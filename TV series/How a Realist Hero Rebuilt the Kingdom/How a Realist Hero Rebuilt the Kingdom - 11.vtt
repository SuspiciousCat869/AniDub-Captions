WEBVTT

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.144
[CASTOR] How did you
find your way in here?

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.271
I think one should store
all kinds of documents

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:23.857
in a library for
moments like these.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.400
In other words,
you found the blueprints

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.152
for Red Dragon City.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.612
So I take it you know
about the underground

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:31.615
escape routes and
all its other secrets.

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:33.951
This is the first occasion
we've met face‐to‐face,

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.911
isn't it, King Souma?

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.038
Duke Castor Vargas.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.832
And I am Acting King
Souma Kazuya.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.376
You may call me Tolman,
a servant

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.919
of the House of Vargas, Sire.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:47.130
On that note, he had
nothing to do with all this.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.882
If somehow, I am defeated here,

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.009
you may trust the
Air Force to him.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.095
The man will serve honorably.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.389
If you're going to be
this gracious about it,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.683
why don't you just
lay down your sword?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.811
[CASTOR] Can a man back
down when his mind's set?

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.355
And know, I don't intend
to go down easily.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.650
My king, I'll handle this.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.455
And you're supposed
to be a hero?

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.415
Care to face me one‐on‐one?

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:46.833
You can't be serious.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.877
No bureaucrat who stays
locked away in a castle

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.171
could measure up
to her in combat.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.382
[AISHA] Castor, just how long
do you plan on aiming

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.925
your sword at King Souma?

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.511
Careful! You'll get hurt!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.721
I didn't want to reveal this
in front of His Majesty,

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.556
but I've been alive
for several decades.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.725
Ha! And I've been fighting
on behalf of this kingdom

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:04.851
for a century!

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.239
Not too shabby for
a dark elf woman!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.408
Name's Aisha, and I won't
let you lay a finger

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.701
on His Majesty!

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.332
Quite the brute
strength you possess.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.626
True. While I may
not be graceful,

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.379
if my strength can be used in
supporting His Majesty's reign,

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:35.048
then being described as a
brute is good enough for me.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.675
[CASTOR]
Such fierce loyalty.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.344
You really find Souma to be
that good of a master?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.054
While I'm not sure,
what I do know is

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.181
that I wish to
remain by his side.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.351
To stay with His Majesty
and the princess forever!

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.187
You're similar to me
and Carla as well.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.857
Still! If your loyalty
overshadows your skills

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.484
with a sword, you will fall!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.111
You and your master!

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:57.237
[yells]

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.369
Ice Sword Mountain!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.579
Freeze right there!

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.294
[AISHA yells]

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.839
[CASTOR grunts]

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.804
The last thing I expected
was for the princess

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.639
to be hiding inside that doll.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.934
You've defeated me.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:28.977
Indeed.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.107
Please don't make that face.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.444
I fought true, despite
my pride, you won.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.613
There is nothing to regret.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.781
That aside,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.950
there is a question I've been
meaning to ask you, Princess.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.202
[LISCIA]
What is it?

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:49.080
Souma, is he the ruler
our country deserves?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.956
He is.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.250
In my eyes,
he's earned the title.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.711
Some might call my
stance self‐indulgent,

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.380
but there's no one
more fit to be king.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.382
And if one day, my father
suddenly demanded

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.759
the throne back,

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:05.597
I would stand by Souma's side
and fight to protect his reign!

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.265
You'd be willing
to go that far?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.601
[explosion]

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.645
[SOUMA]
The battleship exploded.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.064
Which means the Air Force
should be returning soon.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.527
[CASTOR]
So it's to be a slave collar?

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:22.072
The name of the master it's
been set to is Souma Kazuya.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.616
If you attempt to harm
its master, then...

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.160
It'll automatically tighten,
and my head will roll

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.870
free from my neck.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.413
Yes, I understand.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.096
Father! You'll pay for this!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.056
Carla, enough!

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.433
Can't you see we're beaten?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.185
Your insurrection's squashed!

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.728
And since a slave collar
has been attached

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.147
to your father's neck,
killing Souma will end up

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.899
taking Duke Vargas's life, too!

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.286
[SOUMA]
Tolman.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.245
[TOLMAN]
Sire?

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.746
Given recent events,

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.958
I hereby grant you temporary
commission of the Air Force,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.459
making you general over it,

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.253
and part of the Forbidden Army.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.380
[TOLMAN]
As you command, my king.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.675
But, if I may, I wish to
ask you one thing first.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.843
[SOUMA]
Proceed.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:28.305
What fate will befall Duke
Vargas and Lady Carla?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.057
We will review their case
once fighting has ceased.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.893
But at the moment,
I will not speak on it.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.357
[TOLMAN]
Your orders, sire?

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.067
As part of the Forbidden Army,

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.445
how would you like the
Air Force to move forward?

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.323
Announce to your people
the outcome of the battle:

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.074
The Vargas Duchy's
been captured.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.160
As for its troops, they are
now under my command

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.912
and answer to my orders.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.831
Assemble your forces, and head
toward the Carmine Duchy.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.832
Yes, sire.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.963
[SOUMA] Sorry to keep you
waiting, Georg Carmine.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.089
See you soon.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.856
I know you have your doubts,

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.442
but Carla here
is extremely loyal.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.818
She's conscientious to the core

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.445
and will do what
is asked of her,

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.197
no matter how much
she might dislike it.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.282
She's a good girl, trust me.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.409
Also, to be forward,
you may not be able to tell

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.912
with all her armor
on, but she's...

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:37.082
There's no need to oversell
your friend's virtues, Liscia.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.167
I know you're begging
for her life.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.835
But are you sure you've
considered the risks

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.420
that come from doing so?

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.092
Carla has committed
the crime of rebellion.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.887
As a concubine, she might be
shielded from prosecution.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.139
But if the king refuses
to uphold the law,

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.225
he will lose the trust
of the people.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.769
But even so,
you can't just‐‐

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.896
Please stop trying to shield me!

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.648
He sent us letters time
and again asking

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.859
for our allegiance, but we
kept rejecting his offer.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.988
I consider myself
a warrior until death.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.948
If my life is forfeit, so be it.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.741
I only wish you could
have taken that spirit

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:15.161
and directed it into something
that didn't hurt Liscia.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.913
[LOOKOUT] Multiple wyverns
approaching from the sky

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.164
to the east!

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.750
It's the Air Force!

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.587
Duke Vargas sent
them reinforcements!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.881
Is this what the ground forces
have been waiting for?

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.140
Looks like everything's
going to be all right, Hal.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.017
Our gamble ended
up paying off, eh?

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.979
[weapons firing]

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.232
I don't know how, but
Souma really delivered!

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.817
As if there was any doubt!

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.195
Enemy bolt throwers
have been silenced!

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.699
Now then, let's begin our aerial
attack on Randel Castle!

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.617
Make absolutely sure
not to drop them

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.327
on the residential sections!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.712
Brought along the air support,
exactly as I promised.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.672
And we outlasted
the army's attack,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.965
all according to the plan.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.051
It was only a day
and a half, though.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.595
Shouldn't have been that hard
for a competent soldier.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:14.554
You dumbass!

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.015
For your information, they were
using cannons against us!

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.516
So it was a little dangerous!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.976
We didn't have it easy, either.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.270
Duke Vargas gave us
a real run for our money.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.856
Whoever he is, that man
certainly does speak

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.524
quite freely with the king.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.485
Yes, well, Halbert has
special permission

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.694
to be chummy.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.362
In other words, he's one of us.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.830
Count Vargas and the Air
Force have betrayed us!

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:43.041
We must come up
with a new strategy!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.834
We're awaiting
your instructions!

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.253
Tell us what we're supposed
to do now, Duke!

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.842
Are you going to say something?

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.303
Give me a damage report
from the bombardment.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.179
Yes, sire.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.099
Some of the roofs and towers
have been completely destroyed.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.518
Fortunately, casualties
were minimal.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.437
However, Souma now
has air superiority.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.563
I see.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.691
In other words, given
the position we are in,

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.777
essentially we have taken
the people of this city

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.695
as our hostages.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:13.613
Yes.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.281
Then there is no other
way of putting it:

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.908
the battle is lost.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.286
But what you're saying
is utter madness!

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.080
The army remains
virtually unscathed,

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.666
and there's ample opportunity
to turn things around!

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.292
If we use the people
as human shields

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.669
and hide in the castle‐‐

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.882
Use people as shields and
hide within the castle?

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.552
I just want to make sure,
did I hear you correctly?

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.554
You should be able to
sacrifice your subjects

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.805
if you desire!

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:42.016
Yes, I suppose that's the
way you lot think, isn't it?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.393
Disgraceful.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.689
[chains clicking]

[NOBLEMAN C]
Wh‐What are you doing?

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.943
[NOBLEMAN E]
I don't deserve this!

[NOBLEMENT chattering]

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.867
It's outrageous to think
I would ever lower myself

00:10:58.908 --> 00:10:59.993
to your level.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.369
Out of my sight.

[LUDWIN]
Your Majesty.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:07.000
As you ordered, we constructed
and defended the fortress.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.543
Mission accomplished.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.170
That was quite the feat.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:13.715
After the fighting is over, you
and your men will be rewarded.

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.341
Assemble your troops, Ludwin.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.676
Prepare to move out.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.803
Sire. We'll make for Randel.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.556
We won't. There will be no
more fighting here today.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.188
With that, I have done
my part and no longer

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.690
have any regrets in
this life, except one.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.154
Now then, Beowulf, if you
would see to mine yourself.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.197
Sire.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.793
Send a messenger to their
Army with our surrender.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.671
Tell them with the exception
of the noblemen's forces,

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.174
our soldiers were only
following my orders.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.301
I will accept full
responsibility.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.262
As for the rest, I leave it in
yours and Glaive's hands.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.680
Understood?

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.015
Sire.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.559
[LOOKOUT] A white flag is
waving over Castle Randel!

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:08.519
[LUDWIN]
Your Majesty.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.230
But how did you know?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.417
This wine was a present
from King Albert.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.919
The day the princess
was to marry,

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.380
I hoped to drink
myself into a stupor.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.423
My only regret is not
being able to see her

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.717
in her wedding dress
on that fateful day,

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.095
but considering how I am giving
her the greatest present

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:45.014
anyone could ever offer,
pain is more tolerable.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.273
I bring word.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.857
King Souma has not
entered Randel,

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.442
but is already leading
the Forbidden Army

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:58.778
away from here and heading west.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.071
As soon as the army
has regrouped,

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.447
he has ordered us to follow.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.785
You're just an old rotten
trunk I need to step over.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.162
I see.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.789
So that's how this plays out!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.582
He has no intention
on netting minnows

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.126
when he's after bigger fish!

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.336
Well! My king! And princess!

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.839
Go right on ahead and step
over this ancient stump,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.257
hand in hand!

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.675
Cheers to you both!

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.135
Glory to the young!

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.845
And to Elfrieden!

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:27.140
Someone explain it to me!

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.558
Just what is going on?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.560
I understand why you
would be confused.

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:37.025
This whole affair was
orchestrated by Duke Carmine.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.735
What do you mean "orchestrated"?

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.403
[SOUMA] From the very
beginning, I never intended

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.322
to go to war against
the Three Dukedoms.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:43.823
Then why did you‐‐?

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:44.991
I know how it looked.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.745
As if Duchess Walter fell in
line after I made my ultimatum,

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.956
but she's been on my side,
for quite a while, actually.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.333
Which is all thanks to Juna.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.002
That's correct.

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.087
The Duchess's granddaughter
acted as a mediator

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.339
between us.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.758
I couldn't be sure how the
other two dukes would act.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.926
So, I requested Walter
keep this fact a secret

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.136
for the time being.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.390
Regarding Duke Carmine,
Liscia told me several stories

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:11.517
about the man and based
on everything I heard,

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.144
if you spoke
heart‐to‐heart with him,

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.812
he was reasonable.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.899
But then he decided to harbor
those corrupt noblemen.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.817
Honestly, that wasn't
part of mine

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.736
and Hakuya's scenario.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.696
No matter how I tried to
understand his reasoning,

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.948
I didn't know what
Carmine's goal was.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.784
Then I met
Halbert's father.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.411
Glaive requested an
audience with me that day.

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.831
All right, let's hear it.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.958
Right. About Duke Carmine,

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.919
he intends to gather
all the corrupt nobles

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.837
who have committed
offenses at Castle Randel

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.798
and stage a rebellion
against your Majesty,

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.216
so that you may stamp them out.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.220
If these connected and wealthy
men remained concealed,

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.888
they would continue
causing you trouble,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.057
but should the Duke take
a confrontational posture

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.726
towards the king,
it would lure them out.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.269
to his side, openly.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.396
Is this a joke?

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.648
Whoever asked him to
do anything of the sort?

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:01.067
Your anger is
quite justified, sire.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.486
but I assure you, this was
Duke Carmine's idea‐‐

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.862
his alone.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.282
When wheat spoils, sire, it also
spoils any surrounding grain.

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.703
The problem with nobility
is the network they share.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.039
Even if you are aware
a nobleman is corrupt,

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.041
should any of their
relations beg for mercy,

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.335
you'll have no choice
but to let matters stand.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:21.087
That is why it is
so necessary for them

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.005
to be looked down upon,
as insurrectionists

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.466
against the state.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.677
Do we have to take
things to that extreme?

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:30.596
Yes. But there is one
other reason, as well.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.473
Let me hear it then.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.392
The property Your Majesty
seized from them

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.144
was just scratching the surface.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.854
It's been confirmed, the
noblemen who have gone

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.440
over to the Carmine Duchy
spent vast amounts

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.525
employing mercenaries from Zem.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.610
Despite your efforts, this
only proves you have not

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.195
stripped them of
all their wealth.

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.907
Dare I say, these noblemen
are far more sinister

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.534
than even Your Majesty is aware.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.911
So is Georg's ultimate goal
to try and get these nobles

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.205
to spend the remainder
of their hidden assets?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.624
Even if he does, it'll just
wind up in Zem's coffers

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.128
as payment for sending
their mercenaries, unless‐‐

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.504
It's ransom money?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:06.757
Indeed. After successfully
capturing the corrupt nobles,

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.135
all the mercenaries hired by
them will be taken prisoner

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.720
as well.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.639
Duke Carmine wanted them to
use up all their dark money,

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:16.309
so the funds would
wind up over in Zem.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.144
When their mercenaries
are held captive,

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.938
he'll recover that money as
payment for their release,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.565
reclaiming the wealth.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.608
Yes.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.528
A man who can
think so far ahead,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.322
and I'm supposed to
go to war with him?

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:30.698
If he's prepared
to go such lengths,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.866
he should work with me!

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.576
Please, Your Highness,
you must understand.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.661
Duke Carmine has entrusted
you with the future

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.996
of this nation.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.457
Why have such faith
in my ability to rule?

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.875
Even though we've never met?

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:41.792
Who knows?

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.753
But someday, when you
are standing face‐to‐face

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.671
with him, you are free
to ask him the answer

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.131
to that question, sire.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.428
Duke Carmine was willing
to risk his own life.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.014
I hesitated to tell anyone
the truth, even Liscia.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.433
He only confessed to me
what was really going on

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.852
shortly before he
delivered his ultimatum.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:00.937
You're saying

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.022
that my father's and
my opposition was...

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.066
I'm sorry.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.276
I could have told Duke Vargas
about this development,

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.112
but if even a word
of it leaked out,

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.656
then Duke Carmine's...

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.741
His entire strategy
would crumble to dust.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:18.496
And yet, he was willing
to risk his very life,

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.456
as well as mine and my father's.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.084
Carla.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:37.056
I won't show that
damn Weist any mercy.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:42.645
[SOLDIER A] Someone has
stepped out onto the wall!

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.447
It can't be. How is
Duchess Walter here?

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.241
She was in Lagoon City
during the conference

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.826
with the other Dukes.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.578
Even in haste, it would
have taken her at least

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.580
three days to travel here.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.248
You don't suppose
she's been in Altomura

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.500
since before the conference?

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.461
She's been in contact
with Souma all along!

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.547
Father, please! This is a trap!

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:10.923
We must retreat at once!

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.675
I suggest minding
that tongue, boy!

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.652
I am the acting king over
the nation of Elfrieden,

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.613
Souma Kazuya.

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:36.198
Having defeated Duke
Vargas of the Air Force

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.034
and Duke Carmine of the army,

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:41.287
I am now in control
of all the armed forces.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.497
This civil war has ended.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:47.043
However, we still cannot
sheathe our swords just yet!

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:51.380
You see, Amidonia's military has
taken advantage of this chaos,

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.883
and chosen to brazenly
invade our territory!

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.722
For generations, they've
taken land they lost to us

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.433
and continuously raised
tensions along our border.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.769
The current Amidonian
prince, Gaius the Eighth,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.228
has been no exception.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.106
He has promoted friction between
myself and the Three Dukedoms,

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.734
and operated from the
shadows for their benefit!

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.195
Will merely driving these
invaders out suffice?

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.572
At a time when mankind
should be united in the fight

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:20.034
against the Demon Lord, can
we excuse such barbarism?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:23.245
Nay! It must be called
out and punished!

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.289
As such, the Elfrieden
Kingdom condemns

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:29.293
the Principality of Amidonia
and hereby declares war!

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.961
Why, you insolent brat!

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.215
You call three generations
of noble conquest barbarism?

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.466
[SOUMA]
I'm sure you're watching.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:39.470
So, Gaius, know that I am
sending my forces westward.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.306
As you may have surmised,
our destination is Van,

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.183
the capital of Amidonia.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.310
While you and your forces
have been dawdling around

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:48.270
Altomura, we have
made preparations

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.106
to burn your city to the ground.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.025
What'd you expect?

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.319
You have raised your
hand against my house.

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:56.696
And now you will suffer.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.866
We must ride back
to Van immediately!

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:16.048
First you defeat Duke Carmine,
and now you proceed

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.175
to declare war on Amidonia.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.511
This isn't something
you can do on a whim.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.096
This plan, when did you form it?

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.771
What's my family thinking?

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:33.399
Princess. I have received
word that Prince Gaius

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.484
departed from
Altomura yesterday.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.031
Forgive me, but I bring news.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.074
It's your father.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.452
Prince Gaius has arrived
on the plains of Van.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.036
I see.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.331
Out with it. Didn't make it
in one piece, did they?

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.374
No.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:56.046
They took Goldoa
Valley. Correct?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.382
Sadly, yes. Most perceptive.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.802
Souma's a master of finance,
infrastructure, and warcraft.

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.555
He deduced exactly what
my idiot father had planned.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:05.639
and cornered him.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.266
Pray tell, what do you mean?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.435
It's simple,
the shortest route to Van

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.521
would be going through
the Ursula Mountain range.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.273
Even if they were
marching double time,

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.734
they'd still pass through the
mountains during the night.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.198
[ENEMY SOLDIERS yell]

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.454
Word is that it
was a hellish night.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.831
Men abandoning their friends,
screaming for help,

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:32.249
clawing through blood and muck.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.463
The way out of the valley
is right up ahead, men!

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.220
[ARCHER] The main force's
vanguard is headed through

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.346
the valley.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.722
Shall we give pursuit?

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.101
There's no need.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.937
We've dutifully carried
out our orders.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.064
Prepare to withdraw.

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:56.524
By the time they
left the valley,

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.068
their army of 30,000
men was cut in half.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.112
After that,

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.656
His Highness
stopped in villages,

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.616
gathering troops and supplies,

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.869
and managed to recover his
forces back up to 25,000.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:10.704
Even if he does take back Van,

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.707
doesn't Father realize he's
turning the people against him?

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.210
He's openly inviting
a rebellion.

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.628
I've more to report.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.798
After replenishing his forces
and arriving in Van,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.467
the plains were already filled
with Elfrieden Kingdom banners.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.353
Van's fallen!

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:35.646
We were too late!
