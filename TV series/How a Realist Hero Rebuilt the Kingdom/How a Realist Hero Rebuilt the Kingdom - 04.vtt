00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.012
[SOUMA] When it comes to how
people view so‐called monsters,

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.889
there's a distinct difference
between this world

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.351
I was summoned to and
the one that I came from.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:21.522
Back in my world, monsters are
not seen as people or animals,

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:25.108
but basically a separate
class of creature.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.985
Things are different here.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.737
They fall into both categories.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.406
Some are seen as people,
some as animals.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.869
To be more specific, humans,
elves, beastmen, and dragonewts

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.247
all exist under the
label of "mankind."

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.460
As for the wildlife, even
though they look like dinosaurs,

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:46.380
giant lizards are seen merely
as common reptiles.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.424
An ant the size of a person
isn't the least bit shocking,

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.053
and man‐eating flora are still
regarded as simply plants.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.847
Incidentally, dragons
are known as Godbeasts,

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.140
and are treated differently.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.435
The reason they're not
called monsters is because

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.896
they are incorporated into
the world's ecosystem.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.276
So gelins, a slime creature
which to me looks like

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.070
something out of a sci‐fi movie,
are treated here

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:12.781
as a common animal with
an important role to play.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.827
So what does qualify
as a monster here?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.872
Mostly creatures that look like
fusions of various animals.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.292
Among their ranks are many
beings that are relatively

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.962
humanlike in form but no
different from a common beast

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.630
in terms of intelligence.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:34.052
Or so I thought when I
started recruiting talent.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.306
Until a mystic wolf girl
responded to the call

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.099
and told me something that
threatened to shake

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.684
this world to its core.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:18.990
See?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.118
Now you don't have to
raise your voice so much.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.911
There's no reason to be shy.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.541
[SOUMA gasps]

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.668
You're absolutely sure?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.503
[TOMOE]
Y‐Yes.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.922
[SOUMA] Have you told
anyone else about this?

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.842
No one. I mean, besides
you and my mother.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.267
[SOUMA]
Remain calm.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.060
Keep breathing normally.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.063
Don't let anyone see
how shaken you are.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.691
Your request has
been duly noted.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.568
While I cannot promise
you anything,

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.777
I'll consider it.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.821
Oh, Marx.

00:03:57.863 --> 00:03:58.905
Sire?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.699
Her talent's truly a unique one.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.075
I'll need some more
time to reflect on

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.785
how to effectively use it.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.163
We'll have a discussion
on it later.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.706
As you wish, your highness.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.584
My capable guests.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.628
For answering my summons,
I am eternally grateful.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.547
I ask you now to lend
us your aid in reviving

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.841
the kingdom. Please.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:18.967
[GROUP]
Yes, sire.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.645
So... I, uh...

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.856
You said you wanted to talk
to me about something

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.858
that was important?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.027
[SOUMA] Back in the chamber,
when she whispered to me,

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.613
is it possible anyone in
the audience heard her?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.281
I know I didn't hear anything.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:44.534
No. She was speaking
far too quietly, sire.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.120
My ears didn't pick up
a single word, either.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.789
Sounds like there was
no danger that it went

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.624
over the Gemstone
Broadcast then.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.042
I don't think we have to worry.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.920
It shouldn't be sensitive
enough to pick up whispering.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.797
Whatever she said
to you must be serious

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.924
if you're this concerned
about it getting out.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.717
Yeah.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.886
So she can converse
with the animals.

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:04.763
You heard that part, right?

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.764
[LISCIA]
Yes.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.557
[MARX] Not only does she
know what they're saying,

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.434
but somehow, they're
able to understand

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.353
what she says in return.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.105
It's no stretch to call
her talent phenomenal.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.944
Yes, even more so because she
can also speak to demons.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.241
[NARRATOR] Up to this point,
it was thought the monsters

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.576
of this world possessed
intelligence equal to that

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.203
of an animal's.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.914
However, among the
Demon Lord Domain's ranks

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:34.292
were those who acted in teams,
using weapons and magic

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.545
and behaving almost as
though they were no different

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.213
than people.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.049
The humans began referring to
these particular beasts

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.344
as "demons" to distinguish
them from the others.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.347
True, these demons were
different from other monsters.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.225
But despite being able to
demonstrate intelligence,

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.853
there was still one crucial
component that separated them

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:56.064
from the other races
and breeds of the land.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.149
Demons could not be understood.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.277
Their language was unlike
any tongue used by

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.820
the rest of the world.

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.196
Unintelligible.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.866
You spoke to a demon?

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.284
But that isn't possible!

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.578
No one can understand
what demons say!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.580
[LUDWIN] Tell us everything
that happened, in detail.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.455
Well...

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.542
The demon I spoke with in
the woods was pretty short.

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.836
And he had a face that
looked pretty much exactly

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.963
like a dog's.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.716
I went into the mountains
to pick wild vegetables,

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.301
that's where I ran into him.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.220
Before I could think,
I yelled out "Help!"

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.891
Then, to my surprise, he said,
"You can understand me?"

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.059
He seemed as shocked as I was.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.395
My guess, he must
have been a scout.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.981
At least, that's what it
looked like he was doing.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.649
He said "We have the same scent.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.610
I couldn't bear
watching you die.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.655
Go on and run away, quickly."
And so that's what I did.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.325
Meaning a demon
actually showed sympathy?

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.202
It's possible this was an
isolated event and only

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.872
a handful of demons would
let a mystic wolf escape.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.667
But even if it's
only a fraction,

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.669
there are demons we
can communicate with,

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.880
which could alter our
situation dramatically.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.340
What do you mean by that?

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.342
Are you saying we can
negotiate with these demons

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.261
and take back the lands
lost in the war?

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.304
[SOUMA sighs]

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.517
It would be nice if things
took a turn in that direction.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.147
But as of this moment,
the nations of mankind

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.815
are joined together,
facing off against

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.401
the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.237
Simply because the demons
are seen as our enemy.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.907
One that is irreconcilably
at odds with us.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.284
As soon as people learn we
have a way of communicating

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.912
with their kind, there's a big
chance one or more nations

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.665
around us will try and forge
an alliance with them.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.500
No, they would never do that.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.086
I'm no expert, but our
worlds have similarities.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.421
There are conflicts between
nations here, aren't there?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.590
Those who would want
to gain the upper hand.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.717
Yes. Just to the west of us,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.012
there resides the
Principality of Amidonia.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.973
Under our previous king,
we had a conflict

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.891
with their country.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.602
In an effort to keep Demon
Lord's Domain from spreading,

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.354
we are all working
hand‐in‐hand with

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.065
the Gran Chaos Empire
leading the way.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.401
However, mankind is
not unified or immune

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.278
from warring with itself.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.446
You're right.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.741
There are those who'd
exploit her power.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.712
But I'm only bringing up
one possible scenario

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.380
since there really is
no telling what would

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.173
ultimately happen.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.259
After all, communicating
with demons was thought

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.844
to be impossible.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.722
The fact that we can is sure
to shake up this world.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.224
We have to be
cautious about this.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.308
Very much so.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.852
We can't afford a word
of this to leak

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.603
and become public knowledge.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:41.688
Exactly.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.068
But most importantly, the
kingdom has to safeguard her

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.112
with all the tools
at its disposal.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.531
You... you mean protect me?

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.699
[SOUMA]
Yeah.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.118
In the grand scheme of things,
you're far more important

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.328
than even I am.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.372
You could shift the tide
of this war and change

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.292
the relationship between
mankind and demons.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.211
No way, me? Surely you're
exaggerating a little.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:13.053
[SOUMA] I'd like a royal
guard to watch over her.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.471
Will you see to it?

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.805
[LUDWIN]
As you wish.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.183
One concern, if we surround
her with knights,

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.268
would that not arise
greater suspicion?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.811
[TOMOE gasps]

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.063
[LUDWIN]
Very true.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.981
One minute she's
a simple peasant girl,

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.524
and the next thing you know,

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.526
she's surrounded by
the royal guard.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.196
People will inevitably
think there's more at play.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.614
Hmm. You're right.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.408
Someone might get suspicious
and start snooping around.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.827
In that case, why not
simply welcome her

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.704
into the castle as royalty?

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.082
Huh? We can do
something like that?

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.709
Of course.
It's not usually difficult.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.503
Your Majesty would
simply adopt her,

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.089
but seeing how you're not yet
wedded to Princess Liscia,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.091
it's not possible right now.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.635
And speaking of the wedding,
preparations would take

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.261
more than a year to complete.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.513
Well, that's that.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.473
I wasn't trying to rush it!

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.599
Anything else?

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.727
[MARX] Your Majesty could take
her as your secondary consort.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.188
A consort? Are you insane?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.898
In this kingdom,
the law states for a child

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.359
to be a princess consort who
is in line for the throne,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.986
her standing must be that
of a knight or better.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.739
But as long as she's
not a princess consort,

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.074
there should be no problem.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.826
[SOUMA]
Yeah, that's not the issue here!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.702
By the way, how old are you?

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.079
I'm ten years old.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.080
Perfect!

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.666
That is well within the
allowable range, Your Majesty,

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.918
and for a political marriage,
not exceptional.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.504
Even so, that's far too young.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.548
[SOUMA] It's not like I need
you to convince me!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.551
And why can't the previous
king and queen adopt her?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:38.346
Umm... Yes, I suppose
that would work.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.098
[LISCIA]
It absolutely will!

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.517
I've always wanted
a little sister.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.769
‐‐[LISCIA squeals]
‐‐Wait a minute!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:48.356
I'm sorry, but I'm not
so sure about this!

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.484
'Cause... I already have
a family of my own!

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.778
My mother and brother
are waiting for me

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.446
back at the refugee camp.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.535
[SOUMA]
It's all right.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.705
You see, Tomoe, it's more of
a formality just to make sure

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.540
you're well protected.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.876
If you become my little sister,
your mother and brother

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.878
will also become my relatives.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.713
They'll be able to live here
in the castle with you.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.384
Oh, well, in that case, I agree.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.431
Marx, allow some time to
pass before the adoption,

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.641
and then we'll make
the announcement.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.519
If we rush into this without
warning, it'll look strange

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.397
and pretty much defeat
the whole purpose.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.482
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.402
In the meantime, I would still
like to keep her safe.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.655
You wish to give Miss Tomoe a
role which would require her

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.741
to stay within
the castle, correct?

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.117
I do.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.243
Let's see.

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:45.079
Then in recognition of her
ability to talk to animals,

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.165
how about putting her
in charge of the horses

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.167
that draw Your
Majesty's carriage?

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.293
[SOUMA]
Great idea.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.544
Let's go with that.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.670
Sound okay to you?

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.631
Oh! Yes!

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.092
[TOMOE chuckles]

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.117
So, what exactly is
going on here?

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.703
Isn't it obvious? I'm sewing.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.788
[LISCIA]
That part I get.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:29.999
But I'm wondering why
you're doing it in my room.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.169
I had some downtime and
needed some place to relax.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.546
Everyone in the state affairs
office is working hard.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.390
Why don't you just have my
father give up his room already

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.100
so you can use it as your own?

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.101
Maybe.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:51.562
Then again, for efficiency's
sake, it's probably better

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.856
for me to sleep in the
office I have to work in

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.233
every day.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.069
There are definitely other
rooms in the castle.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.155
By the way, what has
Tomoe been up to?

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.283
Ever since she got here,
you've been doting on her

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.243
like a big sister.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.662
Lately, my mother has
taken a liking to her.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.747
She won't leave her side.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.417
Sure, Tomoe was a
little hesitant at first,

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.335
but now she's delighted
to have a second mother,

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.920
so I guess everything
worked out fine.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.171
[knocking]

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.715
It's okay. You may enter.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.263
[SERINA giggles]

Yes, and should be waiting
for you in the reception room.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.821
No time to waste, Liscia!

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.200
[LISCIA]
Hey‐‐

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.785
[SERINA chuckles]

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.291
[SOUMA]
Welcome back, Poncho.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.335
So, was the expedition
successful?

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.627
Oh, very.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.755
In large part because you let
me use the royal wyvern

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.256
for traveling.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.508
I was able to hit every one
of my locations faster

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.260
than I expected.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.554
I gathered pretty much every
type of food I was after

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:09.182
without any complications.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.893
Wait, you mean you also
lent him the hero sack?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.311
That's right.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.314
It's far bigger on the inside
than it looks on the outside.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.776
Plus, whatever you store inside
it is less prone to spoilage.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.236
The perfect tool
for gathering food.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.197
You mean the same satchel
that's part of our hero

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:27.658
gear collection, one of the
kingdom's crown treasures?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.995
And you're using it to
haul around a bunch of‐‐

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.580
We'll move past that.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:33.748
What've you got planned anyway,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.834
going through such lengths to
send him out and gather food?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.044
What do I have planned?

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.338
Something that'll do
the kingdom a little good.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.255
I hope.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.423
[LISCIA]
Huh?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.345
I hope that everyone
in the Elfrieden Kingdom

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.263
is having a great day!

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.140
I, um, do as well.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.142
And this is "The King's
Brilliant Lunch,"

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.144
a program meant to provide
information directly

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.022
from Parnam Castle to you,
the people of this nation.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.691
Or we can just shorten it
to "The King's Brillunch."

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.611
I'm your host, Juna Doma,
and with me...

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.988
I'm, uh, Poncho Panacotta,
connoisseur of eating

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.907
and all things food.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.784
We're only addressing
the entire kingdom!

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.619
There's no reason to be nervous.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.037
[PONCHO]
W‐Well, the thing is...

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.498
I'm not used to
presenting to a crowd.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.001
As a born entertainer, I'm sure
this must come natural to you.

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.421
I'm really quite envious,
Miss Juna.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:25.299
It's true, I'm no stranger to
entertaining large audiences.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.260
Speaking of which,
whenever you're in Parnam,

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.678
you might want to visit Lorelei,

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.681
the cute cafÃ© where
I work, and say hello!

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:34.809
I sing there from time to time,
so stop on by if you're around.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.645
If we could refrain from any
blatant endorsements.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:40.481
Now then, to go into the
specifics of the show,

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.526
we'll now give the floor
to this gentleman:

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.696
Um, you know him
as Elfrieden's 14th king.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:49.198
His Majesty, Souma Kazuya.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.534
The truth is, I haven't
actually been crowned yet.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.078
So technically I don't
deserve the title.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.080
Hey. Greetings.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:16:00.460
I'm acting ruler of the
nation, Souma Kazuya.

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.421
And as you're probably aware,
the country is suffering

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.048
from a massive shortage of food.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.800
As the chief administrator,

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.969
it's I who should be
held responsible.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.804
I apologize to you, the people.

[CITIZENS gasp]

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.852
While we're moving
forward with a plan

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.770
to immediately increase
our food production,

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.065
it will take time and I
ask you to be patient.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:26.652
Until it's resolved, we will
keep making regular broadcasts.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.696
Our goal is to
educate and inform.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.407
We'll introduce new foods,
a few of which you may not be

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.368
accustomed to eating,
but are quite plentiful.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.704
As well as the different
ways to prepare them.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.165
And, to prove these
strange items are delicious,

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.250
I've arranged a panel
of blind taste testers

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.710
who have not been
informed beforehand

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:45.087
what sort of dishes are
being served to them today.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.426
Okay, then, let's get
started, shall we?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.137
Poncho, why don't we reveal
the first food you have for us.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.514
Ah. Of course.

You're not gonna serve
that to us, are you?

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.989
A perfectly reasonable reaction
considering its appearance,

but as a coastal dweller who has
eaten these creatures before,

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.202
trust me, they are quite yummy.

these and actually liked it?

Yes!

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.784
I'm not going to lie, that's
starting to smell pretty good.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:02.999
All right, go ahead and try one.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.635
It's delicious, whatever it is!

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.224
Hey, you're right!
This really is yummy!

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.811
Wow, those are pretty tasty.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.314
One serving isn't enough.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.569
Would you mind if I helped
myself to one as well, sire?

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.820
Please, be my guest.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.739
[AISHA]
So good!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.616
[LISCIA]
These are incredible!

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.826
[JUNA] They're so full
of flavor, aren't they?

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.578
When you bite through
the crispy coating,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.581
inside's the octopus,
and it's so juicy!

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.582
Daddy.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.667
We caught a whole bunch of
octopuses in our net today,

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:47.627
didn't we?

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.628
Sure did.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.839
Usually we'd toss 'em all out,
but let's give them a try.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:55.217
Moving right along,
here is our next food item.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.681
I know these.
They're tree roots, right?

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:03.392
They don't look all that
tasty, if you ask me.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.728
Are you sure that we
can even eat them?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.230
You've never had a
burdock root before?

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.733
[SOUMA] It sounds like you're
familiar with these, Aisha.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.735
It's hard for me to
imagine anyone wanting

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.528
to chew on a root.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.322
Well, in the forest you
have to cook and harvest

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.617
whatever nature provides,
otherwise, you won't survive.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.202
I had no idea.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.955
[SOUMA]
A little salt here.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.708
A little sugar there.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.754
All right. It's chow time.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.135
They're crispy, and the
salt lends them a lot of

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.345
extra flavor.

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.473
When I bite into one,
the oil comes off

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.642
and mixes together
with the sugar,

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.228
giving off an explosion of
sweetness that tantalizes

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.896
the taste buds.

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.940
I can't wait until my mother
gets a chance to try

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.233
these snacks!

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.528
[AISHA]
When you eat both kinds at once,

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.822
they're sweet, salty,
and oh so good!

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.366
Your Majesty, do you have
any more of these?

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.492
From what I've seen,

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.953
Aisha sure seems to be
content, huh, Brother?

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.621
Yes. It appears so.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.373
You'll understand why
I cooked the next meal

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.250
ahead of time after you see it.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.379
[AISHA, LISCIA gasp]

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.717
You do not expect us
to eat insects.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.552
Funny, I could've sworn
you were just telling us

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:22.138
how you had to eat everything
in the forest to survive.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.890
And for some reason you
assumed that extended to bugs?

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.101
You would have to be
mad to eat these.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.437
[TOMOE munching]

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.564
That hit the spot.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.232
It's almost like
being back home.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.276
Can't beat bean‐boiled locusts!

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.444
Bean‐boiled?

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.320
So did you use some
kind of extract?

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:39.321
Precisely.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.407
I primarily seasoned them
using a combination

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.492
of both mashwater and sugar.

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:45.244
[SOUMA]
Never heard of it.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.246
[PONCHO]
Mashwater is a condiment.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.790
I find that mystic wolves
greatly enjoy the flavor.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.087
More specifically, it's referred
to as bean mashwater,

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:58.382
which is made from salting
beans to ferment them.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.593
They continue skimming
layers of liquid that forms

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:03.429
during the process,
and after fermenting it,

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.139
you end up with mashwater.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.224
Both of them are
extremely unique flavors

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.518
not typically known or
available in the kingdom.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.519
Truly.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:13.564
[SOUMA] In other words,
the bean product is miso

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.274
and the mashwater is soy sauce.

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:20.029
Souma. You're really
going to eat that?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.709
[LISCIA]
Uh... Wait... Are you crying?

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:36.086
I can't stop myself
from tearing up...

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.630
This is...

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.590
Yep, a flavor from my homeland.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.176
Insects are a dish
in your world?

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.678
With every bite, the flavor
of Japan spreads

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.971
throughout my mouth.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:51.519
Not only does this world have
soy sauce, but miso, too.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.479
I no longer have to
dream about the flavors

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.689
I loved so much
being only a memory.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:57.900
[SOUMA whimpers]

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.027
Pardon, Your Majesty.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.988
I don't mean to interrupt,
especially when you're so moved,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.741
but would it be all right if we
continued to the next dish?

00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:06.826
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.788
Oh. Yeah. My apologies.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.498
On with the show, as they say.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.874
We can't wait, Poncho.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.376
What do you have for us next?

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:19.046
Ah, yes! I think this one
will surprise you!

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:20.798
