00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:13.514
[SOUMA] This world is one
of magic and inhabited by

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.265
unusual creatures.

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:17.059
If you feel like flying,
you can always

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.685
hop on a wyvern's back.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.981
Large, domesticated beasts
pull the wagons.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:26.485
And mighty sea dragons provide
the power for steel battleships.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.072
There are no lightbulbs,
but the streets

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.074
are illuminated at
night by lamps filled

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.784
with glowing moss.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.661
Cooking is done using
fire‐based magic

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.163
on wood‐burning ovens.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.624
Even though there's
no hard science here,

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.125
day‐to‐day jobs are
accomplished through

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.503
the power of magic.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.797
However, once you strip
away the mystical

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.091
and fantastical elements,

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.594
it's a country with a
rudimentary level of technology.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.556
The industrial revolution
is years off,

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.976
and the feudal system
is still in full swing.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.561
Now, I'm a part of it.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.855
The king of this country.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.075
A magic check?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.577
Yes, sire. After consorting
various tomes regarding

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.080
the ritual, there appear
to be instances of heroes

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.666
being imparted with magical
abilities after they've been

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.876
transported from other worlds.

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.671
Got it. So basically, it's like
a test to see if I have

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.589
any newfound abilities
which may end up

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.840
proving useful.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.762
All I have to do is
touch this statue?

00:02:58.804 --> 00:02:59.721
Yes.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.306
If any magic was
transferred to you during

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.266
the summoning, its nature
will become apparent

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.852
to you once you make
contact with the stone.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.229
I don't know who
came up with this,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.647
but I love how
straightforward it is.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.008
How did it go, my king?

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.178
I never thought I'd
say these words,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.597
but apparently I'm
a magic wielder now.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.640
[CHIEF PRIEST]
Ah.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.102
The question is what sorta
practical applications

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.603
does this power have?

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.448
[LISCIA]
Souma? I'm coming in.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:01.658
[LISCIA gasps]

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.751
[LISCIA]
What is going on?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.337
[SOUMA]
Liscia. Good. You're here.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.050
[LISCIA]
Looks like everything's handled.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.803
You're using magic to
move those pens, right?

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.097
Turns out I've found
a good use for it.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.932
Since I'm able to copy
my consciousness

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.143
onto inanimate objects
and control them,

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:29.644
I figured I might as
well get some extra

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.438
work done around here.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.356
[SOUMA]
Uh‐‐ What I mean is...

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.776
I'm not actually moving
the pens, per se.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.652
They're an extension
of my mind but writing

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.321
on their own.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.114
Since I came up with
the technique,

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.616
it's only fitting I name it.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.327
I call this
Living Poltergeists.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.705
[chuckles] A bit chunibyo
of me, huh?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.540
I don't know what a
chuni‐whatever is,

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.793
but that is one weird ability.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.877
I guess.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.545
Moving three objects is
the most I can manage

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.214
at this point.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.007
And it seems like they
have to be close to me

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.343
in order to work.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.136
Very handy, though.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.305
It's like copying myself
and being able to work

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.141
on multiple tasks
simultaneously.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.184
In short...

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.438
Well, go on.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.066
Super‐convenient for
doing paperwork.

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.445
So, yeah, my newfound
power's making

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.239
certain tasks easier.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.824
Without it, you'd probably
find me buried

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.118
underneath a mountain
of paper in here. Heh...

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.161
[LISCIA sighs]

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.332
Even with your extra
help, it looks like

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.544
you're barely avoiding a
bureaucratic avalanche.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.921
Just what sort of work
are you doing, by the way?

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:40.131
Let's say we're digging
for buried treasure.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.716
Buried treasure?

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.343
[SOUMA] More precisely,
we're tracking down

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.595
unaccounted‐for expenditures.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.889
We take the budgetary
requests then look at

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.474
the financial statements.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.393
Even though the amount
requested and spent

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.228
may seem to be a perfect match,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.147
the itemized expenses will
sometimes be different.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.816
That can indicate two things:

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.485
first, wasteful spending in
order to use up the budget.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.445
Or two, misappropriation
of funds disguised

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.822
as an investment.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.574
We are pouring over
every request form

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.534
the kingdom has received
and keeping an eye out

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.786
for any glaring discrepancies.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.413
If any embezzlement
is discovered,

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.707
the guilty party will pay
the amount back,

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.083
and if they refuse,
they'll be arrested

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.418
and their
property seized.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.338
Is it necessary to go
to such lengths?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.465
After all, you solved
our financial woes

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.136
by selling the national
treasures and paying the empire.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.221
Sure. For now.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.598
At least I don't have
to worry about being

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.808
turned over to the
empire anymore.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.936
Still, if we want this country
to get back on track,

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.230
we can never have
enough capital.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.732
Same goes for manpower.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.569
[ALBERT]
Hmm.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.738
I can't help but wonder
if Souma and Liscia

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.656
are getting along.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.325
[ELISHA]
Knowing the two of them,

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.911
I'm sure they're
doing just fine.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.078
You think so, dear?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.706
Yes, you're right.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.471
What time do you have?

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.306
Uh, it's morning already.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.391
Wha‐‐ Morning?

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.142
How long have you
been standing there?

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.186
Not very long.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.105
Maybe less than a minute.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.481
[LISCIA]
Wh‐What were you‐‐

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:02.649
You looked comfortable.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.567
Just wanted to make
sure you slept well.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.655
Anyway, the paperwork's
all wrapped up,

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.782
if you wanted to nap
a little while longer.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.328
I'm rested.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.372
Don't tell me you never stopped.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.500
By the looks of it, you've
haven't slept in ages.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.503
I was planning on catching
a few winks later,

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.631
but in the meantime,
would you care to join me?

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.425
This minute?

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.718
Yeah.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.011
If you don't mind,

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.470
I have something
I want to show you.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.484
[LISCIA]
Easy!

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.653
It's not like you have to
hold onto my waist so tight.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.322
Sorry, but this is
pretty scary for me.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.866
Some hero you are.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.451
Traditionally, the man
should be up front

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.286
holding the horse's reins.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.704
I can't help it.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.248
This is my first time
riding on a horse.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.541
You're joking.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.377
We get around other ways
back where I come from.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.921
We travel using machines
and don't rely on animals.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.926
Sounds like quite the place.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.511
Souma, tell me something.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.721
[SOUMA]
Hm? What is it?

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.181
[LISCIA] The place
you're originally from,

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.225
do you have family there
waiting for you to return?

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.269
Or, you know. Friends.
Girlfriends.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.480
Anything like that.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.522
There's no one.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.399
My grandpa was the
last of my relatives,

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.860
and he passed away
before I came here.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.528
Sorry to ask.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.530
[SOUMA]
No reason to apologize.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.908
My grandfather
lived a full life.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.703
Basically, there's no one
waiting for me to return.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.956
I guess I'm in no hurry to
go back right away, either.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.000
Uh‐huh. I see.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.513
You can stop here.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.071
Pretty how the morning
dew makes it glisten.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.697
You think so?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.574
I mean, the whole reason
you brought me out here

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.160
was so we could
look at it, right?

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.745
In a way.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.081
You can't eat scenery,
though, and that's why

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.083
we're experiencing
a food shortage.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.709
[LISCIA]
Eating scenery?

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.670
What are you getting at?

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.005
[SOUMA]
It's pretty simple.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.298
As far as the eye can see,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.467
there're nothing
but cotton fields.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:39.055
[LISCIA] Ah. And they can't be
harvested for consumption.

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:40.849
[SOUMA]
Getting right to the point.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.184
The reason this country
has a food shortage

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.603
is because there are
too many of these fields.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:46.771
[LISCIA]
Meaning?

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.860
[SOUMA] It started with
the Demon Lord's Domain.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.653
The countries north of
here used to produce

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.947
a lot more cotton,
but damage caused by

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.576
the monster attacks
forced production to cease.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.203
Speaking of, in this world,

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.622
the further north you travel,
the warmer it gets.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.708
Does it work differently
where you come from?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:09.335
[SOUMA] Actually, the
weather's the opposite.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.671
Anyway, that's beside the point.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.631
Supplies dropped,
and the purchase price

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.508
of cotton shot up,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.927
leading this country
to change course.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.679
At the time, you wanted
to produce and sell

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.639
as much cotton as possible.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.059
And in turn, the farmers
stopped growing food.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:28.396
A crop you can't eat and
is grown solely for market

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.524
is commonly referred
to as a cash crop.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:32.817
There's a drawback
when you devote

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.029
your entire agricultural
system to growing them.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.949
It leads to a sharp decline
in food self‐sufficiency.

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.619
Which explains the
current food shortage.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.578
Sort of.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.413
You can always import
crops from other countries

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.082
if supplies aren't adequate.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.125
You're right.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.461
Not to mention, cotton
sells for a higher price.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.171
We could use the
money to purchase food

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.464
from elsewhere.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.633
[SOUMA]
Yes. Just one problem.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.844
Cotton prices have
considerably fallen.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.721
There was profit to be made.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.348
So other countries
realized this and rushed

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.807
to produce cotton.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.060
As a result, the global
supply far exceeded

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.020
the demand.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.898
And now, the cash crop
this kingdom had been

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.651
relying heavily on is
practically worthless.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.903
[LISCIA] Meaning less funds to
import fruits and vegetables

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.488
from other countries.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.448
And since we're importing
less these days,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.242
the cost of domestically
grown foods

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.285
have continued skyrocketing.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.037
The most vulnerable
classes are the people

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.622
who've suffered the most.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.958
Just one of the numerous
hardships that's undermining

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.292
this country's progress.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.756
I had no idea.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.093
[I was ignorant of
my country's suffering.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.302
It's people.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.805
As a royal,
I'm an utter failure.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.223
Don't talk like that.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.434
Hey. Nobody said that leading
a kingdom would be easy.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.563
Wait, "leading'?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.108
Then the reason you brought
me out here was because...

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.484
Yeah.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.696
Someday, Liscia, you'll
be the ruler of Elfrieden.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.909
What I want, most of all,
is to leave you

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.954
with every tool you'll
need to succeed.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.914
So after I've gone back home,

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.208
you'll be able to manage
all facets of this country.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.940
The first step is to limit the
acreage for cash crops

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.400
and start planting food again,

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:38.943
so we end the shortage
and no longer have to be

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.945
as dependent on other countries.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.739
The kingdom will provide
farmer subsidies

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.782
to support the changeover.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.785
Also, we need to prioritize
planting soybeans and potatoes.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.620
They have a variety of
uses and also can survive

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.788
harsh weather.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:53.958
Liscia, you listening?

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.919
Mm‐hmm.
I was paying attention.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.256
It's not like agricultural
reforms just happen overnight.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.675
For the time being, no matter
whether all the food

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.927
was imported or
domestically produced,

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.180
the kingdom will purchase it,
and sell the goods

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.182
for less than we
bought them for.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.476
Sounds like that's going to
leave us in even more debt.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:16.064
Uh‐huh. And I'd like us to make
up the deficit with our exports.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.901
But given the current
market value,

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.029
we will need to find a new
cash cow that isn't cotton.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.239
Easier said than done.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:28.743
I'm going off topic for
a second here. But...

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.453
...the king isn't exactly
supposed to be eating

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.913
in the mess hall.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.415
Don't worry about it.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.959
We're busy
economizing the castle.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.295
We have to conserve
meal expenses.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.797
Yeah, but still.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.841
[LUDWIN]
It's been some time, Princess.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.302
Or rather, should I refer
to you as Queen Liscia

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.721
‐‐from now on?
‐‐Nothing's official!

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.598
Not yet at least.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.934
Souma, this is Sir Ludwin Arcs.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.228
He's the captain
of the Royal Guard.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:56.354
[LUDWIN chuckles]

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.022
It's Souma Kazuya.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:01.401
I'm sort of the country's
acting king at the moment.

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:03.361
You've made quite
the impression.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.905
Only recently taken over and
already your job performance

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.782
is the talk of the staff.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.076
Next time you see them,
pass along a message:

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.912
if they have time to chit‐chat,
they should be working harder.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.415
[LUDWIN chuckles]
Understood, sire.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.959
If I'm not intruding, may
I join you for breakfast?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.168
[SOUMA]
Fine by me.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.590
[LUDWIN] As long as I'm here,
might I ask you a question?

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.218
I'll try and do my
best to answer it.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.221
I hear you're attempting to
carry out many reforms.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.098
They proceeding smoothly?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.559
The opposite of smooth,
to be honest.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.061
Human resources are
a bit problematic.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.439
None of the officials
are of any use.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.107
Other than Prime Minister Marx.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.817
[sneezes]

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.777
Besides the crown,
I also received the king's

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.028
senior advisors.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.531
To be perfectly blunt,
these are the same officials

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:50.950
who let the kingdom
nearly fall into ruin.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.869
[LUDWIN]
My ears are burning.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.495
[LISCIA]
Now, hold on, Souma.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.330
Where are the people
who can tell me the truth,

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.040
give me straight answers,
and agree to complete

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.586
whatever tasks I assign them?

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.504
Those are the sort
of retainers I need.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.676
[LISCIA] You want to use
the Gemstone Broadcast

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:09.927
to recruit people?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:12.930
Yeah.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.849
If I have this right, the
Gemstone Broadcast

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.559
can reach across
the entire kingdom?

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:18.853
[LISCIA]
Uh... Yes.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.397
As long as the reception
environment's setup correctly,

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.274
whatever is said in the
castle's Gemstone Room

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.734
will be heard across the nation,

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.986
no matter how far away
someone is from us.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:30.615
Then it's perfect for letting
everyone know our situation.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.617
Ordinarily, it's only
used for the king's

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.410
New Year's greetings
or to issue important

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.787
proclamations and like orders.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.665
This will be the first time it's
used for job recruitment.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.293
How does hiring around
here usually work?

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.086
Well, let's see.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.130
We look at all personal
connections or hold

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.216
a written exam and
recruit those who manage

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:49.675
to pass successfully.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.136
That sounds pretty biased,
don't you think?

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:55.306
Also, what's the country's
literacy rate currently?

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.058
Half the population can read.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.685
If I had to guess,
about 30% can write.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.687
What?! That's a terrible figure!

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.397
You can't decide if
someone's right for the job

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.358
using just two criteria!

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.485
Especially when you're
excluding 70% percent

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.820
of applicants before
they can even interview!

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.572
How many diamonds
in the rough could be

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.823
left undiscovered?

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.492
I don't know how to answer that.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.626
No worries. Once the financial
situation stabilizes,

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:27.421
we can solve other
issues as time permits.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.550
But first up, we have to start
recruiting capable people.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.135
And how are you going
to encourage them

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.762
to step forward?

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.515
I've been mulling over
what I plan to say.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.100
But I'm just going to
end up paraphrasing

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.602
a hero I respect,
since they said it best.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.271
Another hero?

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.313
That's right.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.524
An unscrupulous hero
of chaotic times.

[NARRATOR]
During the late Han Dynasty,

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.571
Tsao Tsao, the man
responsible for laying

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.657
the foundation for Wei during
the Three Kingdoms period,

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.742

gathering men of ability

In the year 210, to meet
the demand for talent,

he issued his famous
"Order of Seeking Talents."

This country is facing a crisis.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:27.440
Between the chronic food
shortages, the depression,

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.859
and an influx of refugees
whose lands have fallen

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.902
to the Demon Lord's Domain,

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.031
the Kingdom of Elfrieden is
facing several afflictions.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.533
Additionally, our neighboring
countries are watching us

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.620
with eager eyes and are
more than ready to pounce!

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.997
Realizing the severity
of the situation,

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.833
your former king determined
he was not up to the task,

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.377
and entrusted me to
handle these affairs.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.588
True, if we were living
during a time of peace,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.133
there is no doubt he would have
made an effective leader.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.470
However, we live in
an age of upheaval.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.097
During strife, you need
a king who is tenacious.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.849
Someone who acts
less like a saint

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.392
and more like a survivor.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.895
To the point, a ruler who's
able to keep your families

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.022
and property safe from
harm befalling them,

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.191
domestic or foreign.

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:13.361
That is why your former king
chose me to succeed him!

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:16.113
I would never speak ill
of your previous ruler,

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.741
but in terms of resolve,
I have the clear advantage.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:25.414
Presently, I'm spearheading
a number of reforms.

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:28.125
However, we are
overwhelmingly shorthanded

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.835
for the tasks ahead.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:31.337
That's why I'm here.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.339
To recruit anyone with
a talent that will aid

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.674
the kingdom.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.930
What we require during
these troubling times

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.557
are not those who excel
in peacetime matters,

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.727
but individuals who can
revolutionize this country.

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:49.438
As for the talent,
it can take many forms.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.399
If you can claim with
confidence you are the best

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.277
at what you do, come
and stand before me!

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.405
It doesn't matter
your education or age,

00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:01.325
your social status, place of
origin, ethnicity, or gender.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.202
You can't read or write?
No problem.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.037
I don't care about
your connections.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.288
How attractive you are.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.542
Or the number of
skeletons in your closet.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.669
As long as you can say
confidently you're the best

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.379
at what you do and
there's no one else

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.214
in the country who
even comes close!

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.800
If you believe that with
all your heart, I say:

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.302
Come forward and
present yourself!

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.179
I know some out
there are hesitant,

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.973
wondering if their talent
will be of any use

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.474
to the kingdom.

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:28.018
However, that is ultimately
for your king to decide,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.186
not you.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.896
The determination whether
or not this country

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:35.276
needs your specific expertise
begins and ends with me.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:39.280
I don't care if others have
labeled your talent worthless.

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.531
What're you waiting for?

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:46.620
If your ability is determined
to be an asset

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.205
to this country's future,

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.458
I will afford you every
courtesy and look to you

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.876
as my newest advisor.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:59.300
But perhaps there are some
out there who are still unsure.

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.218
Come demonstrate a talent
that is unmatched

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.180
by any other in the kingdom,
and as King of Elfrieden,

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.224
I will issue you a Certificate
of Peerlessness‐‐

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.310
and a monetary reward!

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.353
[CITIZENS gasp]

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.773
Would that provide you
with some incentive?

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.483
If so, let me hear you!

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:18.027
[CITIZENS cheer]

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.118
[SOUMA] You may recommend
yourself or someone else.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.703
If the candidate's
another person,

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.498
you will receive 30%
of the reward.

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.416
During these trying times,
it'll be up to you

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.335
to bring forth those who
otherwise would not

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.586
step forward!

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.215
Also, if your talent is
being the strongest one

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.382
in the room,

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.259
the best singer
or something similar,

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.595
candidates will compete with
each other ahead of time,

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.223
and the top delegate in each
category will be selected,

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.308
so do bear that in mind.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.393
Those of you who
possess an aptitude...

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:55.815
I'll see you at Parnam,
so we may shake hands!

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:58.901
[CITIZENS cheer]

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.242
[LISCIA]
What was that bit at the end?

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:07.535
[SOUMA]
You thought it was too much?

00:22:07.576 --> 00:22:08.702
Just a touch.

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:16.836
[SOUMA]
I hope it worked.

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:18.420
We'll need all the
help we can get.

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:34.937
You're sure there's nothing
that will change your mind?

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.355
It's made up, Father.
