The capital has fallen.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.476
Father, fear not.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.977
Look up there, at the flags.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.026
Ah! So, they haven't
seized control just yet.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:27.778
Drive the enemy troops away!

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.279
We must get back to the castle!

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.074
[ENEMY SOLDIERS yell]

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:41.291
I bring word, my king.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.585
The Amidonian force
is advancing.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.337
They're planning
to attack all at once.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.297
A frontal assault‐‐
it's about time.

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:59.476
They waved the banner two times!

General Glaive
on the left flank!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.360
Princess Liscia
on the right flank!

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.028
Let us meet the enemy!

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.324
[SOLDIERS cheering]

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.351
We'll never back down!

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.437
Show these cowards how fearsome
Amidonian soldiers are!

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.440
Strike with the rage of a
country that's been invaded!

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.317
[yelling]

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.988
[yelling]

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.829
I won't let you lay a finger
on the princess!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.455
I'm Liscia Elfrieden.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.208
If you want to claim the head
of the daughter of Albert,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.001
then come and take it
if you have the nerve,

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.128
you cowards!

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.337
Your Highness.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:41.096
Your mind doesn't seem
to be on the battle.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.723
[SOUMA] Isn't this what's
required of a figurehead

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:43.598
general?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.017
His place is at basecamp, with
too much time on his hands.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.395
No one expects you
to take up a sword.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.230
Let others fight for you, right?

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.482
Then the king's work
comes afterwards.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.860
Beyond that, let's see.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.946
I suppose in the event things
don't go as planned,

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.365
I'll stick my neck out to
plead for my men's lives.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.369
Are you telling me
you're not afraid to die?

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.662
What? Of course not.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.081
It's not as if I have some
kind of death wish.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.833
But you just said
if it came down to it,

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.376
you would sacrifice
yourself for the lives

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.920
of your soldiers?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.423
Oh. I guess I did.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.841
That's kinda odd.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.638
Are you feeling ill?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.349
Carla, there's a chance
that I'm a charlatan.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.853
Unless I become a full king,

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:33.148
I can't send soldiers
onto the battlefield.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.441
[SOUMA]
Without even realizing it,

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:36.234
at some point I began
conducting myself

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.445
as the official ruler
of the nation.

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:39.613
I'm creating policy now

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.573
by looking at the number
of lives I can save,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.700
then subtracting
the number we'd lose,

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.577
and selecting a course of
action that doesn't result

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.912
in a negative.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.955
What are you talking about?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.374
I'm behaving like a coward.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.169
Deep down, I'm afraid of
seeing myself and others

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.630
get hurt and die.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.757
But in order to enter into war,

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.759
I have no choice but
to fully become the king

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.302
over this institution.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.266
Julius.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.143
What is it, Father?

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.187
Remove yourself
from the battlefield.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.648
Huh? But you can't be serious!

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.067
Now, when the fighting
has only just begun?

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.528
The battle's already lost.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.987
I don't know what
I was thinking

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.157
sending exhausted soldiers
into this death trap.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.742
I will buy us extra
time while you find

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.911
some means of escaping.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.663
At least get yourself to safety.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.248
You can't mean that!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.167
The ruler of Amidonia should
be the one to survive!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.546
‐‐I'll buy you time!
‐‐I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.465
Elfrieden will not cease
until they have my head.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.845
[SOUMA] If only I can defeat
him, then the hardliners

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.639
within the Principality
of Amidonia will cave.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.766
In regards to protecting
the Elfrieden Kingdom,

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.643
it's our best shot.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:52.644
Then it's true.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.312
the only reason
Souma is doing this

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.106
is that he wants you dead.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.983
Even if I were a
coward and withdrew,

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.401
they would pursue me
to the ends of hell

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.444
before letting me go.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.114
Take some troops and
get yourself out of here.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.282
I was wrong.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.658
Compared to the bumbling Albert,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.369
this new ruler far outclasses
his predecessor.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.830
Please! Allow me to
ride beside you, Father!

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.374
Silence, boy!
I gave you a royal decree!

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.168
What will become of our family
if you are lost, too?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.087
But there's still Roroa!

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.299
The future of our family
has never concerned her.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.217
The soul of Amidonia
lives on with you

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.887
and must not be snuffed
out here today!

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.221
Father, you can't.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.726
Please forgive me!

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.107
Now to show them what
Amidonian pride looks like!

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.233
Ha!

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:45.530
Our only objective is claiming
the head of King Souma!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.365
[MESSENGER A]
It's the main Amidonian force,

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.700
they appear to have fallen back,

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.536
except for Prince Gaius and
an escort of 500 elite knights,

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.289
sire! They are charging here,
toward the main camp!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.587
Your collar, I'll re‐imprint it.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.047
It'll answer to Liscia.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.050
If anything should happen
to me out there,

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.468
and I fall during battle,

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.720
I will need you to tell Liscia
that I yield the throne

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.263
to her.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.140
Is that your last will
or something?

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.353
If you think there's any way I'm
going to carry out that request,

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.896
you've gone mad!

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.607
Make life easier; order me
to strike him down!

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.568
It's not for your sake!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.863
Liscia is my friend and I don't
want to see her getting hurt.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.658
So, give me the order already,
and let's finish this!

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.203
Kill him.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.371
At once!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.673
That is far enough,
Prince Gaius!

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.425
I won't allow you to come
any closer to His Majesty!

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.477
It has been done.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:01.356
Highness, may your
wish be fulfilled.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.692
That's not him. It's a decoy!

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.402
Stand aside, you peons!

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.487
I will cut down anyone
who comes between me

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.863
and my objective!

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.120
I don't know why you show
this king such loyalty,

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.579
nor do I care!

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.836
I will achieve the desire three
generations strove for!

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.212
And no one will stop me,

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.339
especially not some
dragonewt wench!

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.341
Before I spill Souma's blood,

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:31.344
I'll gladly paint the
ground with yours!

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.517
You didn't really think
Gaius the Eighth

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.227
would be defeated
by a mere puppet?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:41.771
[SOUMA]
Carla!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.985
Finally, I meet the
source of my strife.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.030
Yeah. I'm Souma Kazuya.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.531
And you're Gaius Amidonia,

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.034
the man who tried to
illegally seize our land!

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.076
Silence!

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.787
That land originally
belonged to our country!

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.582
How is it illegal to tread
on one's own land?

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.085
Get off me!

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.004
Carla, now! Do it!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.297
Better stand clear!

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.268
[SOUMA]
Carla! Are you all right?

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.937
I thought I told you
to stay back!

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.523
If something happened to you,
Liscia would never forgive me!

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:38.495
Souma Kazuya,
until I claim your head,

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.538
I will never admit defeat!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.749
Your kingdom,
I will take it down

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.085
and make the people submit,
and demonstrate

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.587
the backbone of
the great Amidonia.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.219
I have had my taste
of Elfrieden hospitality!

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:59.557
Here is Amidonia's gift,
to show my gratitude!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.320
I have seen Amidonian pride!

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.655
All of you have!

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.657
We've witnessed the valor
of Gaius the Eighth,

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.700
of the Principality of Amidonia.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.953
He will be spoken of
for years to come!

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.214
I see, so my father
was defeated?

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.138
Listen, Sebastian,

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.390
could you let me have
the room to myself?

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.641
Just for a little while?

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.567
You really were a dumb
old man, right to the end.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.421
This place is utterly gorgeous.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.131
They must have spent
even more on decorating

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.425
than we did at Parnam Castle.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.969
If they had that much money,
there were plenty of other areas

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.180
where it could have been
better invested.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.222
I mean, the layout
of the streets

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.057
is needlessly complicated.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.642
It's literally a maze
down there.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.728
Actually, they were made
exceptionally complex

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.771
on purpose,
so arrows and cannons

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.732
wouldn't have clear shots.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.067
It's every bit the
military state, huh?

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.695
So, you've been planning
this takeover of Amidonia

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.072
for quite some time,
haven't you?

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.782
Tell me the truth, Souma.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.534
The reason why
I didn't tell you was‐‐

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.453
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not blaming you.

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.205
I'm just shocked how
few deaths there were

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.456
near the border.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.957
Especially when there
were few at the center

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.043
of the kingdom who
knew about the plan.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.629
That was all thanks to Hakuya.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.340
When I proposed evacuating the
villagers near our boundary,

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.634
he vetoed it immediately.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.510
He figured it would tip
the principality off,

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.223
and let them know we were
aware of their movements.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.975
Do you remember when
monsters suddenly appeared

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.352
near the frontier?

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.775
[FEBRAL]
They're called flame pierrots.

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.902
The quest is to protect
refugees in the village

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.987
from these mysterious monsters,

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.531
but such a hefty reward
for a simple task.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.824
You don't think perhaps
there's more here

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:22.951
than meets the eye?

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.285
Not to mention,
even though these things

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.578
are supposed to be dangerous,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.664
the forest has been
oddly quiet all night.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.959
Juno, go on ahead and
see what you can find.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.344
[JUNO] Those are soldiers from
the Principality of Amidonia.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.804
Gotta report this, quick.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.367
[SOLDIER B] The flame
monsters are attacking us!

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:08.037
[ENEMY SOLDIERS yelling]

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.750
Are we having a repeat
of the dungeon incident?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.420
Well, those Amidonians
got scared.

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.422
The survivors all ran off.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.173
Looks like I owe
you again, Master.

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.636
In other words, the disturbance
involving the flame pierrots

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.596
was just a clever scheme
to get the villagers

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.308
near the border to safety?

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.559
[LUDWIN]
Your Majesty.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.103
Ludwin, your report.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.690
Sire, it seems Julius took
a detachment with him

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.317
and fled west.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:40.069
Supposedly there's also
a princess, but I am told

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.406
she left the city, and took
the finance minister with her,

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.283
along with several
of their key officials.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.329
Not having them
in the capital hurts us.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.497
Contact Castle Parnam at once.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.042
Have Hakuya send
over bureaucrats.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.168
[LUDWIN]
At once.

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:56.252
Yes, Poncho?

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.963
[PONCHO] I‐I'm here reporting
on the status of the treasury,

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.423
uh, sire, sir.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.592
I feel you might have
anticipated this already,

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.927
but in terms of their
food stores and capital,

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.429
supplies are rather scant.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.724
On the plus side, they have
plenty of weapons. So much.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.018
Keep the essential armaments,
then sell the surplus

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.561
to raise funds.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:17.648
Until things are stable, let's
also ration food in the castle.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.610
In the event we run out,
we can import more,

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.612
but only in an emergency.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.197
Would that be possible?

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.574
If you can guarantee
our safety while traveling,

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.869
I think we can manage
easily enough, sir. Yes.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.538
I'll make security
our top priority.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.415
Next, Glaive.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.794
The soldiers are maintaining
discipline and in good spirits.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:39.962
With this kind of
momentum on our side,

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.173
we could easily conquer
the rest of Amidonia

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.674
if you so wish.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.760
We'll capture nothing
beyond Van.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.345
The fighting is over with.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.888
Really, why not?

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.765
I figure we should
trample the enemy now,

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.392
while they're still vulnerable.

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.394
[SOUMA] No matter how much
we expand our dominion,

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.312
it all goes up in smoke
once the empire decides

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.522
to get involved.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.690
You mean that the empire
is going to show up?

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.194
Oh, there's not a doubt
in my mind they will.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.488
Amidonia signed the
Mankind Declaration,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.573
and now they have been
invaded by Elfrieden.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.660
There's no way the empire
ignores the actions we've taken.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.870
[GLAIVE] Any changes
within mankind's borders

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.790
as a result of conflict will
not be officially recognized.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.962
Most likely, they won't stop
at military sanctions.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.131
But Amidonia attacked us first!

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:26.175
Unfortunately, that's just how
international treaties work.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.594
The principality will probably
assert that it's Elfrieden's

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:31.431
own fault for not signing
onto the Declaration.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.641
Which raises the question,
why didn't you?

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.934
Especially when you
had the chance,

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.603
and knew what would happen
if we fought Amidonia.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.856
Because it turns out
the treaty has a catch.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.567
Even if I wanted to, I still
couldn't sign on, so...

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.110
But I don't understand.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.654
Well, let's just say it
could prove dangerous

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.657
to the empire and potentially
break them up.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.284
We need to hurry up
with the postwar cleanup

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.161
before they decide to act.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.716
[LUDWIN] The bitterness towards
the Elfrieden Kingdom runs deep.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:10.553

to remedy their distrust?

That's because in combat,
there's none who can defeat me.

We're right in the
middle of the show.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:09.417
When the next singer's up,

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.335
I need you to keep
a close watch over me.

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.586
Just in case.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.215
I haven't told anyone,
but I added a surprise singer

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.217
after Juna's performance.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.553
Don't you think you
should've told me sooner?

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:23.139
I have no idea if it's going
to blow up into anything,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.974
but it's mostly for insurance.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.434
I will safeguard your
life with my own

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.019
and make sure no explosions
happen on stage!

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.820
[AMIDONIAN CITIZENS clap]

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.739
[MAN C]
That was delightful!

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.823
[MAN D]
Very nice!

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:44.577
[SOUMA] And now, we have
a surprise guest performer.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.370
Lieutenant General
Margarita Wonder

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:49.874
from the Principality
of Amidonia.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.960
She will be performing her
country's national anthem,

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:54.837
"Through the Valley of Goldoa."

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.220
[music playing]

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.604
[singing in Japanese]

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.224
I have demonstrated my
backbone as an Amidonian.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.601
Now, you are free
to take my head.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:51.727
Why would I?

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:52.895
In case you didn't hear,

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.481
I just sang my country's
national anthem!

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:58.609
What's more, it's a song
demanding the return of the land

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.945
Elfrieden took from
our forefathers!

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.072
How can you overlook
such an outrage?

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.365
So what if I did?

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.076
There's no law in the
Elfrieden Kingdom that says

00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:08.744
you can't sing music
just because it's from

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:10.371
another country.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.123
[SOUMA]
What makes a nation good?

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.417
That's not an answer
that can easily be found.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.963
But at the very least,
it's somewhere people

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:22.132
can express themselves,
where one can sing freely.
