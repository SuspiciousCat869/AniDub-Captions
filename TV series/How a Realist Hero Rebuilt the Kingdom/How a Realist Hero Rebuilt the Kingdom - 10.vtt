WEBVTT

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:12.679
Our victory is imminent!

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.975
On this day, history is written,

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.520
and we will achieve
our greatest triumph!

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.689
[AMIDONIAN TROOPS cheer]

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.527
[HAKUYA] The Principality of
Amidonia is invading.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.320
30,000 of their troops
are moving through

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.113
the Ursula
Mountain pass.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.158
From what I see,
based on their movements,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.286
Gaius intends to occupy the
southwestern city of Altomura.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.470
This land has fine,
hearty grain.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.847
Not even the Forbidden Army's
troops could eat it all,

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:19.973
eh, Weist?

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.850
[WEIST]
R‐Right! Without question!

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.560
And soon it'll be yours!

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:26.480
Altomura has no intention
of defying you!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.485
Basically, you'll
surrender the city to us?

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.402
[WEIST]
Y‐Yes!

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:37.074
We have no other option but to
implore Your Highness's mercy.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.619
[GAIUS] If you want it,
then open your gates at once.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.038
[WEIST] I would love to
more than anything,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.167
but before we do, if you could
wait just a bit longer.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.627
[GAIUS]
What for?

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.171
The city is split between
those who wish to surrender

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.340
and those who will fight
to the last man.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.508
That is why I have come here,

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.803
to grovel at Your Highness's
feet, begging for his favor!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.597
As if we couldn't take Altomura
any time we wanted,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.100
whether you're able
to sway public opinion.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.394
[WEIST] True!
There's not a doubt in my mind,

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.063
but there are fools inside
who fail to understand.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.565
I trust Your Highness does
not wish to lose any soldiers

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.733
to the likes of them!

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.735
If you will guarantee
my life, I promise you!

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.071
I promise you I will
make the stronghold

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:18.782
see the light of reason!

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:21.118
[JULIUS] Wisdom states that
it takes five times as many

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.537
soldiers to seize
an enemy fortress.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.330
What if we do as he says?

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.999
There's no need to compromise
our troops without reason.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.337
Very well.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.005
If you will surrender
your stronghold,

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.842
I guarantee the safety
of all those within.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.177
[WEIST] My benevolent lord!
Thank you so much!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.515
[GAIUS] Once the gates
are open, the city is ours,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.559
then I'll hang that rat's
head in front of the gates

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.269
for everyone to see.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.898
What are you so worried about?
Carmine has 40,000 men.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.902
Meanwhile, this King Souma
has no more than 10,000.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.196
He's hopelessly outmatched‐‐
I doubt he'll be able

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.115
to send them any reinforcements.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.498
[ENEMY SOLDIERS yelling]

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.216
[HALBERT]
Damn it!

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.594
They're coming at us a little
hard, don't you think?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.262
[KAEDE]
What were you expecting, Hal?

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.722
Put yourself in their shoes.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.557
They woke up this morning
and found a fortress

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.017
appeared overnight.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.685
It's only natural that
they would panic.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.811
[HALBERT]
I guess.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:33.023
Gotta admit, when I heard
about this Sunomata Project,

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.649
I was surprised, myself.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.693
You have to hand it
to His Majesty.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.862
As soon as talks with the
Three Dukes broke down.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.822
he ordered all 10,000
from the Forbidden Army

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:41.865
to mobilize.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.241
I wouldn't have thought
that we could take up

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.161
position outside Randel Castle
that same day, though.

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.120
[KAEDE]
You're not alone.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.998
But that's Tomoe's rhinosaurus
land train for you.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.792
Not to mention we had
the advantage of using

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.294
His Majesty's genius
two‐by‐four system.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.379
The specs for the fort's
materials were standardized,

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.216
and then mass‐produced
at the capital ahead of time.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.426
All that time we spent
constructing roads and a city

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.678
really came in handy
getting this thing built.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.436
Kinda miss being on the
wrecking crew, though!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.441
[ENEMY SOLDIERS gasp]

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.818
[HALBERT]
That's another down!

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.902
[KAEDE]
Look out, Hal!

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.862
The enemy is bringing
in heavy artillery!

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:21.905
[HALBERT]
Huh?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.286
[HALBERT]
This is pretty bad, isn't it?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.539
[KAEDE] That's a bit
of an understatement.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.916
My anti‐magic reinforcement
only works against spells

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.376
and flame‐based attacks.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.711
Hopefully Roman concrete
and dirt walls stand up‐‐

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.088
[blast]

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.765
[KAEDE]
They're breaking through!

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.642
How are we supposed
to stop them?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.769
[HALBERT] Oh, we are in
trouble if you're asking me

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.062
what we should do!

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.195
You're positive there's nothing
you can do with your magic?

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.405
[KAEDE]
Stop yelling at me!

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.157
I practically used all of it up
building the blasted fort!

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.462
Easier than shooting a falcon.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.339
Hardly a challenge.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.383
And who are you, now?

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.970
Forgive me. I didn't
introduce myself.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.723
I've come here from the
God‐Protected Forest.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.808
You may call me Sur.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.852
I remember you
from the landslide.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.186
Thanks to you, my daughter‐‐

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.521
[blast]

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.567
I never got to say thank
you, which I regretted.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.488
But then my daughter said
she wanted to be like you.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.532
That's not the
worst part, though.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.492
She went on to tell me
how she wants to join

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:52.037
the Forbidden Army
and the great Halbert.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.540
You can imagine my
annoyance at hearing that.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.339
[LUDWIN]
Open the gate!

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.466
Our targets are
the three cannons!

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.885
As for the enemy soldiers,
pay no mind to them.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.303
Do not get in too deep!

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.889
Your only focus should be
destroying the artillery!

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.766
[SOLDIERS yell]

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.184
[LUDWIN]
Come on!

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.478
Let's show these traitors the
Royal Guard is more than

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.355
just a bunch of pretty faces!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:20.857
Torch the cannon!

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.032
[KAEDE]
Are you seeing this?!

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.118
[HALBERT] They've got the
other two burning now!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.954
[KAEDE] And just in
the nick of time, too!

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.163
[laughing]

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.498
[HALBERT]
I wasn't worried.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.090
[BEOWULF] All three of the
cannons were destroyed.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.341
[NOBLEMAN C]
What a sad day!

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.426
Seeing the great Georg's
army turned to a pack

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.303
of spineless cowards!

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.430
[BEOWULF] That's rich, coming
from a corrupt aristocrat

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.557
whose only talent is
in amassing wealth.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.393
[NOBLEMAN A] I trust you
haven't lost your nerve.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.519
Or have you?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.775
You think there's anyone
capable of intimidating me?!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.029
I'm doubting you
understand the situation.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:11.908
The enemy are a mere 10,000,
while we are 40,000 strong.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.703
Why would we ever need
to force our attack?

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.913
They're outnumbered,
but if that is the case,

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.416
should we not wipe out their
forces in one fell swoop?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.002
You attempted the same
strategy and were routed,

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.294
if you remember.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.674
You even took cannons with you,
of which we are now down three.

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:31.261
[NOBLEMAN B] Uh, and we
are truly sorry about that.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.514
And there's no sign Souma
is even in that fort.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.558
[NOBLEMAN D] Duke Carmine,
how can you be sure?

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.143
Since the fort was erected,

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.270
their army has been
on the defensive.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.230
If he were in our position,
he would have made

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.816
some sort of move by now.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.068
No. He is definitely
on the move.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.030
The question is where,
and we must lure him out.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.823
Do you mean to tell us
you're planning on using

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.742
the soldiers inside
the fort as bait?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.413
[GEORG] You men must
be spent from the battle.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.624
This fight will not be over
in only a day or two.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:05.503
I suggest taking tomorrow to
rest and regain your strength.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.963
[SOLDIERS chatter]

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:15.847
Beowulf. Is all prepared
as I've asked?

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.557
Affirmative. Everything's ready.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.145
[laughs]

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.528
Figures. What would you
expect from a rat?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.492
Prepare to attack at once!

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.993
We will lay siege to the‐‐?

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:44.417
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.002
What am I hearing?

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.931
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.933
[SOLDIER A] Forgive me,
but the Lord of Altomura,

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.769
Weist Garreau, requests an
urgent audience with you.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.687
‐‐[GAIUS] Let him through!
‐‐[SOLDIER A] Yes, sir!

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.738
[WEIST]
I am terribly sorry, my lord!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.115
[GAIUS]
Explain yourself!

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.075
You promised me that you would
have the stronghold's gates

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.201
open by now!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.786
The holdouts have
become more stubborn,

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.746
and it's taking longer than
expected persuading them

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.831
to surrender!

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.541
[GAIUS]
What? You lied to me!

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.668
I don't want to hear
any excuses!

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:28.545
I'll lop off your head and
make you an example

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.005
to everyone behind those walls!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.466
[WEIST] Before you do, I wish to
inform you that the shouting

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.802
you just heard coming from
Altomura were the war cries

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.513
of the do‐or‐die resistance
faction I mentioned earlier!

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.060
Father, in a battle against
soldiers who are prepared

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:47.147
to fight to the death, our
losses would be far too great.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.399
I could not have
put it better myself!

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.527
Yes, I've failed you, but
perhaps I can make up for it!

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.656
Please accept this, my lord!

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.491
Gold dust! I wish I had more!

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.452
Also, if I may ask Your
Highness's generosity?

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.122
[GAIUS] I accept your
offering, reluctantly.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.332
But what do you mean
by my generosity?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.835
Tomorrow! Tomorrow at midday.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:10.628
See that tree?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.425
When its shadow reaches here,
they will surrender!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.554
Until then, I beg you to
refrain from attacking the city!

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.098
I promise that this time
I will be able to convince

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.767
the holdouts that surrendering
is the only choice!

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.395
[JULIUS] Father, why don't we
take Weist at his word?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.480
And show some
magnanimity this one time?

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.694
Very well.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:38.114
We will refrain from attacking
until noon tomorrow.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.908
But if the gates are
not opened by then,

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.493
we will take the city by force.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.912
[WEIST]
Thank you! Thank you!

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.079
Leave it to me!

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.832
I can convince them to
open the gate for you, sir!

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.338
Are you sure this is the
wisest course, Excel‐‐

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.716
Ahem. I mean, Duchess Excel?

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.426
With that much gold
at our disposal,

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.511
we could have hired a whole
division of mercenaries

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.471
from Zem.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.765
Until someone offered
them more money.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.434
What good is loyalty
that can be bought?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.103
At the moment, I'm engaging
three different foes.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.481
Time is my only ally.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:16.236
If I can buy a little extra with
gold, it will not be missed.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.238
But hopefully that
much is obvious,

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.448
otherwise, you're
nothing but a child.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.451
[WEIST] I must say, this new
king is quite daunting,

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.995
sending you to act as his
personal messenger.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.790
[EXCEL] Out of the blue,
he says, "Go to Altomura."

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.667
He really is a slave driver.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.044
[WEIST] I'll wager that Duke
Vargas and Duke Carmine

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.380
had no idea that you were
attending the conference

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.631
from here.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.715
Masterfully done.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.218
[EXCEL]
Not just them. Gaius, as well.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.096
It takes three days to get
here from Lagoon City.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.139
Three nonstop days.

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.767
Souma doesn't mind
driving the elderly ragged.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.811
[WEIST] Funny how you
play the "elderly" card

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.312
only when it suits you.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.856
I get a free pass.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:58.152
But I forbid anyone else from
ever mentioning it to me.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.113
By the way, Duchess Excel.

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.865
I was only able to buy us
till noon tomorrow‐‐

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.367
will that be enough time?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.702
I'm sure it will be.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:09.038
For if His Majesty doesn't
make his move by then,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.915
it won't matter.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.918
We'll have to die like heroes
inside this stronghold.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.549
[HALBERT]
Whoo...

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.473
[HALBERT] H‐Hey, Kaede.
What's wrong with you?

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.558
[KAEDE chuckles]

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.854
Nothing. I'm acting this way
'cause I'm happy.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.939
You're kidding. And why is that?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.859
I suppose because I have
you here beside me, Hal.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.280
It all comes down to
today and tomorrow.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.157
If we can get through this.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.533
What do you mean "if"?

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.788
[KAEDE]
I'm hoping things work out.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.458
Here, and with everything
we face down the road.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.418
[HALBERT] Hey, don't start
doubting now after all we've

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.586
gone through.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.422
We made it this far, might as
well see it through to the end.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.716
Good point.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.093
You'll be sure to
protect me, right?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.888
[SOLDIERS yell]

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.807
[HALBERT]
Finally, a breather.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.309
The enemy's dropping
their attack.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.353
I don't see any mercenaries
from Zem down there.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.729
[HALBERT] I told you to
keep your head down!

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.567
Huh. If they're changing
troop formations,

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.486
there is a possibility
the enemy's digging in

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.571
for a more drawn‐out battle.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.115
That would make life
a little easier for us.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.826
[KAEDE] Always stay light on
your feet during combat, Hal,

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.120
or the rug will be pulled
out from under you.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.538
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.047
Prepare to launch our assault.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.426
Messenger!
Alert all units that we are now

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:48.012
beginning our
attack on Altomura!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.014
[LOOKOUT A] Multiple wyverns
approaching from the sky

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.182
to the east!

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.225
[HALBERT]
Huh?

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:53.643
[LOOKOUT A]
It's the air force!

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.318
Duke Vargas sent
them reinforcements!

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.529
Is this what the ground forces
have been waiting for?

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.671
[TOLMAN]
Yes, my lord?

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.089
Let's hear it.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.716
How's the evacuation of
the citizens going, Tolman?

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.010
I'm pleased to report
it's complete.

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.638
As of now, the only ones
remaining in Red Dragon City

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.140
are the air force personnel,

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.017
as well as members
of the Vargas household.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.477
[CASTOR]
Very well.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.271
I'm glad to hear that.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.523
Who knows what King
Souma is planning?

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.358
He's quite resourceful
for his age.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.237
[TOLMAN] Are you having a
change of heart about him?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.947
[CASTOR]
Yes, indeed I am.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.074
Better late than never, eh?

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.076
[TOLMAN] Another item worth
mentioning is we have been

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.828
receiving requests from
air force units

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.205
from across the country,
asking to join your side.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.957
[CASTOR]
Turn them all down.

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.169
I won't have them sharing
in my obstinacy.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.921
[TOLMAN] I had a feeling you
would take that stance.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.799
Are you not joining up
with Duke Carmine?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.759
I don't mind fighting
alongside him.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.511
I'm not about to stand
shoulder to shoulder

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:13.347
with those corrupt
nobles he's taken in.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.434
There's no turning back now,
nor do I intend to.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.603
All that remains is showing
my mettle as leader

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.855
of the air force.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.857
Do I go out in a blaze of glory,

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:26.652
or chew through their flank
like a viper instead?

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.863
[TOLMAN] According to the
reports, the 10,000 knights

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.364
from the Forbidden Army
are headed toward

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.575
the Carmine Duchy.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.535
While it is unclear whether
or not King Souma

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:37.330
is with them, it appears that
he has no additional troops

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.707
to send here.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.335
[CASTOR]
So he's completely ignoring us.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.045
[TOLMAN]
You have only a hundred knights,

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.464
so disregarding you
seems highly likely.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:49.884
[CASTOR]
That's impossible.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:53.054
Souma's smartest play
would be to defeat me first,

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.515
then assume control over
the air force and use them

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.808
for a showdown
with Duke Carmine.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.684
[TOLMAN]
However,

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:02.980
if we're being realistic, the
man has no manpower to spare.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.524
We don't know for certain.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.235
He may deploy a strategy
we'd never think of.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.574
[CARLA] Father! Souma's
force has been spotted!

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.952
[CASTOR]
They're here? How many?

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.036
[CARLA]
That's just it.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:19.914
They brought a ship.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:22.792
A what?

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.109
[CARLA]
Father!

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.069
The Battleship Albert
is heading this way!

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:57.743
[CASTOR] They put wheels on it
and are dragging it overland?!

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.788
Is he planning on throwing
away his flagship here?!

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.582
[SOUMA]
I didn't have any choice.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:05.418
I've already got a shortage
of military strength as it is.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:13.050
Duke Vargas. A letter from Souma
arrived, requesting conference

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.594
via Gemstone Broadcast.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.429
Apologies for the
hasty arrangement.

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.060
Out with it.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.730
Why have you brought
the Albert this far inland?

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:28.816
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.360
To lay siege to the Red
Dragon City, of course.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:35.615
[CARLA]
The Albert! It's shooting at us!

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.782
Incoming fire!

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.710
[CASTOR]
Not bad at all!

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.963
This truly was a failure of
imagination on my part.

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:54.258
I take it you have an affinity
for spectacles, Duke Vargas.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.427
[CASTOR]
You better be careful, Souma.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.430
You're in danger of becoming
a better king than I expected.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:02.183
You could make things easier
for us by standing down.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.770
Surrendering at this point
would be disgraceful,

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:09.065
especially after the
show you put on.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:12.526
I see. That truly
is a shame then.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.736
Have it your way.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.621
Carla! Silence those
cannons for good!

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.622
Right!

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.793
Souma.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.920
If you really have what
it takes to be king,

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.630
come and prove
you're better than me.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.259
But don't expect any mercy.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:41.389
[CARLA]
Start the attack!

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.099
Our target's the
Battleship Albert!

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.308
King Souma's on board!

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.102
Find and capture him!

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.645
He underestimated us!

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.772
Let's show him
House Vargas's valor!

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.192
[AIR FORCE yells]

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.070
Here we go!

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:02.868
Prepare to drop the bombs!

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.000
Fan out and evade!

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.713
[AIR SOLDIER A]
Repeating bolt‐throwers?

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:15.965
[AIR SOLDIER B]
Impossible!

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.342
That's a fixed‐base
defensive weapon!

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.094
[CARLA] The kind you only
see defending bases

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.595
from air assaults.

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.597
He's subverting all
our expectations!

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.768
Dammit, what're we
supposed to do now?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.520
[AIR SOLDIER C] The only option
we have is to attack the enemy

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:31.188
in their blind spot, my lady!

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.941
It looks like the ship's wheels
were hastily constructed.

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.526
That's where it's
most vulnerable.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:39.405
Right. Then we'll approach by
flying at ultra‐low altitude.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.406
Did you hear that?

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.575
I want all units to move in now!

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.201
Neutralize the cannons,
bolt throwers,

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.829
and any other weapons
it has in its arsenal!

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.581
[AIR SOLDIER D] But wouldn't
it be quicker to pulverize

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.082
‐‐the bridge?
‐‐Don't you dare!

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:51.959
Princess Liscia
could be in there!

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:55.087
Destroying its weaponry
will suffice, understood?

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.339
And make sure you
take Souma alive!

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:58.883
[AIR FORCE]
Understood!

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.134
[CARLA]
We have to.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.635
Otherwise, if we kill him,

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.429
Liscia will likely
be devastated.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.474
But if that's a concern,

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.559
I should have tried
talking father out of this.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:15.608
Which means...

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.282
...I should have supported
Souma when I had the chance.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:28.287
Well, too late for that now.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.684
[CARLA]
It's far too quiet down there.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.062
[AIR SOLDIER E] We still haven't
found any enemy soldiers.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:55.689
[CARLA] Somebody had to be
controlling those cannons.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.691
[AIR SOLDIER F] Below deck, we
found what looks to be an empty

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:58.734
suit of armor,

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:01.028
but the only thing inside
was this puppet hand!

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.782
[CARLA] All of you,
hurry back to the castle!

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.159
[AIR SOLDIER C] But we
haven't located King Souma!

00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:09.495
[CARLA] Because he
was never on the ship!

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.289
This was all just a trick‐‐
a ploy to lure us away!

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.124
[AIR SOLDIER C]
When you say lure away,

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.960
you don't mean his
real objective was‐‐

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:23.384
[CARLA] Taking Red Dragon
City, where Father is.
