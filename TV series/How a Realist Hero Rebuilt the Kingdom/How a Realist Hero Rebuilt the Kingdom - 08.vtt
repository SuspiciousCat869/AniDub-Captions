00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:12.679
[SOUMA] Because of the existence
of magic in this world,

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.973
their technological systems
seem a little strange

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.476
to an outsider like me.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.229
For example, there's
the Battleship Albert.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.689
The only ship possessed
by the Forbidden Army,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.442
which bears the name
of the previous king.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.986
Looking at it as a whole,
you would probably find

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.072
its modern aesthetic strange,

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.782
especially for a world that
hasn't even reached

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.034
the industrial revolution yet.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.495
However, despite
being made of iron,

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.956
as long as its buoyancy
is taken into account,

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.832
it can still float on the water.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.585
In other words, a battleship
can still be fashioned

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:46.672
even with only a medieval
level of technology.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.674
In my world, the reason
they weren't built until

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.842
after the industrial revolution
was that there were

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.637
no engines that could
propel an iron craft.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.472
In this world, though,
there are sea dragons

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.267
that have the brute force
necessary to tow an iron vessel.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:00:59.434
No engine required.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.728
By taming them and having
them pull a dreadnought,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.106
long‐distance voyages
become possible.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.400
That is how they were
able to build iron ships.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.778
The same goes for the
large cannons mounted

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.822
to the front of the vehicle.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.242
While this world has gunpowder,
firearms haven't been invented.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.620
Since intermediate magic
was used as a means

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:22.749
of launching long‐range attacks,
guns were never necessary.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.502
Also, there's something
called infusion spells.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.421
You can impart various
effects on an object

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.964
using these abilities.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.300
Like making them stronger
or increasing their ability

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.052
to cut through targets.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:38.181
As for the cannons, this was
done out of necessity.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.017
That's because any
non‐water based magic

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.644
is greatly limited while on the
oceans, lakes, and rivers

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.937
for some reason.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.064
Instead, these weapons were
developed as a means

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.066
of making long‐range attacks.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.110
In short,
technology is developed

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:52.821
when it becomes needed.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.949
It's a world composed
of backwards systems.

00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.078
And here I am, attempting to
advance my own civic projects.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:57.779
Gimme a break.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.241
The legendary Forbidden Army is
reduced to road construction?

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.535
[KAEDE]
You there! No loafing!

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.037
So stop running your mouth
and get back to digging!

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.832
‐‐Kaede...
‐‐[KAEDE] Oh, no, you don't!

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.333
You serve under me, Hal!

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.544
And will address me
as Site Foreman, got it?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.715
Site Foreman, is
this really a job fit

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:18.425
for the Forbidden Army?

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.969
We originally hired unemployed
people from the capital,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.430
but we were still
extremely shorthanded.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.974
After all, we are building
an entire network of roads

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.517
throughout the kingdom,
you know.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.644
Starting from the new
port city of Venetinova

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.188
and stretching all over.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.190
I'm just saying there're
better options besides

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.150
using the Forbidden Army.

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.610
We're supposed to
protect the kingdom,

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.944
not build roads.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.041
Yum! This is good!

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.501
This sauce they've got
mixed in with the meat

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.377
is sweet and salty!

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.546
The king himself
invented this dish.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.089
He calls it "shogayaki."

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.592
I gotta hand it to him.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.261
If nothing else, the guy is a
real talent in the kitchen.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.098
After the mystic wolves came to
the country as refugees,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.309
a settlement was set aside
especially for them.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.061
That's where they make
seasonings called shoyu

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.605
and mirin, both of which
are used in this dish.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.357
It's basically how they
established themselves

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.525
in the kingdom:

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.027
providing us with
these seasonings.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.197
A policy that houses them
and gives us delicious food.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.199
That's killing two birds
with one stone!

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:29.329
What's more, it's amazing
we can eat fresh vegetables

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.039
for a change.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.166
These came from the
village closest to here,

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.127
which is connected by
the road to the capital.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.505
Creating a direct route
between cities lets us manage

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.966
our supply lines more easily.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.884
[HALBERT] Sounds like the
construction efforts are already

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.386
paying off.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.638
With this kind of
transportation capability,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.265
we're making a huge
contribution to solving

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.766
the food shortage.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.101
We are, seriously?

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.811
Once distribution gets
smoothed out,

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.522
imbalances in supply and
demand will be eliminated,

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:56.982
and we can expect to
see the price of food

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.608
become more reasonable again.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.486
That's the reason the king has
us building all these roads?

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.864
The acting king is
an incredible man.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.868
He has so much foresight,
it's almost frightening.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.537
Once we're finished eating,
are you going to catch a wink?

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.913
Yeah, I guess.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.748
The king does recommend
getting some sleep

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.459
after a meal to
increase productivity.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.337
[KAEDE] Seeing how His Majesty
comes from a different world...

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.714
Oh, my gosh, he's here!

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.173
And the princess, also!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.010
Tell me, Halbert, have
you settled in all right?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.262
Sire! No problems at all!

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.930
Why're you acting so formal?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.682
Where's that candid spirit
you had the first time

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:31.933
we met each other?

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.269
I'm terribly sorry for
how I acted that day!

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.938
It was an unforgivable act of
rudeness against Your Highness.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.273
Loosen up, all right?

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.900
And that's a royal decree.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.902
Also, no more "Your Highness."

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.028
Call me Souma.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.280
Oh, but, sire, I‐‐

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.032
Hal. I wasn't asking you.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.117
I was giving you an order.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.244
Understood, Souma.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.829
That's much better.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.414
I've been hoping to
find a guy my age

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.541
that I can just chat
informally with.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.967
So this is what's involved
when making a road, huh?

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.886
Strange how I've walked
on them countless times

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.429
but never gave a single
thought to how

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.264
they were constructed,
or the manpower

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.557
that was involved.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.559
Officially, this is
an inspection,

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.312
but no one said it couldn't
be educational either.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.194
What's that material that
looks just like mush?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.447
It's a special blend of
volcanic ash and lime.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.823
[SOUMA]
In the world I come from,

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.450
they call it Roman concrete.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.410
It continues to
harden over time.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.415
When it solidifies, even
one of those beasts

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.751
traveling at full gallop
won't cause it to crack.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.879
That's pretty amazing,
but is it really that rigid?

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.839
As a matter of fact,
the degree of flexibility

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.176
is what allows it to distribute
the forces it receives.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.388
Back in my world, there are
buildings made of this concrete,

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.474
and they're still standing 2,000
years after they were built.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.270
Are all of these streetlamps
modeled after the ones

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.564
we use like back in the capital?

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:02.399
[KAEDE]
Yes.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.942
They're designed so
that when it gets dark,

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.361
the lightmoss inside will glow.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.364
Also, we planted warding trees
from the God‐Protected Forest,

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.700
evenly spaced on both
sides of the road.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:12.867
Warding trees?

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.869
Aisha? Care to explain?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:15.912
Sir!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.042
Warding trees like this one
constantly emit a frequency

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.379
that monsters and wild animals
seem to find unpleasant.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.172
Most likely it's to
prevent giant boars

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.049
and other wildlife from
devouring them.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.636
In the God‐Protected Forest,
we plant these trees

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:32.929
around our villages.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.431
They keep the monsters
and animals out,

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.850
and our people safe.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.728
Sort of like a rudimentary
barrier, huh?

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.521
But if we place them
too close together,

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.273
there's no telling what
sort of impact it'll have

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.025
on the ecosystem.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.985
So we moderately
space them apart,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.655
far enough to discourage wild
animals from approaching.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.948
I don't understand.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.159
Wouldn't it be better to keep
them out completely?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.786
Right. So, Liscia, what
do you do when animals

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.329
who seasonally change
hunting grounds

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.331
like gray wolves or
red bears can't migrate

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.416
because of the road?

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.710
They get stuck where they are,
and their food runs out,

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:07.547
so then they start attacking
livestock and people instead.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.840
Or another example.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.176
What if giant apes or boars
who find themselves locked

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.678
in one place deplete all the
food and have no choice

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.472
but to descend on settlements
and eat whatever

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.848
they find on the farms?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.225
Ask yourself, what should we do?

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.102
All right, now I understand
why we shouldn't

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.021
stop them entirely.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.356
But why such specific examples?

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.984
Because animal control is
an issue all local authorities

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.903
should be responsible
for, y'know?

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.864
Local what? Authorities?

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.741
I didn't know you were
thinking so far ahead!

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.868
Leave it to you, Your Majesty!

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.502
What was that?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.212
A messenger kui.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.089
Kuis are birds that have
a homing instinct

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.216
as well as the ability
to detect the frequency

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.219
of their masters from across
tremendous distances.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.470
Impressive.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.514
They exhibit behaviors that
would make them ideal

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.766
as long‐distance
message carriers.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:02.894
Well, whoever sent the letter,

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.063
it looks like it was
written for Aisha.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:10.944
No, it can't be!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.487
What does it say, Aisha?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.198
It's a message from my father,
the chief of the dark elves.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.491
This is terrible.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.827
He says last night,
there was a massive landslide

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.495
in the God‐Protected Forest,

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.831
and it ended up
swallowing half of a village.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.627
Before it happened, he says the
forest had been experiencing

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.171
a long stretch of rain.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.800
There're so many
of us... missing.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:36.845
Souma.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.975
‐‐What do we do?
‐‐Shush!

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:44.435
Hal, please, the king
is thinking right now.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.229
Don't break his
train of thought.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.564
[SOUMA]
Kaede.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.566
How many do we
have constructing roads?

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.068
Sire! There're 54 from
the Forbidden Army,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.904
and four engineers on loan from
the civil engineering guild!

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.990
Of all those, there are six
who are earth mages,

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.616
including myself!

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.994
All right then, this group is
going to the dark elves' village

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.662
to rescue them.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:03.705
Majesty!

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:04.747
Aisha.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.708
One‐on‐one, there's no
question that you're stronger

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.418
than I am.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.087
But I can mobilize
a lot more manpower.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.630
So let me handle this.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.508
I guarantee you, we will save
as many lives as we can.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.139
Not now, crying
will have to wait.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.141
We need to carry out
the rescue first,

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.643
but if we're going to enter
the God‐Protected Forest,

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.896
then we need you with us.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.189
Show us the way in.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.399
[AISHA]
Right!

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.444
Disaster relief is
a race against time.

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.031
Luckily for us, we're not
that far from the forest.

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:39.782
We'll head directly there.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.242
As you wish, sire.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.661
I'll get the soldiers
ready to go at once!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.829
[SOUMA]
See to it.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.125
Liscia, please return to
the capital and request

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.835
that they send a rescue party.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.754
When you get there,
also ask Hakuya to send

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.089
relief supplies to the
dark elves' village.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:56.716
[LISCIA]
Understood. I'm on it.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.012
Leaving now,
how long till we reach

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.388
the God‐Protected Forest?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.098
With a quick steed, half a day.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.184
At a normal military march,
it will take two days,

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.560
no matter how fast we hurry.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.312
What? Two days?

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:11.397
If the landslide
happened around midnight,

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.483
about half a day has elapsed.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.485
No matter our speed, we'll
arrive two‐and‐a‐half days

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.779
after it occurred.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.198
Only half a day before
the 72‐hour threshold

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.699
is going to be tough.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.619
Why a 72‐hour threshold?

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.204
[SOUMA]
During natural disasters,

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.207
about three days after
the incident, or 72 hours,

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:32.919
the number of likely survivors
decreases dramatically.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.379
Then let's not waste
time and head to

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.880
the God‐Protected Forest!

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.799
I'd like to, but a
normal military march

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.134
will take too much time.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.136
Isn't there some kind of
magic that can instantly

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.888
transport a large army?

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.931
Are you kidding?

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.183
If anyone could do that,
do you think we'd be out here

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.979
pouring this much sweat into
building these roads of yours?

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.272
Dammit.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.357
Surely there's some way
to get up there fast.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.150
[hoofbeats]

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.029
It is a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, my king.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.198
I am the dark elf chief
and Aisha's father.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.326
Wodan Udgard, at your service.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.828
Please, let us dispense
with the formalities.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.123
Right now, the recovery
effort comes first.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:55.084
Currently, I have just under
50 Forbidden Army soldiers

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.628
accompanying me,
but in the coming days,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.422
a second unit equipped
with relief supplies

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.382
should be arriving.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.176
Explain the details to me.

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:05.094
[WODAN]
Certainly.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:06.971
The landslide occurred
on a slope here,

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.515
to the east of this village.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:13.603
By our count,
over a hundred are dead.

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.981
But there are still more than
40 people unaccounted for.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.984
All right, please compile a list
of those who're still missing.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.028
If we cross off names
as they're found,

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.113
nobody will slip
through the cracks.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:25.406
Very well, my king.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.158
I'll arrange that at once.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.328
Also, post lookouts to stand
watch over the mountain.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.498
If it moves even slightly or
there're any unusual sounds,

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.124
have them warn us.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.085
The last thing we want
is another landslide

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.753
during the rescue mission.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.464
Your Majesty, please allow
me to carry out this duty.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.427
Aisha has played in the
God‐Protected Forest

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.137
since childhood
and knows the area

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.931
like the back of her hand.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.142
You'll be much safer
taking her along.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.811
There were others
as well who once roamed

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.979
the forest with you, correct?

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.690
I have no doubt they will be
equally as indispensable

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.442
in reading the terrain.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.027
Find them and
take them with you.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.113
Yes. It'll be done, Father!

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.031
We're counting on you, Aisha.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.450
But please, don't do
anything crazy.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.161
[SOUMA]
Listen up!

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.081
We're about to embark upon
a search for the missing.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.165
While looking,

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.793
if you hear any voice in
the dirt asking for help,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.295
work carefully to rescue them.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.631
Time to show off the
excavation skills you developed

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.092
while building the roads!

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.344
Remember, don't get
in over your heads.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.388
If you think another
slide is coming,

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.849
run, even if you're
in mid rescue.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.727
I will not accept a single
casualty from my rescue detail!

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:37.728
Understood?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.896
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sire!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.449
I just heard someone!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.491
Huh?

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.121
They're underneath this trunk!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.539
And they're still breathing!

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.501
‐‐I don't hear anyone.
‐‐They're under here!

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:01.878
Hurry up and dig!

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.260
Are you serious?

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:12.054
[grunting]

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.737
I don't know how you could tell
someone was buried there.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.614
[SOUMA]
It's all thanks to these.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.158
What is that? Like a mouse?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.493
Carved out of wood.

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:34.535
Watch.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.543
I'm using it to go search
around, since there are places

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.588
in the disaster site people
aren't able to quite reach.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.589
Oh, yeah.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.424
So this is your
living‐whatever power

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.800
I've been hearing about.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.511
Yeah, I had made up
a few prototypes

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:52.762
for exploring dungeons,

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:56.098
but I never expected them to be
useful in situations like this.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.600
[gags]

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.643
What's wrong?

[SOUMA retches]

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.314
Souma! You all right?

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.732
What came over you?

[SOUMA grunts]

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.277
Oh, sorry about that.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.072
One of my wooden mice
was out searching

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.741
and it just found some
horribly mangled remains

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.326
belonging to a victim.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.994
You mean you share
senses with them

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.413
so it's like you're
experiencing it yourself?

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.751
[SOUMA]
I see.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.504
All of the missing have
been accounted for.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.173
[WODAN] Unfortunately, there
are those who are now cold,

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.676
lifeless bodies, but if Your
Majesty had not come

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:35.137
to our aid, their number
would have been far greater.

As chief of the dark elves,

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.225
I once again must express
my gratitude, sire.

[AISHA]
Majesty! Father!

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.940
The princess has just
arrived from the capital

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.234
and brought the second
relief unit with her.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.152
That's great news!

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:52.780
[ROBTHOR]
No. It's too late.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.252
[SOUMA] It's true they weren't
here in time to search,

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:09.714
but at this stage, it's more
important to focus on relief.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.508
Tending to the wounded,
moving the sediment,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.011
and building temporary housing.

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:18.389
There are a number
of jobs left to do.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.391
But it won't bring anyone
back from the dead,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.976
now, will it?

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.979
Stop this at once!

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.858
This man is my younger brother,
Robthor, Your Majesty.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:31.777
He lost his wife in this
disaster, and his only daughter

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:35.615
is still wandering the border
between life and death.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.867
Understandably, he's
somewhat distraught.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.577
Please forgive him.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.245
No, it's okay.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:45.333
[ROBTHOR] My king! I've done my
part to keep the forest safe!

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:46.667
So why has...

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.628
Why has the forest
taken my family?!

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.713
Enough, Robthor!

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.716
This is no time to ask
futile questions.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.801
That won't bring anyone back.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.098
Right now,
mourn your wife's death,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.142
and pray that your daughter's
spirit will continue

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.186
to remain a part of this world.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:13.611
[ROBTHOR crying]

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:26.374
My uncle was opposed
to thinning out the forest.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.709
He felt that for dark elves,
guardians of the woods,

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:32.004
cutting down trees was a
betrayal of our sacred role.

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.173
I see. That's why.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.675
Are you saying that if
my uncle had been

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.259
more cooperative
towards thinning,

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.136
this wouldn't have happened
and his wife and daughter

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.638
might have been spared?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.973
There is‐‐ I don't know.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.603
It's true moderate trimming can
make a slight difference.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.356
Undergrowth comes in
and the soil retains water.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.191
That way, we can create
an environment less prone

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.567
to landslides.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.528
Still, at the end of
the day, it prevents,

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.029
but can't eliminate them.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:20:00.074
In this instance, prolonged
rains were the catalyst.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.118
Truth is, it could
happen anywhere.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:05.621
Then ultimately,
it boils down to bad luck?

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.791
Per the location of this
landslide, I'm afraid so.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:12.545
However, thinning is a constant
operation within the forest.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.631
Hearing any unusual sounds,
or noticing the forest

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:18.342
appearing to move, signs of
an impending landslide

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.261
would be easier to notice.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.763
Once they were spotted,
a plan could have been formed,

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.932
and evacuation would
have been possible.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.350
Protecting the forest.

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.935
Sounds noble, doesn't it?

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:31.188
But the belief it requires
guarding is a mistake.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.608
Nature is not weak and
in need of protection.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.111
It's egotistical to think
we can destroy it,

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:40.614
so is the idea it needs
us watching over it.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.950
It goes through cycles of
destruction and rebirth

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.160
all the time.

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.995
People merely attempt
to keep it in a state

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.873
that best suits their own needs.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:52.042
All mankind can do is
make slight adjustments.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.336
Thinning and maintaining
the forest makes it possible

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:55.838
to coexist with it.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:18.360
This time around, I wasn't
able to contribute that much.

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:21.322
You went and brought back
the relief unit, didn't you?

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.074
Everyone gave their
all out there today.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.701
Almost.

00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:27.995
I was the only one
who couldn't do much.

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.205
That's nonsense!

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.582
I heard you made a huge
difference with the rescue!

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.003
My responsibility is to be king.

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:39.340
It's not my job to direct tasks
onsite during an emergency.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:40.925
I should've made
preparations ahead of time

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:45.012
before an emergency transpired,
but that didn't happen.

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.806
Because I was neglectful.

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.390
What're you talking about?

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:50.100
Souma, if it weren't for you...

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.311
Utilizing the Forbidden Army
as a rescue team

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:54.104
went smoothly enough.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.358
But beyond that, I've fallen
short several times.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:00.986
A clear means of communication,
long‐distance shipping,

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.239
stocking rescue
supplies per area,

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.616
medical teams assigned
to search parties...

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.827
[sighs] I overlooked all of it.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.330
I was so occupied
with the food shortage

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:12.873
and the Three Dukedoms.

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.417
I failed to prepare
for anything else.

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:16.752
Souma...
