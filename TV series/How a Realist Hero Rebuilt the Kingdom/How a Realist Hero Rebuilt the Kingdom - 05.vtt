00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.928
[SOUMA] This world has these
funny little creatures

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.638
called gelins.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.057
They're known for
being incredibly weak.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.976
Cut them or squash them
and they die instantly.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.605
They have no sex, and
merely divide to reproduce.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.065
And right now,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.692
I'm about to be fed one of
these funny little creatures.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.205
We can't wait.
What do you have for us next?

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.165
Ah, yes!

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.833
I think this one
will surprise you.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.507
[GROUP gasps]

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.097
I hope I'm wrong,
but is that a gelin?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.475
Why, yes indeed,
that's exactly what it is.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.601
You have a good eye!

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.270
That's weird, I didn't think
you could eat those things.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.897
Yep!

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.482
[AISHA]
Just a moment, please.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.734
Is that gelin dead?

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.235
Yes, ma'am, no need to worry‐‐

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.071
this gelin has already
been slaughtered.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.405
It can't be.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:38.325
I've never seen or heard
of a gelin carcass before.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:41.411
Yeah, now that you mention it,
this is pretty weird.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.747
Why? What makes it so unusual?

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.582
[LISCIA] If you break open
the thin surface membrane

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:49.461
of a gelin, its internal fluids
come gushing out everywhere.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.505
So, it shouldn't be
possible for you to kill one

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:54.007
and have it remain
intact like that.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.258
I gotcha.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.720
So, what do you have to do
to preserve the carcass?

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.389
Well, there is a bit
of a trick to it,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.100
but it's not too
terribly difficult.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.560
I learned this from a
small tribe who lives far

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.189
to the west, within the borders
of our great empire.

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.692
If you strike it with a stick or
something just hard enough

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.527
so that you don't
break the membrane,

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.363
you can destroy
the nucleus within!

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:20.367
I'm told the locals refer to
this method as "gelin ikejime."

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.412
[SOUMA]
I guess they're kinda like fish.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.789
If you successfully break
only the nucleus,

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.959
then all of that internal
fluid will begin to congeal‐‐

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.752
and the gelin will grow firm.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.671
If you continue to let
them sit after that,

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.840
the remaining moisture
will eventually evaporate,

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.217
and they'll become almost
hard‐cured lumps.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.969
I'd say two hours
after death seems to be

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.220
the sweet spot.

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:42.013
They'll be solidified
to a certain degree,

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.807
but retain some
of that springiness.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.976
That's when you can cook
'em up real nice, you see.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.404
Now, you can simply boil these
strips in some salted water.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:58.822
And they'll firm up even more!

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.579
[SOUMA] Huh. It looks
like he's adding stock.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.418
Ta‐da! Please give it a try!

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.423
They look like udon noodles.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.592
Oh? What's "udon"?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.178
Oh, right.
That's a "back home" thing.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.138
We have a thick wheat flour
noodle that looks a lot

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.556
like this.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.516
Though, the ingredients
and preparation

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.185
are completely different.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.020
[LISCIA]
You don't say?

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.397
Then I think you should
have the first bite.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.523
Huh?

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.484
You've eaten something
a lot like this before,

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.777
so go ahead!

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.696
She's absolutely right!
After you, Your Majesty.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.743
In that case, Highness,
here you go.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.953
Yeah, thanks, but I don't.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.833
[SOUMA]
Well, I did give the others food

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.251
they weren't accustomed to.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.629
It's not fair if I'm the only
one who gets out of this.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.554
So, how'd it turn out, Souma?

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.849
It's way better than I expected!

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.523
I thought it would be
slimier and fishier,

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.275
but this is smooth and chewy.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.028
I'd say they're closer to
kudzu noodles than udon.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.113
But there's a unique
squeakiness to them.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.573
It's not bad at all!

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.201
[SOUMA slurping]

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.704
Then, I'll try it, too!

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.794
Wow, this is something else.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.678
Its texture is unlike
anything I've had before,

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.179
and I kinda like it!

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.562
And the soup really adds
a nice flavor to them.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.363
Wow, I can't believe
this came from a gelin!

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.739
That's amazing!

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.329
[CITIZENS chattering]

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.083
Unfortunately, that's all
we have for you today,

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.043
so it's time we thanked
everyone for tuning into

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.130
"The King's Brillunch"
and wrap things up here!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.508
I hope you enjoyed acting
as our host, Poncho dear!

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.428
Yes, although I'm afraid
it may be asking

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.097
a little bit too much
of me to do this again.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.265
Sorry.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.642
Someone please trade
places with me next time.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.604
My, I certainly hope there
is a next go around!

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.938
What do you say, Majesty?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.734
Only if the people demand it.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.027
Well, there you have it.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.279
It would be wonderful if there
were some demand,

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.530
don't you think?

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.450
Oh, I guess, but I'm not gonna
hold my breath or anything.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.326
We'll see.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.078
Ah, don't be like that,
I can't wait to do this again!

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.915
N‐No, please,
I really don't want to!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.917
Goodbye, everyone!
And take care!

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.384
Who knew there would be
so much demand to keep

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.595
"The King's Brillunch"
running regularly?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.016
We have to at least
do a follow‐up now.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.060
[knocking]

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.227
Come in!

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:22.442
Marx wants me?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.276
Yes, sir.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.320
He says he has something
important to discuss.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.242
What's going on, Marx?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.328
Why are we having
to meet in here?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.164
Why not talk in the
state affairs office?

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.084
Do forgive me for interrupting
your busy schedule.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.628
But I wanted to discuss the
possibility of stepping down

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.671
as prime minister.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.883
No, you can't be serious!

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.219
The former King Albert
recognized Your Majesty's

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.722
talents and yielded the throne
to you without hesitation.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.849
I have given a considerable
amount of thought

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.185
to following his example.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.730
I have done what I can in your
service for as long as possible,

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.692
but I believe your needs
have outgrown my abilities.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:04.734
Unexpected.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.531
Have you thought
about a replacement?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.075
Hakuya has proven
himself most talented,

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.244
and deeply devoted
to the throne.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.955
I believe this man is the
perfect candidate to take over

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.332
my position as your
new right hand.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.959
He has my full support.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.216
So be it.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:31.344
The formal appointment will have
to wait for another meeting.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.345
But yes.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.264
I agree with you.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:38.435
My oh my, that certainly is a
huge weight off my shoulders.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.895
Now I will humbly accept
the retirement allowance

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.731
I'm owed for my many
years of service,

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.108
and perhaps purchase myself
a cottage in the country

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.110
where I can enjoy
the rest of my days.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.656
At least, that's what
I had been planning,

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.575
but I am well aware that
the national treasury

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.368
is still in dire straits.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.580
So, in lieu of my retirement,
and in service of the crown.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.832
I will remain at your side
and accept a salary

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.209
commensurate with
a new position.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.086
How 'bout that?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.255
You are a wise Minister.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.716
Even more than you
previously thought I was?

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.100
[MARX] I am more grateful for
Your Majesty's words just now

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.437
than I would be for
any monetary reward.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.855
Listen, Marx.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.108
It hasn't been very long
since I arrived in this world.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.027
There is much that I
still don't understand,

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.447
especially when it comes
to the customs of the court.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.616
I would like for you to act
as a consultant to help me

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.202
with that. Will you?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.870
Your wish is my command.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.956
[HAKUYA]
Sire.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.375
Although I haven't been
formally appointed yet,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.711
as your prime minister,
I have one suggestion

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.671
I'd like to put forward.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.215
What is it?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.424
Majesty.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.218
I think you should
take time off.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.260
Huh?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.525
Honestly, of all the things
Hakuya could have suggested,

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.027
why'd it have to be that?

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.821
I get that when the boss
won't take time off,

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.949
it makes it harder for
those under him to do so.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.909
But it still feels weird.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.123
If I had my druthers,

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.458
I would prefer that you
take a substantial break.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.628
An extended stay in a quiet
location outside the castle.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.922
But we don't have
time for that, do we?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.882
No, we do not.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.676
I figured as much.

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:37.053
All right, what do you
want me to do instead?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.721
Take the rest of the day away.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.223
And leave the grounds
before you're tempted

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.599
to continue working.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.103
I've made arrangements
to allow for your absence.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.815
Yeah, if I'm taking time away,
I'd rather stay in my room.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.775
I'm afraid that's not an option.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.153
Our objective here is to
have Your Majesty show off

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.280
that you are taking
a break from work.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.448
You need to enjoy this time
in a way that the castle

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.284
is able to see and appreciate.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.996
[SOUMA] I don't think you can
call that a real break, then.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.330
If I may, sir.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.875
Use this opportunity to take
Princess Liscia on a date

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.168
in the castle town.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.378
Uh‐‐! A "date"?

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.462
Oh, yes!

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.715
By deepening your intimacy
with her in that way,

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.426
it will surely hasten
your succession, sire!

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.386
Don't get ahead of ourselves!

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.723
But I guess it would be kinda
nice to go out together.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.725
So, what should we do
about an escort?

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.060
I think Aisha would be
the perfect choice.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.061
Brilliant, Hakuya!

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.105
With such a mighty warrior
to accompany them,

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.107
their safety is guaranteed!

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.109
Sure, but if it's supposed
to be a date,

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.486
should I really bring
another girl along?

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.405
You'll have a flower
in each hand!

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.199
I couldn't be more envious.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.366
[MARX]
Indeed!

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.826
Damn him!

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.162
He didn't mean that, right?

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.205
[LISCIA grunts]

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.956
Oh, just who I wanted to see.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.751
[AISHA yells]

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.880
[LISCIA yells]

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.765
[AISHA yells]

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.935
Sonic Wind!

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.192
[LISCIA]
Ice Sword Mountain!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.072
[AISHA]
That's nothing!

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.329
Not too shabby.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.915
I could say the same about you.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.751
Your guard is truly impressive.

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:35.129
[SOUMA] Is this how warriors
of this world always fight?

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.714
If they don't slow it down,
they're going to destroy

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.049
the whole castle!

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.011
Hey! Enough already, you two!

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.054
Your Majesty!

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.768
A date?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.144
Yeah.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.646
So's that a no?

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.524
Uh, it's not a no, but...

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.484
Knowing that Hakuya was
the one who proposed it

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.735
is a bit troubling.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.114
Yeah. I kinda had
the same feeling.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.491
But either way,
I do have free time.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.369
There's no reason we can't
go out somewhere, right?

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.954
I suppose not.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.414
Ooh! Sir!

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.916
In that case,
please come to our forest!

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.501
As much as I would like to,

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.670
I only have today, so we'll
have to go someplace

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.171
relatively close by.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.756
Oh.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.591
Yes, we would
need far more time.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.344
It's six‐days round trip
even by horseback.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.305
We'll plan to travel
some other time.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:28.558
I did go over how to carry out
the thinning, though, right?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.059
You did.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.686
But there are many
among the dark elves

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.813
who have always been
particularly inflexible

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.857
on skirting tradition.

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.067
They may take some convincing
to let their own people

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.820
cut down trees in the forest
we're meant to guard.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.697
‐‐See?
‐‐Ah.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.990
No, that makes sense.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.867
Those types are all over.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.827
That is why I would very
much like Your Majesty

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.621
to travel there and
rebuke them personally.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.998
Understood.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.125
We'll go as soon as time allows.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.501
Thank you very much.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.587
I have begged your indulgence,
so in exchange,

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.797
please use me as you see fit!

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.592
Great. I actually do
have a favor to ask.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.844
Sire! Yes!
Shall I to bed?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.262
Why would you assume that?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.348
Because I just finished
offering myself to you,

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.016
was that not clear?

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.267
Souma.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:14.354
Hey, don't give me that look,
you know I wouldn't!

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.606
I just wanted to ask if
she would be our escort

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.733
down in the castle town today.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.027
Uh, wait, you don't really
want me to come along

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.570
on your date, do you?

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.697
If Liscia and I go alone
and something happens

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.575
to one or both of us,
we'll be in big trouble.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.869
And when I say "date,"
we're really just having a look

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.288
around town, so no worries.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.290
Well I, for one,
am a little concerned.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.294
It's nothing, forget it.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.802
[SOUMA] So this is a
military academy uniform.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.429
[LISCIA]
Sorry to keep you.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.271
Hey, those glasses are
really working for you.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.940
Oh, you think so?

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.900
Well, thank you.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:04.195
Your Majesty! How do I
look in uniform, sir? Huh?

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.491
[SOUMA]
Um...

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.119
Uh, it's not a great
match for you.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.703
[gasps]

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.247
Why not, sire?

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.790
How can I put this?

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.042
I guess it doesn't exactly
mesh with the mental image

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.710
I have of dark elves.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.712
What image of dark
elves do you have?

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.673
Do you think I should be
wearing more or less?

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.342
Would you rather I wore only
my flesh out with you, perhaps?

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.010
[SOUMA]
No, hang on, I didn't mean that!

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.012
I have no idea what
you're imagining, Souma,

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.681
but you're crazy if you
don't think she looks good

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.141
like this.=

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.892
I knew I liked you, Princess!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.270
All right, let's observe some
personal boundaries.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.277
It won't be long before
we're in town.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:46.487
Remember, once we set foot
outside this carriage,

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.490
you and I are no longer
the princess and the king.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.492
We're simply students
at the academy.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.035
Yes, hence the uniforms.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.246
We can keep a low
enough profile like this.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.290
You can count on me,
Your Majesty.

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.624
Another thing.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.626
We're undercover, so you
shouldn't call me that.

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.421
Oh! Of course, but what
should I call you instead?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.631
You can just call me by my name.

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:07.717
Or if you prefer, you can
use my given name,

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:08.759
Kazuya.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.222
Souma, I thought that Souma
was your given name.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.557
Uh‐‐

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.018
No, that's obviously
my family name.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.394
My name's Kazuya.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.314
But you're "Souma Kazuya,"
are you not?

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:22.940
Yeah, Souma Kazuya.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:26.819
[SOUMA]
That's right!

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.488
Given names come
first in this country,

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:29.947
like they do in the west!

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.494
N‐No chance I can go ahead
and correct that, is there?

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.037
It's unlikely.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.789
Your official documents probably
all have Souma Kazuya

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.541
written on them already.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.168
Oh, come on!

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.670
I cannot believe I screwed up
my own name that badly.

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:47.381
I don't think it's
that big of a deal.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:48.299
Here we go.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.842
We can switch back
and forth depending on

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.761
where we are at the time.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.346
So when we're out
in public like this,

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:54.805
I can call you Kazuya.

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.893
I'm sorry you have
to cover up my mess.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:16:59.810
I'm happy to do it!

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:03.272
What exactly is your perception
of me in this moment?

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.025
I'm not really sure.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.944
The slacker dark elf?

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.472
I've only ever seen this town
when I've passed through

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:37.557
on horseback.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.935
Getting to walk around and
explore is actually refreshing.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.728
It's been a nice break
in the monotony.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:45.731
Lord Kazuya!

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:46.732
What's up?

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.900
Something wrong?

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.570
No. But I am getting
quite hungry.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.612
[stomach growls]

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.949
In that case,

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.410
how about we go get something
to eat at Juna's cafÃ©?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.333
[bell chimes]

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.835
Well, if it isn't Your Maje‐‐

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.503
Good day, Miss Juna!

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.548
It's been a long time,
so I do hope you remember me.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.049
But if not, I'm Kazuya,

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.469
the son of the silk crepe dealer
in the kingdom of Echigo.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.390
Ah! Yes, of course I
remember you, Kazuya!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.058
How could I ever forget?

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.185
Your father is doing
quite well, I hope?

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.437
Oh, yes.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.022
Although there was quite
a scene when Mother

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.190
finally learned of
his unfaithfulness.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.775
I can imagine!

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.986
I do hope you're more mindful
of how you treat women

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.446
than he is, dear.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.325
[SOUMA]
I'm glad she caught on so fast.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.618
Thank goodness for Juna.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.415
Mmm. I'm still surprised at
how much I like this stuff.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.959
So, has gelin udon already
become an official part

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.002
of the menu?

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:48.836
It has!

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.254
You would not believe
the number of people

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.132
who've asked to try it
ever since the broadcast.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.217
And since it will still
be quite a while before

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.470
we recover from
the food shortage,

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.973
I'm so relieved to have such
an affordable new ingredient!

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.643
I promise we're doing
all that we can.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.311
Sorry if it's not enough yet.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.687
Oh, please!

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.731
I think you're doing
a wonderful job, Kazuya,

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:09.899
don't you fret.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.822
Why does it always seem
like you treat Juna

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:19.116
differently than everybody else?

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.284
Oh, yeah.

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:22.953
That's something that I...

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.248
...noticed earlier myself.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.750
It's nothing I can help.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.502
I get nervous when
I talk to pretty women‐‐

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:31.671
you don't have to point it out.

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.382
And Aisha, you can talk
or eat, but not both.

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.053
[SOUMA]
She's made her decision, folks!

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.179
You know, Miss Aisha,

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.473
the first time I saw you
in the royal castle,

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.934
you struck me primarily as
a gallant woman of action

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.852
who would never let
her guard down.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:50.564
But right now, you seem much
more like a harmless slacker.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.566
Hey! That's not true, is it?

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:54.235
[SOUMA, LISCIA]
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.445
From this angle, it looks like
you just want to outdo

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:58.114
Poncho at the gluttony game.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.740
Yeah, it makes you wonder
whatever happened

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:01.826
to that "gallant" Aisha of yore.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.787
Is it possible, although
I've offered my body

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.206
and soul to you,
you haven't asked me to bed

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.749
because of my appetite?

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.127
Why are we suddenly
talking about this again?

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.878
But either way, it's not
like I can do that

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.755
when I'm already engaged, so...

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.760
Uh, Souma?

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:20.761
Don't you know?

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.264
Polygamy is recognized
in this kingdom.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:25.015
Recognized and embraced.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.144
Sometimes women will take
multiple husbands, as well.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.895
But that's not as common.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.690
If you try to limit yourself to
one husband and one wife,

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.442
you run the risk of your
household dying out

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.860
rather easily.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.236
Sure. I guess.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.196
So why haven't I seen
any queen consorts

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.698
apart from Liscia's mother?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.241
Oh. That's because originally,

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.785
it was my mother who
held the royal power.

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.787
She's the daughter of
the previous king, you see.

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.415
Wait, so your father
married into the family?

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.291
[LISCIA]
Yes.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.168
He wasn't in charge of
any governmental affairs

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.961
until after they got married.

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.796
That's why he never downplays
my mother's involvement

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:59.258
on the throne, and why he
never took other consorts.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.134
Hang on.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.761
Then was it all right for him
to concede the throne

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.345
to me himself?

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:04.722
That wasn't a problem.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.308
My father got all the attention,
but he could never

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.894
have abdicated without
my mother's approval.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.062
I'm the only one with
a claim to the throne

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.064
and responsibility to
the bloodline, though.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.816
So I would eventually
have to take a husband

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.401
one way or another.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:20.154
In my father's case, there were
extenuating circumstances

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.281
that don't apply to you, Souma.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.201
If it's really what you wanted,
another wife would be...

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:27.953
...possible.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.997
But would you be
comfortable with that?

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.124
Truth be told, I wouldn't
be thrilled about it,

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.709
but I'm willing for there
to be up to eight,

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:35.085
including myself.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.378
So many!

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.964
Okay, so where'd you
pull that number from?

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:41.550
Well, I'd like to have you to
myself at least once a week.

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:42.676
Oh, right.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.221
I keep forgetting this world
has eight days in a week.

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.014
Wait, so if everyone
is assigned a day,

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.974
does that mean only
once per week?

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.435
Maybe, though I don't
think it has to mean that.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.437
If you and one of the
others invited each other

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.022
to your respective days.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.775
Ooh, that's true.
Nice looking out, Juna!

00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.945
Although, it is hard to pass up
some guaranteed time alone.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.780
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:06.575
[SOUMA] Come on, can we not talk
about this in public, please?

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:09.328
But I wonder what that
harem would be like.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.454
Eight wives.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.794
[KAEDE]
Out of the question!

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:22.007
And do not make
me repeat myself!

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.175
No, Hal!
