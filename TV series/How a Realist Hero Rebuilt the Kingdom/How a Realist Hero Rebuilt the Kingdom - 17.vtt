WEBVTT

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:39.164
This would be the first time
we've met face-to-face.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.959
I'm Souma Kazuya,
provisional king.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.002
Pleasure to finally meet you.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.047
I'm Georg Carmine,
former general.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.342
I wish to congratulate you
on your recent victory.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.469
It's hard to talk this way.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.720
Raise your head.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.784
[SOUMA sighs]

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.827
How is life in the dungeon?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.164
Since you asked,
surprisingly comfortable.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:46.208
Quite peaceful down here.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.918
[SOUMA]
Peaceful, huh?

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.461
That must be pretty convenient.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.632
Aren't you going
to meet with Liscia?

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.093
[GEORG] Has the princess
anything to say to me?

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:59.096
So far, she's mentioned nothing.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.389
[GEORG]
I see.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.974
Then I can only repeat
what I said when she first

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.519
asked to come see me.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.813
Why should you who's on
the cusp of becoming queen

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.565
show concern for an
enemy of the kingdom?!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.029
You don't convince me.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.281
But knowing
Liscia's personality,

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.701
she took your words seriously.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.203
Whenever I'm around her,
she won't speak about you.

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.247
She's also thrown
herself into her work,

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.957
like she's trying
to distract herself.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.420
While she's acting like
it doesn't bother her,

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.171
I know she's shaken up.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.257
Following your ultimatum,

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.385
I proceeded to say my
farewells to the princess.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.137
No further words were needed.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.974
[SOUMA] He's refusing to
see Liscia to protect her.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.685
Damn, the old man's stubborn.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.353
[GEORG] But since you're
here, there's a question

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.896
I would like to ask.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.856
Go ahead.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.858
What has become of my
comrades who were just

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.027
obeying orders and
followed us into rebellion?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.863
[SOUMA] The soldiers have
been cleared of any charges

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.823
of insurrection after
their exploits fighting

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.783
against Amidonia.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.452
And House Vargas?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.662
[SOUMA] The only ones I hold
responsible and will have to

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.665
answer for their crimes
are Castor and Carla.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.667
The Vargas Duchy
has been abolished,

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.628
but the eldest son, Carl, is
carrying on the family name,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.214
and he has been allowed
to inherit Red Dragon City.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:20.594
Answer me, what fate will
befall Castor and Carla?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.221
The two of them will be
tried by me, personally,

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.848
at a later date.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.516
[GEORG]
And the nobility?

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.310
After being stripped
of their family names

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.021
and having their lands and
possessions confiscated,

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.189
they were executed.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.149
The primary offenders
publicly so,

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:35.984
and those who were
implicated along with them,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.152
in private.

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.321
That was wise of you.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.490
[SOUMA] If they'd made
sure to sever all ties first

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.241
as you did, many
innocent relatives

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.619
wouldn't have experienced
a similar fate.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.623
Per royal law,
traitors and their kin

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.209
up to the third degree
shall be executed.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.085
Nothing you could have done.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.547
Corruption, graft, collaboration
with Amidonia.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.174
Crimes in their home.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.511
Best to stamp out the entire
rotten family tree.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.721
"Guilt by association" makes
the others accountable

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.516
for not stopping them
in the first place, right?

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.851
But isn't three degrees
a bit much?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.561
There was no other choice.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.356
Not only humans and
beastmen to consider,

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.566
but races with longer lives.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:20.695
As a result, the scope of their
association grows ever wider.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.658
Even so, too many innocent
people still end up dying!

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.118
I scrambled with Hakuya
till the last minute

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.120
and got the law revised
just in time to make it

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.330
two degrees.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.666
We also managed to get a
stay of execution for anyone

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.210
13 and under and have
the children safely taken in

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.003
by orphanages or churches.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.384
[GEORG] That was very
considerate of you.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.553
I do wonder, does it pain
you to have to take

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.429
the lives of others, Your Grace?

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.098
How could it be easy
at all for me?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.643
With a single order, countless
lives can be snuffed out!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.688
I'm crushed by the weight
of that responsibility.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.191
I was just an ordinary guy
up until half a year ago!

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.652
[GEORG] Liscia told me
about you in her letters.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.073
I hope she forgives
betraying her confidence.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.243
She praises your Grace
as a king among kings.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:11.288
She supports you, body and soul.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:15.000
Liscia's been instrumental
in helping me.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.918
Hopefully she forgives me, too,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.545
because I'm going to
have to make a decision

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.797
that will cause her grief.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:21.965
The fact is...

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.468
...I am going to
have to kill you.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.264
Your plan was spectacular--

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.058
Gather all the corrupt nobility
together in one place

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.979
and then scoop up their hidden
funds in one smooth action.

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.773
It was the best move
for the kingdom.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.194
Problem is it's a plan that can
never be public knowledge.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.031
[GEORG] I never assumed
that it would be disclosed.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.117
I cannot imagine the
situation being embraced

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.620
if the families of the fallen
learned I was working

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.373
with the King behind the scenes.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.250
[SOUMA]
And since no one can ever know,

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.627
you have to be
treated no differently

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.046
than the other corrupt noblemen.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.214
I always knew how it would end.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.677
You really are an idiot!
Do you know that?!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.137
You knew all of this beforehand,

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.057
and that you'd literally be
taking this secret to the grave!

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.433
You stubborn fool!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:22.651
Georg, is this really the only
way things could've played out?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.195
I don't buy this is how you
wanted things to end.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.822
Content having your name
tarnished and being locked up,

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.325
yes, in this cage, but also
in a suicide pact

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.618
with the nobles?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.455
How can you just sit there
looking so composed?

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.165
[grunts]

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.917
If only we had worked together!

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.460
We could have purged
the corrupt noblemen

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.003
on our own terms!

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.005
The same goes for Castor!

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.590
He believed you had
something in mind

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.217
for the betterment
of the kingdom!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.219
He was your friend,
loyal to the end,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.137
and became a traitor
because of it!

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.683
I had plans for you
to help this nation!

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.726
We were going to do
great things together!

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.436
And no, it's not lost on me.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.189
You solved several
problems in one swoop.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.274
Yes, the kingdom has
become more open now,

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.527
and Hakuya's and my
stock have risen!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.445
But what's the point
if it means losing you

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.822
in the process?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.907
You should know how
damaging it is in the long run

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.701
to lose good people!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.952
Tell me the truth, Georg!

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.705
Are you really content with
the direction this went?

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.626
Yes, of course.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.422
For an ancient tree like me,

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.716
that is destined to only
grow older and continue

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.467
withering until death,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.054
if a new sprout is able
to emerge from the roots,

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:37.058
I only pray that sapling
grows to be mighty in size.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.728
[SOUMA] Even if, as a
result, that large tree

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.688
ends up falling to the ground?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.524
[GEORG] One day, Your Majesty
will experience the joy

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.735
of seeing the next generation.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.362
Of the strength they carry.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.114
You may not understand,

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.867
but you will when you
and Liscia have a child.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.457
[SOUMA sighs]

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.375
I want you to be honest.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.086
Did you think up this
elaborate plan by yourself?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.172
What is that supposed to mean?

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.258
You have a strangely high
opinion of me, is all.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.635
You are leaving
a lot in my hands.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.220
You trust me to
take care of Liscia,

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.389
whom you think of as a daughter.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.267
Not to mention the
future of the kingdom.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.644
Seems a bit odd no
matter how you cut it.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.898
So where does this unwavering
loyalty come from?

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.525
[GEORG] If I told you I learned
of your extraordinary talent

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.943
from her letters,

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.404
would that leave
you dissatisfied?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.989
You know my answer.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.451
You expect me to believe
that's what makes you loyal?

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.787
If you were going
to martyr yourself,

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:42.332
it'd be for the
Elfrieden royal family.

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:46.211
Your entire plan-- was it
carried out under their orders?

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:48.963
[GEORG]
I remain silent.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.423
[SOUMA]
You will answer me.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.217
Stop playing games!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.928
What do they--
what do you know, exactly?

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.266
You're not going to tell me
no matter what, are you?

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.560
[GEORG]
When the time finally arrives,

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.772
they will reveal the truth
to His Grace themselves.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.746
[SOUMA]
A flask of poisoned wine.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.165
If there's one thing I can't
bear, it's seeing a man

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:28.086
publicly executed who sacrificed
himself for his country.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.754
[GEORG]
Thank you.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.714
[SOUMA] I'll recommend the same
for those who would sacrifice

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.716
themselves for you.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.093
[GEORG]
Huh?

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.428
Sacrifice themselves for me?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.973
Several members of
senior staff in the army,

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.642
including your own
second-in-command, Beowulf.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.562
They are requesting the same
sentence that you've received.

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.480
Loyal to the end.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.566
Why are people so eager to die?

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.702
Highness. I have one
final request.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.163
Take utmost care of
the princess for me.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.706
You don't have to ask.

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:08.001
Liscia's my family now.
I will protect her.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.503
No matter what the future
holds, she'll be safe.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:14.215
That is one conviction I can
assure you will never change.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:17.302
It's a relief to hear
you say that.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.054
I'll be praying for
the glory of Elfrieden,

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.515
for you and Liscia's happiness,

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.726
even if it's from
beyond the grave.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.771
I've said all. Farewell.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.179
[SOUMA]
Georg is no longer with us.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.391
I see.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.908
[HAKUYA]
Much appreciated, Jeanne.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.867
I mean it.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.494
You even went out of
your way to send it

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.537
via gryphon cavalry.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.623
[JEANNE] Using this,
the kingdom and the empire

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.458
can contact each other whenever.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.085
Naturally, I put a rush on it.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.965
Regarding the proposals,
my sister gladly agreed

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.259
to all of the ones we discussed.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.886
I've never seen her
like this before.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.930
She was quite pleased
after our talks.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.724
[HAKUYA]
You mean, beyond the proposals?

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.519
My sister can share her
values with someone now.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.981
More so, she's found someone
who understands her.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.315
So have we.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.359
[JEANNE] With all that's
happening, I'd like to arrange

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.486
a virtual conference
between King Souma

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.488
and my sister as
soon as possible.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.115
[HAKUYA]
Yes, by all means.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.908
[JEANNE] Not to change the
subject, but I can't help

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.578
noticing you're surrounded by a
mountain of books, Hakuya.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.663
Oh, those.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.498
They're the tomes Van
gave us as collateral

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.875
until all the
reparations are paid.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.502
Before we return them,
there are a few things

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.088
we'd like to copy
from their pages.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.923
Prior to our conversation,
I was in the process

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.883
of sorting through them.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.844
Meaning you're going
through and organizing them

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.387
by yourself?

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.972
You have a real
passion for reading.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.183
I just get lost thinking
about everything

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.019
I've learned from them.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.061
So listen.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.605
The imperial library needs
a good chief librarian.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.983
Would you come to
our country for the job?

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.736
I have to confess, that idea
does sound rather appealing,

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.195
and if I weren't the
Prime Minister,

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.489
I'd leap at the chance
without hesitation.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.241
[JEANNE]
I take it that's a no, then.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.201
[HAKUYA] As of right now,
I'd like to continue helping

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.329
His Majesty usher
in this new era.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.956
Afterwards, when one of
his heirs takes the throne,

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.417
I'd like to retire, and become
a historian chronicling

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.419
this age.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.087
[JEANNE]
That sounds comfortable.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.674
Given the times, one could
consider it to be a luxury.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.217
[HAKUYA]
You may be right.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.678
Stepping down,
living a quiet life--

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.555
it might be too much to ask for.

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.143
I can't believe it's
already this hour.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.562
Whenever we converse,
it feels like only

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.397
a moment has passed, Hakuya.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.441
I feel the same way,
but I never regret the time

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.151
we get to spend talking.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.413
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
Prime Minister Hakuya.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:33.706
How is it coming?

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.834
[MYSTERIOUS MAN] Everything
is going well. However...

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.295
Recently, it's as if things
are moving forward

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.922
a little too smoothly.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.925
Almost like there is
a force at work here,

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.427
an entity that is guiding
events from the shadows.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.515
[HAKUYA]
As if it's someone else's will.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.647
Nothing in this one, either.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.986
Maybe that really
was the only book

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.739
mentioning the Amidonian
Royal Family tree.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:08.032
What a shame.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.080
[laughs]

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.998
A drawing of a bronze racoon.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.708
Such personality.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.461
There is no shortage of
talent among Amidonia.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:21.754
Truly.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:29.178
Protest as much as you want,
you simply cannot go out yet.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.888
Now stop that.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.850
Do you have eyes in the back
of your head or something?

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.854
Because if you did, we would
be safe leaving this room.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.606
Look. I don't wish to use
your words against you,

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.442
but you said we needed
to lay low until things

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.068
in Van settle down.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.487
Obviously, I'm right,
it's just so boring

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.614
being cooped up inside here!

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.241
[COLBERT] If you're looking
for something to do,

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.660
please start thinking
about Amidonia's future.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.912
[ROROA] When you talk about
where it goes from here,

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:59.083
I suppose that includes picking
my future husband, huh?

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.294
[ROROA chuckling]

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.380
[COLBERT] Whoever ends up
taking Princess Roroa's hand

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.924
in marriage has my
deepest sympathies.

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.470
[MARX]
May I present, Glaive Magna!

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.346
Your loyalty to the
kingdom has been truly

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.973
remarkable and unwavering.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.517
And as a reward for your
service to Elfrieden,

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.188
you are hereby granted Randel
and the surrounding territory.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:23.065
[GLAIVE]
Sire! You are much too generous!

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.067
[MARX] Furthermore, you are
provisionally granted

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.737
a portion of the authority
held by Army General

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.614
Georg Carmine.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.574
You are to maintain
the troops until they are

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.202
reorganized into the
kingdom's defense force.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:35.244
[GLAIVE]
Yes, sire.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.623
I shall endeavor to live up to
His Majesty's expectations.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.041
I am honored.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.250
Moving along.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.836
Aisha Udgard!

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.338
Who? Not me?

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:52.220
Aisha Udgard, for your
service, you are formally--

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.679
Sire?

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.097
Aisha.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:58.476
You are hereby granted the rank
of the King's Personal Guardian.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.353
Yes, sire.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.689
Wodan Udgard, from the
God-Protected Forest.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.487
Even as you were dealing
with the disaster recovery,

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.989
you were good enough
to dispatch reinforcements.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.157
Not at all.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.743
We dark elves wished
to repay your kindness.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.620
It was the least we could do.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.539
I'd still like to show
appreciation for the troops

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.998
you sent.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.376
If there's anything you desire,
all you have to do is ask.

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:26.379
In that case,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.464
I have one request
of Your Majesty.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.174
[SOUMA]
Hm?

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.719
Sire, would you accept my
daughter's hand in marriage?

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.638
[SOUMA]
Wha--

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.348
Father, please!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.558
My word!

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.519
[WODAN] King Souma, would
you take her to be your wife?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.563
Well, it's quite
a simple matter.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.314
Give the word and Aisha
will take on the role

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.024
as your second queen.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.026
Uh, let's slow down here a sec.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.529
Are you sure her marrying
me is something you want?

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.908
As her father,
my feelings are complicated.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.119
However, it may be her wish.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.920
[SOUMA]
Aisha is great.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.089
If it's a question of asking
myself whether I'd want her

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.966
as a wife or not,
I would, but...

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.811
Souma, stop wasting
time and just say yes.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:27.064
Huh? You're all right
with this, Liscia?

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.941
It's all part of being a ruler.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.651
There will be times where
you may have to marry

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:33.154
the daughters of aristocrats
or foreign princesses

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.656
to strengthen bonds
between different nations.

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.783
When that happens,
I'd prefer if the higher-ranked

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.536
queens were people I know
well and we can trust.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.123
Yeah, okay, but still.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.625
How is it that you can
make tough decisions

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.168
when the kingdom is on the line,

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.337
but you're so indecisive
when it comes to women?

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.923
I'll handle this.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.300
Hey, Aisha!

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.760
[AISHA]
What? Yes?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.846
I have no intention of giving
up the throne as first queen.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.015
Can you live with being second?

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.434
If so, then I have no objection.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.061
In fact, I welcome you.

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.145
I agree!

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.230
As long as it means
being at the King's side!

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.363
Right, so, um...

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.324
Aisha, would you
like to marry me?

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.662
Of course! The answer's yes!

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.748

[MARX]
Presenting Juna Doma!

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.094
Because of your achievements--

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.887
Your Majesty, I beg of you.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.806
[EXCEL]
May I have a moment, please?

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:50.189
I ask you to forgive
my sudden outburst.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.942
Permission to speak freely,
Your Majesty?

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.026
[SOUMA]
Permission granted.

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.903
Thank you for
granting me the floor.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:59.407
Let me start by saying, yes,
Juna is my granddaughter.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:03.077
However, Juna's father is
the son-in-law of the Domas,

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.329
a merchant family
from Lagoon City.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.331
In short, not nobility.

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:11.001
As such, Juna is of
commoner lineage.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.505
I'm not sure I'm following.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:18.300
Listen, it's clear you're
using your position

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.678
to save Castor and his daughter.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.096
But I have to, Grandmother!

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.517
You have no involvement
with House Vargas

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.311
or their affairs and mustn't
use your achievements

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.439
for people you've never met.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.316
Do not plead for the life
of Castor and his daughter.

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.776
If I don't, they'll be--

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.198
Your Majesty.
I have a proposition.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.408
What is it?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.578
I-If at all possible,
my sole desire

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.080
is to join Princess
Liscia and Aisha,

00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:50.875
and to sing henceforth
at Your Majesty's side.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.501
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:54.712
[SOUMA] Don't tell me,
she's talking about asking for

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.839
my hand, too?

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.048
How fortunate!

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.550
By making Juna Doma
your consort--

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.637
I can't, and I'm sorry,
but it's just impossible.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.389
At least, for the time being.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.481
You are the Gemstone
program's Prima Lorelei,

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.733
immensely popular
with the people.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.984
What would happen
if it were announced

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:18.861
you were engaged?

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.863
Violence would break
out across the capital.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.907
[OFFICIALS]
Ah.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:25.743
That's why I'm asking
you wait a while.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:30.289
The program, it still needs
its Prima Lorelei Juna.

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:33.083
For now, continue being
the people's songstress.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.086
I'm asking you as
a personal favor.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.756
You believe I'm the
voice of the people?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.966
After we've brought
in more singers,

00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:44.845
and we have others who can
carry on the tradition, then...

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:47.389
...I promise.
I will take your hand.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.605
I'll eagerly be awaiting
that day, Your Majesty.

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:34.330
[NOBLEMAN A] This hero king has
certainly built up momentum.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:37.249
We have no choice but
to do as he demands,

00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:39.543
for now, lest we
get caught up in it.

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.462
[NOBLEMAN B] We'll operate
in the shadows, even as we

00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.963
obey his orders.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.132
[NOBLEMAN A] Together,
we will keep a low profile,

00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.469
so as not to get caught,
while controlling this country

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.179
from behind the scenes.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.223
