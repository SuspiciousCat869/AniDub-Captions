00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.261
[NARRATOR] Our story jumps
backward now to the time

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:14.556
before Souma Kazuya
was summoned to this world.

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:16.475
Until then, Parnam, the capital,

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.436
had expanded unabated and
in an unplanned fashion,

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.397
its streets zigzagging
and winding chaotically.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.566
Souma re-laid main
roads and rebuilt the city

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.694
to make rapid shifts
in logistics possible.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.613
He also built water
and sewage systems

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.617
and initiated efforts
to beautify the city.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.452
Furthermore,
he made improvements

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.038
to public sanitation
by ordering the construction

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.250
of large sedimentation
basins for sewage treatment.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.585
During the project's
excavation phase,

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.837
workers discovered
various bones:

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.090
the remains of
gargoyles, giants,

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.841
and countless other monsters.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.094
The bones of a dragon
were found among them.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.304
However, just as they were
to be transported

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.181
to the Royal Academy for study,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.016
they mysteriously
turned up missing.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.354
[SOUMA] Genia, you were
behind that stunt?

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.398
I'm terribly sorry about this.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.567
But that happened such
a long time ago.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.777
We would have forgotten
if you hadn't said anything.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.612
Why even bring it up now?

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:13.824
I take all responsibility for
bringing it to your attention.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.450
I was sorting through
some of my papers,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.035
and I found this
note among them.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.954
I felt I had to say something.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.206
[SOUMA] "Dear Lu,
I'm taking the dragon bones.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.250
Handle all the details
for me, will ya?

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.502
Thanks, Genia." Ah.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.421
You just found that note?

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.089
Took you long enough, Lu.

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.882
You're the one who decided
to steal dragon bones

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.343
and leave me that dumb note.
I don't wanna hear it!

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.846
I didn't steal them.
I took them for research.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.848
That's what the note
was for, you dunce!

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.183
Could you save the couple's
squabble till later?

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.061
W-W-W-We are not a couple!

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.855
So you don't want to
get married anymore?

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:45.731
That was fast.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.982
No, I didn't say that.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.484
I meant that we're not
a couple as of yet.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.944
So, um, what did
you intend to do

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:52.863
with the dragon bones, anyway?

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.740
I thought you would never ask!

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.714
Now, this one's
name is Mechadra.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.382
It's a mechanical dragon
I cobbled together

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.884
from whatever I could find:
monster components,

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.804
mystery parts I discovered
in dungeons and whatnot.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.306
All patched onto
the dragon skeleton.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.727
[SOUMA] Monster components
and dungeon mystery parts?

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.563
Yikes. I have a bad
feeling about this.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.690
This thing isn't going
to start rampaging, is it?

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.774
[GENIA laughs]

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.276
It doesn't even move
to begin with,

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.945
let alone have the ability
to rampage, Mister King!

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.405
[SOUMA]
Huh? It doesn't?

00:03:58.447 --> 00:03:59.281
[GENIA]
Of course not.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.199
There's no critical
system relaying orders

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.536
to each part to make
them move in concert.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.122
In that case, why did you
make it in the first place?

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:08.957
It's an experiment
to study how the joints

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.377
of living things are constructed
and how they work, of course!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.130
Look. See how smoothly
and easily this part moves

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:16.673
with barely any force?

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.509
It's enormous, but even
I am able to do it!

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.094
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.554
Impressive, but still.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.473
Genia, what manner
of foul monstrosity

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:25.932
have you created this time?

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.601
If the Star Dragon Mountain
Range finds out,

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.770
it could cause an
international incident.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.063
Seriously?

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.523
[SOUMA] Remind me to
send a letter of apology

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.484
to the Star Dragon
Mountain Range.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.152
Maybe we should start
brainstorming a plan

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.070
to rebury the bones,
or have someone go

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.781
and transport them back there.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.460
Whoa, there, Mister King!

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.086
What'd you do to
make that happen?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.880
Souma, you used
your Living Poltergeist

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.548
on that thing, didn't you?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.634
Caught me. I was just
a little curious.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.223
I knew it! My calculations
were correct, after all!

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.058
Take a look, Lu.
I told ya so!

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.810
See how smooth
the movements are?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.229
That was never the
issue with this, Genia!

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.396
As for you, Your Majesty,

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.440
moving around a mechanical
dragon all willy-nilly

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.400
like that could very well
be taken as a threat

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.985
to other nations!

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:22.656
He has a point.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.825
How would one
weaponize this thing?

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.202
[SOUMA] Does the Mechadra
have any armaments?

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.412
Not even I am crazy
enough to deliberately arm

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.541
a model made out of dragon
bones and monster parts.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.377
That means there really
isn't any way to use it.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.170
It sucks to have something
that other countries

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.464
would be wary of,
but it doesn't have to be

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.508
completely useless, does it?

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.763
For the time being, we had
better treat the Mechadra

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.849
as a top-secret internal matter,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.350
and keep it locked
down till we hear from

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.185
the Star Dragon Mountain Range.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.395
[GENIA]
Huh?

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.814
Consider yourself lucky you
aren't being thrown in a cell!

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.024
Genia Maxwell, we're going
to build you a high-tech

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.901
state research lab.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.487
I will be leaving the theme of
your research there up to you.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.905
Mean it, Mister King?

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.448
I do, but you're going
to have to provide

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.409
ten percent of the funding.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.994
Ten percent, really?

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.996
As the patron who has been
funding all her research

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.539
up to this point,

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.165
I would be humbled and
grateful if you would pay

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.084
the whole amount, Your Majesty.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.669
What if I agreed to that?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.088
There's just no telling what
she'd start researching.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.390
[CROWD A] The Poncho
Bridge got demolished!

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.975
[CROWD B] Huh?
But it was so convenient

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.685
when I had to go shopping!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.478
[CROWD C] Things have
been a lot more austere

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.731
since Prince Julius returned.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.734
The Gemstone Broadcasts
have been prohibited, too.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.361
And now food is being
rationed, as well.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.572
I don't have enough
to feed my children.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.574
[CROWD D] I hate to tell you,
but the word on the street

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.869
is that even those rations
are about to get reduced.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.787
--[CROWD E] Wha-?
--[CROWD F sighs]

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.790
I wish His Majesty Souma
would occupy us again.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.130
[JULIUS] You're telling me
the people are discontent?

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.506
Well, that's only
because I've put a stop

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.634
to Souma's lax public morals.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.345
A breach in the levee starts
with a single ant hole.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.264
Control the people,
lest they get dangerous ideas.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.266
If they're unhappy,
they can blame Elfrieden

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.061
for demanding such
outrageous reparations.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.354
Blaming the state?

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.022
Shows how much they know.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.857
[door opens]

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:21.900
What now?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:28.281
Huddles, Lord of Galua.
That's who you are, isn't it?

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.158
Your Highness,
help us, I beg you!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.786
There-- There has
been an uprising!

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.954
A what?

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.082
As you know, Galua lies on
the outskirts of the country.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.750
We don't have enough
food to feed the people,

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.753
and some of them are even
starving to death of late.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.881
Their discontent has erupted
into outright bedlam!

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.007
Funny.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.635
As I recall, Lord Huddles,
you refused to put your faith

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.720
in the young prince,
and you foolishly chose

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.431
to reinforce your troops
on your own instead.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.891
You can sleep in
the bed you made

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.184
and defend yourself.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.103
But Your Highness,
the longer the riots go on,

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.938
the more likely it is
that discord will spread

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.940
to other quarters
of the principality!

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.733
Besides, if you make
a show of strength now,

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.819
then perhaps, ah...

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.820
Hmm.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.865
I shall take lead of
our forces and crush

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.617
the rebellion in Galua!

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.749
Your Majesty, play with us!

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.501
Yeah, Your Majesty!

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.502
Pardon, Sire.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.838
I'm happy that you are
entertaining Rou and the others,

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.965
but don't you have more
important things to do?

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.174
It's all right.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.844
I actually don't have anything
pressing to do at the moment.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.637
Oh, well, in that case,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.431
you two can keep on
playing with His Majesty

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.057
to your hearts' content!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.183
Okay!

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.311
Careful, now, I am the king.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.940
[CARLA]
This is quite the sight, Master.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:47.027
Whoa. You are throwing stones
in a glass house, Carla.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.576
You look creepy in that, like
a clown in a business suit.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.327
Yes, I'm aware of that!

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.788
I feel self-conscious as it is!

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.083
And isn't that skirt really
kind of short on you?

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.960
Stop looking at me!

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.756
Th-The head chambermaid,
she made me wear this.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:08.715
Ah, right.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.217
So, this is what
Serina's into, then.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.094
You finish your
chambermaid training yet?

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.471
My-- my "training"?

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.181
Ugh!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.849
Did I say something bad?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.311
That woman, she whipped me,
like with a real whip.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:22.854
Hold up, what?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.689
It gets worse.
It was a special whip,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.275
enchanted with
some kind of magic.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.611
It didn't leave a mark on me,
though the lashes burned my skin

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:30.612
like fire!

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.865
[SERINA] The whip is love
and love must be accepted.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.705
[SOUMA] Carla's one of the
toughest fighters I know,

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:44.501
so if she's scared of this lady,
then you know it's rough.

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.377
--Now, Carla.
--Yes?

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.546
I seem to remember asking
you to kindly make up

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.590
His Majesty's bed in his office.

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.383
But I couldn't possibly
collect the sheets

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.553
of a man I actually know.
It's too much!

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.305
What are you talking about?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.057
If you are to be a real
chambermaid, then,

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.767
when His Majesty and
the princess (bleep),

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.937
and their sheets are soiled
(bleep) of their (bleep)--

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.189
Okay, kids, let's
go play over here!

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.774
[KIDS]
Okay.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.948
I see.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.700
So, did they put down
the uprising, then?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.952
They did.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.328
Rather brutally.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.664
I'd venture to guess Julius
wanted to make an example

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:23.998
of them.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.292
[SOUMA] That's a
misguided show of force.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.419
Cruelty will only serve
to create further unrest

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.213
among the people.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.549
Hakuya, what did
the emissary from Van

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.050
have to say?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:37.095
The people's representative
from Van sent this.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.977
"We, the good citizens of Van,

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:46.855
profess our true allegiance
to the Kingdom of Elfrieden,

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.565
and request reinforcements"?

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.657
Souma, did you know
this would happen?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.326
I will admit,
I anticipated some movement.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.745
But I have no idea
what the people of Van

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.790
really want or what
they might do next.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.584
Now, since we have
received a formal request

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.670
for aid, yes,
the kingdom will accept it.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:12.046
Send reinforcements.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.806
Damn it!

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.683
To think Van would betray me!

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.560
The very city of my birth!

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.187
Those filthy ingrates!

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.480
Wagging their tails and
begging scraps from Souma

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.857
like mangy curs!

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.693
My lord, there's news!

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.111
The grand nobleman
Lord Cutlass

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.697
has turned traitor to the
Amidonian Royal Family.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.574
He's rebelling!

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.825
Lord Cutlass?

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.038
[SUBORDINATE B] Lord Schadler
took in the people who fled

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.040
from Galua, and now
defies our request

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.208
for their return.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.376
He is revolting
against Your Highness!

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.712
The nobles loyal to Roroa
are banding together

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.423
and demanding
Your Highness's abdication!

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:56.633
[SUBORDINATE C]
Lord Schadler?

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.009
[SUBORDINATE D]
He's rebelling?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.887
[SUBORDINATE E] The people are
rising up and moving on Galua!

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.597
I've lost control?

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.681
What's happening?

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.144
I see.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:11.189
So, Julius' forces have
turned against him.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.150
It's simply impossible to put
down rebellions like these,

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.903
especially when they
are all occurring at once.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:20.031
Allegedly, Julius has taken
a small force with him.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.242
Sources say they've
fled to the empire.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.954
So far, everything is going
exactly as we expected.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.872
Might things be going too well?

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.500
You mean the
uncoordinated rebellions?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.168
We never counted
on that happening,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.671
and it's mildly
concerning, indeed.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.047
Is it like you said?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.882
That there's some
other will at work?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.689
[NARRATOR] After Julius' exile,
Amidonia was a state

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.607
without a leader.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.819
Surrounding nations scrambled
for control of Amidonia:

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.488
the Lunarian Orthodox Papal
State to the north,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.157
and the Republic of
Turgis to the south.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.493
Zem, The Mercenary
State to the west,

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.870
showed no sign of invading,
attempting instead

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.248
to maintain their
perpetual neutrality.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.000
They did, however,
send mercenaries

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.127
to the other two countries.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:16.212
The Lunarian Orthodox
Papal State is home

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.464
to the Lunarian Orthodox Church,

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.175
which worships the
moon goddess Lunaria.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.177
It is a religious movement
whose pope presides

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.055
over both church and state.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.475
In response to the rebellion in
the Principality of Amidonia,

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.978
the Lunarian State dispatched
forces along their border

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.147
with Amidonia to
defend the adherents

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.232
within their nation.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.860
Another fact of note:
the Republic of Turgis

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.486
was a bitterly cold nation.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.530
The southern
peninsula in particular

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.241
was bound by ice and
snow for most of the year,

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.368
and its leaders had
long coveted all nearby,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.495
more temperate territories.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.623
So, the principality found
itself in utter disarray

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.792
and vulnerable to invasion.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.086
Fortunately, Turgis'
forces were halted

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.839
by the brave fighting of
the aged General Herman

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.300
who boasted a century
of experience in war,

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.510
and was the lord of Nelva,
a fortified city

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.636
in the South.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.348
However, how long
could this peace last?

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:11.768
The Principality of Amidonia,
without its crown prince,

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.687
was still in quite a
precarious position.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.356
So, they want the
Kingdom of Elfrieden

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:19.025
to annex the
entirety of Amidonia?

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.109
Yes, sire.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.986
General Herman
Neuman requests it,

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.821
but it's a joint plea,
from Neuman

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.199
and the former
finance minister--

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.368
You may remember,
Gatsby Colbert.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.620
I guess it makes sense
from their perspective.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.038
They would all rather
give themselves over

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.624
to the kingdom than end up
divided and conquered.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.626
If General Herman,
the one who stopped Turgis

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.837
in its tracks, and Colbert,
the former finance minister,

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.131
both strongly
support annexation,

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.509
then I doubt anybody
would oppose them.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.096
Hakuya, could this be
that "other will" at work?

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.514
[HAKUYA]
I can't be certain.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.265
So, what are we going to do?

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.102
I was afraid you were
gonna ask me that.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.978
There would be many
foreseeable downsides

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.022
in annexing Amidonia.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.525
We might as well look
for the upsides, though.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.819
Population growth,
which, in the long run,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.321
would increase our
strength exponentially.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:08.658
Furthermore, Amidonia
is rich in material resources.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.701
We could look forward to
a stable supply of those.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.457
Now let's talk
about the downsides.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.709
First, there's the
food shortage crisis.

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.254
I thought that things
were going well in Van?

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.090
Yes, but that's
one city of many.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.884
When you consider all
of Amidonia as a whole,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.220
it would be a lot to ask of us
when we barely solved

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.014
our own food crisis.
It worries me.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.810
That said, it was a hostile
nation just days ago,

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.855
so governing it could
prove to be difficult.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.107
Before this, the Union
of Eastern Nations

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.901
and Amidonia and the
Republic of Turgis

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.361
were the only countries
with whom we'd shared

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.529
a boundary.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.948
But now we would have
Zem and the Lunarian

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.534
Orthodox Papal State
as neighbors.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.703
And the more countries
we are adjacent to,

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.997
the more complicated
our diplomacy becomes.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.293
Also, while I really
wasn't counting on them

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.463
in the first place,
if we annex Amidonia,

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.339
then we won't be receiving
our war reparations

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.549
any longer.

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.511
So are you saying we
shouldn't annex them?

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.640
I would prefer not to
if I had another option,

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:18.311
but it appears that we have
no choice but to agree to it.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:21.022
If we refuse, it will
belie our justification

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:24.150
for integrating Van into the
kingdom in the first place:

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.569
that we did so at the
request of its people.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.865
We can't very well admit
Van while at the same time

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.034
excluding the rest
of the country.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.203
Also, if the people of
the city end up forsaking

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.538
their countrymen,
they'd be disenchanted

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.831
with the kingdom.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.833
Besides, if we left them
to the invading forces

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.085
of the Republic of Turgis
and the Lunarian Orthodox

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.338
Papal State, then our
own country would be

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:48.216
overrun with the
refugees, anyway.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.301
True, in that case, it's
better to take them all in

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.512
like this than as refugees.

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.680
So we can begin
looking after them.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.641
It may be a lot of work,
but in the long run,

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.726
I've no doubt it will pay off.

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:00.770
Seriously though, good grief.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.023
It's official, all Amidonia
shall be admitted

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.566
into the kingdom.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:07.944
Be sure all other
nations are aware.

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.070
[HAKUYA]
Yes, sire.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.155
The naval forces
under Excel's command

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.615
are to be deployed
along the border

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.992
with the Republic of Turgis,

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.036
where they'll stand ready
to attack at my word.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.207
[NARRATOR] With that,
the territories of Amidonia

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.876
were formally annexed into
the Kingdom of Elfrieden,

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:26.212
and the transition
was achieved peacefully,

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.547
without incident.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.551
Honorable Gatsby Colbert!

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.219
Yes, Sire!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.513
Sir Colbert,
I commend you uniting

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.848
the whole of Amidonia.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.102
If not for your efforts,
there'd be further strife,

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.812
and the people of Amidonia
would have suffered

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:45.189
a great deal of undue misery.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.234
Your words are too kind,
Your Majesty.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.278
Be that as it may, sire,

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.405
there is something that
I must deliver to you.

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:56.576
The Principality of
Amidonia's internal income

00:17:56.617 --> 00:18:00.705
and expenditure reports,
and documentation of rights.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.832
During the war, these
were kept hidden away.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:05.126
So they'd be safe
no matter the outcome.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.043
[SOUMA]
Hang on.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.879
Julius was put in charge of
the principality without those?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.632
I kind of feel sorry
for him now.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:13.926
That is an incredibly
generous gift.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.012
It will help me govern.

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:18.222
However, you should keep
them in your possession

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.932
and hear what
I have to say next.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:25.688
Former finance minister
of Amidonia, Colbert,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.649
are you willing to serve me?

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.526
Yes. Yes, sire.

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.153
Then I hereby declare you

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.238
finance minister of
the Kingdom of Elfrieden,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.116
and charge you with
maintaining its finances.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.576
A moment, please!

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.621
Don't you mean overseeing
Amidonia's finances?

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:44.999
You are finance minister
for the Kingdom of Elfrieden.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:48.586
[COLBERT] B-But sire,
I am still an Amidonian.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:49.962
It doesn't matter.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.797
Employing those who
are willing and qualified,

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.884
wherever they're from,
is now the Elfrieden way.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.844
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.263
Amidonia was less
wealthy as it posed.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.058
Then much of its budget
was funneled to the military.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:03.309
Yet nevertheless,

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.144
you kept the government
from bankruptcy,

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.521
which took great skill
and should be commended.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.815
I want people like
you on my side.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:14.070
Kingdom of Elfrieden
Finance Minister Colbert,

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.571
my thanks for these documents.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.658
I remit them to your possession
as tools of your trade.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.284
Take these all with
you and work hard

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.079
to rebuild the
lands of Amidonia.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.206
Sire. Thank you.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.083
Your wish is my
command, Majesty.

00:19:28.042 --> 00:19:29.335
[HAKUYA]
Herman Neumann!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.299
I commend you for stopping
the Republic of Turgis' army.

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.760
Without your valiant deeds,
our relief efforts

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.221
would not have made it,
and the situation

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.098
would have devolved into chaos.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.892
A warrior vows to
defend his people.

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:48.062
That remains true,
whether there is a ruler or not.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.689
I did nothing more
than what a soldier

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.399
is expected to do.

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.779
I, too, have a gift that
I would be privileged

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.489
to offer Your Majesty.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.908
However, once it has been given,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.119
I do hope that you will
choose not to return it.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.583
The southern region of
Amidonia has a thriving

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.878
wool industry and produces
the finest quality wool.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.297
These are bolts
woven from that wool.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:17.216
I do hope that you
will accept them.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.637
May I take a closer look?

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.222
I would truly be honored.

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:32.189
[SOUMA] This feels familiar.
Almost like carpeting.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:34.942
Carpeting?

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.196
A rug, given as a gift.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.448
Hang on a minute.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:44.160
I am positive I've heard of
a set-up like this before.

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.120
So tell me something, Herman.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.580
What is it, sire?

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.457
There wouldn't happen
to be a woman hiding,

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.792
rolled up somewhere in these
rugs, now, would there?

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:55.212
Seriously?

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.677
[ROROA]
Ah, man, no fair!

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:04.555
This was gonna be
the surprise of a lifetime!

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.599
You're no fun!

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.102
Leaping out, ready
or not, bum-ba-ba-bum!

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.520
Hey, I'm Roroa!

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.357
So what gave me away, huh?

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:16.692
I was really looking
forward to the look

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:17.902
on your face.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.488
[SOUMA] Oh, a woman in my
world did something similar

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:21.947
once upon a time.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.533
[ROROA] Gah! You mean I
stole someone else's act?

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.535
How embarrassing.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:27.661
[SOUMA]
Hers was a bit different.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.413
She was naked. You weren't.

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:30.998
Whoa, what kind
of woman was this?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.458
A sicko or something?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.667
Maybe, I dunno.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.586
Her beauty was widely
accepted to have changed

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.421
the course of history,
but legend has it

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.548
her nose was a bit
bigger than yours.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.050
Why would history have
changed because of

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.927
the size of some lady's nose?

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.846
Is that a euphemism for
her breasts in your world?

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:47.306
Just forget it.

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:49.308
So, may I call you Roroa?

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.101
You're Julius' sister, right?

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.353
Yes, I am.

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:54.897
I've got both beauty
and brains, by the way.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.024
And I am hands-down
the prettiest girl

00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.443
in like literally
all of Amidonia!

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:02.488
Oh, and yeah, you can
totally call me Roroa.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.573
But I am the daughter
of the former Amidonian

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:06.450
crown prince, Gaius VIII.

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:09.161
So my full name
is Roroa Amidonia.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.498
Nice to meet you, Roroa,
but what exactly

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.874
is your purpose here?

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.587
I came here to
marry you, obviously!

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.298
Oh, right, marry me, obviously.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.717
Wait, what?!
