00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.388
[NARRATOR] As Jirukoma departed
with his group of volunteers,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.224
leaving Friedonia behind them,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.061
his sister Komain took over
as chief of the settlement.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.063
Those traveling could
not shake their longing

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.315
for home and swore
to take back their lands,

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.484
by force, if necessary.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.361
While those who saw them
off kept their longing

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.572
for home in their hearts,
dreaming of restoring peace

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.743
to their nations while
remaining in a foreign land.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.037
Though their parting
was a sad one,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.332
at the same time,
it was their own decision.

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:21.558
I see you made it
to class on time.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.227
Oh. Yes, I'm wearing glasses.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.896
Not that I need them.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.773
They put me in the teacher mood.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.483
[AISHA]
Like a piece of armor?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.484
Indeed.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.904
For you see, this will be
your first of many lessons.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.991
So welcome to day one of
the Fiancée's Bridal Course.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.329
And your teacher will be
none other than myself,

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.665
the learned Excel Walter.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.836
To be candid, I've been
hoping for an opportunity

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.338
like this for quite a while,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.090
and when I heard His Majesty
say that he could

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.925
have children any time now,

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.386
I decided this would
be the perfect moment.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.846
After all, it won't be
long before all of you

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.348
will be mothers.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.893
As you are aware,
this Kingdom faced civil war.

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.978
Two generations ago
when the king died,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.022
a dispute arose over
who would succeed

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.273
to the throne.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.068
The royal family
was nearly wiped out.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.278
Under His Majesty Souma's rule,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.739
I trust nothing of the
sort will happen again.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:18.573
However!

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.450
You mustn't be complacent!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.619
If there is any breach
between king and queen

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.955
or between a queen and
one of the other queens,

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.916
someone will certainly
try taking advantage of it!

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.293
For the sake of the kingdom,

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.838
it is paramount for all
of you to establish

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.008
a harmonious
marital relationship!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.971
Thus, why a bridal training
course is so crucial!

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.807
Uh, but why are you
the one teaching us,

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.476
Duchess Walter?

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:50.021
Well, I have lived for
over 500 years now.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.066
And fallen in love with
a number of gentlemen,

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:55.736
none of whom I ever
parted with, mind you,

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.362
except through death.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:01.116
Not to mention I have also
borne each of them children.

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:04.286
Now it's my responsibility
to teach you as queens--

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.955
no, rather as individual women,

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:10.167
how to remain in harmony
with the man that you love.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.543
The art of being a wife,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.795
everything from
understanding the male mind

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:17.466
to ensuring a smooth married
life via the performance of,

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.010
shall we say,
nighttime "services."

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.097
I've already had
His Majesty Souma

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.974
take an individual
course with me.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.271
Now then, what does this mean
in both war and marriage?

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:34.107
Information is key if
you want to succeed.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.859
"Know yourself and the enemy,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.903
and you'll survive
a hundred battles".

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.614
As His Majesty is
always fond of saying.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:41.907
He's right.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.409
As long as you are aware
of how the other party

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.246
views you, you will always
know how to conduct yourself.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.333
Still though, sometimes it
is good to be unpredictable

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.503
and shake things up if you
ever find yourself in a rut.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.671
Know yourself, brides,
and the other party,

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.049
and your union
won't be endangered.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.053
Like I said.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.306
I met with the king,
along with a royal mage,

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:10.018
who secretly cast a confession
spell on His Majesty.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.687
This notebook contains
the information I got

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.023
out of him during that session.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:22.447
All right.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.158
I will now read how
His Majesty Souma

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.119
sees each of his future
queens, one-by-one.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.581
First, Roroa.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.209
I'll start with his
estimation of you.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.378
Me?! Why do I go first?

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.547
Oh, no particular reason.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.298
I just thought I'd start
with the latest one

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.509
to meet His Majesty.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:43.885
Yeah, that makes sense,

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.763
since I am the newest
addition to this group.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.559
Plus, I suppose it's
better than going last.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.811
[EXCEL] All right, so
according to His Majesty...

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.814
[EXCEL] Why don't we
talk about Roroa

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.024
and your feelings for her.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.401
My feelings?

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.737
I like how cheerful
and friendly she can be.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.948
She can be underhanded at times,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.784
but that's just part
of her charm.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.828
It's heartwarming how
she looks up to Liscia

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.121
and the others.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:15.000
Also, she's a wiz when
it comes to finances.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.211
I'm very grateful for her
and that she's my fiancée.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.843
Th-This is so embarrassing.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.219
And furthermore,

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.847
I asked His Majesty if
he had anything to add

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.765
and he said the following:

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.851
"Regarding the death
of her father,

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.686
I feel responsible for it."

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.190
[SOUMA]
I know we were at war.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.901
But that hardly matters.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.361
His blood is on my hands.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.655
And while I know Roroa
says she was estranged

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.198
from Gaius,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.243
I wonder, does she
really want to marry me?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.871
That worries him sometimes.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.751
What? Is he dense?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.419
Darling, you big dummy!

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.546
I've already
considered all of that!

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.381
I'm getting married to
him because that's what

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.717
I really wanted to do,
so why's he thinkin'

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.968
about the past?

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.846
[crying]

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.724
[crying]

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.267
There, there.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.895
[ROROA]
Big sister Cia.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.605
Don't you worry.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.191
I'll give Souma a piece
of my mind later.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.403
Roroa, there's a reason
he brought it up, you know.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.113
That's because he loves you.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.949
You're important to him.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.951
You know that, don't you?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.453
[ROROA]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.747
While on the one hand,
I'm upset he's oblivious

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.082
to the way I feel--

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.209
on the other, now that
I know just how highly

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.046
my darling thinks of me,
it makes me kinda happy.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.756
[EXCEL]
As long as you're aware of that,

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.633
you should do just fine.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.343
Next up, Juna.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.302
Yes?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.766
Pretty. Beautiful.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.851
Her appearance.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.728
But it's not only that.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.897
Her heart, too.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.650
She walks behind the rest,
but only because

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.653
she wants to see
the larger picture.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.614
She really is the perfect woman.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.033
I don't want to lose her.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.787
His Majesty really
said that about me?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.289
When I asked, "How do
you feel about Juna?"

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.667
he then replied
with the following:

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.044
"I consider myself lucky
whenever she lets me

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.548
dote on her, especially
since I'm a younger guy."

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.507
[JUNA]
Wait a minute.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.135
I thought His Majesty and
myself were the same age.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.261
[LISCIA]
No, she's right.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.595
They're both 19.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.809
It was only later
Souma realized,

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:43.565
in the world where he came from,
that one year lasts 365 days.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.818
While in this one, it lasts 384,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.611
so when you factor
in the difference,

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.573
you would actually be
at least a full year older

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.450
than His Majesty Souma.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.326
I had no idea there
was such a gap between

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.495
our ages. But wait!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.164
You're not saying that
His Majesty dislikes

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.125
older women, are you?

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.376
Not to worry.

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.795
He continued by
saying the following:

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.465
"In the world I come from
we have an old saying

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.718
that goes, 'Find a wife a
year older than you are.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.055
And if necessary,
wear wire sandals."

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.556
[JUNA]
Oh, thank goodness.

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.309
[EXCEL]
Next up, Aisha.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.311
Y-Yes ma'am?

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:25.273
[EXCEL] His Majesty Souma's
appraisal of you, Aisha, is...

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.737
[AISHA] Um, sorry, but why
are you stopping there?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:31.654
[EXCEL]
Actually,

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.822
he called you "pet-like."

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.157
He said I'm what?!

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.868
[DOG barks]

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.871
I can see that.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.539
Not you, too, Juna!

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.208
What am I, his lap dog?

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.838
Aisha is strong and noble,
a gorgeous warrior.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.382
The fact is, she's the
most valiant fighter

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.927
in the kingdom and it's
reassuring to know

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.930
I always have her by my side.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.389
At least it should be.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:03.269
The thing is, there's something
irresistible about her.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.397
I find myself wanting
to protect her, I suppose.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.236
[AISHA] I'm an utter failure
as a bodyguard!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.321
[ROROA]
Aisha, shake.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.364
[AISHA]
Woof.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.991
You're so adorable.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.370
I feel like I want to
protect you, myself.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.122
What? Not you, too.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:28.419
[EXCEL] Lastly, we come
to Princess Liscia.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.547
I should start off by
mentioning I asked the king

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:34.259
what was on his mind
when it comes to you.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.595
Uh, that feels like a different
question from the rest.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.847
[chuckles]

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.182
I believe his assessment
of you Princess Liscia

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.310
can be summarized by the
answer to that one inquiry.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.895
When his Majesty answered,

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.898
he said just a single
word: "Nothing."

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.569
[LISCIA]
"Nothing"? At all?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.281
He had something to say
about all the others,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.615
didn't he?

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:01.536
And yet, when it came
to me, he drew a blank?

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:04.664
He did say more, which
should provide context:

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:08.251
"I want to personally tell
her about my feelings."

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.335
Quote.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.132
[ROROA]
Not very fair.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.718
Cia's the only one
he said that about.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:17.677
[LISCIA]
Huh?

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.554
Of course she gets
special treatment.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.972
I'm so jealous.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.056
[LISCIA]
Ow!

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.684
C'mon ladies,
that really smarts!

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.520
Not you, too, Juna!

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.938
The truth is...

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.191
...I'm jealous of
the rest of you.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.442
How come?

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:34.861
I really wanted to hear
how he liked such-and-such

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.029
about me.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.198
Like how he didn't want
to lose me to anyone,

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.909
or how he wanted to
protect me, as well.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.244
I guess that's just
the way things go.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.121
From now on,
whenever we have a lesson,

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.957
why don't we gather
together around the table!

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.710
Oh, Ai, nice job herding us.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:51.669
Of course!

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.131
All right.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:58.051
Moving on, it's time
for specific instruction,

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.011
and to discuss the
different ways for you all

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.888
to maintain marital bliss.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.681
What do you mean by "specific"?

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.099
[EXCEL]
As I said at the beginning,

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.101
we'd cover the
psychological aspects

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.271
and the performance of
one's nighttime services,

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.272
remember?

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.441
And I intend to teach
you exhaustively

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.109
about these subjects.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:19.030
Excuse me, Grandmother,
but everything else aside,

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.407
are you sure it's necessary
for us to have to sit through

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.910
a lecture going over
techniques for these, uh,

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.370
rather private matters?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.997
Yeah, no, I'm 100%
with Juna on this one.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.999
It's gonna be way
too embarrassing.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.293
It's got me kinda
curious, though.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.753
Roroa?

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.880
Cia, you don't wanna know more?

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.091
Well, sure, I mean....

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:40.927
Heh! So, you are a
little curious, huh.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.220
You can say it.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.179
Goodness.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.057
You sure you ladies want to
pass up a chance like this?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.268
Because if you sit through
my lecture all the way

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.979
to the end, then as
proof of completion

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.064
I will give you
each one of these.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.277
[LISCIA] Some kind of
classified documents?

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.779
[JUNA] Does that say
"burn after reading"?

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.323
[AISHA] Whatever's inside
sounds pretty dangerous.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.908
[ROROA]
Must be state secrets.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.327
That's right.
The "naked truth," as it were.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:11.749
Contained here in these black
books are unspeakable things

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.168
His Majesty either
wants you to do to him

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.004
or he wants to do to you.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.631
As well as the situations
in which to perform them.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.384
In other words,
top national security secrets.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.428
Oh.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.929
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.098
[EXCEL] While usually kept
locked within his heart,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.559
his Majesty Souma's
desires for each of you

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.728
are laid bare
within these pages--

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.564
in incredible detail,
I might add.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:35.565
Let's begin.

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.859
Our first lecture: "servicing."

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.156
[overlapping chatter]

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.954
[ALL yell]

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.472
[knocking]

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.015
[MARIA]
Come on in.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.099
[JEANNE]
Pardon.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:19.400
I'm here to make my report
concerning the slave traders.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.662
So, the traders,
you have some news?

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.039
I do.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.124
Similarly to Friedonia,

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.543
I would like to start a
system where they instead

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.253
work for the empire.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.381
That's Souma for
you, no surprise.

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.341
Avoid a war by turning
all the slave traders

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.759
into public servants.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.596
Meanwhile the slaves receive
a high-quality education.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.765
That couldn't have
been easy to think up.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.183
It wasn't Souma.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.851
I heard a slave trader
in town came up

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.478
with the idea.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.854
My!

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.731
Seems like they are
blessed with an abundance

00:14:58.773 --> 00:14:59.857
of talent.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.692
Indeed, they are.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:05.988
However, some slave traders
may not be sanctioned,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.492
and then commit violent
acts like kidnapping.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.828
It has happened in Friedonia.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.205
We will have to keep
a careful watch for that.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.289
Right.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.707
I would like to bear
that in mind when

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.460
distributing certifications.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:20.920
You have to wonder,

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.797
what kind of national
improvement is Souma

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.882
going to try and implement next?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.301
If I know him, he's
imagining an even more

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.470
wonderful kingdom.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.307
You certainly are taken
with His Majesty, sister.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.809
Of course I am!

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.395
And yet, what Friedonia
attempts is ultimately

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.021
just for reference.

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.982
We have to do our
own building using

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.526
the rock-solid foundation
of our country.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.948
A suggestion, if I may.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.616
As their progress continues,

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.077
I should stay in
touch with Hakuya.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.205
Yes. I think that's best.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.000
So, how're things?

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.543
With Hakuya, I mean.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.589
Th-There's nothing
going on between us!

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.466
[HAKUYA sneezes]

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.842
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.344
That's okay. Please continue.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.722
[HAKUYA] The citizens' lives
have become more stable,

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.725
which in turn has allowed us
to build more residences.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.059
That's terrific.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:20.354
[HAKUYA]
Alas, there is a problem.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.231
The trees surrounding
the capital have all been

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.900
cut down for the
purpose of lumber

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.735
and providing heat
for the winter.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.403
Some areas are
nothing but sparse,

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:28.905
barren hills now.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.157
Seems we need lumber stoppages.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.159
Who would have guessed.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.952
[HAKUYA]
Lumber stoppages?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.747
Back where I'm from,
lumber was once an important

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.582
military resource.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.792
To guard it, excess
logging was prohibited

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.711
on certain mountains.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.005
It was so strict, they said
that felling a single tree

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.340
could cost you your head.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.342
That seems a bit excessive.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.385
[SOUMA]
Well, we won't go that far.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.554
Also, redirect the
thinned timber from

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.724
the God-Protected Forest
to where it's needed.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.142
As you wish, sire.

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:01.979
The refugees.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.648
How're they and Komain?

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.484
Their relocation is
going quite smoothly.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.070
And there are no
complaints with the housing.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.614
The issue is with jobs.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.492
While there are numerous
hunters among their people,

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.327
the truth is, not many
of them possess

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.288
what you would call
"marketable skills."

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.916
We can't have them making
nothing but weapons.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.668
I see your point.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.670
They may hunt prey,
but they can also make

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.963
woolen goods.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:29.966
Let's put them to work
in the textile mill.

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:32.635
We have to invest
in the public sector more,

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.596
and not just find
ways of employing them.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:38.099
[HAKUYA] Luckily, there are
some areas in Venetinova

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.393
that as of yet have
not been zoned.

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.395
We can develop the
facilities while providing

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.397
jobs for the refugees.

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:45.856
[SOUMA]
Go right ahead.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.900
As long as we continue
on this course,

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.361
Venetinova will become
a center of trade.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.822
But unless we raise the
level of education there,

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:54.615
they won't be able
to make ends meet.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.492
At least not on industry alone.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.036
I've thought as much and
have already discussed it

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.288
with Ginger.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.039
Leave it to you, Hakuya.

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.332
Zero moss.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.001
--[door opens]
--[PONCHO gasps]

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.715
It's done!

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.133
What's done, Poncho?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.386
[PONCHO] Th-The thing Your
Majesty specially requested

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.637
I invent!

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.681
Really? Are you
talking about "it"?

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:19.890
[PONCHO]
Yes!

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.102
May I try?

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.646
I'd be honored if you
had a taste, sir, yes!

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.784
Is it decent?

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.748
You're a genius, Poncho!

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.626
There's no doubt this is a
sauce for flour-based dishes!

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.711
[PONCHO]
Yes!

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:52.256
If I may ask, what makes this
sauce particularly important?

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.924
Well, with this as a base,

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.968
we can make
yakisoba, okonomiyaki,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.137
monjayaki, takoyaki!

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.390
It'll even work as a sauce
poured over fried foods!

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.850
How about a taste, Hakuya?

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:22.286
[HAKUYA] It has a fruity,
veggie flavor with spices

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.621
that entice the nose.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:26.207
And yet it's unlike ordinary
Worcestershire sauce

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:29.043
in that it possesses a strong
sweet and sour flavor

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.795
with no shortage of taste.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:34.090
Truly, it is unlike any
sauce I've had before!

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.926
I admit, even I'm
surprised you reproduced it,

00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.345
considering how you've
never even tried it.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:42.640
Thank you for your generous
heaps of praise, yes!

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.601
Still, just what did you use?

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.770
Certain tastes
are familiar to me.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.064
[PONCHO] I'm impressed by
your palate, Your Majesty.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.066
Allow me to explain.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.276
It's a mixture of
various ingredients.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:57.113
First I combined Worcestershire
and tomato sauce,

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.615
then added a little bit
of soy sauce and mirin

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.743
from Kikkoro Distillery, yes.

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.953
A question.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:06.288
Are we able to mass-produce
this new sauce?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.915
I spoke with Kikkoro Distillery,

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.084
and they're willing
to take it on, yes.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.127
[HAKUYA]
Your Majesty.

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.420
I just had a thought.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.588
What if we took food
that uses this flour-based

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.882
dish sauce and made
it a specialty dish

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:18.801
that you can only
get in Venetinova?

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.555
Which in turn would
create new jobs!

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:24.932
But we cannot let
Venetinova have a monopoly

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.183
over this sauce!

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.601
However, since
they're a gulf city,

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.311
they can make squid yakisoba!

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.564
This is the dawn of
a Venetinova delicacy!

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:32.815
People will come from all over!

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.358
Squid yakisoba?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.194
I have to be the first
in line to try some!

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:40.448
My mouth's watering just
from imagining it, yes!

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.538
[SOUMA] This sure has
been a turbulent year.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.331
Yes, you said it.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:50.833
[SOUMA] I had the throne
relinquished to me on

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:55.296
April 32nd, and before you know
it, another year has passed.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.132
[LISCIA]
And tomorrow is December 32nd.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.967
The last eight months
felt like they went by

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:01.260
in the blink of an eye.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:12.021
Liscia, is something wrong?

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.564
Wrong?! What could be wrong?

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:14.899
Nothing! That's what!

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:18.694
Open. Say "ahh."

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.451
I've always wanted more
moments just like this.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.870
You know, beneath the kotatsu,

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.289
keeping warm,
while doing nothing.

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.665
Sounds terrific, huh?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.338
[LISCIA]
Here. Say "ahh."

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:43.552
It's nice taking
a break for once.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:46.555
True. Hopefully it stays
like this for a long while.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.517
Yeah, you said it.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.854
[knocking]

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.191
[SOUMA] Then, as soon as we
say it's nice doing nothing...

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.526
Yes?

00:21:58.567 --> 00:21:59.568
[door opens]

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.366
[CARLA]
I have a message from Albert.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.452
Tomorrow, the evening
of December 32nd,

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.955
he would like to meet
with Your Majesty.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:12.665
Finally.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.667
Wait, my father?

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.877
Souma, I'm coming, too.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.838
His Majesty is to attend alone.

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.214
Albert was specific.
