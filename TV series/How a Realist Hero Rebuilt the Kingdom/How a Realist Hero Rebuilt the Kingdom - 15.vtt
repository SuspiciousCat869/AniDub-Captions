00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.887
[NARRATOR] Nearly ten years ago,
the Demon Lord's Domain

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.724
appeared, and mankind
lost their lands as a result.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.727
In response to the turmoil,
the Gran Chaos Empire

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.022
put forth the Declaration of
Mankind's Common Front

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.815
Against the Demon Race.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.193
Nations that signed
onto the Declaration

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.987
ratified the following
three articles:

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.031
The first states any changes
in borders among

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.825
mankind's territory
due to military action

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.119
will not be recognized.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.747
The Principality of Amidonia
signed the treaty,

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.583
while the Kingdom of
Elfrieden did not.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.961
Therefore, when the former
lost the capital of Van

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.547
to the latter, it was
possible for Amidonia

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.258
under article one to
appeal to the empire.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.218
Using the power
of the Declaration,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.679
they sought the return
of their lost territory.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.076
If there are no more delays,
our two nations

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.871
can get down to business
and resume with our talks.

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:43.872
Right.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.671
[JEANNE]
Thank you for the meal.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.506
It was quite delicious.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.717
Please, forgive us, typically we
would give you a banquet.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.514
I shall repay you for
the food and hosting me.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:04.309
Allow me to provide
a morsel of information.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.727
Monster tastes good.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.484
What I mean by that is
their meat can be eaten.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.695
You're not joking.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.323
And these monsters, they're from
the Demon Lord's Domain?

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.867
Of course, they taste
surprisingly normal.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.829
[SOUMA gasps] You've tried
them yourself, Jeanne?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.332
[SOUMA] She is cute,
but also a little bit crazy.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.542
I'm impressed,

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.462
but was there any chance
it was actually kobold meat?

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:36.091
Uh-uh. It was
definitely a monster.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.510
I would never even dream
of devouring demons

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.262
that resemble humans.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.389
To be honest, I can't tell
the difference between

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.141
demons and monsters.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.183
Oh, that's right.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.478
I keep forgetting this whole
world is brand new to you.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.148
Do you know about the fate
of our punitive force?

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.276
[SOUMA] Yeah, King
Albert told me about it.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.777
I don't know how
much he mentioned,

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.320
but it was ten years ago.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.239
A large number of soldiers
were decimated

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.658
by the demons.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.078
This was when my sister
was nine and I was seven.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.913
The punitive force was
under the command

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.040
of the former emperor,

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.252
who you've probably
worked out was my father.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.130
Later, I heard stories,
how horrific the attack

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.674
by the monsters was.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.552
Flames spewing from
teeth-lined jaws.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.888
How cities were turned to ash,
and people were killed

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.390
and devoured, men,
women and children.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.893
The monsters were running
rampant on pure instinct,

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.229
though, so some people were able
to escape their destruction.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.064
[SOUMA]
Almost like wild animals.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.192
[JEANNE] Meanwhile,
the demons demonstrated

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.570
well-organized behavior,
defeating our punitive force

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.489
with overwhelming strength.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.324
Reports afterwards vary.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.284
Some of the troops said
they were not pursued

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.535
by the enemy.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.662
Others claimed the opposite,
and that pillaging

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.039
and butchering took place.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.542
Kind of what you'd expect
if you were fighting

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.503
other people.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.546
Makes you wonder
how the two differ.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.548
Could it be possible that
demons may have evolved

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.841
from monsters?

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.551
We only know they
gained their intelligence

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.845
from eating people's brains.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.431
At least, that's what the
religious folks made a big

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.142
fuss about, but their
narrative was full of holes.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.147
Skipping ahead, after we
entrenched our battle lines,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.859
the monsters kept up their
attack while we held.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.070
But we have the
situation under control.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:21.404
You can take it from me.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.742
But we kind of strayed
from the topic.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.036
So, back to eating monsters.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.957
The meat I consumed, it belonged
to a giant flying serpent.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.167
I'm not familiar
with that creature.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.837
It's a large snake with
four bird-like wings

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.672
growing out of its back.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.841
[SOUMA] As I recall,
Central and South Americans

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.219
worship Quetzalcoatl,
a god similar in appearance.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.971
I don't know what possessed
you to eat something

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.138
like that, though.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.266
[JEANNE] As for the taste, it
was somewhere between

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.269
a normal snake and bird.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.063
[SOUMA]
It tasted like a regular snake?

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.858
As in she's eaten them before?

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.652
For a princess, you've
developed a taste for,

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.154
shall we say, unusual cuisine.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.991
[JEANNE] I'm also a general
commanding troops.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:10.036
If the occasion demands it,
we'll eat whatever we can find.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.955
I suppose I can
see your reasoning.

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.748
Still I'm having a hard
time imagining how

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.209
you found out
in the first place.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.670
From a scout party, they
discovered the remains

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.007
of monsters that
had been cooked.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.300
So, you're saying...

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.305
We believe the demons
have been consuming them.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.603
Naturally, when we
captured the same species,

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:38.064
we had to verify if they
were edible or not.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.442
Upon trying it myself,
I found it tasted light

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.485
and surprisingly refreshing.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.030
I mean, obviously this raises
more interesting points

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.573
besides the taste.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.991
And that would be what?

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.452
Well, for starters, the fact
that demons were eating monsters

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.454
is way more shocking.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.790
The implication is demons don't
regard monsters as equals.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.125
There's a hierarchy.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.379
Tell me something, Jeanne.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.923
What is it?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.926
Just what if demons and
monsters are the same as

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.969
what we call
people and animals.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.183
Why would you ever think that?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.606
Hey, no notes for this part.

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:20.857
Understood.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.444
Must be disturbing if you don't
want it on the public record.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.614
I can't wait to hear the
bombshell you're dropping.

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:30.909
Forgive me, in some situations
I realize these could be

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.328
seen as discriminatory
remarks, so...

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.455
In regards to what?

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.917
If you're talking about demons
and monsters, I'm intrigued.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.253
The truth is,
animals, monsters...

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.548
I can't quite see
any difference.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.177
And yes, I imagine that sounds
crazy to everyone here.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.348
On that note, the races such
as beastmen and dragonewts--

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.559
They seem similar to demons.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.395
That's mad.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.522
The beings that occupy
this world are nothing like

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.190
the ones where I come from.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.234
So I don't understand
how they're different.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.819
Well for starters, demons!

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.737
Are you comparing
Tomoe to their kind?

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.740
Majesty! Saying that's too
far is an understatement!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.534
[SOUMA]
Like I said!

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.744
This could most likely
end up being interpreted

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.121
as discriminatory!

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.208
[SOUMA sighs]

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.501
Let me ask you this.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.753
Can you tell me the difference
between mystic wolves,

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.922
foxes, and kobolds, Jeanne?

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.465
Of course I can.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.843
Kobold's faces
are more dog-like.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.845
[SOUMA] Sure, but there are
races of beastmen

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.848
with animal-like faces,
aren't there?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.476
I suppose, but now
that you mention it...

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.686
Wait! I know!

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.938
The kobolds have bodies
that are almost completely

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.273
covered in fur.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.900
If that's the measure,
their fur length,

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:49.112
then what about demons we
know about without any hair?

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.579
After thinking
about all of this,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.998
I realize now I'm
differentiating between people

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.750
and demons by sense alone.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.334
Same for me.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.503
But if I wasn't, I can't
really think of anything

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.963
that sets them apart.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.507
How did we miss the
similarities for so long?

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.929
[SOUMA] It's probably a shared
awareness unique to this world.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.931
There is a sensate
understanding of the difference

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.142
between mankind and demon.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.520
I'm glad we won't be mentioning
this outside of the room.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.898
If any bureaucrats
had been here,

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.192
then I would have
had to slay them.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.193
Kill them?!

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.029
You're-- You wouldn't
really go that far, right?

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.822
Keep telling yourself that.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.532
If word of this
discussion got out,

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.326
I would expect the
supercontinent to erupt

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.911
in riots.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.704
Isn't that so, Hakuya?

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.164
Most definitely.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.792
The species have been deemed
categorically different,

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.377
but if that stance were
to suddenly change,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.797
the human supremacist
countries like Amidonia

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.799
would seize on the
news, targeting all

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.718
the multiracial peoples
like the high elves.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.845
It would give them the
ammunition they need to launch

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.055
such attacks.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.850
Additionally, if beastmen
and dragonewts

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.770
were compared to demons,
then they would be ostracized.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.522
And various governments
would find ways

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.731
to oppress them.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.529
All throughout the continent,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.032
it would spark interracial
strife and social upheaval.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:19.911
Sorry, I hadn't thought
it through that far yet.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:20.995
[JEANNE]
Don't worry.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.956
Better to bring it up
now rather than having it

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.707
thrust upon us.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.127
I'm relieved to
hear you say that.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:30.505
I'll admit, I don't know
if I have a solution.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.050
It's possible to think of
demons as an ethnic minority.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.678
If so, the Mankind Declaration
would make an appeal

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.848
against persecuting them. But--

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.684
That agreement, though, is
strictly between governments

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.937
and has no bearing on the
general public's views.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.730
At most, we'd check
on how much nations

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.858
would want to supervise.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.694
[HAKUYA] For that matter,
there are nations like ours.

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.572
Ones that have not signed
the Mankind Declaration.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:56.990
If we, a foreign power,

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.616
were to force our
policies on them,

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.535
there could be a severe
backlash and even quite

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:01.953
possibly a war.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.913
That's absolutely right.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.082
Not like we have all the
information about monsters

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.334
and demons anyway.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.879
It's dangerous
drawing conclusions

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.714
when there are still
so many unknowns.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.219
Very well.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:22.223
To be frank, it seems we should
discuss this matter further.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.850
That is, if you would like.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.810
That would be best.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.155
[JEANNE]
Well, then.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:41.326
I think it's time we discussed
the occupation of Van.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.871
As you know, as per
the Mankind Declaration,

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:48.625
we will not recognize borders
altered by military force.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:52.003
[SOUMA] And you should know
we will not return their land.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.173
Amidonia was the one
that started this war.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.467
If you allow for this behavior,

00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:00.637
the Empire will lose
respect of both signatories

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.222
and non-signatories.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.806
You may be right.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.433
But we planned for this.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.060
And because of their actions,

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:11.064
the Principality of Amidonia
will pay reparations.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:14.067
If they refuse, will you
resort to force of arms?

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.610
If it's necessary.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.783
What with the number of troops
I have stationed nearby,

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.868
it shouldn't be difficult,
defeating yours

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.745
and the principality's forces.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.164
Most likely not.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.000
However, we don't
wish to fight you.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.504
So instead, let's lay
out our intentions.

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.589
First, the empires--
you don't want changes

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.758
to the borders, right?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.261
That's why you
need Van returned.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.221
To avoid a precedent.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.722
Most perceptive.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.266
Yes, you're correct.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.518
In terms of my kingdom,
we wish to curb

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.397
Amidonia's ability for
future hostile action,

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.316
so they can't interfere
with us again.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.611
We also want compensation
for their invasion.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.406
[JEANNE] What you're saying is,
taking Van was mostly

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.950
to teach them a lesson?

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:07.245
In short, you would
relinquish control of Van,

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.039
only if the principality
adequately compensates

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.916
by paying you reparations.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.584
Do I have that down right?

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:17.797
If Julius wants the city back
and pays, yes, I will return it.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.757
To me, that's a shame.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.719
Van could generate all sorts
of wealth in the long run

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.679
and we would be missing
out on that for a simple,

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.514
one-time payment.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.058
I don't view it
as a bad situation.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.227
The empire achieves
what they came here for,

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:34.981
and has the principality's
territory returned back to them.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.442
As for the other
non-member nations...

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.861
It sends a clear
message to them all.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.698
If you try anything similar,
you may not lose your land,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.783
but you will pay for it.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.245
You catch on quickly, Jeanne.
No surprise.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.830
This ought to earn
some good faith with

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.916
non-member nations, too.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.919
Julius is going to be
completely against it.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.255
[SOUMA]
He created this situation.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.382
One more thing,
please have the payments made

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.134
in imperial coinage.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.219
You're dragging
my country into this?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.638
The empire bears
some responsibility

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.558
for not quelling
Amidonia's rage outright.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.310
I suppose there's
no denying that.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.814
Tell me, Souma,
why hasn't Elfrieden signed

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.068
onto the Mankind
Declaration yet?

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.862
I hate to say this in
front of Princess Liscia,

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.740
but in Albert's case,
the reason he didn't join

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.825
our unified force...

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.537
That is, it's not that
he refused to.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:35.041
My father couldn't make up his
mind whether to sign it or not.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.709
He's a little indecisive.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.630
You haven't signed
since taking the throne.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:43.925
I imagine you have a
more concrete reason.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.053
[SOUMA] I can't afford to give
her my answer just yet.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.888
Then again, if I lie,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.433
it'll adversely affect our new
relation with the empire.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.727
I hope you'll trust me when
I say we want our nation

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.605
to march alongside yours
despite not being a signatory

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.981
on the treaty.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.734
As long as Empress Maria
continues striving to unite

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.946
all of mankind in response to
the Demon Lord's Domain,

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.823
we will be your allies.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:09.492
The kingdom is not
the enemy of the empire.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.036
Even though you insist
we can trust you,

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:15.039
you still won't sign
the Declaration.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.875
Our country couldn't
sign if we wanted to.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.211
What we would like is
to enter into a bilateral

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.505
alliance with the empire.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.424
One that would be kept secret.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.634
Secret, you say? Go on.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.515
We've finally got our
domestic affairs in order.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.976
And now we're
reforming our military--

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:36.811
we're creating a new system.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.313
one that will act as
a single, unified force.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.902
Speaking of, is it true?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.737
The empire is sending a
detachment to reinforce

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.073
the Union of Eastern Nations?

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.408
Yes.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.286
They're a collection of
small-to-mid-size countries,

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:57.206
but most are signatories
of the Mankind Declaration.

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.376
Per the treaty, it's only right
we send them our troops.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.377
That's right.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:03.212
So why not allow
our country to take on

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.048
the exact same role?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.842
You can't be serious.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.473
[SOUMA] Say the demons
and monsters move south,

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:16.100
they'll surely avoid the Star
Dragon Mountain Range,

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.227
pushing either east or west.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.272
If they head west,
the empire has them.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.942
East, my kingdom will deal
with their numbers instead.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.820
Well, that would require
some new protocols.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.113
[SOUMA]
Yes, I know.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.616
Should the empire, head of
the Mankind Declaration,

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.368
request reinforcements from
the Union of Eastern Nations,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.411
they will be met.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.872
As will any requests
made to our kingdom.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.292
That's the form
I'd like this to take.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.839
If it's discovered that our
two nations are in alliance,

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:49.634
it will make some
countries trepidatious.

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.887
Amidonia, yes, as well as Zem.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.681
Not to mention the
Republic of Turgis.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.267
It is for that reason we would
like this agreement of ours

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.728
to be kept
strictly confidential.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.148
A secret alliance
only we know about.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.400
For my part, I see no
reason why I shouldn't

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.529
accept your proposal,
but just how is this going to

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.364
benefit you in the long run?

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:16.035
The way I see it, we are earning
the trust of the empire.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.871
I'm not sure I would call
that much of a benefit.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.250
Maybe, but when the fate of
mankind hangs in the balance,

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.086
we can't think in terms
of profits and losses.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:27.255
Plus, if we don't become
involved, other nations

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.465
will give us the cold shoulder.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:33.427
That makes sense, but there's
too much distance between us.

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.137
How're the empire
and kingdom supposed to

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.973
communicate quickly?

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:40.017
I have a workaround
to eliminate that problem.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.978
Hakuya, show her.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:42.979
Yes, Sire.

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.732
[SOUMA] I'd like you
to give this to Maria.

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.359
It's a simple receiver.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.322
If the empire would kindly
give us one in return,

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.616
we can reach each other anytime.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.577
That way you and
my sister could be able

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.162
to easily converse,
person to person!

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:04.083
I cannot help but shudder at
your sheer inventiveness, Souma.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.751
You're being too kind.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:08.588
Where I'm from, these
systems are commonplace.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.549
We must seem antiquated
to someone like you.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.843
You just keep amazing me.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:17.722
Listen, Souma, would you permit
me to make a rash proposal?

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.016
Uh... Go ahead.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:21.809
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.770
All right, then.
Princess Liscia?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.939
What is it?

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.524
[JEANNE] How would you
feel about giving Albert

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.026
the throne back?

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:33.613
So that way, you could give
Souma his own country.

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.031
[ALL gasp]

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:38.242
Or he could join the empire
and become our prime minister!

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.453
But that's just the start.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.496
Ultimately, he would marry
my sister and become

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.415
the new emperor!

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.917
I--! Do you even understand
exactly how inappropriate

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.502
of a request that is?

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.338
What kind of negotiation
is this where you can

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.965
just suddenly decide
to steal our king from us?

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:56.177
But... Souma's thinking is
just so ahead of its time!

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.888
I would love to see the sort
of empire he and my sister

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:00.473
would end up creating!

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.517
It's simply out of the question!

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.227
You can't take Souma from me!

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.066
I mean, you can't take Souma
away from our kingdom!

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.567
Liscia, easy!

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.403
I swear I'm not going
anywhere! Okay?

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:20.159
Apologies for shouting.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.244
I know your hand's
still on your sword.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:24.789
Aisha, be good.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.875
Majesty! Why're you
treating me so unfairly?

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.880
A generous offer, but I
can't accept your proposal.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.965
For the kingdom's sake.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.218
As well as Liscia's
and the others.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.470
I understand.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:43.766
It was a wild idea, but I
appreciate you humoring me.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:47.144
Getting back to our
previous discussion.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.271
Regarding this secret alliance,

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:52.525
it's a serious decision
I cannot make on my own.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.027
That's what the
simple receiver's for.

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.612
[JEANNE]
It goes beyond that.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.280
What would you say
to sending each other

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.366
several diplomatic officers?

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.909
I see what you mean.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.453
That would make working
together much easier.

00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:06.539
Then we'll proceed.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.624
[laughs]
As for these Ambassadors,

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.126
let's assign them titles:

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.795
Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.381
I also recommend we build
embassies in both capitals

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.799
to station them.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.926
This all sounds brilliant!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.429
I'll look into it immediately!

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.556
[SOUMA]
It's getting awfully late.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.516
How about we call it a day?

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:26.976
[JEANNE]
Yes, I concur.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.156
[JEANNE] We've been talking
longer than I thought.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.283
The sun's already rising.

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.160
I feel like we discussed
a few subjects

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.662
that weren't necessarily
of importance.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.039
I'm just glad these
negotiations led me to finding

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.959
someone I can depend on.

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.586
There is something
I think you should know,

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.172
my new good friend
from the east.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:59.049
And what might that be,
new friend from the west?

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.719
Within the Demon's
Domain, there's a being

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.306
who is lord over the realm.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:07.683
While we haven't cracked
the demon's language,

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:09.685
there is one word we
have noticed that they are

00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:11.562
often repeating.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.689
My country's researchers
have surmised that they

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:18.569
might actually be saying a name,
of the Demon Lord themself.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:22.531
That word is "Divalroi."

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:27.536
Wait a minute,
the Demon Lord Divalroi?

00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:28.579
Yes.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.873
I've got the strangest feeling.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:34.919
Almost like the name's familiar.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:39.340
Wait. What is this?

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:43.844
Maybe deja-vu? No, it's not.

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:47.223
If only I could remember
where I heard the name from.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.185
[LISCIA]
Souma!

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.647
Serina. Would you be kind
enough to show Jeanne

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.981
to her guest room?

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:05.366
[SOUMA] Really, all I need is
to get some sleep in my office.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.868
Tonight, you're going
to sleep in a proper bed.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.416
I don't know what
happened back there,

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.044
but at least let me
take care of you.

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:21.340
Thank you, Liscia.

00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:22.424
It's my pleasure.
