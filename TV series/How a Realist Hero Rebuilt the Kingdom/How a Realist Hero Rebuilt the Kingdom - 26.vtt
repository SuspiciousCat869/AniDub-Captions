[ALBERT chuckles]

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:40.123
Ah, Souma. Sorry
for making you wait

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.709
until the end of
the year to see us.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.421
It's been too long
since last we met, Majesty.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.799
Far too long.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.426
[ELISHA]
Sit, please. Let us talk.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.140
[ALBERT] My congratulations
on winning the war

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.893
with Amidonia and
annexing the territory.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.062
Quite an impressive feat
for having only been

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.398
on the throne for six months.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.608
That's very kind.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.529
I asked to see you numerous
times since you abdicated.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.656
Now, finally,
you've agreed to meet.

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:16.243
As we said, we're terribly sorry
for making you wait so long.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.995
Whenever I asked
for an audience,

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:20.581
I was given excuses
and told that I would

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.292
know the truth one day.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.335
So, then, is today that day?

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:29.214
If that is what
you most desire, yes.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.466
[SOUMA]
Hmm.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.261
I have some burning questions
that'll help me know

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.471
what you were thinking.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.140
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.392
There're three things
I want to ask.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.602
Number one,

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.979
When you first summoned me
to this world,

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.524
right then is when you
stepped down from the throne.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.944
And you even offered
to make Liscia my fiancÃ©e.

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.196
Which was odd.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.741
It was the first time
we had ever even met.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.118
Not to mention how young I am.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.079
Why would you decide
to entrust everything to me?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.293
[SOUMA]
Number two, Georg's devotion.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.463
Not only was the man willing
to be dragged through the mud,

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.091
he formed a suicide pact with my
enemies to ensure their defeat.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.469
It's all too strange.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.263
The plan required
some careful preparation,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.849
and cost him his life.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:25.646
It worked out, but only
because of his sense of loyalty.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.648
I find it hard to believe
that it was for me,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.691
since he and I were strangers.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.735
Where was that
loyalty really directed?

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:34.112
If not for me...

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.198
...it must have been for you.

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:41.620
And lastly, why have you refused
to meet with me until now?

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.747
Why did I have
to wait all this time?

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.874
[ALBERT]
That's all you wish to know?

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.001
Let's start with those three.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.711
If you insist.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.172
I would like to begin my
answer by observing that all

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.800
of the questions you asked
have something in common.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.176
A single factor.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.803
And just what is that?

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.514
I hope you don't mind me
answering your inquiries

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.932
out of order.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.518
But in regards to
your third question,

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.854
we debated whether or not
we should tell you this.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.400
Or, if it was better to take
the secret to our graves.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:16.363
The fact is, the misdeeds I have
committed are many and severe.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.907
I am not strong enough
to keep them locked away.

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.409
[gasps]

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:26.498
Let me ask: Has there been
a point where you wished

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.792
you could redo
part of your life?

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.044
I have felt that
many times before.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.505
After I took over, I wondered--

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.590
How could I have
done things better?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.927
Could I have somehow managed
to save some more lives?

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.221
But why would you ask me that?

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:44.433
What I'm about to tell you
took place long ago.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.269
Please bear that in mind
while you listen to it.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.315
Once upon a time,
a king ruled over a nation.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:56.278
But, unfortunately,
he was a very mediocre leader.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.198
Then, one day, a request came
from a great country to the west

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.868
to perform a hero summoning.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.080
The king ordered the ritual
as he was instructed.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.624
And thus, a young
man was summoned

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.294
to their world from another.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.880
But before the king could
turn over the young man

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.676
to the great western nation,
the hero said the following:

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:24.765
"We should increase the nation's
wealth and military might."

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.892
[SOUMA] I think I'm familiar
with this story.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.685
You're talking
about me, aren't you?

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.062
I haven't finished
telling it yet.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.814
[SOUMA]
Oh, sorry.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:36.318
[ALBERT] Within this young man,
the king sensed great talent

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.237
he himself did not
possess, and therefore,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.115
appointed the hero
to be the prime minister.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:45.368
The young man lived up to
the expectations and enacted

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.330
a number of reforms.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.292
Sure enough, these efforts paid
off, and the kingdom began

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.962
to recover from their food
shortages and economic woes.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.632
However... The reforms
he implemented

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.344
agitated the rich and powerful
and inevitably incurred

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.846
the ire of the aristocracy.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.771
The ruling class did everything
they could to convince the king

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:15.690
the young man was harmful
to the kingdom's future

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.400
and to have him banished.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.987
Fortunately, the boy
had one powerful ally:

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.615
the general over
the kingdom's army.

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.993
He was able to perceive the
young man's talent right away

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.538
and, for that reason,
supported him.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:33.083
Nevertheless, the aristocracy
feared the summoned hero's

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.584
gain in momentum.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.838
They continued making even
more false accusations,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.759
which resulted in the king
becoming increasingly nervous.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.929
For even though the young man's
talents were appealing,

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.349
they came at the expense
of many influential enemies.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.685
At least, that's what
the king believed,

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.187
and so he chose to dismiss him.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.732
Heartbroken, the exiled hero
took shelter in the city

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.486
where the army's general's
castle was situated.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.740
It wasn't ideal but would keep
the kingdom from being divided.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.409
Even though he was ostracized,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.120
the situation would
at least spare his life.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.623
Or so the king
had convinced himself.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:17.002
Unfortunately, that was not
the end of the matter,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.297
for later that same
year, a neighboring country

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:24.467
which bore a grudge toward the
kingdom invaded their territory.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.513
They responded accordingly, and
the army general sent his forces

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.515
to confront the enemy troops.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.309
Then it happened.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.687
As if they had anticipated
the strategy, the aristocrats

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.481
staged a revolt,
and the besieged country

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.568
was forced to respond
to that assault.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.030
Despite the solid castle walls
and the general's experience,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.742
the enemy had the overwhelming
advantage of sheer numbers.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.620
After an intense battle,
the hero was slain,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.247
and the castle ultimately fell.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.417
The city surrounding
the castle was set ablaze,

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.337
and the young man
was reduced to ash.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.964
The castle is said to have
burned for three days

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.799
and three nights.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.054
As for the mediocre king,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.223
he lamented his decisions after
seeing how they had cost

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.809
the young man his life.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.312
After losing its
stalwart general,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.189
the army was driven back.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.608
The neighboring countries
soon united forces

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.402
with the aristocrats',
continuing their advance

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.237
toward the royal capital.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.574
Even though the king rushed
to assemble his troops,

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.826
because of his failure to
prevent the young man

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.120
and army general
from being killed,

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.499
he found he no longer
had any allies.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.834
At that point, his only
option was to recruit

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:45.006
a volunteer militia, which did
not work out so well, either.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.385
The young man had made many
reforms throughout his life,

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.554
but while they had earned him
the animosity of the nobles,

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.140
they had also saved the people.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.267
After being indebted
to the young man,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.603
only later to be
the cause of his death,

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.564
the people turned
their backs on the king.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.110
Inevitably, the king found
himself isolated and helpless,

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.529
surrounded by
a vast army out for blood

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.990
and to destroy his kingdom.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:20.083
He had brought it
all upon himself.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.755
You make it sound
like you saw all of this.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.842
Yes, that's because I did.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.135
Huh?

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:34.139
In truth-- Well, more like
someone showed me.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.265
[SOUMA]
What do you mean?

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.308
How were you shown?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.562
I owe that gift
to my wife's abilities.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.900
Forgive me, I thought surely you
were aware my wife is able

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:49.612
to use the same sort of dark
magic that you also possess.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.281
[SOUMA]
It's been mentioned.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.868
Her ability is a fact of which
very few people are aware,

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.454
so I ask you tell no one.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:02.208
You see, my wife's dark magic
allows her to transfer memories

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.335
to people who exist in the past.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.336
[gasps]

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:08.548
So you're able to tell people
what hasn't even happened yet?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.133
Wait, what do you mean?

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.343
Have you come
to us from the future?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.054
[ELISHA] It's a little bit
different from that,

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.221
Your Majesty.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.556
Continue listening.

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.767
There's still a crucial part
left in the story

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.019
that I have yet to disclose.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.523
A wiser king would have
let that young man continue

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.319
with his reforms and
not banished him.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.073
Instead, I was swayed
by false accusations.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.533
If I had allowed him
to remain prime minister,

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:39.079
we would not be
experiencing this tragedy.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.747
What was I thinking?

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:43.124
I should have given him the
throne instead of making him

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.834
the prime minister.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:48.755
Ah. If only I had... I suspect
the boy would have ruled

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.508
the kingdom far better
than I ever could.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.552
If he were king, our daughter...

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.600
[ALBERT sobs]

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.437
You've had many failures
in respects here,

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.732
and as a result of those,
our fate has been sealed.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.318
But using my magic,
there's still a chance.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.529
I'll share your failure
to your past so you can

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.280
choose differently next time.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.366
What are you
talking about, Dear?

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:18.660
[ELISHA] At this point, you must
be aware of how I am able

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.495
to use dark magic.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.748
And because of these abilities
I have, I can transfer memories

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.501
of your experiences
to your former self.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.294
You're... You're serious...

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.047
When your past self
receives your later memories,

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.758
they'll vicariously
relive the experiences,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.095
feeling as if though time
itself had been rewound.

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.805
[gasps]

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.431
[ELISHA]
Your Majesty.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.558
There is something I have done

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.601
that I must
apologize to you for.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.145
And what is that?

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.106
[ELISHA] The true reason I chose
to marry you is because of

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.108
my memories passed
from the future.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.276
But why, dear?

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.069
[ELISHA]
Please forgive me, my dearest.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.739
No matter how strong
or valiant a husband I chose,

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.325
or how truly
brilliant they were,

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:02.662
the kingdom perished every time.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.832
Whatever the reason,
invasion by foreign enemies,

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.002
war with the demons,
insurrection by the nobility,

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.504
or even uprisings
by our own people.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.339
The outcome never changed.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.466
I saw the capital in flames.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.094
Then, by marrying me,
you were trying to prevent

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.971
the kingdom from falling?

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.848
And yet, here it
is again, nearly ready

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.058
to crumble while I'm its king.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.561
Yes. However, this
is also the first time

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.647
our country has
persisted for so long.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.232
It was also the
first permutation

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.942
in which I conceived a child.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.110
[gasps]

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.447
[ELISHA] While we are unable to
alter our present situation,

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.699
it's possible for us to
lead our past selves

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:44.329
to a future different from
this one, one without ruin.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.997
Yes, you're right.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.334
Let's convey this failure
to our former selves.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.670
After we have told them,
that version will relinquish

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.089
the throne to the young man.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.223
[ELISHA] What point in time
would be best?

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.099
[ALBERT]
You can choose that, too?

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.559
[ELISHA]
Yes.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.646
Then, after we summon the hero,

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.773
I want to hear him
speak about his policies

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.483
to strengthen the kingdom.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.526
It shall be done.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.488
To my past self, who
is only capable of making

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.324
mediocre choices,
at least make this one

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.952
correct decision for
once in your life!

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.453
[boom]

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.385
[SOUMA]
Is he talking about a time slip?

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.262
No, would it be a time leap?

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.639
Wait, since it's just their
memories and not the person,

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:45.890
is that different?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.267
Hold on a second.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.270
If that's true, wouldn't it
create a time paradox?

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.815
Guh. This isn't the cut-and-dry,
swords-and-sorcery world

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.441
I thought it was.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.782
[ALBERT] You must believe me.
I'm sorry about this.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.243
[SOUMA] I don't see any
reason for you to apologize!

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.787
This has been very difficult
for the version of me

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.832
who sent the memories as well
as the me who received them.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.835
I feel as though I have lived
the experience of appointing you

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.713
prime minister,
playing the damned fool,

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:20.383
then turning back time
to erase all my mistakes.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.928
My current self may have done
nothing wrong, and still,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.306
I cannot shake
this feeling of guilt.

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:30.393
On behalf of my previous self,
I am truly sorry.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.395
Now I understand clearly.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.314
You can apologize
if you want to,

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.607
but I don't remember
any of that happening.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:40.361
Please allow me the dignity
of admitting my failures, then.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:41.821
In that case, all right.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.698
I believe that should
sufficiently answer

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.075
your first and third questions.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.744
Yes, and I'm grateful.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.078
Just one more.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.664
Georg Carmine and his devotion.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.793
[gasps] Hold on. Did you speak
to him about all this?

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.546
[sighs] To be honest, I am
a weak man and wasn't

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.007
strong enough to bear the
burden of carrying the truth

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.301
on my shoulders alone.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.012
I could scarcely believe I would
be able to bring about

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.265
such a radically different
future all by myself.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.559
That is why I found
a man I could trust.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.354
It is why I told Georg Carmine
about everything

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.606
that I had witnessed.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.525
Ordinarily, if a king
exhibited similar behavior,

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.235
he would be considered mad.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.571
But instead, after listening,
the Duke nodded

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.574
his powerful head, and stated
that if I said it were true,

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.910
then it must be so.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.204
That means the strategy
of rooting out all

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.374
the corrupt aristocrats
was his idea.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:37.627
Even though Castor was growing
more and more suspicious,

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.421
unfortunately, we could not
reveal our complete strategy

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.383
to him, and that created
a lot of extra trouble for you,

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.759
I'm afraid.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.511
[SOUMA]
We tried playing Georg.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.930
In the end, we were played.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:52.141
Here I was, thinking we were
blazing our own trail,

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.520
when we were following a track
that was laid before us.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:59.023
What can I say?
This is certainly humbling.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.109
Indeed, isn't that the truth?

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.153
But the fact remains, you led
us into a different future

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.531
that never existed before.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.034
You annexed Amidonia and
rebuilt the entire nation,

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.745
transforming it into
the Kingdom of Friedonia.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.206
I don't see how my decision
to yield the throne to you

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.292
was misguided in any way.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.962
[SOUMA] And I'm pleased
to hear you say that,

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.756
but at what point did
the future begin changing?

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.842
From the very beginning, yes?

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.635
[ELISHA chuckles]
This time around,

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.847
Your Majesty had Liscia
by his side from the start.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:35.017
Wait, Liscia? Did she exist
in that other future, too?

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.770
[ALBERT] You ran into her
at Randel Castle.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.106
She was serving as
the executive secretary

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.942
for Georg's forces, you see.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:46.612
Not only did Liscia recognize
your talents almost immediately

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.448
the way she did
in this timeline,

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.992
but she apparently
fell in love with you.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.703
And then, after your dismissal,
she made a personal plea

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.746
to reverse my decision.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.081
However...

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.876
My husband was yet too afraid
of the aristocrats and therefore

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.712
didn't heed his own
daughter's advice.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.882
Liscia left the capital
looking quite upset.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.342
And returned to Randel Castle,
which was later reduced

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.803
to ashes by the nobles.

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:18.019
But wait, what about
the friends I appointed?

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.021
Hakuya, and the others?

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.065
They weren't around because
you weren't allowed to make

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.067
your Gemstone Broadcast.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:28.112
I had adopted the view of those
who respected the custom

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.739
and then refused
to let you use it

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.158
for any other intended purpose.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.160
[SOUMA]
Now that I think about it...

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.163
Most of the personnel
we recruited came along

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.957
after we sent out
Gemstone Broadcasts.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:44.504
Which leads me to believe that
was a tremendous turning point.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:47.256
And the only way I was
allowed to do it in the end,

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.175
was because I was king,

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.803
and my engagement to Liscia,
which gave me legitimacy.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.432
[SOUMA] Without either
working in my favor,

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.684
we may have never been able to
silence those who objected

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.394
to how we used the Gemstones.

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.772
When you think
about it like that...

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.107
Y'know, Liscia's
starting to look like

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.734
the goddess of victory.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:10.780
It seems so. I hope you'll
take good care of her.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.448
Right.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.993
And with that, I have officially
passed on everything of value

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.913
I know to you, and it
would appear that my role

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.457
is finally at an end now.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.460
We've decided to leave
the castle and to go away

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:26.671
and live in secrecy.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.631
[gasps]
Why is that?

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.467
If the former royalty
continues lingering around,

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.678
it will give people
certain ideas.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.764
Once we witnessed
a different future materialize,

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.809
we both agreed we
would go into hiding.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.686
[SOUMA]
Hmm.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.771
[ALBERT] We know for certain
we can leave the kingdom

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.565
in your capable hands.

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.900
We'll be counting
on you, my son.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.360
Thank you for everything.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.362
Father, Mother.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.573
I will not let you two down.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:55.950
[BOTH chuckle]

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.129
Actually... I'd like
to ask you one last question.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.672
Yes, of course.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.966
[SOUMA] In the world where
I was the prime minister,

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.802
did you ever locate
Liscia's and my remains?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.805
There was nothing
left to find but ashes.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.474
There was no sign
of either of your remains.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.811
In that case, there's a chance
Liscia could've survived.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.187
--[gasps]
--Beg your pardon?

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.982
Majesty? What leads
you to say that?

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.191
It's simple.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:32.361
I would never let that happen to
her without putting up a fight.

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:33.404
[gasps]

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.115
[SOUMA] Shame, honor,
it wouldn't mean anything.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.576
I would have
made sure she escaped.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:42.330
If you didn't find our bodies,
perhaps that means we got away.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.081
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.633
[ALBERT]
Thank you, my son...

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:55.468
For everything.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.643
[LISCIA] What are you
doing out here in the cold?

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:04.852
[SOUMA]
Oh, Liscia.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.313
Don't you "Oh, Liscia" me.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.482
You should at least
be wearing this.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.653
[LISCIA] What did you
talk to my Father about?

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.738
Something I can't
share just yet.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.572
Sure.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.491
You accepted that
quicker than I thought.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.118
In my experience, if you have
to keep a secret from me,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.329
then there's a good reason why.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.707
Besides, when the time
comes to talk about it,

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.335
I know you'll tell
me everything.

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.007
[LISCIA]
The New Year's fireworks

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.051
should be starting soon.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.637
Let's just stay
like this until then.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.430
[SOUMA]
Yeah.

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:46.769
Ah, it's snowing!

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.938
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.906
[LISCIA]
Uh...

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.491
Huh...?

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.996
[LISCIA]
Ah--

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.915
Oh. Souma.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.667
[SOUMA]
The truth is...

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:14.463
The truth is, I need to tell you
something before Aisha and Juna.

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:17.842
Liscia... will you marry me?

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.760
I am in love with you.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.682
My answer is,
"You took your time."

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:28.561
But also, I am in love
with you, too.

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.646
And yes, I will.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:53.252
[SOUMA] Hello there, and happy
new year to all of you.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.754
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:00.760
I'm sorry. That's what we say at
this time back where I'm from.

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.512
I see. As you
probably figured out,

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:06.474
we don't really have a way
of celebrating the new year.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.225
Yeah, I know.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.019
The reason I asked
you all here is to make

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.979
New Year's resolutions.

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:16.066
Though it's kinda a pain
making it sound so formal.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.068
--[SOUMA] Hakuya.
--Yes?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.822
You and I make a great team.
Lend me your insight.

00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:24.033
[HAKUYA]
Of course, Your Majesty.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.494
--Poncho?
--[PONCHO] Y-Yes, Your Majesty?

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.996
[SOUMA] I expect great things
from your taste buds.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.165
Find even more
ingredients for us to eat.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:34.210
Also, keep inventing
delicious recipes.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.545
You bet I will. Yes.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:37.379
[SOUMA]
Roroa?

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.257
[ROROA] No need to be
so formal with me, Darling.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.636
Use your financial know-how
to bolster up the kingdom.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:46.847
Yeah, I'm a merchant, what else
do you expect me to do?

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:49.308
When I make money,
the country makes money.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.228
So in the end,
everyone comes out smiling!

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:54.688
--[SOUMA] Juna?
--Yes, Your Majesty?

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.315
The Gemstone Broadcasts.

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.943
I'm going to add
even more programs.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:03.280
As our songstress, keep giving
hope to all our people.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.950
If that is your desire, I shall.

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:06.867
[SOUMA]
Tomoe?

00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.035
Yes?

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:11.121
As the kingdom continues
growing, and voices need

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:14.500
to be heard, your skill
becomes more crucial.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.001
So stick with it.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.379
I will, Big Brother.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.505
Aisha.

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.674
[AISHA]
Yes?

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:25.261
As our best warrior,
please keep protecting me,

00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:28.597
and be careful not to let your
stomach get the better of you.

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:31.058
Your Majesty, tell me why
am I the only one here

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.060
who gets a lecture, huh?

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:38.023
Liscia, I--

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.650
There's no need to say a word.

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:43.028
You'll always have
my support, Souma.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.656
It's only natural,
since you are our king.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.578
When I spoke
to Albert yesterday,

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:54.123
he left the future of our
kingdom in my hands.

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:57.376
Although, it's not something
I can handle alone.

00:22:57.418 --> 00:23:01.630
I need everyone here-- No,
everyone in the kingdom's help

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:04.675
for the sake of the future.

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:08.053
Family... lend me
your assistance.

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:10.389
Our king...

00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:13.392
[ROROA] Darling, the king
isn't supposed to bow to us!

00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:14.685
[JUNA]
She's right, Your Majesty.

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:16.395
Lift your head.

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:23.277
I, for one, can't wait to see
the future you'll build.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.571
[PONCHO] If-- I-If you order
me to, Your Majesty,

00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:27.907
I would take up arms
for you, yes!

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.450
--[laughing]
--[SOUMA] Thank you, Poncho,

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:30.951
but there's no need.

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.746
I want all of you to strive
to do what you can

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:36.999
by using whatever
strengths you have.

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:40.419
Do that, and together,
we'll make this kingdom

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:42.504
into something great!
