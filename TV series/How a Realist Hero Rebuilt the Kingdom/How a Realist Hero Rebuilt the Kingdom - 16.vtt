WEBVTT

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:15.307
[HAKUYA] This is the Kingdom
of Elfrieden's decision:

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.143
We will give back Van to the
Principality of Amidonia

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.395
and return to our country.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.314
The conditions
of this return are:

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.650
The Principality of Amidonia
is hereby ordered

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.902
to pay the Kingdom of
Elfrieden war reparations

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.153
for their invasion.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.366
Furthermore, this payment
is separate from monies

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.868
negotiated for the return
of prisoners of war.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:12.883
[JULIUS]
Answer me, Jeanne!

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.801
What is the meaning of this?

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.345
[JEANNE] You wanted your
lands returned to you,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.180
and that's exactly what I did.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.182
Is this your idea of a bad joke?

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.017
You know how paying
reparations will look?

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.227
As if our nation's
admitting defeat!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.146
[JEANNE] I'm afraid that's
unavoidable since that is

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.397
what happened.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.775
You did lose your capital,
after all.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.817
[JULIUS]
You're wrong!

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.694
We haven't been defeated yet!

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.530
We just had one of our cities
conquered, that's all!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.449
[JEANNE] In that case,
the empire withdraws from

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.536
this mediation and
will play no further role.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.872
By all means, go to war
or take whatever action

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.332
you desire.

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.168
As I recall, you couldn't
reclaim Van without asking

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.503
for the Empire's help.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.009
Deny it all you want,
you have lost.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.887
Serving as head of
the Mankind Declaration,

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.683
the empire has now considered
this dispute settled.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.310
Van has been returned, now pay.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.521
But... General!

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.147
Paying them reparations will--

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.775
And you should know,
my sister, Empress Maria,

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.195
is terribly saddened
by this whole affair.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.740
The Declaration cannot overlook
this act of aggression,

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.910
or the attempt to justify such
actions through the treaty.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:25.414
As I said, the battle
was Gaius's call.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.375
[JEANNE] Even so, to ensure
other member nations will not

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:31.795
follow your example and attempt
similar military action,

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:33.922
severe punishment is required.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.174
Your nation will serve
as a precedent.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.388
[JULIUS]
I see. And what if we refuse?

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.226
Then the empire will
withdraw its support

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:49.771
and we will expel Amidonia
from the Mankind Declaration.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.607
Huh? But that is
just utter madness!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.318
You can't expel a
signatory on a whim!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.863
[JEANNE] As I mentioned earlier,
you instigated this act

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.115
of aggression using
a broad interpretation

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.825
of the Mankind Declaration.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.745
If we permit that,
there will be other countries

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.538
who might try similar actions.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.039
And knowing my sister, Maria,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.500
she will not look kindly
upon those who do.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.756
[SOUMA] The Principality of
Amidonia is surrounded on

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.467
four sides, each by
a different nation.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.511
If they lose the protections of
the Mankind Declaration now,

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.848
they could get preyed upon
by the other three countries.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.809
During his reign, Gaius the
Eighth protected the country

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.936
on the northern and southern
borders by flexing

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.396
his military might.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.441
One could argue he was able to
maintain a sense of diplomacy,

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:36.109
albeit in his own style.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.446
The question is whether Julius
possesses the same acumen.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.993
[JULIUS]
Your mediation plan is accepted.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.536
A wise choice, Julius.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.079
A deal's been reached.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.459
Now that's settled,
let us begin negotiating

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.669
a specific amount.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.922
The Kingdom of Elfrieden
requests two years' worth

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.966
of the Principality of
Amidonia's annual budget.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.511
Of course we do not
intend for you to make

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.805
this payment all at once.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.932
Rather over the next ten years.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.143
Also, these payments are to
be made in imperial coinage.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.312
[JULIUS] Two years' worth
of our annual budget?

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.855
What makes you think
I'd ever agree to such

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.357
an exorbitant amount?

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.735
[JEANNE]
Were you listening?

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.487
Did you miss where
they said it's to be paid

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.072
in imperial coinage?

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.784
If you refuse them,
it won't concern us.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:29.162
However, I think you should
be aware, by doing so,

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.248
the city of Van won't
be returned to you.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.340
More than 50% of
Amidonia's annual budget

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:44.469
goes toward the military,
so if we're taking 20%.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.639
We want to deprive him of what
they used to spend on them.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.517
Will Julius be able to
scale that back, though?

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.936
If I may ask, Jeanne,
what if one of the payments

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.688
becomes overdue?

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.648
[JEANNE] Then the empire will
support the Kingdom of

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.567
Elfrieden's bid to annex Van.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.280
While I believe you are a person
of great integrity, Julius,

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.365
it's still conceivable that
someone in your court

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.367
could end up delaying payment.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.871
Which is why I would
like some collateral.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.539
That's interesting.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.417
What exactly did
you have in mind?

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.961
A Gemstone to make
future broadcasts.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.590
Huh? We have only one
in the entire country!

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.509
Wait. You're planning
to incite the people!

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.469
[SOUMA] All you would have to
do is change the receivers'

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.054
frequencies, right?

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.015
After that, you would
prevent them from receiving

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.559
any transmissions
from Elfrieden.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.936
[JULIUS]
Even though that is true...

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.230
[SOUMA]
Before you protest--

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.399
I want to be forward and say
I don't think the Gemstone

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:40.901
is enough collateral.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.695
To make up for the shortfall,
I'd like to take possession

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.448
of the books in
the castle's library.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.284
Ha! Why didn't you just say so?

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.620
Take all the dusty relics
off our hands you want.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.751
[SOUMA]
Very well.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.212
All right. Let's put other
matters before us to bed.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.590
You're holding several
of our soldiers captive.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.468
I demand they be freed
as part of the arrangement!

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.719
Fine by me.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.013
But for knights, or for
any higher ranking,

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.223
and nobles you will
pay a ransom.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.268
Furthermore, after your
country invaded ours,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.021
we launched an investigation to
uncover those who committed

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.316
war crimes and compiled
a list of those individuals.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.526
We cannot consent to
turning over any captives

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.028
whose names are on the list.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.491
I agree to your terms.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.452
Among the criminals listed
there, we request those

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:36.539
who remain in your country
be turned over to us.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.875
As soon as that
handover is completed,

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.710
we will begin returning
your prisoners.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.925
Among the captured,
is there a "Roroa"?

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:50.220
Roroa? Is that an
acquaintance of yours?

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:54.307
[JULIUS] She shares the Amidonia
name and is my unworthy sister.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.850
You have a sibling?

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.311
I heard before the fighting
broke out, she fled,

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:01.856
along with other
influential bureaucrats.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.441
All right, then.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.944
We can search for her
on our end, if you'd like.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.112
[JULIUS]
Not necessary.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.489
[LISCIA] He's trying to prevent
any dispute over his succession

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.782
to the throne.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.075
[SOUMA]
Huh?

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.285
Despite being one of
his few relatives left

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.162
now that Gaius is
no longer around...

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.748
It's not uncommon among royalty.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.500
Even in the
Kingdom of Elfrieden,

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.836
there was an awful
successorship struggle,

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.547
at least until my
mother took the throne.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.549
I'm sure it's a reality.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.135
I only wish it wasn't.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.345
In my view, as someone
without a family,

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.222
I couldn't imagine not
wanting to take care of my

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:37.183
one and only sister.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.811
One last matter,
concerning General Margarita,

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.772
we would like to have
her remain in the kingdom.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.858
[JULIUS] You want General
Margarita Wonder?

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.444
If you will release five of the
noblemen you are holding

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.864
without any ransom, then we
will gladly accept your offer.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.949
[JEANNE]
I won't interfere.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.744
But from what I understand,
she worked alongside

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.288
the kingdom after
the occupation.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:01.041
In my opinion, you could have
driven a harder bargain.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.626
Giving her up in exchange
for a mere five noblemen

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.711
is unwise.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.172
[SOUMA]
Very well. We accept your terms.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.426
[JULIUS] She's served as a
competent general, but why,

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.262
out of all my officers,
choose her specifically?

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.223
Someone who only judges people
based on their military value,

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.808
wouldn't understand.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.045
[SOUMA] So, in exchange
for returning Van,

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.047
Elfrieden receives compensation.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.549
A very generous
amount, actually.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.385
As for you, in return
for paying reparations,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.513
you get your capital back.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.848
Furthermore, as acting
mediator in this dispute,

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.018
the empire has
demonstrated a fair approach.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.854
I am satisfied with
the result, for now.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.148
There's only one
satisfied party here!

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.691
You've crippled our country!

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.068
If you'll excuse me!

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.657
[SOUMA]
Before you go...

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.827
Now what is it?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.829
Where I come from,
a famed political thinker

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.289
named Machiavelli
said the following:

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.874
"Power acquired
through difficulty

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.251
you'll keep with ease.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.877
Those who acquire it
without keep it

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.380
with immense difficulty."

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.632
Hm? What does that mean?

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.509
[SOUMA] When I defeated
you and took Van,

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.177
I purged all the nobles.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.179
Not only them,
but your knights too,

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:41.432
and any other potential
political opponents.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.892
All on my own merits.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:46.146
So even if I were to somehow
continue governing Van,

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.815
I wouldn't have very many
obstacles in my way.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.860
But you, that's
a different matter.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.404
When you return to power,
will you be able to govern

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:55.738
without incident?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.410
You forget, this was
my city to begin with!

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.579
Just one moment!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.081
This is your land but
you didn't win it back.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:08.251
You relied on the empire, an
outside force, to reclaim it.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.462
Machiavelli called it "acquiring
power without difficulty."

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.755
But that's not all.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.591
He also said the following:

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.551
"One who becomes a prince
without hardships

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:19.929
must exercise great
effort to remain so."

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.223
Julius, I suggest directing
your efforts to helping

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.267
--the people of--
--Who asked your opinion?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.319
[JEANNE] I wonder what the
people of Amidonia will think.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.072
When he resumes control over
a city he couldn't take back.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.867
He was a fool to ignore
your warning, Souma,

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.202
but what else is new?

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.521
We weren't here for very long,
but now that we're leaving,

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.190
I'm going to miss the city.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.525
Remaining in Van would have
been a waste of funds.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.444
Not to mention a waste of time.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.613
Several issues within our
Kingdom remain unaddressed,

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:19.656
Your Majesty.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.032
[SOUMA]
Yeah, yeah, I'm well aware!

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.620
Is it just me, or do most of
the citizens look downtrodden?

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:26.746
Huh?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.917
They're probably
anxious about falling under

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.669
Amidonian reign again.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.420
Even though everything
will go back to the way

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.755
they remember it being?

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:40.051
[SOUMA] Precisely why. They
were living under oppression.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.762
That's what they
came to expect daily.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.764
However, when they were
under the occupation

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.517
of the Kingdom, they learned
that there was more

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.143
to life than tyranny.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.353
[LISCIA]
That is true.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.522
You allowed them the freedom
to express their thoughts

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:55.316
and feelings, and
without repercussions.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.484
[SOUMA]
Exactly.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.944
They're anxious whether
or not they're coming

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.698
under an age of dictatorship
all over again.

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.284
And more than likely,
that will be the case.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.203
Knowing Julius, he'll crack
down on the relaxed mood

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.205
they've adopted.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.124
Now that they've finally
gotten a taste of what

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:14.794
freedom's like they can't
go back to their old lives.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.337
Almost like an addiction.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.841
[SOUMA] Fair point, and I
understand where you're

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:23.011
coming from, but I wish there
was a better comparison.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.762
[LISCIA]
It's true, isn't it?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:28.057
Still, it's not that easy to
change the entire mindset

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.100
of a nation.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.852
Back in the world
where I come from,

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.104
we have a saying that
goes, "Tyranny is more terrible

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.731
than tigers."

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.441
[LISCIA]
I don't quite understand.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.192
Could you explain it?

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.486
It means that an oppressive
government is fiercer

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.114
than a man-eating tiger.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:47.827
To the citizens of Van, yes, we
might have been invading tigers.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.496
But in no way were we tyrants.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:53.041
And now that they know their
old way of life's returning.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.919
Strange how the more
I walk by your side,

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.173
the more I see how people
react during harsh times.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.133
Had all you can stomach?

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.135
--Not even close! Bring it on!
--No way! Bring it on, sire!

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.970
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.638
[AISHA chuckles]

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.391
No path walked with His
Majesty is ever too difficult!

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.393
You know I feel
the same way, right?

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:16.314
I promise. I'll travel any road
as long as it's with you.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.775
I get nothing but hardship,
but that's normal.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.526
[SOUMA]
Uh, you're welcome?

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:24.989
[AISHA, LISCIA laugh]

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.913
[JEANNE] Sister, I have returned
from Amidonia's capital city

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:32.955
of Van.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.918
I'm relieved to see
you're home, Jeanne.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.545
So, how did everything go?

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.382
There was a little bit of
trouble, but for the most part,

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:45.009
things turned out
the way we hoped.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.136
I'm pleased to announce
the return of Van

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.972
to the Principality of
Amidonia is complete.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.474
Just as planned.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.851
Thank you for your efforts.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:54.811
Well done.

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.021
Now, that is enough
of this talking shop!

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.398
I beg your pardon?

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.984
Welcome home, my dearest sister!

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.736
Where's this coming from?

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.406
Such inappropriate
behavior for an empress!

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:09.075
Do you have any idea how
lonely I was not being able

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.994
to see my sweet sister's
face for so long?

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.996
You know how everyone
outside of family treats me

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.291
like the empress, and our other
sister just stays cooped up

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.420
inside her laboratory,
the same as always!

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.629
[JEANNE]
Don't give me that!

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.215
You're not a child anymore!

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.383
[MARIA]
Aww...

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.386
So, tell me everything!

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.305
Just what kind of man
is this King Souma?

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:33.391
Well, he is unique.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.851
Stop holding back already.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.980
He keeps a bed in his office.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:41.691
Then again you do the same,
so that's nothing new.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.068
Go on!

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.111
First of all,

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.864
Souma is well aware of
the empire's intentions

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.532
and doesn't bear us
any ill-will regarding

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.909
the hero summoning.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.536
[MARIA]
Thank goodness.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.831
What's more,
he's very intelligent.

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:57.999
He says where he comes from,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.251
these things are
common knowledge,

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.421
but comes up with one
innovation after another.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.965
Using Gemstones for
media broadcasts?

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.592
I never would have
thought of that.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.136
That's his intention
for using the Gemstone?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.847
And this is the best part
so prepare yourself.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.432
Since he's from
a different world,

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.559
he actually wondered aloud

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:19.645
if the relationship between
monsters and demons here

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.440
was no different than
animals and people!

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.568
What? Surely he
wasn't being serious!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.320
Are monsters and
demons the same,

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.281
the way that animals
and people interact?

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.992
I confess, I've never
thought about it that way.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.328
After you hear how
he sees the world,

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:37.413
you can't help but wonder
how different his view is

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.248
from ours.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.958
It seems so.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.629
Also, he proposed a
secret alliance with us.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.506
He wants us to work together?

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:47.882
Indeed.

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.092
During discussions, Souma
promised that he'd work

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:53.513
with the empire as long as
you aimed to unite mankind.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:57.141
Additionally, in the event
an invasion should occur,

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.810
the empire would defend
an attack from the west.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.521
While the kingdom
would be responsible

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.356
for defending the east.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.690
[MARIA laughs]

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.983
You're laughing?

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.694
I do not see how any of
this is humorous, Maria!

00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.947
[MARIA laughs]

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.741
I'm sorry, sister!
But how can I not?

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.868
Would you care to explain?

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.287
[MARIA] It wasn't that long ago,
we had to show Elfrieden

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:22.291
special consideration as their
kingdom was facing its decline.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.085
Then all of a sudden,
we're such good friends,

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.212
we can entrust the safety
of the whole eastern half

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:29.215
of the continent in their hands.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.175
[MARIA] It's such a reversal,
you would think a fairy

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.928
cast a spell of illusion.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.388
I'm sure of one thing.

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:38.307
Recent events have been
moving at a dizzying pace.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:42.270
Yes. Truly they have, Jeanne.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:45.648
Say, do you remember,
specifically, what it states

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.276
a hero is supposed
to do for the kingdom?

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.777
[JEANNE]
It was in the report.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:53.656
"One who will lead the
revolution into a new age."

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.325
[MARIA] And yet, nothing
about ruling the world,

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:59.620
or being the one who will
defeat the Demon Lord.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:00.705
Yeah, good point.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.708
But it just doesn't feel right
assigning him that title yet.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.379
When you consider all
of the hectic changes

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.465
we've seen lately, indeed,
it feels like a revolution

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.633
is happening.

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:25.104
This Souma is more
fascinating than I thought.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.608
Ah. I can't wait to communicate
with him directly.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.327
And here I was just thinking
you weren't going

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.703
to come out with us tonight.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.122
Well of course he would
make an appearance!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.082
After all, he is a
fellow adventurer.

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:48.669
I thought you said
you just ran into him

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.129
at the guild, Juno.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.423
You sure you didn't twist his
arm to get him to show?

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.928
Adventurers one and all!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.014
Welcome to Parnam Castle.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:04.018
As you may know,
I am the fiancÃ©e of King Souma.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.063
Liscia Elfrieden.
It's an honor.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.398
I am here tonight
in place of Souma,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.109
who was unable to attend
due to his hectic schedule.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.195
He's asked me to
say a few words.

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.072
I want to thank everyone
of you very much

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.991
for taking on
this latest request.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.869
Because of your efforts,
countless of our people's lives

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.996
have been spared.

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:26.666
On the absent King's
behalf, but also,

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:29.794
the people of the kingdom,
I extend our thanks.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.129
We are in your debt.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.548
And with that, a toast!

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.384
[ADVENTURERS]
Cheers!

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.597
Hey, slow down there, Augus!

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.057
Would you mind leaving
a little tatsuta-age

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.308
for the rest of us?

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:51.649
So I've been doing some
thinking about what happened.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:52.692
Listen up.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.112
There's a real good chance that
whole flame pierrot scare

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.530
was just made up, so--

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.950
Do me a favor and don't
be such a party-pooper.

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.411
These octopus
skewers are delicious.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.871
Open and say "ahh."

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.916
[DECE]
My mouth's already full!

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:09.917
For crying out loud.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.544
Are you drunk already, Julia?

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.795
[JULIA]
What if I am?

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.839
This is a benefit banquet
for adventures

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.465
hosted by the kingdom, isn't it?

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:18.050
[JUNO chuckles]

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:27.935
[JUNO]
Here's yours.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.937
As a member of the party,
you have to celebrate

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.522
with the rest of us!

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.528
You better drink up, or am
I'm gonna hafta serve it

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.071
to you mouth-to-mouth?

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.741
Okay then.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:44.118
Let's down as much
as we can tonight!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.327
Juno's right.

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.912
You're one of us now!

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:52.126
So pull down that mask
and drink already!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.462
A mug for each one
of your party members!

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.130
Yeah! It's on us!

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.802
[JUNO]
Whoa, you okay, Master?

00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:04.221
Should've told us you
were a lightweight.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.891
Gimme a sign if you can hear me.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.350
[LISCIA]
Pardon. Coming through.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.645
[JUNO] Aren't-- aren't you
P-Princess Liscia?

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.193
[LISCIA sighs] Congratulations.
You almost gave yourself away.

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:20.404
I'll take over from here.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:23.783
[JUNO]
Uh... Huh?

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.130
What's wrong?

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:40.257
Is there something on my face?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.343
'Cause I'll die of
embarrassment.

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.720
No, It's nothing.
A pleasure to meet you.

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:47.056
Please, enjoy the rest
of the evening.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:48.098
[JUNO]
Huh?

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:53.896
Could you make the room
stop spinning, please?

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.231
[LISCIA] If you didn't
want to get found out,

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.024
why'd you join them
in the first place?

00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.610
You even hid inside
your costume.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.904
[SOUMA]
What other choice did I have?

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.240
I need to socialize
occasionally, you know.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.120
By the way, was that
Juno back there?

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.039
She's pretty cute,
don't you think?

00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:13.791
There's nothing going
on between me and her

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.042
if that's what you mean!

00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:19.171
Well, I wasn't really
asking, but thanks for

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.714
letting me know, all the same.
