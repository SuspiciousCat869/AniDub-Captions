00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.303
[SOUMA] The Elfrieden
Kingdom's total military force

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.348
is said to be roughly
100,000 strong.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.475
The army, led by
Duke Georg Carmine,

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:18.685
numbers 40,000.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.230
The navy, led by
Duchess Excel Walter,

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.023
numbers 10,000.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.609
The air force, led by
Duke Castor Vargas,

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.402
numbers only 1,000.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.905
Though, it is said that
one Wyvern Knight

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:33.617
is equal to 100 foot soldiers.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.994
Furthermore, there's
the Forbidden Army,

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.705
which is composed of the
Royal Guard under the king.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.832
Combined with private
armies of noblemen,

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.460
their numbers total
40,000 strong.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.379
Also, there are hired swords,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.297
dispatched as part
of the service contract

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.633
with the Mercenary State
of Zem under the leadership

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.718
of the Forbidden Army,
but their employment

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.303
has been terminated.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.639
The reason being soldiers
who fight for profit

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.599
readily change sides.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.101
They have only one loyalty.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.894
Whoever pays most.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:04.398
When a military force fights
for money and not country,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.900
they do more harm than good.

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:09.111
Now then, to explain why
the Forbidden Army

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.363
is smaller than the
Three Dukedom's forces.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.490
requires a bit
of history lesson.

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:14.741
The kingdom was
originally founded

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.579
when various races decided
they should join forces.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.082
Humans were the most populous,
so one of their own became king.

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.626
But in order to preserve
the rights of the other races,

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.170
the top leaders of the three
armed forces over air,

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.132
sea, and land were chosen
from among these people.

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.969
It was a contingency plan
in case a human tyrant

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.470
were to begin oppressing them.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.556
The system allowed the
Three Dukedoms' forces,

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.182
which outnumber
the Forbidden Army,

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.350
to resist them.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.187
At a glance, this may
look well‐designed,

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.356
but a decision‐making
body split into groups

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.525
has many disadvantages
for a state.

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.945
For some reason,
when I contacted them

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:54.573
about my reforms,
the Three Dukes decided

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:57.075
to give me the silent treatment.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.202
Because of these circumstances,

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.247
I had the freedom to take
some time off, and honestly?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.832
I was actually enjoying it.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.428
[KAEDE]
Out of the question!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.638
And do not make
me repeat myself.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.682
[HALBERT] It's not like you're
going to change my mind!

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.477
[SOUMA] Going off those ears,
maybe another mystic wolf,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.562
like Tomoe?

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.273
No, she isn't.
That girl is a mystic fox.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.482
Huh?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.152
You can easily tell
by looking at her tail.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.112
[SOUMA]
Uh...

00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:59.030
[AISHA]
Clearly belongs to a fox.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.408
Oh, right, definitely.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.201
You wouldn't want to
mistake mystic wolves

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.870
for mystic foxes.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.080
That's an easy way to
make both races mad.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.999
Oh. Thanks for letting me know.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.835
[SOUMA]
Other worlds are hard.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.963
Of all people, I wasn't
expecting to see

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.299
Halbert Magna here.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.884
[SOUMA]
You know him?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.137
[LISCIA] He's the oldest heir to
the prestigious Magna family.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.930
Ever since his days
in the academy,

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.600
he's shown himself to be
an outstanding horseman.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.434
[AISHA]
Ah!

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.352
That's a challenge
I cannot pass up.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.396
Now, Aisha, she said
he was outstanding,

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.981
not the best.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.066
After graduating, he was
supposed to take a post

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.234
in the army.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.278
Why's he in the capital?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.697
[SOUMA] Hmm.
And what about the girl?

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.199
Dunno.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.368
[JUNA]
That is Miss Kaede Foxia.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.663
Actually, she comes in
here relatively regularly.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.832
If I remember right,
she said that she was a mage

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.626
with the Forbidden Army.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.753
I'm begging you, Hal! Please!

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.423
You mustn't go over to the
Carmine Duchy right now!

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.091
You know the Duke
is outright defying

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.927
the new king of Elfrieden.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.806
Worst‐case scenario, we're
looking at potential civil war.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.974
That's the whole
reason for switching.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.684
If there's going to be a war,
this is my chance

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.813
to finally make my
mark on the world.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.523
I hope you realize
there's more to war

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.274
than just advancement.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.859
Your father's worried about you.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.486
He requested you come
back because he doesn't

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.029
want you doing anything rash!

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.781
My old man has nothing
to do with this!

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.325
He served under Duke Carmine's
command for years!

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.285
But when it's time to
confront this new king,

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.162
my father refuses to fight!

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.581
Instead, he hides away
in the capital!

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.626
I don't have to listen
to a word he says!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.129
He clearly understands the
situation better than you.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.923
When it comes to Duke Carmine,

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.050
he refuses to heed the
king's call and stays

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.510
in his own lands.

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:45.053
It's insubordinate!

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.684
[KAEDE] He hasn't been
acting like himself lately.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.102
If we fight amongst ourselves,

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:55.188
it only benefits the
neighboring countries.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.649
The Principality of Amidonia
will do whatever it takes

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.317
to win back the territory
that was seized

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.152
by Elfrieden two kings ago.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.697
Most of the Republic of
Turgis's land is frozen.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.449
They want rich soil and
a harbor that won't freeze.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.038
If a civil war breaks out, I
guarantee they'll invade us.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.582
Duke Carmine
hasn't figured it out,

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.542
otherwise he wouldn't
be acting this way.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.964
First, let's go over the
surrounding countries.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.716
There are the nations
that border our kingdom

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.801
in the southeast end
of the continent.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.428
They include the Union
of Eastern Nations

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.847
to the north and the
Principality of Amidonia

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.765
to the west.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.144
To the southeast is
the Republic of Turgis.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.771
Also, in the sea, to the east,

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.900
there is the Nine‐Headed
Dragon Archipelago Union.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.861
Then, west of the
Principality of Amidonia,

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.155
lies the Mercenary State Zem.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.489
There are no countries
with whom we have

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:47.991
friendly relations.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.035
Four of them are
neutral while one of them

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.745
is hostile.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.998
So, basically, we don't
have any allies.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.375
[HAKUYA] With all due respect,
because of the chaos

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.377
from the Demon Lord's
Domain expanding,

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.130
this is not uncommon.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.216
Presently, each nation is wary
of the others' intentions.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.594
The truth is the only allies
they see as trustworthy

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.055
are their own tributary states.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.556
[SOUMA sighs]

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.309
So, which territory's hostile?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.561
Is it Amidonia? Zem?

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.521
Or perhaps Turgis?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.941
[HAKUYA] First of all,
we can exclude Zem.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.234
To be frank, the choice to
terminate the mercenary

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.570
service contract left
relations with their country

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.489
somewhat strained, but still,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.741
I would not call them hostile.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:30.909
However,

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.078
Amidonia is antagonistic
towards us,

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.246
and if we requested
reinforcements,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.290
they would likely
send mercenaries.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.044
Getting in some payback
while also getting paid,

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.295
is that it?

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.297
Come winter,
Turgis will be isolated

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.715
by the ice and snow.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.676
So geopolitically,
they adopt a policy

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.552
of heading north.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.388
But why north?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.223
Right, I forgot in this
world it gets warmer

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.350
the farther you travel
in that direction.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.186
[HAKUYA] They may be watching
carefully for an opening,

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.896
but if we gave them one,

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.606
I doubt they would
be openly aggressive

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.984
towards us.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.070
Basically, we have to
guard against Amidonia.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.154
Which is strange.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.074
They did offer to send
assistance, if I remember right.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.158
Yes.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.119
"The stability of our
neighbor, Elfrieden,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.538
is directly related to our
own national defense,

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.707
thus, if requested, we will
send reinforcements

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.251
to put down the hostile
Three Dukedoms."

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.129
As they so eloquently put it.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.089
Thing is, it wouldn't
surprise me if they made

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.050
very similar offers
to the Dukes, as well.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.261
"Let's work together to
overthrow the false king,

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.847
Souma, usurper of
the Elfrieden throne."

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.806
About right?

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.641
[chuckles]

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.768
Obviously their plan
is to exploit the strife

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.603
with the Three Dukedoms
so they can expand

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.272
their territory.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.649
They'll see their chance to
send troops into our lands,

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.109
calling them reinforcements,

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.069
then capture several
of our cities.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.113
Amidonia will weigh
their options,

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.323
whether their assistance to
Your Majesty or the Duchies

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.243
is more advantageous,
then aid that side.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.412
[SOUMA] And after they've
occupied various cities,

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.456
they'll come up with some
reasoning to annex them

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.458
as part of their country.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.376
Sadly, it's a rather
common tactic,

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.295
but quite effective nonetheless.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.629
I'll bet.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.173
This is a real problem.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.009
Well, all the Dukes are
likely wise to Amidonia's

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.552
true motives.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.929
So, regardless of how
much they dislike me,

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.973
they won't let themselves
be taken advantage of

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.642
by another country.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.936
At least, I sure
hope that's the case.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.607
There's still one issue, though.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.567
How can the Dukes
needlessly oppose the king

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.152
when the neighboring
countries are looking for

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.362
any opportunity to pounce?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.573
What are they thinking?

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.618
[SOUMA] Yeah, that is
the question, isn't it?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.661
Duke Carmine isn't careless.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.371
Whatever his reasons,
I trust him.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.832
Even though you admit you don't
know what he has planned,

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.001
you're still more than willing
to blindly follow him

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.252
into battle?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.422
For your information,
several noblemen

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.299
have given up on the king
and have combined

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.885
their forces with
Duke Carmine's army.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.387
And do you know why
they're joining him?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.390
They're upset the king has
exposed their injustices.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.184
After having their
property confiscated

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.560
to pay for their crimes,

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.604
of course they have
an axe to grind!

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.774
If Duke Carmine is
taking those sort of people

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.567
under his wing,
then I have a hard time

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.486
believing his cause is just.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.780
Well, it's not like he‐‐

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.698
Look, Hal.
I'm begging you.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.160
Reconsider going over
to the Carmine Dukedom.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.080
It's dangerous to side with
anyone who opposes this king.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.164
Trust me.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.500
A child, unproven
in combat, dangerous?

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.335
He's no match for
a battle‐tested hero

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.336
like Duke Car‐‐

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.588
Your perception of him
is all wrong!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.923
Isn't my word good enough?

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.092
That man is formidable!

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.802
[SOUMA]
And what makes you say that?

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.637
An army's effectiveness
depends on the quality

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.556
of soldiers and supplies.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.683
The same is also
true for a nation!

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.726
Our new king, he's
finding people to solve

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.103
the food crisis!

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.329
So, pardon, but why are we here?

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.664
[gasps]

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.583
Please don't tell me you're
going to arrest Halbert

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.668
because of what he
said back at the café!

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.794
The boy's harmless!

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.671
He's dumb, but he'd never
do something as stupid

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.256
as rebel against the kingdom!

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424
[SOUMA laughs]

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.176
I think you have the wrong idea.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.635
I... I do?

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.179
So why were you in town?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.264
I got some time off
of work unexpectedly,

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:22.974
so I popped into Juna's café.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.893
Oh. A much‐deserved break.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:25.894
Enough games.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.353
Are you one of Kaede's friends?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.813
No, not exactly.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.565
Then how about minding
your own business?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.692
Now, Hal, you don't have
to be so rude to our‐‐

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.277
Be quiet!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.737
Who asked your opinion anyway?

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.779
[KAEDE whimpers]

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.867
Hey, there's no need for you
to raise your voice at her.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.535
I don't care if you
do know each other.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.996
You butt out!
Whose fault is it that we're‐‐

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.710
[grunting]

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.046
I give! Call her off!

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.672
[KAEDE whimpers]

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.466
Aisha, that's enough.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.855
Care to explain just
who the hell you are?

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.652
[SOUMA] I don't get a
chance to do this very often.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.445
Time to get a little theatrical.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.079
Why, Halbert, it seems
you've forgotten my face.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.500
No! It can't be!

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.460
Ah! Your Majesty!

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.213
[SOUMA] Huh! How can I feel
guilty about being dramatic

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.465
when I got a reaction
that over the top?

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:40.260
K‐Kaede, you knew it
was him the whole time?

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.638
Then how come you didn't
tell me to shut up sooner?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.432
[SOUMA]
Let's continue our conversation.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.935
I'm curious, is your
intention to actually side

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.353
with Duke Carmine?

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.148
Well, I... That is...

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.113
I couldn't really blame you
if you chose to do so.

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:03.366
The same way a ruler chooses
and appoints his officers.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.201
I believe those officers
have a right to choose

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.954
the ruler they're
going to serve.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.873
Kaede, just how do
you know Halbert?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.709
We're childhood friends,
Your Highness.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.921
Childhood friends, eh? I see.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.716
Well, Halbert, as I mentioned...

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:21.009
I'm not going to
stop you from siding

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.719
with the Three Dukedoms.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.387
However, I'm sure
you already realized

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.347
an inevitable fact:

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.392
After I retaliate against
them for their betrayal,

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.102
you'll be forced
to fight your friend.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.774
If I understand, Kaede's a mage
with the Forbidden Army.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.569
Meaning that she's in a unit
that reports directly to me.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.987
When you are out
on the battlefield,

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.072
do you think you'll be able to
raise your sword against her

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.158
should your two paths
end up crossing?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.370
And even if you're not
personally responsible,

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.830
there's still a chance
someone else fighting

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:54.250
on your side might
end up taking her life.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.293
In the heat of battle,

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.128
when you know she'll
be exposed to danger,

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.380
can you say without
hesitation you'll be fine

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.632
on the side of the enemy
and not being able

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.134
to come to her aid?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.181
You don't have to answer,
but just know

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.058
that whatever road
you do choose,

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.477
it leads to a future
not that far away.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.323
Before you're swept
up in the moment

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.158
and do something
that might prove rash,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.202
just ask yourself:

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.163
What it is that you want,
what you truly desire,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.832
for whom, and why you want it.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.627
What I desire and for whom.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.083
[LISCIA]
Just a little break, yeah right.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.252
The moment she lied
down, she passed out.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.964
[SOUMA] Sounds like she's
having a nice dream at least.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.550
[LISCIA]
Say, Souma.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.717
[SOUMA]
Hm?

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.678
Earlier, you seemed
really intent on trying

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.847
to change Halbert's mind.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.349
And laying it on pretty
thick, to be honest.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.519
Like you didn't want him
and Kaede separating.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:37.979
[SOUMA]
Hmm.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.897
Well, I mean,
I was just thinking

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.482
realistically about
what would happen

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.276
if they fought
on opposite sides.

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.113
You look tired.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.406
Why don't you lay on my lap?

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.533
Huh? On your lap?

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.493
Don't make it sound weird!

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:56.164
Besides, um, this is supposed
to be a date, after all.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.167
You do have a good point.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.960
Not like it'd be out
of the ordinary.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:15.141
Doesn't this make us
look like we're engaged?

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.810
Yeah. In name only, at least.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.439
[LISCIA]
Name only.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.025
[SOUMA] Don't worry about
the whole betrothal thing.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.819
I'm only keeping the throne
warm for a little while.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:30.490
After a few years, I'll probably
retire from this king gig.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:31.741
Hey, do you...

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.826
Do you even want
to be engaged to me?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.581
It's not very fair
to ask me like that.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.750
Huh? And why not?

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.959
Liscia...

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.253
Are... Are you okay?

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.130
You know, being engaged to me?

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.548
Yeah, of course I am.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.596
Don't read into that; I just
meant you're better suited

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.973
to ruling the kingdom
than I am, that's all.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:59.018
You're fine being engaged
to someone you don't love

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.896
just because they're better
suited to being the king?

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.858
That's what it's
like to be royalty.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.027
Maybe so, but I'm not royalty.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.612
Not really.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:13.491
Anyway, I would rather
marry for love's sake.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:17.328
[LISCIA] So, in other words,
you don't like me.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.956
Can you say for sure you'd
never fall in love with me?

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.260
[AISHA]
Pardon, but...

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.055
How much longer do you two
need me to keep pretending

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.306
like I'm asleep?

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.857
Told ya.
I'm pretty good at this.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.484
I assume you're moving
him using that

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.695
"Living Poltergeists"
magic of yours.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.283
Yeah, I must have leveled
up by using it so much

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.243
or something, because
now I can move up to

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.870
four objects with
independent consciousness.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.081
[LISCIA] Impressive,
but out of everything,

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.958
this is what you're using it on?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.084
[SERINA]
Your Majesty.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.211
We have three visitors.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.255
Glaive Magna,
head of the Magna family,

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.674
and his son, Halbert,
are here with Kaede Foxia,

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.426
a mage with the Forbidden Army.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:15.761
The three of them are requesting
an audience with you.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.308
[SOUMA] All of you,
please lift up your heads.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:21.350
[GLAIVE]
Yes, sire!

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.733
Oh, wow, Halbert.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.319
Looks like you saw combat
sooner than you were expecting.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.990
I ask you forgive
my son's misconduct.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:39.118
No, I beg you,
have mercy on him, sire!

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:43.080
By "misconduct,"
do you mean yesterday?

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:46.334
Kaede related the events
that transpired, Your Majesty.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.753
From the abuse he
heaped on your lordship,

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.463
to his flagrant admission
that he would take

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:54.717
the side of the Three Dukedoms!
It's unforgivable!

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.802
Your Majesty's wrath
is to be expected,

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.971
but whatever punishment
you see fit to administer

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:01.974
should be mine alone
to bear for my failures

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.643
as his father!

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.770
[SOUMA] The blame should
fall on me for letting things

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.438
reach the point
where my officers

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.065
would consider defecting.

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.067
I won't censure him.

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:12.276
[GLAIVE]
Majesty!

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.737
[SOUMA]
And besides, by the looks of it,

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.615
he's been punished
enough already.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.575
Such magnanimous words!

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.285
You are merciful!

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.913
Once we return to our mansion,
I will see to it immediately

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.456
that my fool of a
son has this lesson

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.375
pounded unto him by my own hand!

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.379
Yes, well, don't be too harsh.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.506
Besides, I'm worried if
Halbert's rugged looks

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.216
continue improving...

00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:36.425
[laughs]

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:40.012
I mean get worked over any more,
it might end up upsetting Kaede.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.226
That reminds me.

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.686
I was going to do
this at some point,

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.604
but now's as good a time as any.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.398
We might as well
get it over with.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.529
Mage of the Forbidden Army.
Kaede Foxia.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.072
[KAEDE]
Sire?

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.074
[SOUMA] It's obvious your
talents are being wasted

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.284
in your current position.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.787
I order you to serve
under Sir Ludwin

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.123
as a staff officer
in the Royal Guard.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.165
Yes!

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.960
Hold on, me, a staff officer?

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:14.672
What's critical is the quality
of our personnel and supplies.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.924
That is what you said
yesterday at Lorelei.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.972
I believe you and
I think quite alike.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.307
I‐‐ Thank you very much, sire!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.936
As for you, Halbert Magna.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.148
I order you be transferred
to the Forbidden Army.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.108
You want me in
the Forbidden Army?

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.443
[SOUMA]
That's correct.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:37.278
You will be Kaede's adjutant,

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.364
where you will stand watch
by her side and support her.

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:41.407
Understood?

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.201
Yes, sire!

00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:49.498
And with all that,
our business is done here.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.417
[GLAIVE]
Your Majesty!

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.210
It pains me, but I'm
afraid I must request

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.921
a longer audience
before my departure.

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:59.175
Something is weighing on
my mind I feel I must tell you.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:02.261
Tell me. I'm listening, sir.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.637
[GLAIVE]
Well...

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.723
It concerns a matter I do
not wish many people

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.184
to hear, besides you, sire.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.685
Might we clear the room?

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.863
[SOUMA]
All right. Let's hear it.

00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:22.907
Sire.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.205
This is surreal!

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:32.166
I can't believe I'm actually
having tea with the princess!

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.126
It would've been incredibly
dull waiting around

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:36.796
until Glaive and the King
finished their business.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.131
This is a much better
use of our time.

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:40.549
Lovely idea, Princess.

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.468
Might I suggest that
our two guests provide

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.553
some insight how a young
lady and gentleman

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.722
can maintain such
a strong friendship

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.432
without certain entanglements.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.936
I'm sure it will prove
most instructive,

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.521
given your situation.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.022
Serina! Please!

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.066
Well, if it helps
Your Highness, then‐‐

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.818
No! She wasn't being serious!

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.361
[SOUMA gasps]

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.908
And now that
you've told me this,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.869
just what do you expect me
to do with the information?

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:11.038
That's your choice.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.499
I just wanted Your Highness
to be aware.

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.334
And I have completed my task.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.129
This is heavy.
