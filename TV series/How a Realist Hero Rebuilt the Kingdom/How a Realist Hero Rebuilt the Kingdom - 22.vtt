WEBVTT

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.180
We desperately need
more personnel.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.476
You said it.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.061
[SOUMA]
Like Roroa, for example,

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.980
who's got an extraordinary
sense of economics.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.565
Agreed.

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:24.942
But at the end of
the day, you can't run

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.320
the kingdom's finances all
by yourself, can you?

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.446
That much is true.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:30.739
Despite my strengths,

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.741
I need employees and
personnel who are able

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:33.951
to do math.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.246
So they should have
some math skills,

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.915
and the ability to read
and write as well.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:41.500
It pains me to report

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.378
the literacy rate among
citizens is quite low.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.963
Those who can do arithmetic,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.131
if you exclude the
nobility and the knights,

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.467
often end up becoming merchants.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:52.553
[SOUMA] I couldn't have
said it better, Juna.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.263
[LISCIA] Well then, why don't
we try recruiting from

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.515
everyday people?

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.100
[SOUMA] When it comes to
appointing skilled workers

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.601
that're above and beyond,

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.353
countries that can
concentrate money and power

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:02.771
have an advantage.

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.856
For us, it'll be
a tougher process.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.776
Almost like finding
a needle in a haystack.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:09.653
So, what do we do instead?

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.780
We try to find skilled
individuals in neighboring

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:14.116
countries, as well
as the other plan.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.367
What other plan?

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.383
[NARRATOR]
Slavery.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:59.346
Never has there been a greater
violation of mankind's rights.

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.723
A person owning another
without recognizing

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.100
their humanity.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.186
Regarding them as
property to buy and sell.

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.897
Even the great philosopher
Aristotle once defended

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.942
the practice,
calling them "living tools,"

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.486
but the system should
have never been adopted.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.989
Sadly, however, the
practice is alive and well

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.283
on the supercontinent of Landia.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.661
Unfortunately, the
Kingdom of Friedonia

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.579
was no exception to the rule.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:29.501
Although, some are enslaved
as punishment for their crimes,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.545
the vast majority had
no other choice but to

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.714
sell themselves due to poverty.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:38.885
If their masters permitted it,
they could eventually be freed.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.681
And physical or sexual abuse
was strictly forbidden.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.183
However, there were
still many female slaves

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.686
who were violated,
and many male slaves

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.813
who ended up being
worked to death.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.526
Which brings us to an
unassuming slave trader

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.028
by the name of Ginger Camus.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.074
As you know, my grandpa
has recently died,

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.618
which means I have
inherited all of you.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.954
Oh, right.
My name is Camus.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.506
Um... may I ask the reason why
you're all acting so frightened?

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.175
[SAN]
You don't know, Shopmaster?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.010
I'll explain.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.636
You're a mystic tanuki, right?

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.016
A raccoon person.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.935
If you're curious, the
difference is with the tail.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.688
Mystic tanukis don't
have any stripes,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.983
while we raccoon people
have an elegant pattern.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.652
And what's your name?

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.404
Please forgive my rudeness.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.281
Call me Sandria, the slave.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.576
[CAMUS]
How about "San" for short?

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.954
Oh. Of course.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.498
Pleased to meet you.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.167
The pleasure's mine, Shopmaster.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.044
So, San, can you tell me...

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.214
...why everybody here
looks so gloomy?

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:01.343
[SAN] Because we're mourning
the passing of your grandfather.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.386
[CAMUS] You're grieving his
death even though you were

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.596
his slaves?

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:07.849
[SAN] Yes, I'll admit we
are feeling some sadness.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.977
How to put this...

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.397
Compared to other slave traders,
your grandfather treated us

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.732
with dignity.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.317
Is that right?

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.361
He made sure we
had clothes to wear,

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.613
provided enough food for us.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:25.659
Which is quite the rarity
when it comes to traders.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.910
I never knew.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:30.205
It's obvious I know nothing
at all about the slave trade.

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:31.414
That's quite all right.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.251
I assumed you didn't.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.378
Before your grandfather died,
he said that you would

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.297
probably be unable to
take over his business.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.675
That this kind of work
would be too much

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.552
for his gentle grandson.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.931
[CAMUS]
Grandpa saw right through me.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.684
I don't want any of
his remaining slaves.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:54.771
I would rather sell them off
and begin some other business.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.189
Have a fresh start.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.527
At least, I thought I did.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.320
Something wrong?

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.030
No. I'm sorry.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.907
I was just thinking
about my grandpa.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.078
If you don't end up taking
over the business,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.332
we'll just be sold off to
some other slave trader.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.752
But no single one will take a
group with this many slaves.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.463
Which means we're
going to be split up.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.133
So that's why your grandfather's
passing's a reason

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.509
for us to mourn.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:27.762
Shopmaster?

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.433
[CAMUS]
What is this?

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.149
[SAN] It was presumptuous for
a slave like me to offer

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.317
my opinion.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.444
I would like you to
punish me for it now.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.155
That's insane!

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.740
[SAN]
It's all right.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.951
That whip is specially made so
it doesn't leave any marks

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.454
on the body and won't
diminish my value

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.247
when you sell me.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.625
That is not what I'm
talking about, San!

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.668
If you knew you're
going to be punished,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.379
why'd you even give
me your opinion?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.674
[SAN] Because I was hoping
once you close up shop,

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.011
you might show us the
slightest bit of mercy.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:12.265
That somehow,
you might find owners

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.060
who'll let families
stay together.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.979
So does that mean you have
family members here, as well?

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.151
You really care that
much about the others.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.949
I understand your
situation clearly now.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.283
That being said,

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.369
I don't intend to keep
running this business.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.997
However,

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.708
I'll do my best while you're
under my protection.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:44.047
Naturally, I'll refuse to sell
any of you to malicious buyers.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.300
So I'll take it upon myself to
carefully scrutinize them first.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.477
I hope you can forgive me.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.939
I needed some help
carrying all my sundries.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.608
It's wasteful to show
concern for a slave.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.485
Please order me to
do whatever you wish.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.199
Master Ginger, if I may
ask you a question.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.909
Why are you making
sure to provide food

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.744
and new clothing
for your slaves?

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.998
Especially when selling us
off is just on the horizon.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.458
What would you think
was taken better care of?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.460
Something clean or something
that looked to be

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.962
in bad shape?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.588
You're asking me?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.675
Well, I suppose it would be
whichever was kept cleaner.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.635
It's the same general idea.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.429
I want the slaves taken care of.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.430
You see?

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.266
If potential buyers are looking
for someone as disposable labor,

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.809
they're likely to stay away.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.732
All right, everyone.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.526
Let's review our multiplication
tables of threes.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.069
Ready, go!

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.071
[SLAVES]
Three times one is three.

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:52.157
Three times two is six.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.242
Three times three is nine.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:58.121
Excuse me, but why is everybody
here practicing mathematics?

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.372
I'm glad you're back,

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:00.749
and you brought
what I'd asked for.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.001
Yes, right here.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.712
[CAMUS] Now I can teach
everyone to read and write.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.840
So you're teaching us math
and you're also going

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:12.969
out of your way to make
sure we slaves are literate?

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.929
Well, I've been
doing some thinking.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.765
Even tools get taken
better care of if they have

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.225
some added value to them, right?

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.311
So I started asking
myself how could I give

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.813
additional worth when it
came to another person,

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.357
and I thought,
"what about an education?"

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.860
[SAN] That is true, but
there are a limited number

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.613
of people who will
buy a schooled slave.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.114
If they remain unsold,

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.784
or do wind up getting
sold into manual labor,

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.786
I don't quite see the point.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.746
There's a chance
that you're right,

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.123
but as you know, I have
no plans on continuing

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.833
to run this business.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.794
So I figured that the best
way to move forward

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.671
is to find decent buyers
for everybody here.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.508
Well. Would you like me
to teach you, too?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.884
[SAN]
That's all right.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.844
My family ran their own store.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:58.515
I can already read,
write, and do math.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.891
Um, San...

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.268
If you don't mind me asking you,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.855
how did you end up
becoming a slave?

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.899
A shopkeeper was tricked
into taking on a debt

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.359
by someone.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.569
In order to save his
family and store,

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.615
he had no choice but to auction
off one of his daughters.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.200
That's all there is.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.993
You make it sound routine.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.079
It's actually a
very common tale.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.413
The truth is

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.916
this misery can sprout
up wherever you go.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.134
Oh, thank you, San.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.136
How are the sales? Going well?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.890
Less than ideal, I'm afraid.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.059
By that I mean we
don't have any buyers.

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.310
Least not yet.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.229
I wonder what's stopping them.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.023
I thought there were some
customers that came in earlier.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.900
Why didn't they buy anybody?

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.947
Not to brag, but when
it comes to people,

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.075
I have a pretty good
eye for sizing them up.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.786
Every customer so far,
they've only wanted slaves

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.122
as disposable tools
and nothing more.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.375
Even buyers that
looked like gentlemen.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.460
[SAN]
Is that right?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.462
[CAMUS] I promised everyone
that I would find them owners

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.256
that were trustworthy.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.717
Which means I have to
be kind of selective.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.594
You know, if you keep
talking like that,

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.138
you'll fall into debt and
end up a slave, as well.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.515
Well, we certainly can't
afford that to happen.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.393
My grandfather used
to have a saying:

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.936
"Someday, the calm will end,

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.856
and then the tide
will suddenly turn."

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.525
It means you have to wait
for the right opportunity

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.943
and never give up.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.196
So when the chance
comes, you grab hold

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.614
so you don't miss out.

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.492
[SAN]
Master Ginger.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.411
It's the strangest thing.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.831
Despite being a slave,
whenever I'm with you,

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.042
I'm almost hopeful
about the future.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:05.225
[knocking]

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.768
[MAN A]
Excuse me!

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.603
I heard that you had slaves
here who could read,

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:12.232
write, and do math!
Is this true?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.067
[MAN B]
I need them immediately!

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.819
Name your price,
I'll gladly pay it!

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.404
[MAN C]
I need some, as well!

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.865
Whatever you require,
just tell me!

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.617
[MAN D]
Money's no object!

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.580
[CAMUS]
How can I help you all?

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:28.831
My dear sir!

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.209
The fact is I'm in desperate
need of slaves who can read,

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.794
write, and do math.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.963
You've come to the
right place for that.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.632
Every one of my slaves
has learned those skills.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:38.883
[MAN B]
Every last one?

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.218
Are you serious?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.428
Oh, thank heavens!
It's a miracle!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.596
[MAN A]
Outstanding!

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.890
Let's discuss the terms
of purchase right away!

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.892
It's not as if you're the
only one here worried

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.603
--about their territory!
--[arguing]

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.689
I'll to have ask you
all to settle down!

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.149
Can somebody please tell
me what's going on here?

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:00.947
Now I understand.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.991
Seemingly out of nowhere,
His Majesty made

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.660
a royal decree in regard
to evaluating promotion

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.662
or demotion of
knights and noblemen.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.164
The process will now begin
including one's ability

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.166
to govern their own territory.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.502
At least the king wished
you all good luck.

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.297
As for my lord, he believed
there was one path

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.756
to getting ahead in life.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.634
Being a nobleman and
taking part in state affairs.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.470
Knights are distinguished by
heroics on the battlefield!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.556
Now the ability to rule
over their own domain

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.141
is in question!

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:31.644
In order for one to govern,
office skills are essential!

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.604
I must have someone
who's able to read, write,

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.815
and perform
mathematical equations!

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.567
Well, um...

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.569
While I understand your plight,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.029
I have parents
here with children

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.072
and a pair of
sisters to consider,

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.824
so I would require you
to take on members

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.285
of the same family as
part of our arrangement.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.787
You're saying that if we agree
to take families together,

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.456
we have priority when
it comes to securing

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.749
two or more slaves?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.002
In that case, I'm willing
to take as many as I can!

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.338
[MAN C] I already told you,
I get first pick!

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:01.215
[arguing]

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.717
Please, everyone, calm down!

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.886
All this shouting won't
help the situation!

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.106
This place has become
very quiet rather quickly.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.733
Indeed, it has.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:22.487
The last two, Anzu and Shiho
are with Piltory Saracen.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.655
I'm extremely happy
for both of them.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.699
He promised to set them free,
and he's taking them

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.159
as his wives, too.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.911
It's a little hard to believe.

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.746
That makes two of us.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:32.789
So here we are.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.749
I'm the only slave
still in your care.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.002
To be honest, San,

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:42.256
it's not like I made a fortune,
but it was still a tidy sum.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.591
[SAN chuckles]

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.593
Well, you spent your
own money on us,

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.178
making sure to
provide an education

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.180
we wouldn't otherwise receive.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.266
I'm not really cut out
to be a slave trader.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.434
Although now,

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.437
I can finally start to think
about a new business.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.107
But if you're going to
change your business,

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.859
then what would
that mean for me?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.236
Why don't you sit down?

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.279
You must be pretty tired from
having to stand on your feet

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.864
all day.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.533
It's out of the question!

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.742
I'm only a slave.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.829
I would never dare sit at
the same table as my master.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.664
Oh, really? That's interesting.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.583
Then what would you
say if I ordered you?

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.293
If you insist, then very well.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.135
Why don't we take
a little break?

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.138
I'm the one who ought to
be doing that sort of chore!

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.639
Don't worry.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.891
Call this a small
token of my thanks.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.226
Your thanks?

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:38.062
Yeah. I owe you so much.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.730
If you hadn't had
the courage to speak up

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.774
the very first time we met,

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.192
I'm sorry to say

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:46.654
I might have let the other
slave traders buy everyone.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.197
In terms of running a business,

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.575
it meant turning several
potential buyers away,

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.535
but I'm glad I taught everyone
skills that made them

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.036
more valuable.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.621
Thanks to His Majesty's order,

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.498
it just happened
to work out nicely.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.959
But it all started with you
and the risk you took

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.669
to keep the families together.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.925
Perhaps, but we're the ones
who should be thanking you.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.677
For everything that you've done.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.305
You say it was to give us
all more value, however,

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.807
you went above and
beyond, Master Ginger.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.684
Not only were you good
enough to have provided us

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:19.270
with brand new clothing,
but somehow

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.356
you were able to make this
place feel like our home.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.650
You did all that at
your own expense--

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:28.905
in fact, you even dipped into
your grandfather's inheritance.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:32.325
Most would never show
slaves that much kindness.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:35.244
But you did, and I'm
grateful for that.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:40.291
Listen.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.709
[door opens]

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.128
[CAMUS]
Welcome, sir.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:50.092
What a strange hat.

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.220
Is he from the Nine-Headed
Dragon Union?

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:57.225
I've a request.
I am very interested

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.603
in purchasing this
particular slave.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.856
[CAMUS] Sorry, you might have
missed the sign outside,

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.858
but we are closed for the day.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.777
Oh, do forgive me.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:11.864
See, I'm so taken by
this raccoon-person slave

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.575
I must buy her before
someone else does.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.328
Now, then, whatever is
necessary to acquire her,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.788
just name it.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.623
Naturally, I'm prepared
to pay you more than

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.041
her market value.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.169
Afterwards,

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.089
I will then release her
of her status as a slave.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.591
I uh, actually, she...

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.134
Very well.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.720
And what price would you be
willing to pay for me, sir?

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.389
Wait a minute.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.560
As you can see, my master
takes care of his slaves.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.562
They have all been purchased.

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:45.565
Except me.
And as a final act of service.

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:49.318
I request you buy me
at a higher asking rate.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.903
Master Ginger.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:53.239
I only ask you use the
money to fund your new

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.407
business venture.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.617
There's no way I'm letting
him buy you, San!

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:57.994
[SOUMA]
As you wish.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.124
Here's ten large gold coins,

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.210
and also 50 standard
gold coins as well.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.296
Will this be a sufficient price?

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.339
That is an extraordinary amount.

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:11.966
I agree to the offer.

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.009
Glad to hear it.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.761
[CAMUS] That's not something
for you to decide!

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.180
I'm sorry, she's not for sale!

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.516
I don't care how much
money you have!

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.269
She'll serve as an employee
when I start my new business.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.814
Equal to me, and not a
slave to be ordered around!

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.316
But Master Ginger.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.067
You'll have to forgive me, San.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.986
Yes, there is a possibility
that you would live

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.113
a far better life if
you allowed this man

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.824
to take you away from here,
and he obviously comes

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.076
from considerable
wealth as well.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.787
The thing is, out of
my own self-interest,

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:44.290
I don't want to let you go.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.875
I want to stay.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.505
I beg you. Keep me here.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.133
Allow me to remain
by your side forever.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.260
San. Of course I will.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.140
Uh...

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.477
[chuckles]
Isn't that something.

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.522
[ROROA] You see?
Just like Sebastian said.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:11.025
Quite the fascinating
slave trader, huh?

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.943
That's an understatement.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.154
I'm sorry, but what's this?

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.739
My deepest apologies.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:20.117
It was only supposed
to be a test.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.786
I'm confused.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.038
This world is full of people.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.626
Yet someone like you was
hiding right under our noses.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.462
We can't stop searching
for talented personnel.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.297
Wait. Your Majesty?

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:35.925
No formalities.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.010
We three here are incognito.

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.762
I've always wanted
to say "incognito"

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.889
but never got the chance before.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.849
[CAMUS]
Um, Your Highness.

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.477
Do you mind if I ask
why you sought me out?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.688
[SOUMA] Word of your
reputation has spread.

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.856
About how you decided
to teach your slaves,

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.608
so they would end up in
places that would treat them

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.152
with dignity and respect.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.654
Traders around the
kingdom are following

00:19:56.696 --> 00:20:00.199
your example now by educating
their slaves, as well.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.992
Oh. They are?

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.619
Judging from your reaction,

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.163
you didn't realize your
glorious accomplishment.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.374
You ought to be quite proud.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.292
[CAMUS]
I wouldn't say "glorious."

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.836
As long as I've been king,

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.838
I have been thinking of
ways to abolish the system

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.673
of slavery here.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:19.260
The thing is, if I just made
reforms by royal decree,

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.388
it would've only resulted
in societal upheaval.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.141
One wrong move,
and we'd have a civil war.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.226
That's a bit extreme,
don't you think?

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.436
Sadly, no.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:31.313
In the world I came from,
that's exactly what happened.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:34.734
As a solution, "slavery"
will exist by name alone.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.237
[AISHA]
Wait. You don't mean...

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.198
Isn't this the subject you
were discussing earlier with--

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.867
with Princess Liscia, yes?

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.578
Yes it was, Aisha, education.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.372
You protected the socially
vulnerable and improved

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.957
their quality of life.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.126
Guaranteeing them employment.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.671
And as a result, the slaves
will no longer be enslaved.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:58.382
If that's not glorious,
I don't know what is.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.925
I mean, I couldn't be happier,

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.844
but I was just doing
everything in my power

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.721
to protect the people
who were left in my care,

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.889
Your Highness.

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.893
You're exactly the kind of
person that I've been

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.269
searching for.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.771
Starting from this point,

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:14.899
I'll be socializing the
slave trade in this country.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.193
Your Majesty,
what's "socializing"?

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.445
Slave traders will
become public servants

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.739
and we'll have a
screening process.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.365
That's phase one.

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:25.534
I'm also currently in the
stages of constructing

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.954
a job training center so
they can find employment

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.832
and not be used
as disposable labor.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.376
While I'd like to abolish
the system altogether,

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.880
at the present moment,
this will have to do.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.215
So then you're saying...

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.675
You're a bit of a slow
learner, aren't you?

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.553
The kingdom's adopting
the program you invented.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.306
[SOUMA] This new training
center will need a director,

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:49.099
and I'd like to appoint you.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.310
Me? Are you sure, Majesty?

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:55.105
I can't think of anyone more
deserving of the position.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.566
This money is your reserve fund.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:58.901
How would you like
to take the gold

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.444
and start your new business?

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.699
[SAN]
Someday, the calm will end,

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.660
and then the tide
will suddenly turn.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.583
It's a deal.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.378
Majesty. I want to do this.
