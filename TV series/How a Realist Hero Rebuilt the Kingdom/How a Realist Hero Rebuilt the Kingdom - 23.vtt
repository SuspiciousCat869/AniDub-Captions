WEBVTT

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.802
How did we end up
in this position?

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.429
What choice did we have?

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:16.058
Roroa's busy turning slave
traders into civil servants.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.809
Believe me, she's not happy.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.103
She's got her hands
full issuing licenses

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.980
and dealing with complaints.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.566
Juna doesn't have
free time with her show,

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.152
and Aisha wanted to concentrate
on her martial arts training--

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.779
[LISCIA] That's not what
I'm talking about!

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.115
I meant how did all of us end
up on this crazy road trip?

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.867
That's just how
things worked out.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.953
When I said I was
going into town,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:38.997
Serina insisted that I take
Owen and Carla along with us

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.750
to serve as our escorts.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.294
And you had a
pretty genius idea.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.547
Even as a ragtag
group of adventurers,

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.341
we do kinda look like we
belong together, right?

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.093
If you wanted to blend in more,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.594
you could have worn
that student uniform

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.429
like you did last time.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.306
And given the way
Owen's dressed,

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.767
we could've said he
was your instructor.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.853
You are actually getting trained
by him in martial arts.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.230
You're one to talk.

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:04.898
If you had dressed more
like an adventurer,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.067
we'd look like a
party, except for...

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.403
What did I miss?

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.697
Why're you both looking at me?

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.949
Carla would have
stood out regardless.

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:14.992
That's true.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.910
Aren't you being a little cruel?

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:19.079
I mean, you're
dressed as a maid.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.206
It's not as if I picked this
outfit because I thought

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.500
it'd be a good costume!

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.127
If it wasn't for
Serina's orders,

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.088
I'd be wearing my armor instead.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.216
Carla. You're our friend,
and you always will be.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.468
So when Serina's not
around, don't hesitate

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.803
to speak freely.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:35.887
Good call.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.264
[CARLA]
You want me to speak freely,

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.266
but I can't decide
how I should dress?

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:42.019
Sire--I mean, Kazuya,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.063
are you positive you want
to continue going this way?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.231
Yes, I am.

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.900
But if we head down there...

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.737
Oh. Now I understand.
You're right.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.656
Eventually, we'll all
arrive in the old slums.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.116
And if I may speak frankly,

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:58.410
that's not the sort of place
I'd ever wish for you

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.121
or Liscia to see in person.

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.664
It's a den of crime.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:05.000
Home to a bunch of low-lifes.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.252
In the past, but not anymore.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.171
How is it different now?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.089
It'd be quicker if you
saw for yourself.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.566
[SOUMA]
What do you think?

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:54.568
[LISCIA]
Uh, well, it's a lot different

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.819
from what I had pictured,

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.280
so I guess you could
say I am surprised.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.281
Meaning what?

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.616
Meaning it's supposed
to be dark, gloomy,

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.202
musty, and dangerous
in this part of town.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.538
At least, as far as
what I've been told.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.874
Hard to believe these
are the kingdom's slums.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.334
Nope! You're thinking
of the old slums.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.712
Way different from how
you remember, huh?

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.797
We did our best to get
everything in shape here

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.467
by tackling the
sanitation problem.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.260
The sanitation problem?

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.845
That was part of your
big plan to improve

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.305
the city, right?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.390
Was reworking all these
buildings a part of that plan

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.558
as well?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.977
We rebuilt the old structures.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.897
Now they allow air
and sunlight in.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.815
While we were at it,
we arrested criminals

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.942
and stopped the drug trade.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.862
So we aired the place
out in that sense, as well.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.989
[LISCIA] Uh, Carla, did Souma
just casually mention

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.450
he completely removed
crime from the slums?

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.951
He did, he did.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.120
Afterwards, we had the
residents move into all

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.122
the new houses we had built.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.500
They're small and cramped,
but they're free.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.794
Additionally, by employing
the residents to help

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.713
keep the city clean,
they get paid and maintain

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.632
sanitation at once.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.759
You've been keeping busy.

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.093
Maybe too busy?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.222
It is hard work,
but a lot of fun, too.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.599
Getting to rebuild the city
and fashion the country

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.601
how I want it.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:13.772
And if as a result the people
smile more, where's the harm?

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:14.815
[LISCIA]
Agreed.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.358
But if there's anything
I can do, you be sure

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.318
to let me know.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.695
Of course.
I'm relying on you.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.406
I've gotta say, this is
a far cry from the slums

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.825
that used to be here.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.661
Wherever there's grime,
decay follows,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.831
and then pathogens are
more likely to take hold.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.332
What are "pathogens"?

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.376
It sounds odd, but they're
an infinite number

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.169
of these tiny creatures.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.505
Even though they're
invisible to the naked eye,

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.174
they live in the air, soil,
water, everywhere else.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.177
I just told you,
you can't see them!

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.680
But they're powerful
enough to make food spoil

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.265
and cause illness.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.308
We can only view
their influence.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.977
Wait! Now I get it!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.979
So, that's the reason you
recommend that we all

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.106
gargle and we wash our hands?

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.482
You got it.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.775
I'm a little confused.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.653
So, pathogens,
they cause diseases?

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.364
I believe whatever Kazuya
tells us about them.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.576
It's not a question of whether
or not they accept my word.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.744
Since they solve all their
problems with magic,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.830
what can I do?

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.457
In this world, medicine
and hygiene haven't made

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.251
significant advances.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.503
Probably because light
elemental magic has such

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.255
a widespread presence.

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:22.883
When it's been cast, it gives
you the ability to heal,

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.093
and can treat even
the most serious wounds.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.515
But it does have
certain drawbacks:

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.101
Like not being able to treat
elderly patients' infections

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.562
and injuries, since their
natural ability to heal

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.188
is diminished.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.399
Treatments for
diseases are available.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.902
But the market is overrun
with drugs made from

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.572
dubious ingredients, and
questionable folk remedies.

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.908
When I started tackling
the sanitation problem.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.201
I knew I had to do something
about the health crisis

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.620
as well.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.787
First things first,

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.333
I need to make them realize
pathogens do exist.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.543
[LISCIA] The question is how do
you get people to acknowledge

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.754
something they can't see?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.255
[SOUMA]
Some already can.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.300
Or more specifically, a certain
race of people in the world.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.677
Those people know
that germs exist.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.888
Thanks to an extra
eye unique to them.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.349
It lends them a kind
of enhanced perception

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.060
and the ability to see things
other people cannot.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.269
[CARLA]
An extra eye.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.688
It sounds like you're talking
about the three-eyed race.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.734
I'm surprised they
agreed to work with you.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.028
I've heard their kind
shuns contact with anyone

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.738
from outside their clan.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.949
Their isolation
seems self-imposed.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.369
Most likely because of
how they view the world.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.412
Remember, they can tell
whether something

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.623
is sanitary or not.

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:39.334
Imagine. If you saw
germs everywhere,

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.835
you'd probably
avoid others, too.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.213
They must think we're
disease-ridden freaks!

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:46.257
Well, that's certainly
one way of putting it.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:50.428
Long story short, the three-eyed
race knew pathogens were real.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.222
As well as the fact that
they cause ailments

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.474
light magic can't treat.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.435
So, using their vision
and their insight,

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.146
they developed their
own brand of medicine.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.649
Their research into
diseases is advanced.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.401
Compared to the
rest of the world,

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.820
they're centuries
ahead in medicine.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.239
Wait. Could that be the
reason the three-eyed race

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.074
has such a long lifespan?

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.909
How old are we talking about?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.911
You know how humans
and beastmen only live

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.955
to be around 60 years of age?

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.500
Well, the three-eyed
race's average lifespan

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.043
is well over 80 years.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.503
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.255
Liscia is correct.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:28.133
Introducing hygiene has
extended their lifespan.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.510
It's like a shield for health!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.428
Right.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.763
I've set up talks to
ask for their help,

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.266
and commissioned them
to make a device.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.018
Once it's complete,
this object will allow

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.936
the other races the
ability to see germs

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.230
and microorganisms
for themselves.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.565
Amazing!

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.442
[OWEN]
That's our Kazuya, all right!

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.402
Well, we had them
back in my world.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.862
Called 'em "microscopes."

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.155
A "microscope"?

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.364
Yeah.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:54.367
By putting lenses together,
it can make small objects

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.994
appear larger.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.162
Because of these,

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.873
I was able to prove to everyone
what the three-eyed race

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.124
said was true.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.542
And that's not all.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:06.046
Thanks to their sight, they have
already made antibiotics.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.922
Another strange new word.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.592
I'll skip the explanation,
since it's complicated,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.594
but they're a substance
that inhibits the growth

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.054
of pathogens.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.430
[LISCIA]
So it's a medicine?

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.473
Yeah.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.767
Turns out they just
call it "medicine" too.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.560
But that gets confusing.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.689
So I decree that it shall be
known as three-eyedine.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.901
Because it's a type of medicine
made by the three-eyed race.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.320
Three-eyedine, what do
you mean it's able to inhibit

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:33.323
the growth of germs?
As in, the spread, too?

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.825
It's a wonder drug
against diseases,

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.745
but that's only
putting it mildly.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.498
It can be used to prevent
epidemics as well as keeping

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.374
open wounds from festering.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.460
You said stop epidemics?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.629
It's really powerful
enough to do that?

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.173
Since the three-eyed race
can see these germs,

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.218
they're also able to help
find a way of stopping them.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.428
Well? Could it be mass produced?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.763
Liscia?

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.056
This is important.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.934
This could even help us
to stop epidemics.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.144
There's no mage who can do that.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.938
There's not much available yet,

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.023
but we are ramping
up our production.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.983
Perfection!

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.027
Good news is,
the three-eyed race is now

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.947
cooperating with us,
and additionally,

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.698
we won't hold anything
back when it comes to

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.700
the medical research.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.828
Our biggest struggle so
far is the small number

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.288
of gelmedics available,
which three-eyedine

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.790
production is dependent on.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:24.833
Gelmedics?

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.710
[SOUMA]
Kind of a subspecies of gelins,

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.672
which can survive in
unsanitary environments.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.799
Before getting refined,
three-eyedine

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.968
is extracted from it.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.470
Thanks to Tomoe's help,
there has been an increase

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:38.596
in gelmedics.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.556
[LISCIA]
Hold on.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:42.350
Aren't gelins more plantlike
than animal-like?

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.269
But Tomoe can talk to them?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.397
Apparently, communication
is a little bit murky.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.857
Still, she's had some luck.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.067
In fact, she's discovered
a little about their ideal

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.569
living conditions.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.405
[LISCIA] Feels like our little
sister's the one teaching us.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.115
Isn't that the truth?

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.741
[spraying]

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.996
[HILDE laughing]

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.165
Sterilize the unsanitary!

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.124
There you are!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:09.169
[laughs]
And some more over here!

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.046
This woman is clearly
deranged, Kazuya.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.549
Uh, what's that
weirdo doing exactly?

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.010
This is just normal
behavior for her.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.595
You know this psycho?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.180
Doctor Hilde Norg.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.473
as you can see,
she's three-eyed.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.225
On top of that,
she has a high degree

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.102
of medical knowledge and skills,

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.188
even by the standards
of her people.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.356
She's a doctor?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.941
[SOUMA]
Same old Hilde, I see.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.610
[HILDE]
Huh?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.069
And who are you?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.571
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.073
Oh. Well if it
isn't His Majesty.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.159
I thought you were just
some sorta vagabond.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.578
[SOUMA laughs]
Introductions are in order.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.829
These two are...

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.081
Oh, I know.
That's the princess,

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.210
and that's the former air
force general's daughter,

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.587
in a rather embarrassing
outfit, I might add.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.798
Hey, are you familiar
with my friend Owen?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.550
I would rather be boiled
alive than know a man

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.427
of his filthy stature, ugh.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.763
Just who're you calling
filthy, you elite snob?

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.224
Try and make a move,
you musclebound freak.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:05.683
So tell me something, Hilde,

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.061
what is it that has brought
you out here today?

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:10.230
Leave the populace
unsupervised for long,

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.523
pretty soon they
get filthy again.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.609
I come by regularly
to offer health tips

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.860
and sanitize.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.071
[SOUMA] That reminds me,
where's your partner?

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:18.905
Is he not with you?

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.449
He is not my partner,
is that quite clear?

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.910
Anyway, Brad is wandering
around somewhere.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.245
He's always saying
how he'd rather treat

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.081
a stray dog than filthy,
overgrown pigs.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.582
Or some sort of nonsense.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.461
[SOUMA]
Sounds like typical Brad.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.256
[HILDE] King, would you mind
talking to him for me?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:40.176
He's always making me
lecture his junior students.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.844
Who's this Brad?

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:45.098
Full name's Brad Jocker,
and he's a doctor, too.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:48.393
Also healthcare reformist,
just like Hilde.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.353
So is he three-eyed as well?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.479
He's not.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.064
A young human, actually,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.108
and he is decent
at his trade, too.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:57.360
But his personality
could use a little work.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:58.403
Pardon.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.530
Um, are you even
listening to me?

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.198
Your Majesty?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.658
Please Forgive me, Hilde.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.159
I will speak with him.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.496
Now then, what brings you
this far from the castle?

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.497
Oh.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.624
Just checking on the
job training center.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.210
I put Ginger in charge and
wanted to see how it's going.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.722
[GIRL A]
Goodbye, Miss San!

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.056
[GIRL B]
See you tomorrow!

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.975
Have a nice day, everyone.
Be good!

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:31.978
Thank you for coming
by the school to see us,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.771
Your Majesty.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.524
Hey, San.
Where's Ginger?

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.235
[SAN] Master Ginger.
King Souma is here for you.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.324
Your Majesty!

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.534
I told you, no need
to be so formal.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:47.910
Oh! The princess is here?

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.203
H-Hi, um...

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.289
M-My name is Ginger Ca-Camus,

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.916
and it's such an a-amazing
honor to meet you, Highness!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.210
You're sure stuttering
more than usual today.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.966
Behind me, that's Carla Vargas.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.676
This man is Owen Jabana.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.928
--And that's--
--I know Doctor Hilde.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.222
She's always stopping by to
give free medical checkups

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.974
to the school children.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.017
[SOUMA]
Hm?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.727
[HILDE] Yeah, only 'cause
I can't stand seeing

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.354
their grubby little hands.

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.189
I'm going to spray over there.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.982
Give me a holler
when you're finished.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.319
I believe some went to play
in that direction, there.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.529
[HILDE]
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.239
I hear you've been
teaching children to read,

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.241
write, and do math here.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.910
[CAMUS]
Not just the little ones.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.620
Adults are learning, as well.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.080
Adults, too?

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.831
There are many in the
kingdom who've never had

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.416
an education.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:38.127
Days, we teach kids,
and the adults at night,

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.254
after they've finished
all their labors.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.007
Is that right?
I really had no idea.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.594
[CAMUS] We plan to eventually
offer other lessons as well.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.012
Isn't that right, sire?

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.139
Yeah. There's tons.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.392
Including training for
civil engineers as well as

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.602
adventurers who
explore dungeons,

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.146
and lessons on medical
techniques from Hilde.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.524
That's quite the wide
variety of subjects.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.235
The academic research in
this world is pretty narrow

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.779
and mostly focuses on
magic and monsters, right?

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.450
Thing is, hidden within
studies that are outside

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.994
the mainstream, there's
tremendous potential

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.579
waiting to be found.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.748
When you master a field,
no matter the subject,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.041
you're the best.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.877
By becoming number one,
you also become the Only One.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.588
And those Only Ones are who
you want to nurture, right?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.800
Yes, but first off, we need
to do whatever it takes

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.636
to raise the education
of the entire kingdom.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.138
What's the center's status?

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.556
Sounds like things are well.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.682
Oh, they are.

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.685
Attendance is way up,
and the school lunch program

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.479
Your Majesty suggested
has been very popular.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:41.607
I've never heard of a school
lunch program before.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.110
It's a system I introduced
from my homeland.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:47.238
If you're a student going
here and under 12,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.240
then you're able to
eat lunch for free.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.450
Wow.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.742
How wonderful!

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.412
That will be a huge help
for poor households.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.913
If they keep studying hard,

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.165
there's a good chance
in the future,

00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.667
they'll be able to escape
from a life of poverty.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.335
I'm afraid to say our
adult attendance,

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.171
on the other hand,
is rather poor.

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.964
Basically, their reasoning
is why should they learn

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.216
mathematics or be literate
if they've lived this long

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.634
without any need?

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.720
It's my job to help
them see why.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.346
So leave that part to me.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:14.348
I'll come up with something.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.725
[CAMUS]
Thank you, sire.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:16.851
All righty then.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.519
Now that we've confirmed
all is coming along

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.855
nicely here,
on to the next stop.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.315
Where are we headed?

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.193
Huh? Didn't I mention
the reason for our trip?

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.611
No, you didn't.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.820
Going outside.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.864
But we're already outside.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.407
Outside castle walls.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.825
But the refugee camps are there,

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.203
and they're even more
dangerous than the slums!

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.913
I think it's about
time I saw them.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.583
[HILDE] If you're going outside,
you'll be needing me.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.710
So how long have you
been standing there?

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:45.421
[HILDE] I finished up
disinfecting the urchins.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.507
And Brad disappeared somewhere.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.592
That deadbeat is really
gonna get it for making me

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.427
cover his lectures again.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.980
For sure this place is a dump,

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.899
but oddly enough,
there's a powerful look

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.692
in their eyes.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.111
[SOUMA] They came a long
way from the north

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.280
with nothing but
the will to live.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.324
It's safe to assume
that those who are here

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:16.410
are far stronger than
we could ever imagine.

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:19.539
They've experienced wars,
natural disasters,

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.165
and other misfortunes.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:24.001
Yet somehow they still stand
on their own two feet.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.796
Refugees have a unique
brand of strength.

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.757
Then again, that strength
can also be a hazard.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.259
While their sense
of unity grows,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.595
their sense of individuality
also becomes diluted.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.597
By the way, Sou-- I mean,

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.599
Kazuya, you said you
had supported them.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.059
What'd we do for them?

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.852
Really wasn't all that much.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.854
We sent food, firewood,
and supplies

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.523
they desperately needed.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.234
Also, I had the adventurers'
guild make security

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.611
around the camp a quest.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.405
[LISCIA] I get supplying
them with essentials,

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.365
but why do they need
our protection?

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.492
[SOUMA] When foreign nationals
are victims of crimes

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.869
or the perpetrators,
it often leads to

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.496
international incidents.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.872
But it's different
for these people,

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.374
who have no countries.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.543
As long as it doesn't
become a global event,

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.878
people are often content
looking the other way.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.715
Those sort of folk
need to be punished!

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:11.799
No.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.551
There's also the possibility
that our own people

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.094
could harm the refugees.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.221
[REFUGEE A]
Help!

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.310
What's all the commotion?

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.395
Look! Those thugs just
showed up out of nowhere

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.480
and tried kidnapping
all the children!

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.523
They tried what?

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.108
[REFUGEE B] They're attacking
anyone who jumps in

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.359
to stop them!

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.445
Those adventurers heard
about what was happening

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.197
and stepped in
to protect our camp!

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.407
Carla, Owen.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.242
Go and help the
adventurers, fast.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.285
As you command.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.038
Let's show this scum
what valor looks like!

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.331
Come on!

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:44.957
Hilde, I want you to
go and help the priest

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.208
over there.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.502
[HILDE] Oh, well, what
other choice is there?

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.838
And I'll stay and
protect you, Kazuya.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.507
A hero who can't defend himself.
How sad.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.842
Well that's why I'm here.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.262
You can fight if needed, right?

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.723
Owen has been putting me
through all the paces,

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.559
but he says I'm only slightly
better than a fresh recruit.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.561
Well that doesn't
sound too reassuring.

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.439
No matter what happens,
try and stay behind me.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.982
I guess that's all I can do.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:16.447
Duck, Juno!

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.410
Uh-oh.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.663
Say goodbye to your head!

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.667
[SOUMA]
Keep calm. Stand your ground.

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.043
If I can make it
through his strike,

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.628
Juno can get back to her feet.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.004
I just have to remember
the basic moves

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.631
that Owen drilled into me!

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.974
[SOUMA]
I did it! I actually did it!

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.184
A successful parry!

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.560
Don't just stand there!

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.446
Tell me, what were you thinking?

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.281
You can't be running
off like that!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.284
[SOUMA]
I, um... I'm sorry.

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.829
I thought my heart was going
to stop, I was so worried!

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.664
If anything were to happen
to you, do you know

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.874
what would happen?
I would--

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.044
All right, pal! We've never met,
but you called me Juno.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.797
So you wanna go ahead and tell
me how you know my name?

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:17.174
'Cause I... Well, you see...

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.009
Yeah, Kazuya.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.512
You seem to be very
chummy with her.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.806
[SOUMA] How do I explain
my way out of this mess?

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.933
Not like I can just
say the truth.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.893
"Yeah, I'm the king and I've
been going on adventures

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.979
with you as Master Mascot."

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.689
[JUNO]
Hey, are listening to me?

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.982
Kazuya?

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.192
That was incredibly
reckless of you, Master.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.153
[laughs]

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.988
I saw you in action.

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:41.365
Those sword skills I taught
you sure came in handy,

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:42.450
didn't they?

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.368
Ah! Both of you, nice work!

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.870
There's no way you're
changing the subject.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.164
Hey! I'm still waiting
for an explanation!

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:51.375
So, got any idea who these
two punks are anyway?

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:52.668
Well?

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.088
Look. We were just hired
by some slave trader.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.049
Slave trader? What for?

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.676
Because the king of
this country has gone

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:03.471
and made the slave
traders into civil servants.

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.973
Thing is, you need
to get qualified,

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.893
and our employer ended up
failing the review process.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.978
[SOUMA] So why are you
attacking refugees?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.272
To get out of this country.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.524
Women and children
fetch a healthy price.

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:16.734
What'd you say?

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.736
Easy! Mercy!

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.863
We were told the refugees
were easy pickings

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.531
since the kingdom wouldn't
go out of their way

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:23.783
to give 'em protection.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.367
And who told you that?

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.745
Uh, we were just hired
to do a job, man.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.206
[MERCENARY B grunts]

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.500
[MERCENARY A grunts]

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:40.007
Carla, would you go and tell
Hakuya what happened out here?

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.593
Sure he'll take swift
measures to deal with this.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.637
[CARLA]
Yes! As you command.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:46.931
[HILDE] Well, I finished
treating the injured.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.766
Don't know what the plan is.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:51.101
We've managed to draw
quite a crowd here.

Crap! We're supposed
to be incognito!

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.814

don't raise your voice!
