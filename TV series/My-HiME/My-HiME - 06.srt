Hey, Shiho.

165
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,958
I guess we have to check
this room as well.

166
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,416
[SHIHO]
Ah! Don't touch that!

167
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,750
Sorry. That door's
gotta stay closed.

168
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,375
--Oh.
--[SHIHO] There's an old legend

169
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,333
that's been passed down
at this shrine.

170
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,583
A big scary god that used
to terrorize the town

171
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,666
is locked inside,
so the door has to stay sealed,

172
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,000
or there'll be
serious consequences.

173
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,500
Oh.

174
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,750
I guess it's good idea to
take these things seriously.

175
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,125
But...

176
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,208
Nothing bad'll happen
if I leave it alone, right?

177
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,666
[YUICHI grunts]

178
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,333
I'd say that's about it.

179
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,458
[MAI] Yup, now we just
have to take to the hall.

180
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,416
There aren't too many
heavy boxes here,

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,083
so we might be able
to do it in one trip.

182
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,208

[YUICHI]
Done.

00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,291
Long as nobody's forgotten
anything, we're outta here.

[GROUP]
Okay!

[MIDORI]
No biggie.

188
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,583
I've got an ace up
my sleeve if I need it.

189
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,833
More importantly...

190
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,333
[MIDORI]
Hmph.

by Korekiyo Torii?

194

And this one's Udagawa's

195
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,291
Ha! These are all cult books!

196
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,791
Like the

197

And Toraibo's
<i>Iyohouryaku Engi</i> !

198
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,750
I've hit the jackpot!

[MAI sighs]

200
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,916
Not only do we get paid, but we
get dinner and a bath as well!

Oh, this?

205
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,416
I've had it since I was born.

when I take a bath.

[SHIHO]
Oh...

208

Then...

209
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,916
[SHIHO]
That, too?

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,750
Doesn't that look
a lot like mine?

211

I was shocked when I saw it!

Wow...

--Ooh.

There's not a mark on you.

It's just not fair!

What do you mean, "not fair"?

putting on a show for us.

Aw, Sis...

still nothing going on

Nothing at all!

Why not? I can't count
the number of times

you've seen Shiho
naked in the past.

--[TAKUMI] Uh...
--Give me a break, Gramps.

[TAKUMI]
Mm...

[MAI]
This is so much fun.

238

It's like being
on a school trip.

Sister?!

489
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,750
[YUKARIKO] If your teacher
tells you she's 17,

490
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,750
it means that she's 17.

491
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,291
Have faith in her.

00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,333

Right...
