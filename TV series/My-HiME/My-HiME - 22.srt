00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,541
[TEACHER A] Next,
let's look at this problem.

2
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,958
Suzuki?

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,291
Oh, right, he's already
transferred to another school.

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,291
[It's getting awfully
lonely around here...

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,416
...with so many students gone...

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,166
Wajima! Try solving it.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,291
[WAJIMA]
What? A-Are you serious?

8
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,291
[MIDORI]
Have you made up your mind?

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,750
I don't know who he is,

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,666
but he's definitely at the
center of all this trouble.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,708
Obsidian Prince...

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,666
It's like the
headmaster told us.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,333
If there was only one way
for the HiME to avoid

14
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,833
fighting each other,

15
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:55,625
it would probably be by
defeating the Obsidian Prince.

16
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,458
But, then again...

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,958
...maybe you wanna fight.

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,875
If it's power that
you're really looking for,

19
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:06,625
the kind of power you can gain
from winning to the end,

20
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,833
then I won't be
able to stop you.

21
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,625
[MIDORI]
Regardless...

22
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,750
...there isn't
very much time left.

[ANNOUNCER A] Tensions have been
mounting in the Kashmir region,

occurring all over the place,

are traveling through the
islands, there's a hail storm

28
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,875
over the Sahara Desert

29

at our school.

30

Sounds like it's
the end of the world.

31
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,208
All of a sudden,

32
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,083
everything that we took for
granted is being destroyed.

33

Ah! You still haven't
heard anything from Nao?

34
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,625
She's always taking off
from school

00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,083
without permission,

36
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,875

been gone way too long.

Same with Mai.

First, she quits her job
at the restaurant,

41

then, she stops coming to class.

seen Mikoto at all.

And I think Takumi has
taken some time off as well.

but she wouldn't
tell me anything.

anything about this?

The dean wants to get ahold
of the board members.

He's getting pretty desperate.

64

But without the headmaster
and Shizuru around,

65
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,750
it's going to be
quite difficult.

[REITO]
Hmph. Forgive me.

74
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,125
Maybe that was being
a little too mean.

75
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,958
But if you're honestly
concerned about her...

outta class, did you?

In so many ways.

running the student council!

What do you want?

168
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,666
It's just-- It's just I heard
a rumor that you might be

169
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,000
leaving the school for good...

You what?

What does that
have to do with you?

I'm worried about you.

What's wrong with that?

Hey. Tell me what happened.

It's for your own sake, Tate.

I've told you that
quite a few times before.

If my theory is correct,

If our former chairman
was certain of anything,

250
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,875
It was that we should acquire
as much power as possible.

251
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,541
The person who developed
the basics behind the device

252
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,583
was a female scientist who
worked for your organization.

Is that why you've
come to talk to me, then?

You want me to
take responsibility.

Oh, no, nothing of the kind.

256
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,375
Our new chairman simply wants
to have good relations

00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
with the true power
of this country.

274
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,875

in your capable hands.

No problem.
I'll take care of it!

276
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,333
So, are you sure you
don't wanna be in bed?

277
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,333
I was only feeling a
little sick, nothing serious.

278
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,500
Oh. That's a relief.

279
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,958
Miss Sugiura? I was wondering...

280
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,625
Is there someone you
hold precious in your life?

281

Wow, this is coming
from outta nowhere.

Uh, well... Y-Yeah, actually.

He's all proper and stuff,
and focused on his research.

284
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,083
He's a bit of an odd ball.

285
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,708
Even when a cute, young girl
like me shows interest in him,

286
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,458
he doesn't even seem to notice.

287
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,750
[YUKARIKO] Would you be willing
to do anything for that person?

288
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,458
What? Well, I don't
know about that...

289
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,000
Jeez... Dunno...
But probably.

290
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,416
Hmph. [laughs]
What am I saying?

291
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,833
I've been hoping I could
become the kind of girl

292

he'd wanna make his.

293
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,750
But all my attempts
haven't made any difference.

294
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,583
Your feelings are wonderful.

295
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,500
That must be what it means
to honestly love someone.

00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,416
What're you talking about?!

298
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,833
Sister, you're the one
who's supposed to be

299
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,791
the "love expert" around here.

300
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,208
That's what they
keep telling me.

301
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,916
[ISHIGAMI growls]
I still have a chance...

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,041
Jeez, I might as well--

303
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,166
No, I can't!

304
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,416
Hang on, maybe I'll--

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,416
[NAGI]
That's a nice painting.

306
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,416
[gasps]

307
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,125
[NAGI] It brings to life
the love between

308
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,291
the painter with the model.

309
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,333
Why are you here?!
Did you come to eliminate me?!

310
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,208
[NAGI]
I wonder what I should do?

311
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,583
[ISHIGAMI whimpers]

312
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
[NAGI]
Hmph. But that wouldn't be fair.

313
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,416
After all, you have been
at least some help to us

314
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,375
in your own unique way.

315
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,833
I guess I could agree
to give you a bit of a break.

316
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,583
That is, if you're willing
to go along with my plan.

317
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,041
[ISHIGAMI whimpers]

318
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,166
[MIDORI] Sister sure seems
exhausted, poor thing.

319
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,250
Yeah. But it's not like
she's overworked.

320
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,208
--It's more like she's...
--[MIDORI] Hmm?

321
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,166
Anyway, what did
you want from me?

322
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,166
I'm not lending you money
if that's what you're after.

323
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
Oh, man. Busted.

324
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,708
Okay, but at least
hang on to this.

325
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,500
[YOKO]
Hmm?

326
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,958
Just for a while.

327
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,583
I'm counting on you, Yoko.

328
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,958
Wait a sec!

329
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,833
[SHIHO groans]

330
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,083
[YUICHI]
I'm coming in.

331
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,375
[SHIHO]
Huh?! Ah! Ahh!

332
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,291
[YUICHI sighs]

333
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,916
What's the matter with you?

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,083
[YUICHI]
Hmm? I-It's nothing.

335
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,000
Your eyes... They're bloodshot.
Have you been sleeping properly?

336
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,583
Kinda.

337
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,916
I stayed up late 'cause there
was something I wanted to do.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,458
[YUICHI]
You need your rest.

339
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,333
Your rehab's pretty
demanding, isn't it?

340
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,375
I know what'll help.
Will you sleep next to me?!

341
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,375
Please?!

342
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,583
[gulps]

343
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,750
I have terrible dreams
when I go to sleep.

344
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,291
Will you?

345
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,666
If you've really given your
truest heart to me, you would.

346
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,041
Given you...

347
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,291
Given my truest heart...

348
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,666
I'll always stick
by you, all right?

349
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,791
Just don't ask too much of me...

350
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,208
[SHIHO]
You coward!

351
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,375
Yeah. I guess I am a coward.

352
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,250
How's it going, Mai?

353
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,000
[SHIZURU]
Natsuki.

354
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,166
Hey, the sun's
gone down already.

355
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,375
It's gonna get
chilly pretty soon.

356
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,500
Oh...

357
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,666
Natsuki...

358
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,833
[SHIZURU whimpers]

359
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,708
[HARUKA screams, grunts]

360
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,041
[SHIZURU gasps]

361
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,000
What did you just do?!

362
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,750
Why don't we have a talk over
there, all right, girls?

363
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,375
[MIDORI]
Hmm...

364
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,125
[MIKOTO]
That's as far as you go, Midori!

365
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,291
[MIDORI]
Huh?!

366
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,500
Mikoto...?

367
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,500
Is that you?

368
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,500
Natsuki...

369
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,625
[NATSUKI gasps]

370
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,625
Nah. That's just crazy.
Why would Shizuru...?

371
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,708
[HARUKA] You have
completely disappointed me!

372
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,083
There's big trouble at
the school, and you're

373
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,791
abandoning you duties,

374
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,791
and on top of everything,
what was that?!

375
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,000
There's no place for you on
the Student Council!

376
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,750
That's what I'm
here to tell you!

377
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,708
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?!

378
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,083
I'll be counting on you to do
your best, Miss Suzushiro.

379
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,000
What?! You're going to throw
away your responsibilities

380
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:24,833
just like that?!

381
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,208
[YUKINO]
H-Haruka...

382
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,333
[SHIHO] And you do your best
to help Miss Suzushiro.

383
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,875
All right, Miss Kikukawa?

384
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,291
[YUKINO gasps]

385
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,875
How could you be
so cold about all of this?

386
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,333
About everything?!

387
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,125
[SHIZURU]
Hmph.

388
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,750
[YUKINO]
I can't do it!

389
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't you see Haruka's
always looked up to you?!

390
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,708
I know she may not be
any kind of match for you...

391
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,166
But still,

392
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,041
she's always wanted to be
acknowledged as your rival!

393
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,750
Yukino! What are
you going on about?!

394
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,000
That's why she's
always worked so hard!

395
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,000
But you don't even take the
slightest notice of her!

396
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,291
Yukino!

397
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,333
Come back to the school!
I'm begging you!

398
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,583
[SHIZURU]
Hmm.

399
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,458
[YUKINO] If you don't
come back, then I'll...

400
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,833
I saw what you did.

401
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,250
Like how you kissed
her back there...

402
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,041
I saw what you did
to Natsuki while she slept.

403
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,791
How could you do
something like that

404
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,041
to someone who
trusts you as a friend?

405
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,333
[gasps]

406
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,250
[NATSUKI gasps]

407
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,000
[SHIZURU] That's quite the
accusation, Miss Kikukawa.

408
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,791
But isn't it a case of the
pot calling the kettle black?

409
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,458
[YUKINO]
No! I was only...

410
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,791
You were what?
Enjoying watching other people?

411
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,791
That's quite a hobby
you've got there.

412
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,958
[gasps]

413
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,875
[SHIZURU grunts]

414
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,333
[HARUKA] I've never been
this disappointed by anyone

415
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,500
in my entire life.

416
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,333
Disgusting!
How can you look so calm?!

417
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,750
I think the only person
you care about is yourself!

418
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,791
You have no right to tell
Yukino off! Ever!

419
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,333
Two women behaving like
that with each other!

420
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,458
You're filthy!

421
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,708
Both you and Natsuki Kuga!

422
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,375
What happened was
something that I did to her.

423
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,250
I will not have you
insulting Natsuki.

424
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,833
[SHIZURU]
Tell me something.

425
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,541
Do you think you should be able
to get away with anything,

426
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,250
as long as it's for the sake
of the person you love?

427
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,208
Just as I thought.
I think so as well.

428
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,666
No, Shizuru!

429
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,583
[NAGI] Mai, it seems like
you're finally getting serious.

430
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,375
Yeah. I'm willing to go
along with your plan,

431
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,958
but first, I wanna meet
the Obsidian Prince.

432
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,458
I dunno. Why I should let you?

433
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,625
I wanna know about the power

434
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,875
that the last
standing HiME gains,

435
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,083
and find out for myself
that it's real.

436
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,375
The Obsidian Palace
is tightly fortified.

437
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,291
And there's no way that I can
trust someone who puts

438
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,000
only himself out
of danger's way.

439
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,666
You're impossible...

440
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,791
First, I want to see proof
that you're actually serious

441
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,500
about this.

442
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,791
Then, perhaps I'll consider
your little request.

443
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,958
[gasps]

444
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,375
You go and check it out.

445
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,125
[NAGI, REITO]
I will watch over you...

446
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,541
...Mai-HiME.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,250
[NAGI] Well, the storm
clouds are rolling in.

448
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,583
[MAI]
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,041
This is all your doing!

450
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,250
[NAGI]
Oh, right.

451
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,416
I'm so amazing,
I surprise myself sometimes.

452
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,000
Or maybe it's just that
everyone else is so ordinary.

453
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,125
[MAI] That's it, I'm gonna
destroy you first, after all!
