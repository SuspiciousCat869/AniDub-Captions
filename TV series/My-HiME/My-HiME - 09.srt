it seem even more likely

that they ran off together.

to talk to her more often.

to do it properly.

didn't know anything about it?

can help you with,

I dunno how to swim either.

To be honest, I've never
even tried before.

My sister told me I almost
drowned once, when I was a kid.

Sorry about Haruka.
She's got a bad habit

of saying things that
are kinda harsh.

00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,583
[tires screech]

483
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,000
See? You did it!

484
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,416
--[MIKOTO] Mm-hmm!
--[BOTH gasp]

485
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,708
So, Kuga. Mind explaining?

486
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,041
Woo-hoo! Nice moves!

487
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,208
[REITO laughs]

488
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,625
We were worried, so we came
to look for you guys.

489
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,750
That was quite the
little show you gave us!

490
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,291
[NATSUKI whimpers]

491
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,666
[NATSUKI growls, screams]

492
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,416
[HARUKA] Now, this is the
proper way to prepare a Grouper.

493
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,541
First, take the kitchen knife
and jam it into the gills!

494
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,958
[YUKINO]
Ah, o-okay...

495
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,708
[HARUKA] And then you slice and
cut and hack and slice!

496
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,333
--[screams]
--[YUKINO] Haruka?!

497
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,708
[HARUKA groans]

498
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,833
[YUKINO] How about we
work on some regular dishes,

499
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,208
and then try a harder dish
that involves a Grouper?
