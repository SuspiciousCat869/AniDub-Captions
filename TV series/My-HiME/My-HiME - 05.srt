wanna know about him?

Because! Is it true that he's

Didn't you tell Mai that
we were coming to visit

Were you trying to
leave her out, or what?

Seems pretty childish
if you ask me.

That's not it!

Then tell me how it is!

let it slip to the others...

We wanted to talk to you,

but... it's not exactly
easy to bring up.

[MIYA] It's only been a short
time since you transferred here,

[MAI]
Oh, come on!

00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,333
I should be the
one to apologize!

00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,666
I mean, for making you guys
get all worried about me.

You mean you're not mad at us?

'Course not! That's crazy.

There's nothing for me
to be mad about, is there?

353
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,708
You sure are dedicated
to your brother.

354
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,125
I really admire you.

355
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,791
Nah, it's no big deal.

356
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,250
If you wanna see my notes,
or even study for an exam,

Oh, Mai.

If you're looking for Takumi,

367
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,208
your father came to pick
him up a little while ago.

You're such a dedicated girl,
Mai; always trying so hard.

Oh, nothing special.

Just wanted to say hello to
a doctor who treated me before.

Don't you have an umbrella?

Well, don't expect
to get under mine.

Whatever. I would've
refused if you offered.
