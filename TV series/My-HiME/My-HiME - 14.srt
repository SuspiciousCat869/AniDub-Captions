Huh? Good question...

322
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,333
I wish there was no fighting.

323
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,166
I wish I was just
going to school,

324
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,000
working at my part-time job,
and hanging out with friends.

325
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,166
That's how

326
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,125
Then let's make it happen!

327
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,250
[MAI]
Hmm... Mikoto...

[MIKOTO growls]

329
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
[NAGI]
Looking good.

330
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,208
Keep up the nice work.

331
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,416
Nice of you to finally show up!

332
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,333
So I guess this is a
big enough crisis for you?!

333
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
Remember the underground shrine?

334
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,625
Anyway, if you can manage to
make it there, you'll be safe.

335
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,125
Good luck finding your way.

336
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,250
Come back!

337
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,666

Mai!

00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,458
[groans]
Gimme a break!

340
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,791
What's the matter, Mai?!

341
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,250
I can't summon Kagutsuchi
when it's like this.

342
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,333
Call him! Let's get 'em all!

343
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,208
Not on humans!

347
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,625
Close your eyes!

Load Flash Cartridge!

Fire!

[MIKOTO screams]

352
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,250
The Valkyries have escaped
from the academy perimeter.

[ALYSSA]
Miyu.

354
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,750
How much longer do we
have to wait until Artemis

355
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,458
is in position to fire again?

356
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,875
[MIYU]
Eleven hours and 52 minutes.

357
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,250
[NATSUKI]
I see.

358
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,875
What about Midori
and the others?

359
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,333
[MAI]
I dunno.

360
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,750
Either they've been caught
or they've somehow escaped.

361
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,416
[NATSUKI] I still can't
believe a place like this

362
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,958
was under the school
all this time.

Come right this way.

00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,333
Hey. What do you think
about this guy?

369
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,666
Can we trust him?

370
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,208
[NATSUKI]
Hmm. We're covered.

Hey! Is everyone all right?!

377
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,958
Midori, you're here!
Yukino, too?

Hey!

My dear HiME...

[MASHIRO] I am pleased
that you've all made it here.

00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,333
Obsidian Palace.
Lying at the very core,

382
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,666
it's the last fortress
protecting the land of Fuka.

Now, we've got everyone!

388
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,500
We've got a commander
and an underground base!

389
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,125
It's time to hit them back!

390

I can't wait!

Can't wait, huh?

if I share your excitement.
