1
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,833
So...

2
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,833
...you're sure you're
not gonna come with us?

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,416
There's something that
I need to sort out first.

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,541
I'll leave as soon as I'm done.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,500
I hope you really
mean that, Mai.

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,166
I do. I'll be right behind you.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,708
[BOTH]
Mm...

8
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,958
[MAI sighs]

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,875
You probably know this,
but we really love you.

10
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,083
Don't ever forget that, okay?

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,625
Thanks for saying so.

12
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:50,833
If you were a boy, I might've
really fallen for you, Chie.

13
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,166
You don't hear that every day,

14
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,291
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,791
Tate's lucky; he is the one
you've fallen for, isn't he?

16
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:58,916
[gasps]

17
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,083
[MAI whimpers]

18
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,375
--Mai?
--Is something the matter?

19
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,833
[MAI]
Uh... It's no big deal.

20
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,458
[bell rings]

21
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,458
[CHIE]
Oh...

22
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,708
[whistle blows]

23
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,083
[AOI whimpering] We'll be
waiting, so make sure you come!

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,250
[sobs]

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,083
This nightmare will
be over by tomorrow.

26
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,333
That's when we'll
meet. I promise.

27
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,208
[SAKOMIZU] I won't
pretend to understand it.

28
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,791
I have no idea why such
an intelligent woman

29
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,500
would do something like that.

30
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,375
But I'll tell you this:
Dr. Kuga did truly treasure you.

31
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,875
That's one thing that
I can be certain about.

32
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,666
I've decided to trust
in the devoted mother

33
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,666
I remember her as.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,208
That's good enough for me.

35
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,916
Anyway... loving someone
is what starts it all.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,750
People care about their
precious ones so much

37
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,083
they get lost and make mistakes.

38
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,208
Yeah, you could be
right about that.

39
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,833
It might be precisely
because Fujino has

40
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,875
fallen in love with you,
and because you're so special

41
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,875
to her, that she ended up
causing such devastation.

42
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,250
[NATSUKI]
If that's true...

43
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,583
then love is something
I never want to experience.

44
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,875
I dunno. Think about it.

45
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,625
Love is the one thing
that enables people

46
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,791
to carry on living.

47
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,000
[NATSUKI]
Hmph.

48
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,375
I'll be praying
everything works out.

49
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,125
[CHIE]
Hey, Mai!

50
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,791
[gasps]

51
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,583
Hiya!

52
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,333
[YUICHI]
What's the matter, Tokiha?

53
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,958
Why the sad face?

54
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,375
Ha, ha! I bet you
screwed something up!

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,041
[MAI sobs]

56
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,458
[sighs]

57
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,791
[MAI]
Hey, Natsuki?

58
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
School sure can be fun, huh?

59
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,000
[NATSUKI] I never took
you for the studying type.

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,166
[MAI]
Nah, that's not what I meant.

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,375
It's just that...
all my friends are here

62
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,541
and we all hang
around having fun.

63
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,791
I really do like school.

64
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,750
[NATSUKI] Personally,
I found it a pain in the butt.

65
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,000
[MAI] You definitely majored
in skipping classes!

66
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,833
[NATSUKI]
Pfft! Hey, watch it!

67
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,166
Anyway...

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,500
I wanna enjoy life
more from now on.

69
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,166
Live every day to the fullest,
to make up for lost time.

70
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,291
[MAI]
Yeah.

71
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,791
So we still haven't been
able to find the pieces

72
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,666
of that robot trash.
Another thing:

73
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,833
There's that sham
of a HiME, as well.

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
Too many
unpredictable factors.

75
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,625
But that's what makes it
all the more interesting.

76
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,916
I mean, this festival
is fundamentally different

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,625
from all the others that
have played out in the past.

78
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,500
You really have changed.

79
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,500
No, I am who I am.
My body may vary,

80
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,958
but my soul remains
the same as always.

81
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,583
[NAGI]
Is something the matter?

82
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,083
[REITO]
No...

83
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,958
Dinner's ready, Natsuki!

84
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,458
Ah! Don't you know
how to knock?!

85
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,291
Oh...! Oops! Sorry.

86
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,000
Just a force of habit, I guess.

87
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,291
[MAI] I wanted to make something
a little fancier, but, oh, well.

88
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,375
Yikes! That's hot.
Go on and start without me.

89
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,708
[NATSUKI]
Hmm?

90
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,583
Whoa, this is great!

91
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,625
Are you sure these are
instant ramen noodles?!

92
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,958
Positive.

93
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,416
I told you: these noodles
are outta this world.

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,541
Yeah...

95
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,333
These noodles are
the best ever...

96
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,625
Thank you for the meal...

97
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,416
It's yummy...

98
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,625
Ramen noodles are
still my favorite...

99
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,375
[MIKOTO]
It's good...

100
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,958
R-Really good...

101
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,375
[whimpers]

102
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,541
Mai!

103
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,875
On second thought...
It's not good... at all...

104
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,833
[voice faltering]
I want Mai's ramen...

105
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,958
It's the best... Ever...

106
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,708
[sobbing]

107
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,541
Mai! Mai!

108
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,583
[sobbing]

109
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,041
Mai...

110
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,666
[MAI]
Mikoto...

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,333
I wish I understood what
those tears of yours meant.

112
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,041
[MIKOTO sobbing]

113
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,500
[REITO]
What's the matter, Mikoto?

114
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,375
[MIKOTO]
Huh...?

115
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,958
You don't need to cry.

116
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,541
You have me by
your side, remember?

117
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,208
Brother!

118
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,583
[sobs]

119
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,333
You don't have to think
about a thing, Mikoto.

120
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,375
I'll take care of everything;
it's all under control.

121
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,291
All right. If you say so...

122
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:53,791
[MAI] Tomorrow's the day.
I'll see you then.

123
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,166
Even if...

124
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,541
there's no other way but
to fight each other.

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,750
[NATSUKI]
Shizuru, I'll stop you.

126
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,166
No matter what it takes.

127
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,375
[SHIZURU]
Natsuki, wait for me...

128
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,708
Soon, I will make you mine.

129
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,708
Yamada?

130
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,500
This one's on the house,

131
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,958
'cause you were one
of my better clients.

132
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,625
I enjoyed working together.

133
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,458
[NATSUKI]
Hmm.

134
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,541
There's no way I'll be
able to survive this.

135
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,666
I'm gonna leave
everything up to you.

136
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,125
I'm sorry, Mai.

137
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,416
Natsuki...

138
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,250
Mai, I'm truly glad
that I met you.

139
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,833
Same goes for me.

140
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,416
You understand what your
role is, Mikoto, don't you?

141
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,291
Yes, I do, Brother.

142
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,541
Nagi.

143
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,083
I want you to carry out
the ancient contract.

144
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,708
Your wish is my command, Master.

145
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,000
It's almost time.

146
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,041
The final act of this
show is about to begin.

147
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,916
Where a new world will
be created by me and my wife!

148
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,416
Huh?

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,666
Miko...

150
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,791
Miyu?

151
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,041
No...

152
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,500
[gasps]

153
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,000
Show me which way to go

154
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,791
to find the gates of Valhalla,
the underground shrine.

155
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,333
[MAI]
Ah... But why?

156
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,000
[MIYU] There is no need for
you to know that information.

157
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,458
You people are mere pawns
in a larger game.

158
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,791
I seek true revenge against
the one who controls the pawns.

159
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,791
That's all I have
to say about this.

160
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,000
[MAI sighs]

161
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,458
[MIYU]
Why, may I ask, are you here?

162
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,833
Do you intend
to continue battle?

163
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,541
The person you loved, who served
as the source of your strength,

164
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,000
has already
been extinguished.

165
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,791
I'm not doing it for anyone.

166
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,250
I'm doing it 'cause
I feel I have to.

[COMPUTER] This unit

from the previous operation.

169
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,250
Do you wish to format the data
and assign a new master?

170
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,625
No, thanks. Not necessary.

171
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,958
[MIDORI] I'll trust you, seeing
as how you've demonstrated

172
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,875
how much Alyssa meant to you.

174
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,666
[MIYU] You humans certainly are
a difficult race to understand,

175
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,500
considering you don't
share the kind of bond

176
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,083
I had with Miss Alyssa.

177
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,166
Now tell me. Which way
to the shrine entrance?

[MAI grunts]

179
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,000
[MIYU]
So it is there.

00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,458
[MAI]
Wait! Miyu!

181
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,041
You're always showing up
outta nowhere, like that.

182
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,500
[NATSUKI] You destroyed the
headquarters of District 1.

183
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,375
Not to mention the HiME.

184
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,791
You've gone too far.

185
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,791
I won't let you carry on
like this anymore!

186
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,166
[SHIZURU]
I thought so.

187
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,916
In other words, you're
rejecting my love for you...

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,333
All right, then...

189

I'll stop you even if we
have to kill each other!

00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,750
That's what my brother wishes!

193
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,958
I couldn't care less--
I will still get past you.

[MIYU] Confirming the call
of Alyssa Searrs.

Where's Mikoto?!

Right about now, she's playing
with that Searrs robot trash.

00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,208
We've gotta destroy that thing

Aw, you're leaving?

[NAGI]
Hang on.

If you don't hurry up, you're
just going to run out of time.

I'm going to see Mikoto!

But the Obsidian Prince has
been waiting to see you.

Hmph.

Come on... I'll even
lead the way for you...

[SHIZURU]
I'm sorry!

I never intended to
make you suffer, really.

Shizuru!

[SHIZURU]
Natsuki...

222
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,958
Don't be angry with me.
I can't help it that I love you!

[NATSUKI growls]

224
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,958

I will make you mine.

00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,875
Even if it means having
you curse me forever.

[NATSUKI]
A Child...

231
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,541
The strange creature
that is created by

232
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,708
a person's love for another.

233
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,666
The Child's power comes from
the strength of that love!

234
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,375
[SHIZURU]
Do you hate me that much?

235
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,000
See all these columns?

236
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
When a HiME's
loved one vanishes,

237
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,958
the sealed pillar takes
the life and rises up.

238
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,875
And when the 12 HiME are
reduced to the last one...

239
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,000
...the Obsidian Palace
will reveal its true form.

like we have another one.

another battle's been settled.

Shizuru...

260
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,416
Since I was little, I wasn't
willing to trust anyone.

261
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,916
Then I came here, and you were
the first person to embrace me.

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
But... you were
looking for love,

263
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,666
and I wasn't able to feel
the way you wanted me to.

264

Still, Shizuru,

I am flattered that you
fell in love with me.

I really enjoyed your

Congratulations, Mai.

Or rather, the Obsidian Prince.

299
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,541
[REITO] The winning HiME
is sealed away in the crystal,

300
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,958
and becomes the core
of the Fuka no Miya,

301
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,625
serving as a gateway to guide
the power of the HiME Star.

302
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,166
That's how it's been...

303
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,458
...till now.
It's different this time.

304
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,083
[REITO] You will become
my wife, in every aspect.

305
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,791
And together, we will
create a new world.

306
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
Many myths of
the world's creation

307
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,291
start out with one
man and one woman.

308
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,916
Making the entire population
their own descendants.

309
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,458
But this world is
already far beyond help.

310
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sure you understand
just how irrational

311
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,833
and imperfect this world is.

312
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,458
That's why this must be.

313
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,375
You and I shall create
a brand new world,

314
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,791
populated by our own progeny.

315
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,875
Never!

316
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,041
[REITO]
But why?

317
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,916
Because. Everyone
has their own feelings.

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,958
Special feelings...
for only their loved ones.

319
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,916
[REITO]
Do you hate me?

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,083
That's fine.

321
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,833
Hate can be a stronger
emotion than love.

322
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,666
[MAI]
I don't hate you.

323
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,083
I pity you, that's all.

324
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,375
[REITO] Why are the handlers of
Kagutsuchi always like this?!

325
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,666
Then what will you do?

326
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,166
Are you going to call upon
Kagutsuchi to defeat me

327
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,166
in exchange for
saving the world?

328
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,333
[MAI gasps]

329
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,958
[REITO]
Yuichi Tate no longer exists,

330
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,041
and your brother
has been eliminated.

331
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,416
Do you really think you
can summon Kagutsuchi

332
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,833
given your state?

333
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,541
You have nothing left.

334
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,750
Nothing except for me.

335
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,291
I do so!

336
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,250
He's still here.

337
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,041
Yuichi's right here in my heart.

338
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,875
That's why...!

339
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,875
[gasps]

340
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,750
[gasps]
Mikoto!

341
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,333
[NAGI]
You've done pretty well.

342
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,375
But now the game is over.

343
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,125
[MIYU]
Hmm?

344
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
[ALYSSA]
Miyu.

345
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,833
Miss Alyssa?

346
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,916
[MIYU]
Confirming Alyssa Searrs.

347
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,708
Initiating anti-materializer.
Dress mode: Platinum.

348
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,041
Mission Start!

349
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,000
Ah! What?! [yells]

350
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,791
Miss Alyssa!

351
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,958
[MIYU]
All safeties disengaged.

352
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,958
Anti-materializer at full power.

353
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
Zero, two, six...

354
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,000
Exceeding power limit.

355
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,625
[MAI]
So many things have happened...

356
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,208
--[MIKOTO] We cried...
--[NATSUKI] ...we laughed...

357
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,708
--[MIKOTO] ...we fought...
--[MAI] ...and we fell in love.

358
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,000
[MAI, NATSUKI, MIKOTO]
Our shining days...
