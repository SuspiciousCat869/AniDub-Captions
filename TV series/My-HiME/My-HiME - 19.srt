[MIDORI growls]

4
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,250
Miss Sugiura,
I need your advice.

5
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,875
If one wants to, can a person
change their destiny?

6
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,208
Of course one can.

7
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,708
You really believe it.

8
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,958
Then I encourage you
to use your resources

9
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:14,416
and do whatever you can.
For the sake of the HiME.

10
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,125
[GIRL A] Sure are a lot of
earthquakes these days.

11
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,958
[BOY A]
They say Mt. Fuji's gonna erupt.

12
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,958
It's like the end of
the world or something.

13
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,791
[YUICHI]
See ya.

14
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,416
[GROUP]
Bye! See ya later!

15
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,375
[SAYURI]
Tate sure is devoted.

16
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,541
He's headed to the
hospital again, right?

17
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,708
Yeah, he's been going
pretty much every day.

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,500
Ah! Hold on, Tokiha!

19
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,958
[MAI]
Huh?

20
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,666
[TATSUHIKO] Dr. Mochizuki's
been asking about Takumi.

21
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,583
[gasps]
Oh, sorry.

22
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,416
Could you tell him that
I'll definitely send

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,916
Takumi over there tomorrow?

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,125
Guess I was wrong.

25
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,958
Tate and Shiho must be
together after all.

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,666
He used to act like
he didn't want anything

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,708
to do with her.

28
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,875
[SAYURI]
Yeah.

29
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,666
Shiho's always
stuck by his side though,

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,791
even when Tate was going
through that tough phase.

31
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,291
[MAI]
What tough phase?

32
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,041
[TATSUHIKO]
Didn't you know?

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,791
Tate was actually...

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,750
Hey, Captain...

35
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,458
Tate. I came to hear
your answer in person.

36
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:50,958
[MIKOTO growling]

37
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,625
[sighs]
Knock it off.

38
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,083
You've got that creepy look in
your eyes again, Mikoto.

39
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,416
[MIKOTO]
Mm? Mmm...

40
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,083
[MAI]
Hmph.

41
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,750
[TATSUHIKO] Tate used
to be an ace fighter

42
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,458
and assistant captain
of the Kendo Club

43
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,166
back when he was
still in junior high.

44
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,916
[SAYURI] But right before
the national tournament,

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,583
he injured his left knee
during practice.

46
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,333
It didn't take long to heal,
but in that short time,

47
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,458
he totally lost interest
in everything.

48
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,750
He became really
moody and reckless.

49
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,666
[YAYOI] Right. He was
kinda scary back then.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,916
[SAYURI] Yeah. Until
Student Council put him to work.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,833
[YAYOI] And even though everyone
else went out of their way

52
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,666
to avoid Tate,
Shiho stuck it out with him

53
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,208
and did her best
to cheer him up.

54
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,000
It's only natural
he's been looking after her

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,291
like he is, considering
all they've been through.

56
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,666
Tate...

57
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,666
"I'm rootin' for ya"?

58
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,666
It's stupid to say that.
And even stupider to believe it.

59
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,958
That's why. No wonder.

60
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
[MIKOTO]
Hmm? Did you say something, Mai?

61
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,750
Nope. Mm-mm. It was nothing.

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,041
[MASASHI]
Are you absolutely positive?

63
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,500
[YUICHI]
Think about it.

64
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,541
What if she doesn't get better?

65
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,083
She might never be able to run
again for the rest of her life.

66
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,041
And it's my fault.

67
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,083
That's why...

68
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,750
Ever since I hurt my knee,
I've had all kinds of doubts,

69
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,041
trying to figure out what
my purpose in life is.

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,375
But... for now...

71
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,625
...it's only right that
I stick by Shiho's side.

72
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,916
So you're doing this for her
because you're to blame.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,708
Well, that sounds nice
in theory, but hey--!

Is that what you really want?!

00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,375
Will you swear on this kendo
stick, the stick you staked

everything on
back in junior high,

78
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,583
that this is what you want?!

79
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
Yes.

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
[MASASHI]
Hmph.

00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
I'll take your nametag
down in the dojo.

[YUICHI]
I'm very sorry, Captain.

00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Oh, you're here.

84
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,458
I was wondering where
you'd gotten to.

[HARUKA] Do you have any idea
how many times I called you?

in case you hadn't noticed.

Ah! It's no big deal.

All right?

96
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,875
[MIKOTO]
You're going to see Takumi?

97
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,416
[MAI] Yeah, when it
comes right down to it,

he's got not guts.

00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,541
And that's where I come in--

100
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,458
[AKIRA] Takumi, why aren't
you going to the hospital?

101
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,541
[MAI]
Huh?

102
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,791
[TAKUMI]
My mom died a long time ago.

103
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,458
And ever since then...

104
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,291
...Mai's been there
to look after me.

105
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,625
I didn't think anything of it
when I was a little kid.

106
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,916
What's he saying?

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,583
It's different now.

108
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,625
I'm older and we live apart.

109
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,791
I've started to realize
something for the first time.

110
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,416
Her life's been so hard

111
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,791
and I've put so many
demands on her.

112
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,416
It's gonna cost a lot of money
to have an operation overseas.

113
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,708
We had to sell the house,

114
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,250
switch schools 'cause of
the scholarships we got.

115
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,000
Plus, my sister's gotta
work part-time every day.

116
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,500
And we still don't have
enough for the operation.

117
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,666
Besides, the success rate
for this type of surgery

118
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
isn't very high. If it failed...

119
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,166
...we'd still have
all our debts to pay.

120
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,250
Anyway, it's got me thinking.

121
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,208
I dunno if living is
worth all that trouble.

want that operation,

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,166
[MIKOTO]
Akira's gotta be a girl!

[gasps]

162
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,625
What a shocker, huh, Mai?

163
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,958
I totally had no idea
that Akira was a girl!

164
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,916
How about you?
Had you figured it out?

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,083
That he was a she?

166
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,125
And she was a HiME?

--Shut up!
--And she and Takumi--

168
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Huh?

[MAI whimpers]

--[MAI] Don't.

[MAI sighs] Please.
Leave me alone for a while.

173
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,125
Okay...

174
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,208
[YUKINO groans]

175
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,625
The greatest obstacle...

176
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,833
Now I know how
I'm going to attack.

177
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's call it quits
for the day, shall we?

178
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,833
Something's suddenly come up.

179
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,166
[YUKARIKO sighs]
All right.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,041
[SHIZURU]
Huh?

181
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,791
[SHIZURU]
Hmm...

[NATSUKI groans]

00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,333
Huh...?

185
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,208
It seems like like you
were having a nice nap.

186
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,166
Ah... I must've just, uh--
Sorry...

187
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,958
[SHIZURU]
There's drool on your mouth.

188
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,708
[SHIZURU]
Just kidding.

189
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,958
Shizuru!

190
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,541
It's probably
none of my business,

191
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,916
but it seems like you've
been working hard lately.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,333
You must be exhausted.

193
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,041
A little... I guess.

194
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,166
[SHIHO] Is there anything
I can do to help?

195
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,500
Asides from letting
you use that?

196
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,333
Thanks, but no.
I'd better get going.

197
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,125
Sorry to interfere
with your work.

198
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,583
Natsuki.

199
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,416
I want you to know that I'm
always thinking about you.

200
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,625
I hope you never forget that,
no matter what.

201
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,583
I appreciate that, Shizuru.

202
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,041
But please...

203
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,500
...I don't want you to get
too close to me, understand?

204
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,625
Later.

205
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,166
[BOTH gasp]

206
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,416
Hi! Kuga!
Uh... Nice timing!

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,166
--Uh, I mean--
--Hey, you, too, stupid!

208
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,291
What?

209
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,916
[REITO]
What's the matter, Mikoto?

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,916
Huh?

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,833
Reito...

212
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,916
Uh... Mai was really mad.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,208
I've never seen her like that.

214
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,625
Hey. What do you
think I should do now?

215
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,166
Well, I don't know the
details or anything,

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,250
but I see that Mai must be
very important to you.

217
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,000
If you sincerely want
to offer your help,

218
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,333
you'll just have to do whatever
you can to support her.

219
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,125
Oh, yeah? Do what I can?

220
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,375
Yes. Then she'll definitely
know that you care about her.

221
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,250
--I'm positive.
--[gasps]

All right! I'll do it!

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,583
Good luck now.

00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,333

like an older brother!

Huh...?

Takumi, at the very least,

229
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,208
you should talk to
your sister about it.

230
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,791
[TAKUMI]
Mm-hmm.

[AKIRA]
If I know her... [gasps]

Hey! That's personal!

Sorry--

234
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,083
So... Did you see anything?

Sis always stays positive.
Smiling and stuff.

242
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,541
Sure, it makes me happy
and everything.

243
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,375
It weighs on me, though.

244

C'mon, though... I had to...

245
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,750
The only thing I could do
was be positive...

246
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,750
And smile...

247
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,791

Was I wrong to do that?

248
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,416
Is that why...

[MIKOTO]
Hmm? Whaddaya mean...?

I told you over and over
not to fight,

but you didn't listen.
Don't you understand?

Then how could you turn
around and do something

like that to Yukino?
Didn't you say that about her?

you liked her, too?

looking after someone you love.

00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,666
Huh...?

324
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,083
What is it, Sis...?

325
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,750
Oh! It's nothing...
I can deal with it.

326
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,416
It's not anything you have
to worry about, okay?

327
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,333
Got that?

328
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,083
Listen, Mai. It's okay now.

329
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,416
[gasps]

330
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,333
You've sacrificed so much
for me all these years.

331
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,083
And forced yourself to smile
when you wanted to cry.

332
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,291
So, please-- Don't lie
to yourself anymore, okay?

333
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,625
I-I'm not.

334
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,916
I've been wondering, Sis.
What are your dreams?

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,208
What do you want outta life,
most of all?

336
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,208
What do I want?

337
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,125
[TAKUMI]
Mm-hmm. Being sick...

338
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,958
...I didn't know if
I wanted to go on.

339
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,666
But now I'm sure
that I wanna live.

340
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,000
So I'll have the operation.

341
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,375
I'll go to the States.

342
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,000
And I'll go by myself.

343
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,125
[BOTH gasp]

344
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,250
Go alone?

345
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,708
Don't say it.

346
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,833
It's not like I can't
walk or anything.

347
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,583
I wanna do this on my own.

348
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:45,041
I want you to live for yourself.
Don't live for me, Sis.

349
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,500
You've got your
own life to live.

350
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,625
I guess I should
feel glad about it.

351
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,541
Takumi's finally going
for his operation...

352
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,458
[TAKUMI]
Don't live for me, Sis.

353
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,666
You've got your
own life to live.

354
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,833
Yeah, sure. My life.

355
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,208
It's just... I dunno...

356
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,041
...what that is.

357
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,041
Mai Tokiha:
works part-time after school,

358
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,666
likes to cook for people,
and is Takumi's big sister.

359
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,625
[sobs]
That's it...

360
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,208
That's all I am...

361
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,916
[TAKUMI] What do you
want outta life, most of all?

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,375
[MAI sobs]
I don't know...

363
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,958
I have no idea
what I want outta life...

364
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,083
[SHIHO]
It sure is nice to be outside.

365
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,625
I had a great time!

366
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,583
What? All you did was have a
sundae at a family restaurant.

367
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,041
You sure are easy to please.

368
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,791
Everything's
delicious as long as

369
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,250
I'm with you, Brother.

370
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,750
Yes, of course...

371
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,083
It's a pleasure to be of
service to you, Princess.

372
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,333
[SHIHO giggles]
I'm much obliged.

373
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,166
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

374
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,583

[MAI sighs]

377
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,791
Huh...?

378
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,333
[YUICHI]
Hmm? Hello?

379
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,291
Hey. Question for you.

380
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,958
Huh? What is it?

381
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,333
[SHIHO] Are you being nice to me
because you feel guilty

382
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,333
about me getting hurt?
Is that what this is all about?

383
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,458
[gasps]

384
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
No way.

385
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
[SHIHO]
Really? Then kiss me.

386
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,375
[gasps]

387
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,083
Kiss me!

388
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,583
Shiho?

389
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,500
I don't want you to
be all nice to me

390
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,125
if you're just faking it.

391
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,458
I wanna know how
you really feel.

392
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,708
[YUICHI sighs]

393
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,958
Love only me and nobody else.

394
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,541
[MAI groans]

395
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,250

I'm so happy...

[gasps]

399
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
What's the matter, Brother?

400
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,416
Forget it. It's... It's nothing.

401
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,541
Oh...

402
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,708
[MAI panting]

403
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,875
[TAKUMI] What do you
want outta life, most of all?

404
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,166
That can't be it...

405
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,541
I must be wrong...

406
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,250
It can't be... No way...

407
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,541
Because...

408
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,000
...it's too cruel...

409
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,833
Now, of all times...

410
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,125
[MAI]
Gone.

411
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,125
Everything's gone...

412
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,666
[TAKUMI]
You weigh on me, Sis.

413
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,250
[MAI]
What?! Have I gained weight?!

414
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,333
[TAKUMI] What do you want,
more than anything?

415
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,041
[MAI]
I'll take cash!

416
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,500
[NATSUKI]
I understand how you feel,

417
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,166
but that I didn't need to hear.

418
