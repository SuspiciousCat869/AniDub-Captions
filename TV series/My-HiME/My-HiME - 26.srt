Uh, heh... pull some strings...?

332
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,208
I'm afraid I can't.

333
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,291
I guess that throws a wrench
in your little journey

334
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,333
over the holidays, doesn't it?

335
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,958
No! Wait! You can't!

336
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,083
[SHIZURU] Repeating a year?
Oh, that doesn't sound too bad.

337
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,416
Shi... zuru...

338
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,250
Maybe I'll do the same.

339
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,375
Graduation can wait.

340
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,250
Uh... Hey, Mai?

341
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,000
Uh! What?

342
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,916
Uh... Well...

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,541
I was thinking...

344
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,750
We've never really...

345
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,583
--...you know...
--[MAI whimpers]

346
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,916
Anyway...

347
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,875
[MAI squeals]

348
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,041
[YUICHI grunts]
Why'd ya--!

349
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,041
Over there.

350
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,166
[YUICHI]
Huh?

351
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,166
[SHIHO]
Brother...!

352
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,625
[YUICHI grunts]

353
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,166
You can't go ahead
without my approval!

354
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,958
That's right.

355
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,916
You know, you've got to give the
competition a fair chance, Tate.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,458
Reito!

357
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,791
[MIKOTO] Forget it! You and
Yuichi better back off, Brother!

358
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,541
Because Mai belongs to me!

359
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,708
[MAI squeals]

360
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,833
Hey, would you stop
being so reckless?!

361
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,875
You just got five stitches!

362
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,041
It's hardly even
a flesh wound!

363
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,458
Look, Mai! What do you think?!

364
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,916
Jeez...

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,125
Hey...

366
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,875
Was that a bra I just
spotted under there?

367
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,916
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm! Natsuki gave me one!

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Uh, not that she's anywhere
near actually needing one.

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,958
Natsuki...

370
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,083
[MIKOTO]
What're you talking about?!

371
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll be bigger than
Mai, pretty soon!

372
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,125
Stop flashing people!

373
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,208
Huh? What's that?

374
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,291
[TAKUMI] The surgery went well,
and I'm recovering just fine.

375
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,333
Looks like I'll be able to
make it back for next term.

376
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,583
[AKIRA]
That's what he thinks, anyway.

377
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,208
The doctor says that
he wants to monitor him

378
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,208
for a little while longer.

379
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,250
But there's nothing
to worry about.

380
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,500
I'll be taking good care of him.

381
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,875
Sounds like he's well.
That's great.

382
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,250
[
Yeah.

383
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,375
[YOKO]
Oh, I got this from Midori.

384
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,500
[MIKOTO gasps]

385
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,500
Here we go, Sugiura!
We'll protect the Balagan Ruins!

386
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,541
All right, Prof!

387
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,125
--[TERRORISTS scream]
--[MIDORI] Comin' through!

388
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,708
Sounds like our Midori.

389
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,291
Is that prof of hers
an idiot as well?

390
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,833
She sure seems to be
having a good time, though.

391
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,625
--Yup!
--Huh?

392
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,708
[TAKUMI] P.S. It all seems
like a dream to me right now,

393
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,666
but I think all the things
that happened back home

394
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,625
made me stronger,
so I could be ready for this.

395
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,625
Thanks, Sis; it all
worked out for the best.

396
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,291
[MAI]
I think so too, Takumi.

397
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,458
[AOI groans] I'm glad
spring break starts tomorrow.

398
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,833
Here's an idea.

399
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,375
What do you say to going
on a date with me, Mai?

400
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,208
[YUICHI gasps]

401
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,125
No chance! Mine!

402
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,166
[MAI chuckles weakly]

403
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,791
Why do I have to
have club practice?!

404
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,875
You can't let your pal
Takeda down, now.

405
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,875
You're sure popular, Mai!

406
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,416
Yeah... I guess...

407
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh? That's a change!
She actually admitted it!

408
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,791
Well... it's a good thing
to be liked by people!

409
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,083
Right, Natsuki?

410
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,166
Mikoto?

411
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm!

412
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,583
[NATSUKI chuckles]

413
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,000
[CHIE] Hmph! Now we've got
her blushing big time!

414
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,000
Check it out!

415
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,250
So, Mai! What've
you decided to do?

416
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,833
Give us the details!

417
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,000
[MAI]
Hmmm...

418
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,250
Okay, I know!

419
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,166
[BOTH gasp]

420
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,125
The thing I love
to do most...

421
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,041
What I wanna do most...!

[NAGI] Just because the
HiME Star has disappeared

427
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,833
doesn't mean that the world
is free of disasters.

428
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:03,250
In fact, the future is even less
clear now than it's ever been.

429
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,291
It was the girls that
made the final decision.

430
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,375
I'm sure they can handle it.

431
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:09,208
[FUMI]
Mm-hmm.

432
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,750
What's the deal?

433
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,375
Since the war, girls and socks
have gotten so much tougher.

434
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,625
Right?

435
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,708
[MASHIRO sighs]
It's time to return.

436
