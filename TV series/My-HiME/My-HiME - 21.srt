1
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,583
You won't be able
to hide this any longer.

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,208
Look at all the destruction...

3
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,208
It doesn't matter, really.

4
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,125
There's no need to
conceal this any more.

5
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,000
Although, we will keep it
from getting out to the media.

6
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,458
It'll be 300 years till
this happens again.

7
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,833
By then, this event will be
remembered as nothing more

8
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,208
than a legend or fairy tale.

9
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,666
So this is going to
keep on repeating itself?

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,500
--[SMITH] I would think so.
--[BOTH gasp]

11
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,541
There's a certain
government agency

12
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,583
which does not officially exist,
known as District 1,

13
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,291
that has been controlling
the HiME festivals,

14
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,500
as well as supporting this
country from behind the scenes.

15
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,666
Hey, aren't you--?

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,625
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Mr. Sakomizu?

17
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:23,208
And a pleasure to meet you,
Princess Natsuki.

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,458
[growls softly]

19
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,166
I'm in charge of the
Searrs Foundation

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,291
Publicity Department, Number 4,
and the name is John Smith.

[SAKOMIZU gasps]

22
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,250
Oh, please. There's
no need to be rash.

23
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,083
Seeing as our chairman
has passed away,

24
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,875
we've decided that we
would not interfere

25
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,125
with the HiME
Festival this time.

26
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,041
My job is simply to
clear up the mess

27
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,791
that our former chairman
left behind; nothing more.

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,291
Then you're the one.

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,000
The person who wanted to trade
some information with me.

30
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,083
[gasps]

31
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,208
That's right.

32
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,416
Then why don't I
just cut to the chase?

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,875
The remains of Miyu Greer.

34
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,208
Would you know where
I might... find them?

35
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,458
Huh?

36
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,458
You see, it's a bit of
a conundrum, I'm afraid.

37
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,083
It seems as though we lost
her retrieval signal.

38
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,666
Therefore, I thought I'd ask
someone who had had

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,625
the opportunity to fight her.

40
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,083
[NATSUKI] And what information
do you have to offer?

41
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,958
Let's me see...

42
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,708
How about the truth behind
the circumstances that led

43
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,958
to the death of
Dr. Kuga, your mother?

44
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,750
--[SAKOMIZU gasps]
--What did you say?!

45
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,958
[NATSUKI]
Mother!

46
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,625
[SAKOMIZU]
Ah! Don't listen to him!

47
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,875
This man is--

48
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,000
[SMITH] I suggest you
keep your mouth shut,

49
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,958
you District 1 lackey.

50
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,500
This deal is strictly
between her and me.

51
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,625
[NATSUKI sighs]

52
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,416
[NATSUKI]
I don't know first-hand.

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
Except...

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,166
You mustn't tell him!

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,958
[NATSUKI] There was some talk
that flowers of ice had bloomed

56
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,041
by the lake over the back hills
immediately after the fight.

57
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,791
It's possible that...

58
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,416
[SMITH] That's where
her signal was lost.

59
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,875
Trust me, we've already searched
that area very thoroughly.

60
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,125
[sighs]

61
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,583
[SMITH] It sounds like you
really don't know.

62
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,958
Oh, well.

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,000
At least you seemed to have
answered me honestly,

64
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,583
so I'll reciprocate
in good faith.

65
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,541
After all, as I understand it,
you could have become a part

66
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,833
of our organization.

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,666
What?!

68
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,208
Smith! Stop!

69
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,250
Dr. Kuga was trying to sell you
to us as a research subject,

70
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,958
and when that was uncovered,
she was dealt with.

71
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,500
[gasps]

72
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,500
It really was unfortunate.

73
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,208
We'd already paid her
up front, and then that.

74
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,458
[YAMADA] That number turned
out to be a bank account.

75
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,083
So I traced the money
to its final recipients,

76
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,500
and found that they ended up
at two organizations.

77
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,625
One's Iwasaka Pharmaceuticals.

78
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,958
The other one is
the Searrs Foundation.

79
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,458
It's a lie...

80
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,166

81

[grunts]

82
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,000
[REITO]
I've put a little brandy in it.

83
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,500
It'll warm you up
and help you relax.

84
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,125
This house belongs
to my parents, actually.

85
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,750
But since I'm the only one
in the family who's around,

86
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,958
I decided that it
just makes more sense

87
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,708
for me to live in the dorm.

88
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,541
[REITO]
I come home on the weekends.

89
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,125
Or at times when
I want to be alone.

90
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:06,250
If you need me to,
I'll stay right here beside you.

91
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,583
All right?

92
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,791
[MAI]
Will you hear me out?

93
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,791
I wanna tell you everything
that's happened up until now.

94
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,833
This is ridiculous!
Where is that bumbling girl?!

95

How could she just
abandon all her duties

at a time like this?!

as fun as it should be.

I don't get it.
Why aren't you fighting back?

Don't be ignoring me.

111
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,916
The problem with
making you suffer

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
while you're droopy
and lifeless...

113
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,833
...is that it doesn't
make me feel any better.

114
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,541

as much as ever.

Huh...?

do anything to harm Natsuki.

Miss Yuuki. Isn't that right?

Jeez. The Student Council
President knows my name.

123
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,541
I must've gotten pretty famous.

124
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,541
Oh, dear. You poor little thing.

125
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,958
Huh?

126
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,375
[SHIZURU] Perhaps you're just
too aware of everything.

127
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,583
If you were somewhat
more dim-witted,

128
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,125
you probably wouldn't
have suffered so much.

129
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm guessin' you were
probably goverened

by strict rules as a child,

131
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,458
so it's no surprise you
sought the approval

of everyone around you.

Am I correct?

Heh. So that's what
you've wanted to tell me.

What, now all of a sudden,
you've turned into some

00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,291
kind of counselor?

You don't seem to understand
the situation here.

Anyway, that's how it is.

[SHIZURU]
I'd have to agree.

Whatever past
you might have had

to do with me.

I'm only interested
in one thing.

144

And that's saving Natsuki.

I will never allow
anyone to hurt her

and get away with it.
Whatever the reason.

Hilarious. The rumors are true.

around here is in need

of some counseling,
I'd pick you.

[sobs]

161
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:55,083
It seems so unfair
that Takumi's health was so bad,

162
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,625
and that you're one of the HiME.

163
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,083
Plus, the outcome.

164
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,125
Listen, though.

165
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,750
If everything you've
told me is correct

166
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,125
it may be too soon
to give up hope.

167
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,166
If the HiME who wins
all the battles

168
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,166
can attain
incredible power

169
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,833
like you say...

170
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,708
Well, then there
may still be a chance.

171
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,625
Besides, you've already
realized it by now, I'm sure.

172
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
The feelings
that you have inside.

173
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,041
For that person who's more
precious to you than anyone.

174
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,083
[REITO] In a world where nothing
goes the way you want,

175
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,250
there might be just one thing
that you can count on.

176
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:40,375
It's love. Your love for
another. For those feelings,

177
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,958
and for that special
person you desire...

178
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,125
You might even be willing
to become a demon.

179
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,333
[REITO] You might even be
allowed to become a demon.

180
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,708
Reito, I don't...

181
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,291
[REITO]
I've got to go now.

182
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,958
I'm worried about what's
going on at school.

183
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,208
You should stay here
and get some rest.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,166
[REITO]
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,958
I hope you'll forgive me
for saying those things

186
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,750
without any consideration
for your feelings.

187

[MAI]
Um...

188
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,958
Thank you, Reito...

189
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,458
For everything...

190
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,583
Heh.

191
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,250
There's hope...

192
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:48,875
[NAGI] What a gentleman.
You had a good chance, too.

193
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,583
Even if I could have her body,

194
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,458
her heart would still
belong to someone else.

195
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
Let's carry on as planned.

196
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,000
[NAGI]
Hmm.

197
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,625
I'm at your command, Master.

198
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,833
Where am I...?

199
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,083
You're safe here.

00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,166
This place belongs to
one of my tea students.

201
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,458
Just relax.

202
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,583
No one knows about this place.

203
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,208
You and I are
the only people here.

204
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,625
I certainly held myself
back for a long time.

205
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,208
I was fairly sure that
if you knew I was a HiME,

206
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,333
you would constantly
be worryin' about me.

207
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,625
I know that you had your
suspicions and all,

208
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,375
and I'm glad that you kept it
to yourself for so long.

209
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,791
But this time...

210
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,041
...I wasn't able
to keep it from you.

211
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,458
I'll do anything,
abandon everything,

You haven't seen
the last of me yet...

I really do like you, Natsuki.

I'll do whatever it takes

Me, too.

I like you, too, Shizuru.

224

Perhaps... But the meaning of
your "like" and my "like"

225
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,583
is quite different.

The school's closed?

told us before we came.

a fire did this?

saw what looked like a dragon.

There was that incident
the other day, too.

This place could be dangerous.

The only positive

was her dedication to her work.

00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,125
It seems that they've
been planning it all along.

319
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,833
To defeat you, I mean.

320
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,083
Thing is...

321
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,541
...they never really
knew who you were.

322
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,500
I hope you're grateful
for all that I've done.

323
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,625
Heh.

324
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,291
It looks like they've arrived.

325
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,583
I'm surprised that you
decided to seek me out.

326
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,541
Have you been dissatisfied with
your throne, Queen of Hades?

327
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,916
So you were the vessel
for the Obsidian Prince...

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,666
...Reito Kanzaki.

329
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,500
All of my memories have
come back to me now.

330
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,041
I must say, you've been working
hard the past 300 years,

331
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,916
Mashiro. Or rather...

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,250
...Crystal HiME.

333
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,083
[REITO chuckles]

334
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,041
[MASHIRO]
I will defeat you

335
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:19,041
in order to break the curse
that haunts the HiME.

336
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,208
[REITO] So you put your
soul into a Child,

337
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,666
and decided to live as a doll?

338
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,416
You were so determined
to defeat me

339
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
that you went that far?

340
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,375
Yes. Because, in the past,
you were the one I loved.

341
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,958
You, my brother.

342
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,083
[REITO]
Hmph.

343
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,166
Now, Fumi!

344
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,041
[FUMI grunts]

345
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,625
[MIKOTO grunts]

346
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,000
[gasps]

347
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,333
Anybody who dares to
try and defeat my brother

348
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,291
will have to go
through me first!

349
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,333
You've done it again! Stop this!

350
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,916
Even if I crush you,
the only thing that will happen

351
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,250
is that your power as a Child
will be wasted.

352
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,875
Now, Mikoto...

353
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,083
...my adorable little sister.

354
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,000
The time has come for
you to fight for me.

355
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,250
Yes. Of course, Brother.

356
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,166
[MIKOTO growls]

357
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,250
Mikoto...

358
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,083
Unfortunately...
there's no choice...

359
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,041
Miss Mashiro?!

360
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,375
[MIKOTO growls]

361
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,666
[MIKOTO]
Uh?

362
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,125
Miroku!

363
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,916
Headmaster... Ah...

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,041
Fumi...

365
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,875
[REITO] Thank you all,
for the work you have done

366
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,250
while I was away
these past 300 years.

367
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
The moment of destiny is near.

368
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,541
From now on,
all matters will be...

369
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,083
...under my authority.

370
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,875
[MASHIRO] That certainly
caught me off guard,

371
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,291
finding out that Reito is
the Obsidian Prince.

372
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,041
[NAGI] Really? Didn't he seem
suspicious from the start?

373
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,666
[FUMI] Why would he?
He awakened just recently.

374
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,000
[NAGI]
Oh, right.

375
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,833
Then I guess he's just
the shady type by nature.

376
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,208
[REITO]
Well, excuse me.
