Haven't you even stopped

Take my advice
and watch your back.

You might wind up getting
back-stabbed by someone

She's right...

That's what I've done...

[MIDORI] Don't beat
yourself up over it--

182
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,166
You had no idea
that would happen.

183
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,458
Besides, it seems as
though Alyssa wasn't

184
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,416
a typical HiME anyway.

You did what you
had to that day,

186

and I'm glad you stood up
to the challenge.

187
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,791
Otherwise, the rest of us
wouldn't even be here.

[SAKOMIZU]
We know that you despise us,

190
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,875
but we'd like you to
set aside any thoughts of

191
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,375
personal revenge and concentrate
on winning this battle.

Are you saying there's
no way to avoid it?

193
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,750
[SAKOMIZU]
Yes.

194
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,541
Besides needing to
do it for the greater good

195
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,583
of the world, this just
happens to be your destiny.

196
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,416
So I'm supposed to
sacrifice myself, huh?

197
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,458
Well, do you expect me to
be satisfied with that?

198
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,916
[SAKOMIZU]
Hmm. Hardly.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,416
Okay, good.

200
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,291
Then that's the way it'll be.

201
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,208
Well, there's definitely
no disputing

202

she's the daughter
of Doctor Kuga.

203
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,958
[ISHIGAMI]
Now that's disappointing.

204
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm fairly certain
it's against the rules

205
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,791
to leak information to a HiME.

206
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,541
If the people higher up
found out about

207
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,583
some of the things
you've done, you'd be in

208
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,750
much more trouble
than I would.

209
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,791
What're you talking about?

210
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,666
If you don't know
what I'm referring to,

211
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,833
then I suppose there's nothing
to be concerned about.

212
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,791
I suppose there isn't. Well...

213
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,416
Have you been getting
enough sleep? You look awful.

214
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,916
Never mind that.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,125
Just give me some vitamins and
something for my headache.

216
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,583
All right, but the best
thing you could do

217
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,625
is get some sleep.

218
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,625
Is that a love letter or
something from Professor Sasaki?

219
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,125
Not quite.

220
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,541
It's actually an issue of a
journal that's been put out

221
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,291
by some local historians.

222
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,333
Ah... And I need to go
through it all today.

223
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,833
For your thesis, huh?

224
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,375
You sure you wanna
go back to university?

225
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,541
[MIDORI] Huh. Ah, right.
Going back to university

226
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,333
was my goal in the first place.
I completely forgot.

227

If you want my
personal opinion,

228
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,541
I think teaching's
a perfect fit for you.

229
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,916
Yeah. You know, you may be
right. But that's exactly why

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,666
I don't have time for sleep.

231

Don't you want any water?

No, these're pretty tasty.

it when I first heard

236
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,333
about all this from Nagi.

237
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,166
There's no point in
regretting something

238
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,541
that's already happened.

239
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,833
And besides...
you had no choice.

240
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,333
Anyway, my concern right now
is about that HiME

241
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,416

this before, but...

get back at them?

do you think I am?

Of course! Don't be stupid.

a whole year off of school...

in an accident.

of District 1.

She was one of the
researchers. Thing is...

...when I think about it now,

254
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,458
she must've known about
the destiny of a HiME.

In order to let me escape,
she betrayed the organization.

All of a sudden,

to live a normal
and ordinary life.

You see, the rest of you all
seem to be afraid to fight,

262
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,083
because you don't wanna lose
the people that mean

263
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,083
the most to you.
But I don't have anyone.

That means there's
nothing for me to fear.

If District 1 wants us
to fight each other,

then I'll do whatever
I can to ruin their plans.

I don't know exactly

explained it,

Seems my instincts were right.

I never liked you

You're pathetic.

What about the Obsidian Prince?

Has he awakened,
or are we still waiting?

Good question.

327
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,125
Not that there's a need
for you to know if he is.

328
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,291
Or who he is.

329
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,750

look all of a sudden?

from your past, maybe?

[AKIRA]
Has it started already?

378
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,416
[MIDORI] In that issue, there's
a story about an accident

379
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,125
that happened on the way
to an archeological dig.

380
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
The name of the girl
who died in it

381
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,541
was Mashiro Kazahana.

382
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,458
I thought that we'd
eliminated all traces of it

383
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,250
from the public records.

384
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,458
I suppose we didn't do as
thorough a job as I remember.

385
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,083
[MIDORI]
That's hardly the issue here!

386
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
What I wanna know
is who you are,

387
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,083
what your purpose here is,
and how we might be able

388
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,208
to put a stop to this sick
and twisted "festival"!

389
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,500
I'll tell you one thing.

390
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,958
This festival must go on,
and I'm not going to

391
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,291
try and stop it...
Teacher Sugiura.

392
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,708
Teacher, she says.

393
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,250
Huh.

394
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,500
I used to think teaching was...
just a way to pass the time

395
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,375
until I finished up my thesis.

396
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,583
But I didn't count on
some students getting attached

397
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,208
to a half-baked
teacher like myself.

398
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,416
And so I thought,
maybe I'd get more serious

399
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,458
about the profession.

400
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,250
That's why I'll protect them.
No matter what the cost!

401
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,291
[MIDORI] I don't have any
more time to waste here.

402
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,166
I'm gonna get the truth,
even if I have to

403
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,833
force it out of you!

404
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,500
I understand.

405
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,666
And you know my position.

406
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,791
So then, we must duel.

407
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,208
Forgive me, Miss Sugiura.

408
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,541
I should've known.

you and made you lie!
