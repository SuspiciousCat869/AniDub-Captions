1
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,541
[CONTROLLER A]
Typhon One is approaching

2
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,875
along its predicted trajectory.

3
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,041
Recalculating mass
using topospatial radar.

4
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,750
[CONTROLLER B] Current error
divergence is plus 0.03.

5
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,666
Now updating all data links.

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,708
No change in planned
mission order.

7
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,500
Where is the attack team?

8
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,333
[CONTROLLER C] They've just
passed Space-One velocity.

9
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,333
They'll be arriving at the
attack point any second now.

10
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,250
It's about time
we finished this!

11
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,708
I'm gonna crush that hemorrhoid
into itty-bitty pieces!

12
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,041
It's an asteroid--

13
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,958
[SARA] It's called an asteroid,
Big Sister Haruka.

14
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,458
You're supposed to be
the mission leader.

15
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,458
Could you at least
try to act like it?

16
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,708
[HARUKA]
Hmph.

17
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,833
[MASHIRO]
Arika...

18
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,708
This is quite an
emotional moment.

19
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,375
I never thought I'd
live to see the day

20
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,291
when all nations would be
working hand in hand

21
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,708
towards a common cause.

22
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,791
It wouldn't be possible

23
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,375
if it weren't for you,
Headmistress.

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,916
After all, you were the one that
gave us Garderobe's technology.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,083
[NATSUKI]
Not really.

26
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,958
It was a matter
of a good timing.

27
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,208
Right after this Karakawa
Observatory opened,

28
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,041
it was able to detect
the incoming asteroid.

29
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,291
If it crashes into the ground,

30
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,416
it won't only be Aries
that's destroyed.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,666
It would demolish at least six
of the surrounding nations.

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,833
Hey, Mai!

33
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
Is it okay if I have
one of these snacks?

34
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,083
No, they're offerings.
You can't eat them yet.

35
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,791
[CONTROLLER A]
Ten seconds to firing point

36
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,041
for the Meteor Breakers.

37
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,791
Jettison the Force Wings.

38
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,875
Hereby commencing
Meteor Breaker Ignition.

39
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,333
Those rocks!

40
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,750
Don't worry, they'll burn
up in the atmosphere.

41
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,875
Got it!

42
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:44,333
[CONTROLLER A] Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one, fire!

43
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,958
[yells]

44
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,416
[CONTROLLER B] Abnormal vector
change detected for Typhon One!

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,666
It's fallen out of orbit!

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,916
[CHIE] Adjust the path
of the Meteor Breakers!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,208
[CONTROLLER B] It's too
late! They're gonna hit!

48
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,625
[CONTROLLER A]
The alignment has shifted!

49
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,250
A large piece remains!

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,833
It's accelerating as a
result of the explosion!

51
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,083
It's entered the atmosphere!

52
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,125
Its current course?

53
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,791
The projected point
of impact is...

54
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,083
...Windbloom!

55
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,583
We're going after it!

56
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,250
[SARA]
It's no good, Big Sister Haruka!

57
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,666
Send up the second attack group.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,875
[HARUKA]
An attack grope?!

59
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
[YUKINO]
She said, "group," Haruka.

60
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,291
[HARUKA]
Arika?!

61
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,208
I'm gonna try to stop it!

62
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,125
Mashiro, the contract!

63
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,208
Right!

64
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,500
Blue Sky!

65
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,666
[CONTROLLER A] Meister Arika's
reached her ultimate form

66
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,000
with Materialize Zwei!

67
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,666
She's chasing after the debris!

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,333
[CHIE]
She's fast.

69
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,500
What's this, "Materialize Zwei"?

70
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,250
It's a special ability
unique to Meister Arika.

71
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,500
We're still investigating
its characteristics.

72
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,916
It's like the late
Blue Sky Sapphire.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,833
Does that mean Arika
can use the same powers

74
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,250
that were possessed
by her mother?

75
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
Yes, but more than that.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,458
It's more accurate to say
that this is the true form

77
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,666
of the Blue Sky Sapphire itself.

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,875
[ARIKA]
I have to protect everyone!

79
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,000
She's passed it!

80
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
Come on, Arika!

81
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,541
Akatsuki!

82
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,791
[yells]

83
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,875
The Blue Sky Sapphire...

84
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,583
She collided head on
with Typhon One.

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,916
[ARIKA]
This is Arika Yumemiya!

86
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,666
[ARIKA]
Repeat, this is Arika Yumemiya.

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,541
The asteroid has been
totally eliminated.

88
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,250
Well then, the
mission's complete.

89
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,875
Arika...

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,708
Uh! Did you see me,
Mashiro? I did it!

91
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,000
I protected the
world for everyone!

92
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,291
[gasping]

93
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,041
[ARIKA grunting]

94
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,583
Ow, that hurt...

95
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,166
[meow]

96
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,333
[ARIKA]
Hm?

97
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,458
Huh? What the--?

98
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,875
Was... Was that a dream?

99
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,000
[MARIA]
Really,

100
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,458
what sort of dream
were you having

101
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,375
that made you end up like this?

102
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,500
[ARIKA]
Huh?

103
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,125
Miss Maria?

104
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,666
What? Miss Maria, was
that all just a dream?

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,583
I thought there was an asteroid,
and I made it go boom!

106
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,166
No, you weren't dreaming.

107
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,458
As you can see, you really are
the saviour of this planet.

108
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,791
[ARIKA]
Huh?

109
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,416
Oh, thank goodness.
It wasn't a dream then.

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,208
Yes, you may be a Meister,

111
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,250
but unfortunately you lack
the required number of credits.

112
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,041
That means you are still a
student under my supervision.

113
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,583
So, Arika Yumemiya,

114
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,958
first, run 50 laps
around the palace.

115
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,958
When you finish I want
you to open your copy

116
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,625
of <i>What It Means</i>
<i>to be an Otome</i> ,

117
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,791
and transcribe
chapters 12 through 15.

118
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, Miss Maria!

119
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,666
Uh! Aww...

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,458
[MARIA]
Dismissed!

121
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,916
[ARIKA]
Uh, right!

122
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,875
[ARIKA]
Uhh...

123
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,750
Hello, Meister Arika.
Is there some sort of problem?

124
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,416
Oops, sorry! Uh, I mean...

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,250
Please excuse me.

126
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,000
Honestly...

127
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,291
Now, what's the next item?

128
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,833
[SAKOMIZU]
Huh?

129
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,166
Oh, yes. Moving on, the next
topic on the agenda is "SOLT",

130
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,958
the Strategic Otome
Limitation Talks

131
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,875
to be held next month
in the nation of Artai.

132
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,916
Right. Mikoto! Let's get going!

133
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,583
[ARIKA]
"Dear Nina,

134
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,083
I don't know where you might be,

135
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,958
but I hope this letter
reaches you!

136
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,750
I wrote it from my heart,
like I always do.

137
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,875
It's already been a whole year.

138
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,958
The city has calmed down,

139
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,666
and everybody is
doing really well

140
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,625
in their day-to-day lives now.

141
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,083
Mashiro's been
working so hard lately!

142
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
She's becoming more
and more like a queen.

143
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,333
I don't know much about
that kind of stuff,

144
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,833
so I can't really
help her with it,

145
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,750
but I'm studying hard
and doing my best

146
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,833
so I can become a great Otome!

147
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,458
If you ever feel like it, Nina,

148
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,000
please come and
visit us someday.

149
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,208
I'm sure that by then,
this country will be a place

150
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,250
where people can smile
from their hearts!

151
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,250
I can't wait to
show it to you..."

152
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,416
[ARIKA]
Huh?

153
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,958
[WORKERS shouting]

154
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,125
[SERGEANT A] Everyone,
please disperse quietly.

155
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,041
You're forbidden from protesting
outside the palace gates.

156
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,250
Don't give us that!

157
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,208
We're just exercising
our workers' rights!

158
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,958
[WORKER B]
Let us in to see the queen!

159
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,791
[WORKERS shouting]

160
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,666
Come on... Get going.

161
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,541
[GAL] Your inventions still need
that extra push, don't they?

162
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,875
Professor, I'm wondering,

163
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,833
is this really the
extent of all the damage?

164
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,166
[GAL]
What?

165
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
This crater that was made
by the falling meteor--

166
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,250
[GAL]
It's still unknown,

167
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,000
and that's why we have
to study it more, okay?

168
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,250
[NATSUKI] "The proposal to
abolish the minimum wage

169
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,250
and benefits law is close
to being approved.

170
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,000
The workers' union of Wind City
has been holding strikes."

171
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,666
Oh, boy, looks like
Queen Mashiro's rule

172
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,750
will face one
hardship after another.

173
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,416
[yelps]

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,750
Shizuru.

175
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,291
It looks like the queen
is facin' some opposition.

176
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,041
Still, considering the current
situation in Windbloom,

177
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,041
I think she's been makin'
the right decisions.

178
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:06,750
Me too.

179
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,125
But on top of all that,

180
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,916
we've got those Otome
Limitation talks next month.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,250
I can already tell
that's going to be

182
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,500
another big headache for us.

183
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,833
--[whooshing]
--[BOTH] Huh?

184
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,791
[BOTH grunting]

185
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,000
Hello, Headmistress!

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,750
We just finished collecting
all the samples.

187
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,791
[GAL] Now, let's head back
to the school, shall we?

188
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,125
Irina, what is a
researcher like you

189
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,750
doing riding around on the back
of a professor like that?

190
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,541
That goes for you too, Professor
Gal. You should know better.

191
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,250
Director, our sample recovery is
complete and we're coming back.

192
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,625
Is that all right?

193
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,666
I'm sorry, but could you check
out one more place for me?

194
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,666
Oh, wait! Leave that
where you found it!

195
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,916
I just need you to see
if the ruins are there.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,708
If that's all then, I can go
by myself and take a look.

197
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,291
Natsuki, you go
back ahead of me.

198
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,833
Sure, if you don't mind.
Thank you.

199
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,208
All right, in that case...

200
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,083
We must defend ourselves against
the enemies of the Academy.

201
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,333
For now, let's fall
back to Garderobe!

202
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,958
Why can't she just simply
say "We're going back"?

203
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,416
[GAL]
Who knows?

204
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,791
[MASHIRO sighs]

205
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,250
I know we have
them all the time,

206
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,791
but these meetings
are exhausting.

207
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,625
I think you've been doing
a splendid job Miss Mashiro!

208
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm very happy and proud of you.

209
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,000
What about those people
holding the sit-in?

210
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,375
Yes, I'm afraid
they're still out there.

211
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,166
Huh... I see.

212
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,500
Mashiro!

213
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,791
[MASHIRO] What, you're
asking about that now?

214
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,291
No, I'm not going to repeal it.

215
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,000
It's part of a necessary reform.

216
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,208
Why? Whaddya mean?!

217
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,041
A lot of people could
get their wages cut!

218
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,041
How could you do
something like that?

219
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,833
[MASHIRO] Don't worry,
that's not gonna happen!

220
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,083
Why else do you think

221
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,416
I've been having meetings
every single day?

222
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,458
I haven't been doing it
for fun, that's for sure!

223
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,875
[ARIKA]
I know that.

224
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,791
But all of them are worried
about what's going on.

225
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,375
You haven't been talking with
those protestors, have you?

226
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,333
Yeah, of course
I talked to them!

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,833
[ARIKA]
Mh-hm, mh-hm. Mh-hm.

228
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,791
You're such an idiot, Arika!

229
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,916
Huh? Now you're
calling me an idiot?!

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,791
Why won't you listen to
what they have to say?!

231
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,916
I feel sorry for them!

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,708
I'm not doing this
because I want to!

233
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,708
You can't dictate the
policies of this country

234
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
by how sorry you feel!

235
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,166
[ARIKA] You've changed
a lot lately, Mashiro.

236
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,458
[MASHIRO] The problem is,
you haven't changed one bit.

237
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,125
My, that's rather strange.

238
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,958
It's a lot different down here
compared to that other crater.

239
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,833
I wonder if it's supposed
to be that way.

240
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,875
Huh?

241
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,708
[MIYU]
Run, Bewitching Smile Amethyst.

242
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,875
That creature...

243
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,375
[SHIZURU]
Hm?

244
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,416
[gasps]

245
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,583
[ARIKA] What's with her,
trying to act so mature?

246
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,833
Grandma always told me

247
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,250
that you can stand on
your toes all you want,

248
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,916
but that doesn't make
you a grown-up.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,041
Sounds to me like you're
feeling lonely, Arika.

250
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,875
After all, it's like
you're being left behind.

251
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,708
[ARIKA]
That's not true!

252
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,833
Aw, come on, Arika,
don't get upset.

253
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,041
Just accept the facts!

254
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,625
But that's not the way it is!

Oh! Your face is very cute!

258
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,000
Ugh! And if that wasn't enough,

259
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,958
today Mashiro's gone
off on her own!

260

Hey, Miss Cat Goddess,
are you a food expert?

Yeah, are you?!

[WOMAN A]
Look, it's the Cat Goddess!

263
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,166
Can I take a picture of you?

264
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,500
Good day to you, Cat Goddess!

265

[MIKOTO chuckles]

266
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,875
[MASHIRO] Ugh! That Arika
is so annoying sometimes.

267
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,541
I put a lot of hard
work and energy

268
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,750
into getting that act passed.

269
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,458
She has no idea!

270
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,791
Huh? Then the two of you
ended up having a fight?

271
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,458
N-No, we weren't
having a fight!

272
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,833
It's not like we're children!

273
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,333
[MAI chuckles]

274
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,041
Mai! Come on,
where's my bowl of ramen?

275
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,333
It's almost ready.

276
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,250
Mashiro, just don't get
too emotionally involved

277
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,916
and rush blindly ahead.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,250
You tend to see what's only
right in front of you.

279
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,750
But I'm not getting
emotionally involved at all.

280
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,583
[RIBBON] Sorry for
the wait, Your Majesty!

281
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,125
One bowl of Cat Goddess ramen!

282
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,500
It looks delicious!

283
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,666
[RIBBON] Yours is coming
right up, Cat Goddess.

284
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,083
The soup is still really hot,
so please be careful.

285
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,583
[MASHIRO]
What a great waitress!

286
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,875
[RIBBON]
Enjoy!

287
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,708
By the way, Mai,

288
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,250
what's happening with the
disarmament of the Slave Lords?

289
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,791
Well, since Garderobe has
its hands full right now,

290
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,166
they haven't had the
time to come and help

291
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,375
all of these people.

292
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,541
I see.

293
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,541
So even a little girl
as cute as her

294
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,833
still has to carry
the burden of a Slave.

295
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:42,833
That's awful.

296
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,458
[MAI]
Your ramen's getting cold.

297
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah, I know that.

298
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,250
Is that the debris
from the big meteor?

299
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,833
That's right.

300
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,000
We're analyzing the materials
and studying its composition.

301
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,750
There are some things
about it that worry me.

302
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,541
[ARIKA]
Really, how come?

303
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,583
Remember?

304
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,916
There was that
weird course change

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,125
that the Admiral and the
others were talking about.

306
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:04,791
Uh?

307
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,958
[NATSUKI]
Irina?

308
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,041
Shizuru hasn't returned
to Garderobe yet.

309
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
Has she contacted you at all?

310
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,708
[IRINA]
No.

311
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,958
There's been nothing from
the Gem transmission

312
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,291
or the heavy particle link.

313
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
[GAL] I guess she must've
found a pretty girl

314
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,291
along the way to distract her.

315
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,541
Ugh. Professor.

316
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,458
[IRINA, YOHKO chuckle]

317
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,791

00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,625
[groans]

480
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,583
Why did it fail?

481
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,625
Please give the power of
the Blue Sky to my Otome!

482
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,500
Give back her power!

483
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,833
Are you all right, Arika?

484
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,625
Why did I...?

485
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,208
Hey, Mai!

486
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,750
What is it?

487
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,125
[NATSUKI] Yohko! What's the
location of the intruders?

488
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,541
[YOHKO]
I don't know,

489
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,000
but in the meantime, the
subsystem has reached its limit!

490
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,250
Huh? What is that thing?

491
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,500
Just to let you know, this'll
probably only work once.

492
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,708
Okay!

493
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,791
[ARIKA] I can do this
without Mashiro's help!

494
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,666
[yells]

495
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,750
We did it, Arika! Nice job!

496
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,541
Yeah!

497
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:17,125
[thunder rumbling]

498
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,458
Arika...

499
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,708
[NATSUKI]
Mai! Arika!

500
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,166
The Predecessor's been
attacked by unknown forces!

501
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,958
What?!

502
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,000
Be very careful.

503
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,250
Whoever those bastards are,

504
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,041
they also took the
Pure White Diamond

505
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,250
from where it was sealed.

506
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,583
Wait, are you saying?!

507
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,416
[screams]

508
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,541
Mai!

509
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,000
Arika!

510
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,541
Huh? What's going on?!

511
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,583
Oh no, Mashiro!

512
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,375
[ARIKA]
Mashiro!

513
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,208
Arika!

514
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,291
Mashiro?

515
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,666
Mashiro!

516
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,416
[MAI] Oh my gosh, we're finally
releasing an OVA, Arika!

517
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,458
[ARIKA] Yeah, Mai!
At last, our own OVA!

518
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,875
[MASHIRO] Do you even
know what OVA means?

519
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,375
[ARIKA]
Of course!

520
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,583
It stands for, "Outrageously
Voluptuous and Attractive."

521
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,000
[MASHIRO] I can see you
still have no intention

522
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,000
of taking these
previews seriously.
