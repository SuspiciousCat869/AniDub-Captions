to tell us what happened,

then how are we supposed to
carry out our investigation?

The situation doesn't

so please, just be honest with
us and explain what happened.

We were there and we saw it!

Sister had some kind of
strange weapon in her hand!

Excuse my interruption,

but would allow me to speak
to Sister Yukariko alone?

I'd prefer to deal with
this situation personally.

Uh, the pork cutlet

[DOCTOR] The injury to her
arm isn't particularly bad,

51
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,041
but there's a hairline
fracture in her left fibula.

52
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,875
Perhaps it was caused
when she fell.

53
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,625
I'm more concerned
about that, actually.

54
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,625
Then her memory loss
of last night...

55
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,833
It's likely temporary and stems
from the shock of the injury.

56
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,416
I don't think we have to
worry too much about it.

you! So don't you--

62

[MASHIRO]
Even if you knew...

63
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,750
...what would you do about it?

I can't say for sure
what I'd do...

I don't know what I would do!

But my friend was attacked,
and she's even lost her memory!

I'm getting sick
and tired of this--

72

it's so confusing
and frustrating!

73
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,541
That's why-- Why I
came here to ask you.

74
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

75
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,791
It must've been difficult
for you to here,

76
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,625
but I can't tell
you anything.

77
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,208
Judging from all
that you have told me,

78
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,291
you're probably
cursing your fate.

00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,000
But personally, Mai, I feel
glad that you're a HiME.

Gimme a break!

All she ever does is
blow smoke around!

I don't like her at
all; I never have.

83
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Well, it's clearer than ever.

From now on, we're just gonna
have to take matters

It's me.

I'm very sorry.
I understand that.

90
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,166
But I'm afraid I need
to ask for your help.

91
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,625
Not for myself,
but for someone else.

92
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,083
I can't give you the name...

[SHIZURU] You always
turn up outta nowhere.

101
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,041
I see that
Iwasaka Pharmaceuticals

102
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,375
is one of the sponsors
of this school.

103
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,041
[SHIZURU] Yes. I met some
of their top people

104
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,333
at the Founders' Day festival.

105
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,500
Yet there's no mention
of the Searrs Foundation

00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,666
or any other
affiliated companies.

107

Strange.

Thanks, appreciate it, Shizuru.

109
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,750
Not at all.

Don't do anything too
dangerous now, Natsuki.

But you also have me, Sister.

I may never be able to
completely win over your heart.

You haven't slept

should be taking a break?

No chance!

I dunno what that fool of
a leader thinks she's doing,

but I have my pride as well!

Just don't push yourself.

133
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,916
I brought you something to eat.

[HARUKA]
Hmm! Good work, Yukino!

135

With this little bit of food...

136
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,375

Yukino, why don't you
go and get some sleep?

142
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,416
But I--

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,958
Don't argue.

144
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,125
Unlike me, you need your sleep
or else you won't be able

145
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,958
to function at your
full potential.

146
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,791
Remember, our enemy is
awfully bodacious.

147
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,375
You mean, "audacious."

148
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,500
Pardon?!

149
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,791
Yah! Thanks, Haruka.

150
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,625
I will go rest.

151
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,750
Incredible, to think
that Sister Yukariko

152
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,791
was a Valkyrie...

153
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,541
A case of being too close
to see her true nature.

154
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,041
But the vampires are
working very well.

155
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,500
[NATSUKI]
It sure is hard to see people

156
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,958
for who they really are.

157
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,125
Who would've thought
a place like this

158
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,041
existed under the chapel?

159
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,125
Alyssa Searrs, huh?

160
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,041
Now there's a surprise.

161
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,666
I know your organization
likes to hide in the shadows.

162
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,375
So it's kinda interesting
you'd come after us

163
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,208
using your actual name.

Mai! Are you all right?

326
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,750
[MIYU] That's quite
an incredible power.

327
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,875
[BOTH gasp]

328
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,916
Mai! Do it!

329
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,750
Fire!

330
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,166
[MAI grunts]

331
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,750
[MIYU] Miss Tokiha, you are
a very interesting person.

332
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,625
We will meet again.

333
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,958
Oh, no, ya don't!

334
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,666
[BOTH grunt]

335
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,375
[NATSUKI groans]

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,375
What?! At Tsukimori?

337
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,125
He was apparently arrested.

338
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,916
A creep of a guy who liked
to call himself a vampire.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,125
[SHIZURU] And he confessed to
all the crimes he committed

340
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,833
--at this school.
--[HARUKA] What?!

341
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,583
I wonder...

342
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,250
...if she did it...

343
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,125
It's gonna be tough for you
to manage on your own.

344
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,375
Father has taken full
responsibility

345
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,708
for having tarnished the dignity
and reputation of the chapel.

346
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,208
I should have be the
one held accountable.

347
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,375
[YUKARIKO]
He was a wonderful man...

348
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,916
Are you insinuating
my plan was inadequate?

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,916
Is that what you're telling me?

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,333
[SEARRS]
That's right.

351
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,208
Our board has determined...

352
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,333
...that you shall be removed
from your position immediately.

353
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,416
[GREER]
No...

354
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,208
[SEARRS]
Alyssa?

355
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,500
I believe you can
manage on your own?

356
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,666
Yup! That's right, Father.

357
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,791
[giggles]

358
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,875
[gasps]

359
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,000
Miyu!

360
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
No, Miyu! Don't do it!

361
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,250
Remember, Miyu!
Remember that I created you!

362
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,583
Initiate Code Alpha 7-9!
Command priority!

363
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,708
The secret codes that you had
installed have all been deleted.

364
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,458
What a terrible thing
that you're trying to do.

365
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't you realize that Miyu is
a very important friend of mine?

366
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,125
As you heard,
you've been fired...

367
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,708
...Joseph Greer.

368
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,750
[GREER snarls]

369
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,416
I am the one
who is now in control.

370
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,750
In order to usher in
the Golden Age.

371
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,791
[SHIHO] Mai, how'd
they get to be so big?

372
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,291
--[MAI] U-Uh--
--[SHIHO] I'm serious!

373
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,625
You've gotta tell me!

374
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,541
[MAI]
What do you expect me to say?

375
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,708
[SHIHO] Ugh! You wanna
keep it a secret?!

376
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,000
You're mean!

377
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,000
[CHIE] That's right!
Don't keep it to yourself!

378
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:09,833
Spit it out!

379
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,250
[MAI]
Not you, too?!
