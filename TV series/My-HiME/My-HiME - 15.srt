--[MAN A] This is the girl?
--[MAN B] Yes.

She has ighly-advanced
materializing capabilities.

She's been created as a

of the technology.

[SEARRS]

Thank you.

But your vital signs
aren't back to normal yet.

Don't worry.

00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,958
I don't have time to be resting.

00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,125
I've lived my whole
life for this day.

Yes, but...

[NAGI]
Ugh! I can't believe this!

17
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,666
[NAGI] Boy, you sure
made a mess of my hideout.

18
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,666
It would upset anyone.

19
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,291
Don'tcha think?

20
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,041
I assume you're Nagi. Correct?

21
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,041
You know, you can try all you
want,

22
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,708
but the star isn't going
to do what you hope it will.

00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,583
Oh, and count on a whole
lot of payback for the mess

Do what you want.

But don't be so sure
we're the bad guys here.

You are hardly innocent.

Gimme a break...

00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,250
The attitude of kids today.

[MAI] Um, Headmaster,
why did you call us all here...?

31
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,875
[MASHIRO]
This is no trivial matter.

32
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,833
I want you to save our school.

00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,333
[MAI sighs]

34
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,000
The Searrs Foundation has taken
occupation of the academy.

35
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,458
They're after you,
with the goal of keeping you

36
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,166
from acquiring the power
of the HiME star.

37
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,125
The Foundation has
their HiME, Alyssa Searrs,

38
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,541
and her bodyguard, Miyu Greer.

39
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,125
If they don't get
what they want,

40
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,000
they'll destroy the school, as
well as the entire student body.

41
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,375
Just like they did when they
destroyed the bridge.

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,750
[ALL gasp]

43
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,958
The bridge?

44
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,208
So Alyssa was behind that.

45
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,708
[MASHIRO] The satellite
Eclipse 1 is going to harness

46
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,875
her power and become her Child.

47
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,291
Alyssa? No... N--

48
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,500
It's us HiME that
they're looking for.

49
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,250
So if we leave the
school grounds,

50
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,375
they'll probably release
the other students.

51
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,500
[NAO scoffs]
What're you talking about?

00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,958
That's not gonna happen.

00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,333
[NATSUKI] They hardly seem
like the type to negotiate.

54
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,625
But...

Hey, will you please
clarify one thing for me?

56
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,666
Is Akane Higurashi a HiME?

57
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,375
I'm afraid that
Akane was defeated

58
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
at the hand of Miyu Greer.

59
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,541
As long as they're here
threatening the academy,

60
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,625
they're a danger to you HiME.

61
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,708
That's why I need your help.

62
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,125
[NATSUKI]
All right, then.

63
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,250
I don't like the idea of
helping you District 1 people.

64
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,416
But now isn't
the time to be picky.

First, I need you to
promise me one thing.

Promise you'll make
the safety of the students

You've come all this way,

Okay, girls.

Our preparations are complete.

There're about six
hours until the satellite

If we can evacuate the students
and hold Alyssa Searrs back

105
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,666
until then,
we will have succeeded.

Understand that you are
essentially acting as decoys.

Please remember that the success
or failure of the evacuation

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,750
depends on your ability
to draw the enemy forces
