Do I have to tell you
everything I do?

I knew they were
in the same class,

got along with each other.

connection with the school

[MAI whimpers]

486
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,625
You had me so worried!

487
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,166
Mai...

[police sirens approaching]

489
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,625
[MASHIRO] I had a feeling
that you'd be coming by

490
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,875
sooner or later.

491
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,750
What is a HiME, anyway?

492
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,833
And why do we have these
powers? What's the point?

493
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,416
To fight Orphans with.

494
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,125
Is that a good enough
answer for you?

495
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,041
[MASHIRO] All I can say
is that the future...

496
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,083
The future of this
entire country--

497
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:26,791
no, the whole world--depends on
the powers that HiME possess.

498
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,166
That's all.

[MAI]
Mm?

500
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,708
Are you still mad at me?

501
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
No, Mikoto.

502
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,791
Hey, what do you want
for dinner tonight?

503
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,458
You can have anything
you like--your choice.

I know what I want!

506
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,291
Some of your
three-minute noodles!

507
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,875
One order of three-minute
noodles it is, then!

508
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,208
Mai!

509
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,291
[MAI] Before dinner, you've got
cleaning duty as punishment.

[MIKOTO]
Uh-huh.

No kidding...

515
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,750
That's Alyssa Searrs,
from grade school.

They call her
the "Golden Angel."

Really?

Miyu...?

00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,000
So, she is capable of
