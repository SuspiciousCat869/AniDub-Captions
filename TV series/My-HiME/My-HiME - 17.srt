00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,333
[OLD LADY A]
I am glad you've managed

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,166
to overcome this
difficult situation.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,416
Certainly, they must now realize
that they are powerless.

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
[OLD LADY B] Remember though,
the most important stage

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,500
is yet to come.

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,375
[OLD LADY C]
As the star gets closer,

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,000
the world will start to waver.

8
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,583
But we must not allow them
to continue having

9
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,250
their way with this country
and the world any more

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,458
than they already have.

11
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,916
[OLD LADY B] You must give
guidance to the HiME

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,166
and be sure to make this
upcoming festival a success.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,583
[OLD LADY A If you can do that,
the land of the rising sun

14
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:59,083
can look forward to becoming
a great and prosperous nation.

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,583
[OLD LADY B]
Yes, yes!

16
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,708
[OLD LADIES laugh]

17
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,583
[OLD LADY A] The Obsidian
Prince shall awaken soon.

18
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,500
And remember, the more
tears that are shed by

19
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:15,875
the Battle Princesses, the
greater the joy of the Prince.

20
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,125
However, you must
make sure to carry on

21
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,833
the festival without fail.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,041
Kazu...

23
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,791
Hari disappeared.

24
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:26,958
[gasps]

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,125
[AKANE] The person
most precious to me...

26
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,208
--[clapping]
--[gasps]

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,666
It seems like you've enjoyed
your night of singing, my HiME.

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,166
[MIDORI] Hey! You shouldn't
be climbing up there!

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,041
[AKIRA] Now that you
know I'm a girl,

30
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,875
I don't have any other choice!

31
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,666
[TAKUMI gasps]

32
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,041
[NAGI]
It's about to begin.

33
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,208
You are now going to
have a new battle...

34
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,625
...to defeat each other's Child.

35
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,708
The festival is
about to commence!

36
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,708
Now, the time has come!

37
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,708
If you have someone
residing in your heart,

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,708
then come, accept the challenge,

39
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,125
and descend upon the
cursed land of Fuka...

40
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,458
...My HiME!

41
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,250
Basically, after this
particular law was introduced,

42
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,791
government agents could
take control of local property

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,041
and do as they wished,

44
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,958
leaving the towns and
villages at their mercy.

45
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,875
So this meant people had
to protect their own land.

46
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,416
In order to do that,
they needed to be armed,

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,333
and this eventually led to the
development of a warrior class.

48
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,833
[MAI]
What's this about?!

49
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,875
[NAGI]
It's really quite simple.

50
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,791
You have to fight
each other, that's all.

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,500
Using your Child.

52
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,250
Those strange creatures
that have been nurtured with

53
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,750
your love--the same love you
have for your precious person.

54
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,750
[MAI sighs]
Unreal.

55
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,875
Jeez!

56
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,708
[NAGI] Oh, don't get
too worked up about it.

57
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,666
[NAGI] You only have to
defeat each other's Child.

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,333
[NATSUKI]
But...

59
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,708
...if a Child is defeated,

60
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,041
the person most precious
to its HiME vanishes.

61
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:54,833
Right?

62
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,166
[gasping]

63
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,083
[NAGI
Bingo!

64
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,916
I see you've done your homework.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,416
I'm betting Akane
told you about it?

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Then again, I did
tell you once before,

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,708
didn't I?

68
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,625
If you choose to fight,
you'll have to risk

69
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,250
the one thing most
important to you.

70
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,541
[gasping]

71
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,833
[gasps]
No way...

72
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,250
Does that mean... Kazuya's...?

73
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,958
[AKANE shrieks]

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,041
[AKANE pants]

[gasping, screams]

76
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,125
[NAGI] That's basically
what it's all about.

--[door jiggles]
--[YUKINO gasps]

78
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,291
[HARUKA]
Hey! Who locked the door?!

79
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,416
[YUKINO gasps]

80
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:40,875
[YUKINO]
U-Um...

81
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,250
I don't know what happened.

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,083
I-I must've locked
it by accident.

83
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,416
[HARUKA sighs]
C'mon.

84
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,625
You've been making stupid
mistakes all morning.

85
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,458
Get it together.

86
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,125
[YUKINO sighs]
Yeah..

87
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,500
Sorry, Haruka...

88
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,416
[HARUKA]
Hmm? Yukino.

89
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,208
If something's bugging you,
please tell me right away.

90
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,875
You're not doing
yourself any favors

91
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,250
by keeping everything
pent up inside.

92
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,375
[YUKINO]
Hmm?

93
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,000
[NAGI
Oh, and another thing.

94
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,458
Let's say that
for whatever reason

95
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,333
you were to be defeated...

96
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,833
...both your Child and the
person most precious to you

97
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,125
will still disappear.

98
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,833
So if you want to protect
the person who means

99
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,625
the most to you, there's nothing
else you can do but fight

100
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,458
and win all of your battles.

101
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,375
Oh, Lord...

102
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,625
Why is this happening to us?

103
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,625
[ISHIGAMI]
Sister?

What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,708
You look as though God
Himself has forsaken you.

[ISHIGAMI]
Hmm? Yukari... ko...

110
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,958
[NAO] In other words,
I just have to keep fighting

111
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,458
and winning until it's all over?

112
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,541
Is that right?

113
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,708
[NAGI]
Exactly.

114
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,166
You catch on quick.

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,125
[NAO growls]
Hah. Yeah, sure.

116
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
So you think I'm just
gonna go along with

117
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,166
this little plan of yours?

118
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,916
Are you demented or something?

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,708
[NAGI]
Hmph. Yeah, sure. Whatever.

120
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,208
The fact is,
you'll have to fight.

121
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,166
There's no way any of you
can avoid that fate.

122
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,333
Besides, that's really
what you and the other HiME

123
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,708
are here for.

124
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,333
[NAO sighs]

125
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,500
There's no way
I'll be defeated...

126
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,500
Jeez. The guy sure
isn't very sociable.

127
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,625
Hmph.

128
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,833
[NAGI] Haven't you
noticed that up there?

129
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,041
[GIRLS]
Hmm? Huh?

130
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,291
It's gotten bigger.

131
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,041
[NAGI]
The HiME Star...

132
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,125
The star that only
you are able to see

133
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,291
is approaching
Earth as we speak.

134
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,875
That red star will bring
great disaster to everything

135
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,958
it comes into contact with.

136
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,375
But its effects
can be felt even now.

137
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,000
The only person that can
counter its force is the HiME

138
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,875
that survives through to the
end, and, of course, her Child.

139
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,666
You will have to
choose that one HiME

140
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,791
before the star
crashes into Earth.

141
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,208
And if that's not possible...

142
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,875
...the world will be destroyed.

143
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
I still can't believe it.

144
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,500
Can't be...

145
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,833
[MAI] How do you expect
us to believe that?!

146
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,458
And besides--
Why do we have to do it?!

147
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,416
[NAGI]
Why do you think?

148
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,583
It's your destiny as HiME.

149
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,125
Whether this country--
in fact, the entire world--

150
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,583
prospers or not depends
on the power of you

151
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,083
and the other girls;
the only ones with the ability

152
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
to control the Hime Star.

153
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,208
And you people expect us to
sacrifice ourselves for that?

154
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,541
Is that what you're saying?

155
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,500
[NAGI] Mm-hmm. However,
there is one little bonus.

156
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,833
The HiME who wins all
the battles will be bestowed

157
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,916
with a tremendous power.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,791
[gasps]
Hang on! We're not done!

159
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,916
I've gotta go explain
all this to the girls

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,333
who aren't here.

161
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,041
Anyway, good luck.

162
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,416
Mai, what're you gonna do?

163
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,875
I'm going to ask the Headmaster,

164
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,125
and she'd better
give it to me straight.

165
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,166
Yukino!

166
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,208
[gasps]

167
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,708
[MAI]
You're here.

168
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,666
I was getting kinda worried
since you weren't in class.

169
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,916
Uh, right...

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,583
--[MIDORI] Mai.
--[MAI] Huh?

171
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,583
Yukino, Mikoto, you, too.

172
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,875
Let's talk outside.

173
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:20,958
[MAI]
No kidding.

174
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,625
So the Headmaster
isn't back yet...

175
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,875
[MIDORI] No, but I'm
gonna talk to her

176
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,791
as soon as she gets back.

177
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,208
Miss Sugiura, we're going
to be okay aren't we?

178
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,458
I-I mean... It's just...

179
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,416
You worry too much.
We're all friends, remember?

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,166
The HiME force, right?

181
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,333
Yeah, I know...
We're all part of a team...

182
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,166
But there are other HiME
that we still don't know about.

183
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,416
[MAI sighs]

184
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,750
[NAGI] We're a little
short on girls...

185
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,791
She's got a point.
There are a total 12 HiME.

186
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,833
That much we can be sure of.

187
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,916
So that means there
are still two HiME

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,666
that we don't know about.

189
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,875
But what if they...

190
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,208
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

191
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,916
I'm positive they
aren't that stupid.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,041
--[YUKINO groans]
--[MIKOTO] Yup!

193
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,500
Nothing to worry about, Yukino.

194
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,041
'Cause if something
bad happens,

195
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll protect both you and Mai!

196
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,791
Mikoto...

197
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,041
C'mon, c'mon.

198
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,500
There's no point gettin'
psyched up for a fight.

199
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
Anyway, I'm gonna check
and see if there's any truth

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,208
to that kid Nagi's story.

201
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,208
And even if he's
being honest with us,

202
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,208
there has got be a way of
getting out of this predicament.

203
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,750
--[MAI] Mm-hmm.
--[YUKINO] Mm...

204
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,083
[MIDORI] Until then, we've gotta
stay calm and use our heads.

205
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,833
We can at least make a
pact amongst ourselves.

206
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,208
In the meantime, if you
happen to run into Sister,

207
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:40,000
Natsuki, or Nao, make sure you
tell them about everything.

208
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,666
See? It's gonna be all right.
Nothing to worry about.

209
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,541
[MAI]
Yes. We will be all right.

210
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
[NAGI] If you choose to fight,
you'll have to risk

211
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,250
the one thing that's
most important to you.

212
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,541
Takumi...

213
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,166
Oh, Father...

214
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,916
I wonder...

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,375
Did you know?

216
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,458
Did you realize... that the
HiME would eventually have

217
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,166
to fight each other?

218
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,125
After all, it is your
destiny as HiME.

219
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,291
[AKIRA] That's why I was
told not to let anyone know

220
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,125
that I was a girl.

221
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,291
And to kill them
if they found out.

222
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,916
--[TAKUMI] Akira...?
--[AKIRA gasps]

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,458
[sighs]
Well? How are you feeling?

224
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,958
All right, thanks.
I'm feeling a lot better.

225
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,583
[AKIRA sighs]
That's good.

226
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,750
You found out!

227
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,416
Now that you know my secret...

228
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,041
...you'll have to die!

229
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,000
[TAKUMI groans]

230
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,000
That's okay.

231
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,416
[AKIRA gasps]

232
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,125
If this is something that
you know you've gotta do,

233
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,666
then do it.

234
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,625
There's so many times... I'd be
gone if you hadn't saved me.

235
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,541
Right...? [groans]

236
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:02,333
Besides, I'm used to
giving up anyway. [groans]

237
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,791
Takumi...

238
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,583
You serious...?

239
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,791
Dead serious.

240
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,166
To be honest...

241
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,625
...I'm tired of it.

242
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,041
Tired of all this suffering.

243
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,125
I haven't said
anything till now,

244
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,958
but my sister's sacrificed
so much for me. [groans]

245
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,791
So...

246
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,291
[whimpers]

[AKIRA]
You fool!

How can you give up
on life so easily?!

254
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,125
That's the one thing about
you that I can't stand!

The... one thing...

256
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,083
...I hate about you!

[TAKUMI]
Akira...

259
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,208
Sorry about what I said.

260
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,166
[TAKUMI sighs]
I should be apologizing.

261
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
I mean...

262
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,041
...you did tell me
to knock first...

[groans]
Ah!

265
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,708
Forget that! It was
just your imagination.

266

[TAKUMI]
Hmph.

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm so sorry.

268
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,458
Now you're even missing classes
because of me and my brother.

[sighs]
Yeah... Well, uh...

270
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,458
I wasn't really into going
to class today anyway.

Well, I sure appreciate it.

Hmm?

[MASASHI]
Sorry to come barging in here.

Why, hello there, Takeda.

If you're looking for Natsuki,
she's taken the day off.

Uh. What makes you think
I'm looking for Kuga?

284
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,375
Then you came to see me?

Oh, my goodness...

You are very nice
and all, but...

It's not that!

[SHIZURU]
Hmph.

289
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,666
For the last six months,

290
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,541
I've stayed clear of Tate,
just like I said I would.

291
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,666
I'm sure that he's settled
any issues that he had by now.

292
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,958
So I want him back in my club.

293
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,625
I suppose.

294
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
I don't have any problems
with it personally.

295
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,208
But Tate seems to be
preoccupied lately.

296
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,333
Huh?

Isn't it terrible?

give guidance to the students.

let's be calm about this.

Drink up. I'm quite
skilled at making tea.

303

Perhaps even more so
than painting.

00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,500

322

[gasps]
Uh, Mai. Your skirt.

323
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,208
It's kinda...

324
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,291
[MAI]
Huh?

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,250
[MAI gasps]
Oh, my gosh!

326
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,541
I'm glad you weren't
hurt or... anything.

327
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,416
Uh, please forget about it.

328
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,791
Oh. No problem.

329
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,291
I'm just happy that we
get to talk like this.

330
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,750
Lately, I've had
this funny feeling

331
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,541
that you've been avoiding me.

332
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,458
It's not like I'm...
trying to avoid you.

333
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,708
[REITO]
I'm sorry, Mai.

334
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,791
I apologize for
trying to do that.

335
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,083
I wasn't even thinking
about your feelings.

336
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,250
[REITO] Guess I was right all
along about you and Tate...

337
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,458
[MAI]
Uh, hang on a second!

338
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,416
I don't have any special
feelings for Tate!

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,833
[MAI]
Even if I did like somebody...

...I've got too many
things going on right now.

341
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,625
I don't have time
for that kinda stuff.

342
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,625
What do you mean?
Is something the matter?

Go ahead and get it.

00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,416
I won't be long.

Are you sure about that?

Yes.

Hmm.

353
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,875
[MAI]
Is it true?

354
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,166
Yes. There's finally a heart
donor for your brother...

gonna have to leave the room.

00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,041
Or maybe you want
to take our place?

[NURSES laugh]

00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,958
Why do I always make
a fool of myself?

00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,000
Tate?

373
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,583
Well, good for Takumi.

374
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,916
[MAI]
Yeah.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,083
But this is where things
are gonna get complicated.

376
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,458
You've got it rough, too.

377
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,291
You're here taking care of
Shiho around the clock.

378
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,166
I guess. Then again...

379
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,333
...it was my fault she got
hurt in the first place.

380
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,958
[YUICHI sighs] I think you're
pretty amazing, though.

381
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,208
[MAI grunts]
Meaning...?

382
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,583
[YUICHI] Sorry. I know you hate
being told stuff like this,

383
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,625
but you've got enough
on your hands worrying

384
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,958
about Takumi and
his health problems.

385
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,125
Then on top of that, you've got
to deal with being a HiME

386
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,625
and fighting Orphans.

387
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,750
And then there was all
that trouble at the school.

388
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,416
[YUICHI] You know,
I wanted to find something

389
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,916
I could do to help.

390
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,625
But there wasn't anything,
and worse, I left Shiho alone

391
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,333
and she ended up hurt.

392
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,208
[YUICHI]
It's always like this!

393
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
I get all psyched up,

394
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,541
I convince myself that
I can deal with a problem,

395
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,500
but in the end, I panic and
end up screwing up big time.

396
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,958
Tate...

397
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,708
[YUICHI sighs] Now I think
I finally understand

398
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,500
all the problems you
had to go through.

399
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm sorry for...

400
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,208
...you know...

401
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,041
Well, for not being
very considerate.

402
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,666
Where's all this coming from?!

403
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,416
It's not like you at all!

404
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,041
I mean, why would you
say this now?

405
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,541
After everything...

406
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,208
It's complicated.

407
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,458
I mean... Shiho and I have known
each other since we were kids,

408
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,416
and she's always
called me "Brother,"

409
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,416
which kinda drives me
crazy, sometimes.

410
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,583
[YUICHI]
But still...

411
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,791
...that's why...

00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,666

just with someone?

[YUICHI]
Hmm? No.

Must be something in my eye...

435
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,333
Now, I'd better
get back quick

and tell Takumi the great news!
