in her all of a sudden?

[NATSUKI]
No reason.

172
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,125
Is it something to do with
what happened on the back hill?

173

[NATSUKI sighs]

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,916
Sorry, Shizuru.

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,958
I just don't wanna get you
wrapped up in this, that's all.

[SHIZURU giggles]

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,166
That's so cute. Why,
I'm almost buying it.

[GIRL A]
Good bye, Kanzaki. Heh!

180
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,208
Bye, girls.
Careful on your way home.

Okay! [laughs]

182
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,666
Kanzaki. So what are
we gonna do about

183
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,500
the annual
Founder's Day Festival?

184
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,000
Well...

185
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,750
With all that's happened,
I don't think we can go through

186
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,000
with the boat party plan.
We'll have to start over.

187
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,375
Good.

188
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,166
I wasn't exactly in a hurry
to get back on a boat

189
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,250
any time soon.

Don't worry; from now on,

192
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,750
I'll be sure to send you
somewhere a lot safer.

[sighs]
I wish.

194
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,458
But something tells me
that's not gonna happen.

195
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,708
Ooh.

[NATSUKI]
Huh?

198
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,291
Hi. Not interrupting, are we?

199
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,041
Yup, you sure are.
Right at the juicy part.

Shizuru!

201
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,791
Heh. I was kidding;
we won't bother you.

202
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,416
I've got an idea.
How 'bout some tea?

203
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Wasn't there a good
mandarin tea around?

204
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,916
I suppose you want me to get it.

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,375
I'm leaving, anyway.

[SHIZURU]
Oh, come on.

207
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,083
Why don't you relax
and stay a while?

Tell me though.

Wait a minute...

Don't tell me you had something
to do with that incident

last night out on the back hill.

Sorry to bother you like this.

has asked me to
bring you to her.

The school has
officially announced

00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,291
what happened last night
on the back hill.

242
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,750
It was a lightning strike.

You sure are a hard nut
to crack, aren't you?

I won't pretend to know what
that's supposed to mean.

Excuse us.

Right now, we need to keep
Takumi out of the limelight.

He needs his rest more
than anything else.

Yes, I understand.

I'll escort him to the
dormitory myself, in fact.

to the headmaster.

[MAI] That vice president
guy sure is nice.

He's like an understanding
older brother.

Mm... Yeah, I guess.

He is a pretty amazing
guy, that's for sure.

He and student council
president Fujino

are the most powerful couple
in the school's history.

Pretty bad, huh?

doing that kinda damage.

that whole thing with the ferry.

going on these days.

by a demon or something.

How about an exorcism?

not too far from here.

I'm pretty sick all the time,

so I've been a huge
burden on my sister.

we were able to get scholarships

to attend this school.

to each other...

thank you as soon as we arrived,

in a few things...

There is no need to
thank me for anything.

an ulterior motive

That's why you're here.

331
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,708
[MAI gasps]

332
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,458
[MASHIRO] That beast
that you fought last night,

333
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,041
it's called an "Orphan."

334
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,000
[MAI]
"Orphan"?

335
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,375
That's right.

336
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:35,291
It's not from Earth.
It strayed from another world.

337
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,583
The only ones that can
fight these beasts

338
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,000
are maidens who are under
the guidance of a certain star.

339
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,041
Only you HiME can fight them.

340
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,208
That's why you called us here.

341
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,375
--[MAI growls]
--[MIKOTO] Huh?!

342
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,000
[MAI] You called us here
in order to fight monsters?!

343
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,541
--[huffs]
--[MASHIRO] Yes.

344
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,875
[MAI]
Ugh!

345
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,166
That's cruel...

346
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,416
You tricked us!

347
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,041
It's just not fair!

348
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm already responsible
for someone

349
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,708
I promised to take care of.

350
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,458
I don't have the time
or energy to waste

351
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,291
on other people's problems!

352
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,375
You mean your brother?
Is that it?

353
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,541
[gasps]

354
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,208
If you'd like, I might
be able to help...

355
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,375
--[MAI growls softly]
--[gasps]

356
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,625
I'm terribly sorry.

357
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,916
That was... rude of me.

358
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,875
[MAI sighs]

359
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,125
Are you hungry, Mai?

360
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,541
Something tells me
you're the hungry one.

361
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,333
--[stomach growls]
--[MIKOTO] Mm...

362
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,291
Why don't you go on
and have a bath first?

363
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,250
I'll make you something to eat
while you're in there.

364
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,791
A bath?!

365
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,833
No! Stop it!

366
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,333
It's getting in my eyes!

367
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,750
[MAI] That's why I'm telling
you to close your eyes!

368
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,083
[MIKOTO]
Stop! It burns!

369
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,750
[MAI] You don't even know
how to take a bath?!

370
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,916
What kind of backwater
country did you come from?!

371

--[MIKOTO whines]

[MIKOTO groans]

373
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,208
[MAI]
Ugh.

374
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,125
[sighs]

375
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,958
[MASHIRO]
I won't force you to do this.

376
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,541
And I won't take away
your scholarship, either.

377
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:17,250
You must decide for yourself
what direction is right for you.

378
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,416
Hey, Mikoto.

379
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,333
What are you
gonna do about this?

380
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,458
Are you gonna fight like the
school headmaster asked us to?

381
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,666
I don't like the headmaster.

382
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,000
She is your legal
guardian, you know.

383
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,875
She covers all your school
and living expenses.

384
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,833
I need to find my brother.

385
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,291
And I'll fight anyone
who gets in my way.

386
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,458
End of story.

387
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,708
Oh.

388
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,875
I wonder if I'll
become like that...?

389
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,500
[MIKOTO] My grandpa
once told me something.

390
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,541
That my brother is
in the land of Fuka.

391
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,125
So I came here.

392
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,166
Mai? Am I too much of a
burden staying with you?

393
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,000
No, but what if you were?
Got anywhere else to go?

394
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,250
[MIKOTO]
No...

395
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,041
Then it looks like we're
stuck with each other.

396
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,208
Really?!

397
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,500

Mm-hmm!

This is your roommate, Mai?

Mikoto Minagi.

You're in middle school, huh?
What grade are you in?

421
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,416
She's 14, so that
puts her in third year.

get you into trouble one day.
