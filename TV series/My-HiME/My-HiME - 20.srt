172
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,833
Because when a HiME is defeated,

the person she cares
about most disappears.

Trouble is, Mai's power
is too immense.

195
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:02,041
So she must lose the person
who means the most to her.

196
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,750
Then, she will not be able
to summon her Child,

and Nao will be able
to defeat her.

your grandfather.
And this is as it should be.

00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:15,791
You must show... no loyalty to
anyone other than your brother.

Your brother,
the Obsidian Prince.

You have... grown into
a fine girl, Mikoto.

You don't know what it's like

looking after someone you love.
Making sacrifices.

377
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,125
And getting hurt!

You don't have a clue
what it's like!

I don't know how to love.

Takumi...

391

Did all this happen because
I turned my back on you

392

for a little while?

I hadn't left your side?

outta life, most of all?
