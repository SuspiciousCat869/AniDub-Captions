I fell in love with him first!

He's all that I've ever wanted!

You've gotta realize!

No matter which one of us
is defeated, Tate will--

--[SHIHO] Why?!

And when that happens, you will
be the one to defeat it.

Tate, I'm impressed.

I was expecting--and even
hoping--that you'd suffer

a far more humiliating,
pathetic end.

Mai's lost the most precious
