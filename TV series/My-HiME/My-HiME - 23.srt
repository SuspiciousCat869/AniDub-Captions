Yukino!

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,000
Haruka!

172
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,375
[HARUKA]
Yukino...

173
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,916
You're amazing, Haruka!

00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,375

I...

Heh. Oh, how amusing.

178
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,166
[NATSUKI growls]

179
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,833
[SHIZURU]
Pathetic.

180
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,625
I wonder if she actually
thought she could fight me.

181
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,083

[NATSUKI growls]

There's nothing to
hide from you now.

184
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,416
Natsuki... you must know...

185
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,750
...I truly am in love with you.

186
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,875
Shizu... ru...

187
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't worry. I'll defeat
all of the other HiME.

188
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,500
If there's anything
you don't like,

189
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,916
I'll take care of it
for you, Natsuki.

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,666
[NATSUKI]
Huh...?!

191
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,458
You just watch.

192
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,041
Wait! Shizuru!

193
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,375
Shizuru!

194
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,541
Oh, how frightening!
I'm impressed!

195
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,500
It's exactly as you predicted.

196
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:45,375
Nagi. Please go and tell her
where to find Natsuki's enemy.

197
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,416
And the reason why District 1
is called District 1.

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,541
[NAGI]
Yes, sir! What?!

199
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,000
It's become quite clear to me
as I awaken after 300 years.

200
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,916
This world is no good.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,541
However... as long as those
old ladies are around,

202
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,291
everything will
repeat endlessly.

203
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:06,375
The future must be built by
the hands of young people.

204
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,583
Hey... Are you the
Obsidian Prince?

205
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,916
Or maybe Kanzaki.
No, Reito Minagi.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,041
[REITO]
Hmph.

207
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,583
[MIDORI]
"Dear Mai.

208
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,000
I promised you'd get
first look at my thesis

209
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,583
when it was done.

210
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,166
I'm still not finished,
but I want you to hear

211
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,750
what I've learned so far
about the HiME battles.

212
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,583
Do you remember
that place underground

213
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,583
where all those
pillars were located?

214
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,458
Apparently, a pillar
rises up every time

215
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,333
someone precious
to a HiME vanishes.

216
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,500
When 11 pillars have risen,

217
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,791
in other words, when there's
only one HiME remaining,

218
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,083
the final door opens.

219
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,250
Then that last HiME will
be able to attain the power

220
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,750
of the HiME Star.

221
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,916
But only in exchange
for a certain destiny.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,833
To become the wife of
the Obsidian Prince.

223
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,875
Mai, I don't know who you hold
most dear in your heart.

224
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,583
But don't lie to yourself about
whom you give your love to.

225
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,500
Because for us to love
a person strongly,

226
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,875
means to put that
person's life at risk.

227
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,416
So, at the very least,
it's important

228
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,333
that you're true to yourself
about how you feel for someone."

229
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:45,625
[MAI] I'm sorry, Midori.
But it doesn't matter anyway.

230
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,375
Either way...

231
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,041
Then tell me
what it's all about!

232
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,750
What does it mean...
to truly love?

233
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,750
[echoing]
...to truly love?

234
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,500
...to truly love?

[grunts]

237
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,333
Why did things have
to turn out this way...?

238
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,291
[YOKO] Did she write anything
that might be of help to you?

239
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,375
Huh?

240
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,208
Uh... [sniffs] Yeah.

241
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,375
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

242
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,041
So she can be a little teacher-
like, when she wants to be.

243
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,208
[MAI sighs]

244
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,416
[YOKO]
Sister accidentally forgot that.

245
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
It seems she wasn't feeling
very well yesterday.

246
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,208
So she was getting some rest.

247
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,916
Is that right?

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,208
She was very grateful
for everything.

249
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,333
It was her first time.
As a patient, I mean.

250
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,750
From what I gather,
she's very healthy.

251
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,375
She's never even been
sick or injured before.

252
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,541
Are you sure?

253
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,708
[YOKO]
Yes.

254
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,791
But what about that time
when she hurt her arm?

255
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,833
[YOKO] Hmm? I never treated
her for any arm injury.

256
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,166
And when I examined her,

257
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,916
I didn't see any scars or
signs of past injury.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
Sister...

259
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,500
Damn that kid!
My last chance, he says?!

260
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,666
What a joke!

261
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,000
Stop staring!

262
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,708
Don't look at me like that!

263
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,041
I'm the man that sullied you!
You ought to hate me!

264
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,916
And I still need you
to fight for me!

265
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,416
I can't do it.

266
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,458
I can't do it anymore.

267
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,416
I love you, Wataru...

268
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,125
Are you really
gonna leave me now?

269
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,916
Yeah. I've got some things
I need to get at the store.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,625
Then promise me something.

271
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,541
You know that park
across the street?

272
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,708
Meet me there at
3 o'clock this afternoon.

273
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,541
[YUICHI]
Hmm? Why go to all that trouble?

274
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,625
Oh, I knew it...
You don't remember, do you?

275
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,416
[YUICHI sighs]
Okay, okay.

276
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,416
You want me at
the park at 3, right?

277
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,666
[gasps]

278
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,875
It's a promise!
And don't you forget, either!

279
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,916
That Shiho sure is a handful.

Kuga!

282
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,083
[SHIZURU]
Don't worry.

283
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,041
I'll defeat all
the other HiME.

284
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,083
If there's anything
you don't like,

285
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,541
I'll take care
of it for you, Natsuki.

286
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,833
[NATSUKI]
No, Shizuru!

287
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,291
No!

--[YUICHI] Hey.
--[gasps]

289
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,583
Apparently, you
collapsed on the street.

290
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,708
You were brought
here in an ambulance.

291
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,375
They shouldn't have bothered.

292
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,875
They could've just left me
in the street for all I care.

293
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,041
[YUICHI] Hmm?! You've
gotten all strange, too.

294
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,291
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

295
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,416
You're a HiME, aren't you?
What's happening?!

296
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,458
Tokiha's acting weird, too!

297
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,791
Mai is?

298
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,916
[MAI] There's something
I wanna ask you.

299
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,916
[YUKARIKO]
Certainly.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,708
I see. Mai as well, huh?

301
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:18,000
The fate of the HiME
will destroy everything.

302
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,250
Tell me, are you
in love with Mai?

303

Hmm?! I don't really know.

How could she just...?!

00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,708
[NATSUKI]
Hmm.

307
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,833
HiME battles put lives at stake.

308
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,000
The lives of people
we love the most.

309

[gasps]

310
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,041
[NATSUKI]
When a HiME is defeated,

311
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,416
the person most precious
to that HiME is... lost.

312
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,750
Ah! Then Takumi was...!

313
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,833
No, Takumi was lost as the
loved one of another HiME.

314
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,666
Come to think of it...

315
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,791
...back then, the person
that Mai loved the most

316
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,583
might have been changing.

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,416
[MAI] The real battle
began that night

327
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,166
when you came running back,

328
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
claiming that Nao
had attacked you.

329
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,250
That was a deception.

330
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,416
That was something
created by my Vulas.

331
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,875
Then it was all
because of you! [growls]

332
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,666
[YUKARIKO]
If you're going to crush me,

333
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,166
I would be more
than happy to oblige.

334
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,500
Except that...

335
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,416
...I don't want you to
commit a sin for the sake

336
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,291
of someone you love.

337
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,500
[ISHIGAMI groans]

338
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,333
It's too late for that!

339
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,291
You lied! This is
all your fault!

340
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Lied?

341
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,625
I suppose you're right.

342
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,250
So you intend to defeat me,
and the other HiME,

343
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
to become the
last one remaining?

344
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,916
Yes! I'm going to win
and take Takumi back!

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,416
And him, I can--

346
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,333
[YUKARIKO] Are you absolutely
certain that's what you desire?

347
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,583
[MAI gasps]

348
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,458
[MAI] What do you want
outta life, most of all?

349
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,625
[gasps]

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,125
[NATSUKI grunts]

351
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,291
[screams]

352
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,250
[NAO]
Welcome back.

353
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,333
You sure took long enough.

354
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:50,000
I've been waiting for you.
For... ages.

355
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,166
Nao...

356
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,416
[SHIHO] Do you remember
what day it is, Brother?

357
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,916
Today's the anniversary of
the first day you and I met.

358
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,333
[SHIHO whimpers]

359
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,625
[screams]

360
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,291
[SHIHO groans]

361
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,375
You promised...
to meet me here.

362
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,166
[NAO]
My eye is still killing me.

363
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,916
Did I mention how much it burns?

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The pain won't go away no
matter how many men I tie up.

365
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,541
It probably won't feel better
till I finish you off.

366
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,500
That's what I'm thinking.

367
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,666
[YUKARIKO] Mai, most
people desire one thing.

368
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,041
More than any other.
Just one thing.

369
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,500
[YUKARIKO] There are times when
people simply have to choose.

370
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,125
They must decide
what the one thing is,

371
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,625
that they cannot live without.

372
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,750
[YUICHI groans]

373
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,833
[SHIHO pants]

374
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,291
[whimpers]

375
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,916
[YUKARIKO]
Mai, don't be afraid.

376
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,250
Don't fear your true desire.

377
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,083
Don't fear the world
that you hope for.

378
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,375
[NATSUKI] Quite a ploy,
taking cover as a holy woman.

379
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,958
[YUKARIKO] I don't
need you to tell me that.

380
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,708
[NATSUKI] And Mikoto seems good
at the part of the evil villain.

381
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,250
[MIKOTO] I'm not
too happy about that part.

382
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,541
[NATSUKI] This is where
we get to see true evil!

383
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,500
Bring it on!

384
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,291
[YUKARIKO]
Pardon?

385
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,416
[MAI]
Say what?
