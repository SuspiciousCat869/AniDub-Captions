Now explain yourself!

What were you doing
sprawled out on the lawn?!

Eh-heh... Funny you ask.

00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,958
[MAI] Actually, I don't
really know myself.

[HARUKA growls]

6

You enter school property
after visiting hours

with a totally
questionable stranger!

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,458
Then, you selfishly damage
our beautiful lawn--

00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,541
the student's one place
for some peace and quiet.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,125
You presented yourself in
a totally inappropriate manner!

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,791
While offending and
polluting the minds,

decency of our students

with your obscene display.

And on top of everything,
you bring a weapon here!

[HARUKA] I want a good
explanation for all of this!

Are you listening to me?!

[MAI]
Uh...

00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,166
I'm waiting, Mai Tokiha!

Now, now.

[BOTH]
Huh?

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,708
Haruka. Why don't you have a cup
of tea and chill out a little?

24
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,666
Huh? You, too, Mai.
Before it gets cold.

I'm Kanzaki, third year.

--Hello.
--[HARUKA growls]

I don't care if you are
the vice president, Reito!

You should just
stay out of this one!

00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,500
[HARUKA gasps] It's the
Executive Committee's job

36
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,000
to maintain a proper
atmosphere at the school

37
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,541
and to ensure the safety
of our fellow students!

Oh, Haruka...

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,666
[REITO] Now, now. You don't
need to get so uptight.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,750
[HARUKA] I'm so sick
of your "now, now!"

41
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,125
People like you always
wanna let these miscreants

42
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,625
off the hook,
but you're only making

43
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,500
the Executive
Committee's job harder!

44
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,000
We're the ones
that have to answer

45
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,625
for all the strange things
that've been going on

46
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,666
around here lately!

[REITO]
Now, now.

There you go again!

[MAI]
Huh?

50
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,541
There's someone here
to visit the accused.

Hmph! Who'd that be?

[TAKUMI sighs]
I was worried about you.

00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,625

I'm sorry.

[SHIZURU]
Miss Suzushiro.

60
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,875
It's the Executive
Committee's responsibility

61
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,208
to ensure safety in the school.
Isn't that correct?

62
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:37,125
Uh, yes. Of course.
It is, President Fujino.

63
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,500
I knew you'd agree.

64
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,666
Then perhaps you should be
celebrating the fact

65
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,250
that Miss Tokiha
has come to our school.

Now Takumi. Don't cry.

[MAI]
Ugh! I can't believe it!

70
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,916
What's Suzushiro's
problem, anyway?!

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,833
Acting like she's more
important than everyone!

72
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,041
It's nauseating!

73
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,750
The Executive Committee
officers are on edge

74
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,083
with all the strange
stuff going on.

00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,833
I can't say
I blame them, either.

76
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,291
She's only a student
though, right?

77
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,458
Yeah, but at Fuka Academy,
the student council

78
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,250
is responsible for governing the
discipline of the other pupils.

79
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,833
It's part of the
academy's slogan--

80
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,166
it's a school run by the
students for the students.

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,541
So what's your story?

82
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,583
How did you become a member
of the student council?

83

You hardly seem the type.

Thanks for the
unsolicited opinion.

I'm not an officer or anything.

that time on the ferry...

hiding something.

[YUKINO] I-I don't really think
what happened on the ferry

been going on here at school.

This would be so much easier
if the student council

170
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,500
wasn't so incompetent!

of this--the sooner the better!

all about you... Mai Tokiha.

Natsuki Kuga.

[AOI]
She always looks so pretty.

194

You mean she's one of
the students here?

195

Natsuki's in the
class beside us.

Hmm. She's gone.

Sometimes things
simply get out of hand.

That's when it
becomes a problem.

There was another girl
on that ferry.

they knew all right. Yup.

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,750
Goodbye, Father.

325
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,958
Goodbye.

326
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,916
[TAKUMI]
She's been gone all afternoon?

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,333
[YUICHI] Yeah. You...
haven't heard from her?

328
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,416
[TAKUMI]
No.

329
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,625
[BOTH]
Huh...

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,666
Hang on, Mai!

331
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

332
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,958
[TAKUMI]
Wait for me, Sis!

333
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,375
[MIKOTO laughs]

334
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,583
[MAI]
How was it? Are you all full?

335
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,625
[MIKOTO]
Mm-ha, mm-ha!

336
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,666
I'm Mai!

337
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,000
That's my name--Mai.

338
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,416
What's your name?

339
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,791
Mikoto.

340
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,333
Okay. So, Mikoto.

341
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,208
There're a few things I wanna
ask you, if that's okay.

342
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,375
Like...

343
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,125
For starters,
where did you come from?

344
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,333
[MIKOTO]
Hmm...

345
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,916
[MAI] Okay, do you know
where you're going?

346
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
[gasps]

347
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,750
I'd better go!

348
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,291
To where?

349
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,416
[MIKOTO]
I'm looking for my brother!

350
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,375
[gasps]

351
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,250
That was awesome soup, Mai.

352
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
You're a good person.

353
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,166
[MAI gasps]

354
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,375
No, wait!

355
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,500
It's the third floor!

356
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,875
Guess it didn't matter.

357
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,375
[gasps]

358
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,291
Oh, no...

359
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,500
She got away from me again!

360
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,666
[TAKUMI wheezes]

361
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,708
[TAKUMI]
Sis...

362
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,041
[MAI pants]

363
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,916
[MAI] There was no point
in me taking her in!

364
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,916
[gasps]

365
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
So it seems you
didn't drown after all.

366
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,666
[growls]
What's the matter with you?!

367
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,375
How can you just
stroll back to school

368
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,083
after causing such a disaster?!

369
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,541
I should go to the police
and tell them what you did!

370
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,416
The police couldn't do
anything if they tried.

371
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,333
They don't stand a chance
against the powers

372
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,041
that are lurking in
the shadows of this school.

373
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,125
[MAI groans]

374
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,708
[NAGI]
You'll understand, eventually...

375
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,750
...my... princess.

376
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,166
Nagi!

377
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,250
[MAI]
Not again!

378
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,083
Who are you, anyway?!

379
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,416
I'm a HiME. That's who.

380
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,750
HiME?

381
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,916
[NATSUKI] Highly-advanced
materializing equipment.

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,875
That's what the people
at District 1 call me.

383
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,416
At District 1?

384
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,125
[NAGI]
Enough with the lecture.

385
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,083
I wonder why I get this
feeling something terrible

386
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,125
might happen you continue
to stand around

387
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,333
chatting all night like this.

388
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,583
What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,250
Can't guess?

390
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,250
A poor "lost one" is here.

391
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,833
An orphan!

392
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,583
[NAGI]
Mai!

393
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,458
[MAI]
Mm? Ah?

394
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,791
Take my advice.

395
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,708
I think you in particular
should get a move on.

396
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
[TAKUMI pants]

397
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,958
[NATSUKI]
Move!

398
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:12,916
[MAI]
No!

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,291
[NATSUKI]
Move!

400
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,500
Never!

401
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,541
[NATSUKI]
Get on!

402
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,541
Huh?

403
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,750
[TAKUMI grunts]

404
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,208
Takumi!

405
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,666
[gasps]

406
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,833
He has a bad heart!

407
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,125
[gasps]

408
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,250
[NATSUKI] Her powers
haven't even awakened yet.

409
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,875
[NATSUKI
Duran!

410
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,958
Go!

411
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,500
[DURAN howls]

412
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,791
[MAI pants]

413
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,791
Takumi! Takumi!

414
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,708
Behind you!

415
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,791
[MAI gasps]

416
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,916
[NATSUKI] Out of the way!
You can't handle it!

417
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,083
[gasps]

418
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,583
[NATSUKI]
Huh...?

419
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,083
[MAI]
Who are you, anyway?

420
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,833
[MIKOTO]
I'm Mikoto!

421
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,958
[MAI]
I know that...

422
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,958
Ugh. How could I have given up
my first kiss to this girl?!

423
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,500
[MIKOTO]
Fine. I'll give it back.

424
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,666
[MAI]
Hmm? No, wait...

425
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,208
Mikoto-- [grunts]
