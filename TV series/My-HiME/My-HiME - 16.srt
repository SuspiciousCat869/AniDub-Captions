What's the matter?

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,833
[sighs] It's just that--
I wanted to talk to her

65
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,833
and hear how everything
turned out in the end.

66
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,416
And also...

67
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
...to find out what happened
to Miyu and Alyssa.

68
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,750
It seems nobody knows
what happened to them.

69
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,250
But considering that
the Searrs troops

70
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,625
were completely wiped out
by the blast,

71
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,458
I'd say there wasn't
much hope for them.

72
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,458
Yeah. Right.

73
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,666
That reminds me:
Whatever happened to Akane?

74

She still hasn't
snapped out of it.

It'll be a while before we
get any information from her.

Information?

fighting, aren't we?

by the elders?

86
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,041
Must be tough
being the headmaster.

87
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,208
The job comes with certain
duties; I accept that.

88
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,541
Yeah, sure. It just
seems like a bad time

89
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,291
to be leaving the
school, that's all.

You've gotta do what
you've gotta do,

and it's no different
for me. Don't you agree?

Whatever you say.

93
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,625
But ultimately, everything's
determined by the star.

94
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,958
Making you and I
nothing more than pawns.

95
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,708
It might be pointless
asking you to do this,

96

but I want you to watch
over the girls for me.

She did regain consciousness
for a short time,

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,875
but she wasn't lucid
enough to communicate.

if she stays like this?

be able to talk to her.

had to take a medical with

119

so I was kinda worried.

It was nothing harsh.

124
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,291
We got stuck waiting
in the gym, that's all.

you were in there.

at the festival,

Guess she got hurt or something.

163
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,583
It probably happened when
the troops were here.

But the amazing thing is Tate.

166
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,458
He's been spending
every day at the hospital

167
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,791
since she was admitted. Looking
after her and everything.

168
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,250
Oh? He finally gave in
to her begging, did he?

You look like
you've seen a ghost.

Tate being with Shiho--
does that bother you?

No, I don't have
a problem with it.

Excuse me!

Yes, I'm coming!

Oh, right.

You seem kinda down.

feeling "up," that's for sure.

You scared me!

I wanted to talk.

00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,791
Oh, right...

So you did...
Go ahead, what's it about?

[MIDORI]
Hmm...

214
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,708
I, Midori Sugiura,

215
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,666
hereby make the
following proposition!

216
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,833
We will protect Fuka
Academy from Orphans

217
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,333
through the formation of
an organized HiME task force!

218
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,416
Huh?!

219
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,250
Thank you very much.

220
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,625
If you hadn't told me
to leave when you did,

221
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,583
there's just no telling what
might've happened to me.

222
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,083
I knew you could
be in danger,

223
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,666
so I couldn't sit
around and do nothing.

224
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,125
I had no choice.

00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,333
I have called you together
for a very important reason.

244
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,958
[NAO]
C'mon! This isn't very funny!

245
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,458
What's it about, anyway?!

246
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,291
Just hear me out.

[NAO groans]

248
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,500
Although the menace
of the Searrs Foundation

249
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,291
is no longer, our school,
Fuka Academy,

250
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,958
is still threatened
by Orphans. Ladies!

251
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,875
The only ones who are able to
resist and fight the Orphans

252
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,250
are we HiME!

253
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,666
And so!

254
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,791
In order to bring safety
and peace back to our school,

255
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,458
we must join together
and take on this task!

256
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,458
In other words,
establish a HiME force!

257
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,500
Oh, great. A HiME force...

258
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,166
C'mon, gimme a break.

259
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,666
What a stupid idea.

260
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,666
Why should we do
something like that?

261
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,666
Well, just think about
it for a minute.

262
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,333
Instead of each of us fighting
off the Orphans by ourselves,

263
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,916
it'd be way safer if we formed
a team and worked as a unit.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,666
We'd also be able to
mix up our different types

265
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,791
of attacks, and that'd help
us quickly destroy

266
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,291
any Orphans that show up.

267
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,833
Seems like a plan to me.

268
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,166
[NAO] A stupid plan.
I don't have time for this.

269
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,500
[NATSUKI]
Count me out, too.

270
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,166
If you want to play games,
then you're on your own.

271
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,333
What if someone like
Searrs shows up again?

272
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,041
Think you can manage
on your own?

273
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
[BOTH gasp]

274
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,583
[NATSUKI]
Hmm.

275
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,583
[NAO]
Hmm...

276
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,833
[MIDORI]
If we had a team in place

277
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,833
and something like that
happened, it'd be easier

278
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,875
to respond. We could share
information with each other.

279
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,416
It'd benefit us all.

280
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,916
I think it's a
wonderful idea!

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,791
The Lord did say that,

282
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,791
"Even arrows that would
easily break as one,

283
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,791
would not break in threes."

284
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,208
Wasn't that Motonari Mori...?

285
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,208
It is the Lord that
has brought us together.

286
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,791
We must join hands and
overcome our hardships together.

287
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,333
So? Not such a bad idea, is it?

288
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,541
[NATSUKI]
Mm... Ugh... Guess not...

289
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,875
What do you think, Mai?

290
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,125
[MAI]
Hmm... She does have a point.

291
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,000
I mean, it would be better
than doing it on our own.

292
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,083
I think your way
would be better, too.

293
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,291
I'm glad you all agree.

294
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,666
Perfect. This way,
my research time

295
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,500
won't be taken up by enlessly
fighting off Orphans...

296
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
What's that Midori?

297
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,916
Uh-- [coughs] Nothing.

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,666
Now, we should get to
know each other better

299
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,916
as the new HiME force.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,416
I've already got
a place reserved.

301
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,125
What do you mean?

302
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,541
Ah! What a place!

303
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,416
I finally made it!

304
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,791
[MIKOTO]
Good for you, Mai.

305
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,166
What's with the tears?

306
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,458
C'mon, girls,
let your hair down!

307

Go crazy and
party all night!

308
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,125
You're already setting
a fine example.

One-sixty-one

is serious about this.

We'll spin the roulette
to decide who sings next!

You can change into your
stage costumes back there.

317

Use the roulette?

318
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,833
Stage costumes?

319
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,791
No way! [yelps]
