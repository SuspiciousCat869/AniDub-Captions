And that our mission here
is to fight those monsters.

we were called here.

but there are other
HiME in this school.

in the background,

assembling HiME for some
reason I'm not sure of.

157
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,875
But I would guess that
this has to do with something

158
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,375
other than fighting the Orphans.

more HiME from
coming to this school.

163
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,750
[MAI]
Hmm. Makes sense.

164
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,041
So, are you still hoping
to get rid of us

165
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,416
now that we know each other?

166
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,208
[NATSUKI sighs]

167
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,333
It's too late for
that kinda distraction...

168
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,583
I've gotta keep my eyes open
and see what happens next.

169
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,208
Then I guess I can assume

170
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,583
you're not gonna be
coming after us or anything.

171
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,750
Am I right?

172
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,333
As long as you promise
not to get in my way.

173
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,375
[
Promise.

174
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,000
Right, Mikoto?

175
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,291
[MIKOTO groans]

176
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,000
You can't be picking
fights anymore, okay?

177
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,250
[MIKOTO]
But...

178
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,041
[I'll stop making those
yummy lunches for you.

[MIKOTO wails]

180
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,250
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

181
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,458
'Kay, I won't!

182
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,291
I accept this challenge!

183
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,958
It's a challenge?
Ya think so?

184
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,291
[HARUKA]
Of course!

185
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,541
While that complacent,
delusional Shizuru Fujino

186
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,500
assumes that all's well,
morals are plummeting

187
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,750
and rules are being broken!

188
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,916
Just look at this!

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,958
It seems that they are
blatantly scorting

190
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,250
the Executive Committee!

191
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,875
Don't you mean "scorning"?

192

Yukino!

193
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,375
Shut up!

194
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,416
I'm calling an Executive
Committee assembly!

195
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,458
We're going to catch
this panty thief

196
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,583
and drag him in front
of the student council!

197
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,708
And then, I will show them all!

198
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,250
I will expose the ineptitude
of that bumbling girl

199
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,041
and her senseless boy!

200
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,125
Hey, what does "bumbling"
mean, anyway?

201
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,458
[YUKINO]
One who makes lots of mistakes.

202
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,541
[HARUKA cackles]
That's perfect for Fujino!

203
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,375
[YUKINO]
You didn't know what it meant?

204
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,333
[MAI] Gee, that's too bad,
for you included.

205
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,708
Does this kinda thing
happen a lot at the school?

206

[NATSUKI]
No way. Don't be ridiculous!

207
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,250
It's the first time we've ever
had a panty thief around here.

[MIKOTO groans]

Hmm?

Knock it off, Mikoto!

212
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,625
What're you doing?!

213
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,250
Is that a bra? That thing
underneath your shirt?

214
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,458
Yeah, why?

215
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,750
[MIKOTO] And that's what
everyone's missing?

That's right. And panties, too.

[MAI] C'mon, Mikoto,
you can't be serious!

221
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,541
It wasn't attacking or anything.

222
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,583
That's why I'd forgotten.

223
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,500
Of all the things to forget...

224
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,458

An Orphan...

Huh?

[NATSUKI]
So that's what it was.

227

[growls] I'm gonna make it pay
for what it did to me!

Do you want me to walk you home?

--Oh!
--You've gotta be careful,

Nice talk for someone
in your business.

it's not exactly easy to prove.

so sure about this?

Right, Natsuki...?

Oh, give it a rest!

325
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,625
It's not my problem if
the guy likes to talk to me.

326
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,291
This is only my opinion,

327

and I'm not covering up for him
because he's my classmate.

328
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,541
But I just don't see how Takeda
could do something like that.

329
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,416
And he doesn't strike me
as the type who'd get off

Unfortunately, he
wouldn't cooperate with

investigation.

336

to reveal himself?

from each other

all the same in one way.

we could help out,

He took all the underwear...?

480
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,083
[NATSUKI]
Oh, no, he didn't.

481
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,375
He won't get away!

482
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,083
Duran!

483
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,250
[MAI]
What?!

484
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[gasps]
You idiot!

485
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,583
[groans]
Fine!

486
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,750
I'll do it just
to get my own bra back.

487
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,916
Wake up, Haruka!

488
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,583
[HARUKA groans]
Hey, Yukino?

489
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,375
What on earth happened?

490
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,500
Uh...

491
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,166
[HARUKA screams]

492
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, by the time I looked,
there was nothing left.

493
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,833
Now this is unexpected.

494
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,916
I wonder if Takeda escaped
from the chapel or something.

495
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,833
[HARUKA groans]

496
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,833
This is it, Orphan!

497
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,125
[NATSUKI gasps]

498
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,458
[NATSUKI]
No way!

499
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,750
I don't care how
many of you there are!

500
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,416
[NATSUKI gasps]

501
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,375
Duran!

502
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,666
[NATSUKI]
So this is your true form.

503
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,041
[NATSUKI]
Duran!

504
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,208
[gasps]

505
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,541
[screams]

506
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:12,000
[NATSUKI grunts, groans]

507
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,125
[MAI yells]

508
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,750
Now, Mikoto!

509
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,125
[MIKOTO growls]

510
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,541
[NATSUKI yells]

511
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,041
Nice one, Mikoto!

512
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,791
That's all the help
you're gonna get!

513
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,250
[NATSUKI grunts]

514
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,458
Thanks, you guys...

515
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,333
Duran!

516
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,916
Load Silver Cartridge!

517
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,708
Fire!

518
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,583
[NATSUKI sighs]

519
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,291
[NATSUKI sighs]

520
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,666
[gasps]

521
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,166
Huh? Wait a second,
what is this?

522
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,583
Hey, I can't see anything.

523
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,375
Huh-- [screams]

524
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,416
Look what happened to my bra!

525
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,625
Ah...

526
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,041
Gone...

527
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,958
My whole collection...

528
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,250
This is the worst.

529
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,708
[laughs]

530
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,875
[NATSUKI snarls]

531
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,791
You idiot!

532
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,750
[NATSUKI] This is the
proper way to put on a bra.

533
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,458
First, you put it
over the shoulders.

534
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,875
Once you put
the cups in place,

535
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,666
you pull the breasts
up and together.

536
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,875
Up and together.
Squeeze them in there!

537
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,208
There, isn't that better?

538
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,666
Tsk, tsk. I'm wasting my
time on those puny things.

539
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,750
[MIKOTO groans]
