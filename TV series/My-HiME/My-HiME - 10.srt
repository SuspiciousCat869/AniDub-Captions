Hyah!

328

[AKIRA]
The ultimate technique...

329
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,666
"Hell Pot!"

00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,708
[TAKUMI]
Huh...?

[AKIRA sighs]

00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,083
[TAKUMI]
Akira?

333
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,333
[AKIRA gasps]
No, wait. I'm not Akira Okuzaki.

334
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,875
I am... Yes!

335
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,375
I'm a secret ninja that was
chosen for a special mission;

336
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,166
to protect this school
from dangerous monsters!

337
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,666
You mean you're the one
who's been protecting us

338
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,666
all this time?

339
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,458
[AKIRA]
Huh? Yeah, that's right.

340
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:38,000
Thanks a lot, Akira--
I mean, uh, "Secret Ninja."

341
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,041
[AKIRA]
Yeah, right.

342
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,541
Don't tell anybody about this!

343
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,875
Got that?!

344
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,916
I sure appreciate
your help, Akira.

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,333
[NAGI]
Hmm.

346
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,375
This wasn't part of the plan,
but I guess that's okay.

347
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,916
Things are definitely
livening up here.

348
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,583
[AKIRA groans]
It got me pretty good.

349
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,458
Oh, great. It looks like
they're getting even bigger.

350
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,208
I hope he hasn't realized...

351
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,541
...my secret.

352

[ambulance sirens blare]

357
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,708
[AMBULANCE CREW]
All right, steady, steady.

358
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,458
And, uh, all right.
Slide it back.

359
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,166
All right, just bring him down.

360
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,791
[SHIHO]
Brother! Please don't die on me!

361
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,541
[YUICHI] Then you shouldn't
have tried to kill me!

362
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,625
Gah!

363
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,125
You better be prepared
for the worst.

364
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,333
Remember: you're responsible
for all of this.

365
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,583
Oh...

366
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,000
[chuckles]

367
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,291
What did you guys bake, anyway?

368
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,958
Never mind that.
Just hurry and open up.

369
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,500
I need to shower, big time.

370
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,916
[MAI]
Yeah, yeah...

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,666
Ugh... This had to be one
of the worst days ever...

[GROUP]
Happy birthday, Mai!

375
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,000
Welcome to your surprise party!

376
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,583
[gasps]

377
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,458
[MIKOTO] This...
Awm! ...cake! is the best!

378
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,833
It turned out pretty good.

379
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,708
Akira and I tried super-hard
to do a good job on it.

380
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,291
Right? Didn't we, Akira?

381
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,416
[gasps]

382
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,875
What's the matter, Mai?
You hate the cake, don't you?

383
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,000
[MAI]
Mm-mm...

384
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,375
It's really good. Honestly.

385
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,625
Thank you, Takumi.
And all of you.

386
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,208
You're more than welcome.

387
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,333
You wouldn't tell us
when your birthday was,

388
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,041
and we probably wouldn't
have ever found out

389
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,500
unless your brother
had come and told us.

390
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,875
[MAI]
I just didn't want everyone

391
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,875
to make a big deal out of it.

392
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,833
Don't be so humble all the time.

393
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,458
Yeah, Mai.

394
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,416
Here's something from all of us!

395
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,875
[MAI gasps]
I've always wanted one of these!

396
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,208
Thanks a lot, guys!

397
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,625
How 'bout a little shoulder rub?

398
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,500
Hey! Cut it out, that tickles!

399
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,500
[CHIE laughs]

400
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,041
You're sure sensitive, Mai!

[ALL laugh]

402
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Today is... the greatest ever!

403
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,208
Hey, I've been thinking, Sis.

404
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,208
I know it hasn't
exactly been easy,

405
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,750
but I'm glad we
came to this school.

406
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,083
It was a good move.

407
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,291
[gasps]

408
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,583
Yeah!

409
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,291
[MIYU] Mai Tokiha, Natsuki Kuga,
and Mikoto Minagi.

410
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,041
The three of them are
Valkyries, aren't they?

411
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,250
That's correct.

412
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,083
They've also managed
to defeat our Orphan.

413
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,333
Why don't we eliminate
the three girls, then?

414
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,916
[GREER]
Mm-mm.

415
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,583
No. For the time being, we will
simply monitor their movements.

416
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,583
This makes four. Our top
priority at the moment

417
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,791
is to quickly find the remaining
Valkyries, the HiME,

418
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,041
and research their backgrounds.

419
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,291
I understand, Father.

420
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,416
[MASASHI]
Ah! Oh, no!

421
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,708
[NATSUKI]
Don't you freak out, Takeda!

422
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,166
What's going on?!

423
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,000
[MASASHI] I found a naked
girl--and she's passed out!

424
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,291
[NATSUKI]
What?! Takeda!

425
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,541
What have you done?!

426
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,833
[MASASHI groans]
The passions of youth made me--

427
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,750
No! I didn't do anything!
