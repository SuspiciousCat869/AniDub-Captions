after the attack,
they all had what looked like

for a minute.

Usually, it would be some
kinda creep or a pervert.

That's even scarier,
thinking it was a real person.

[CHIE] Yeah. Maybe that
explains it, though.

Well, it seems that the girls
only lost a little blood.

00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,125
I'm always happy
to cooperate,

162
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,083
and you have my full
support if it'll benefit

163
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,541
our dear students.

164
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,791
[HARUKA]
I appreciate it!

165
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,083
Get moving!

166
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,750
[COMMITTEE]
Right!

167
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,291
[MAI]
Miyu!

168
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,958
What's going on around here?

169
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,000
The Executive Committee has
decided to take over the chapel.

170
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,583
[gasps]
Why? What now?

171
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,250
[HARUKA]
Hey, what's taking so long?!

172
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,875
Get that equipment
set up on the double!

173
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,250
And you, girls!

174
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,000
Get back to your dorms, now!

175
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,166
As of today, there's
a six o'clock curfew

176
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,750
for all dormitory residents.

177
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,125
After six, no one will be
permitted outside,

178
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,208
even on school grounds!

179
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,625
What?! C'mon,
you can't be serious!

180
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,458
I work way past six o'clock!

181
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,750
Not an option!

182
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,375
This is a necessary measure
that we're taking

183
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,166
in order to protect
all of you students!

184
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,333
[MAI]
But...

185
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,541
If you have a problem
with our decision,

186
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,500
I can send you inside
to do penance!

187
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,750
[MAI growls]

188
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,458
[MAI] Nagi! Where are you?
I know you're in here!

189
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,500
[NAGI]
Over here!

190
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,708
[MAI gasps]

191
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,791
[NAGI] I'm impressed
you found this place!

192
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
Natsuki told me
about it once before.

193
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,375
But never mind that.

194
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
What's the deal
with this vampire?!

195
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,000
Probably another Orphan, right?

196
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,958
Oh, that thing?
Well, it's good timing.

197
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,500
'Cause I have a
favor to ask you, Mai.

198
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,708
Yeah, yeah, you want me
to destroy it.

199
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:50,000
Urr! Wrong answer!
Actually, it's the opposite.

200
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,875
Huh?

201
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,666
For HiME? You mean
they're looking for us?

202
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,166
The mark you all have on
your bodies is the easiest way

203
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,416
to tell that you're a HiME.

204
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
They're simply trying to
identify which ones HiME

205
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,250
by chasing down all the girls.

206
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,833
The blood, they're
probably using

207
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,333
for some kinda
genetic testing.

208
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,750
[MAI]
Why would they be doing that?

209
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,125
Who knows?

210
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,208
Now, Mai, I don't wanna hear
that you've gone looking

211
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,583
for a fight, or gotten yourself
caught up in something

212
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,000
you can't handle, all right?

213
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,250
[gasps]

214
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,333
I've been a little worried
about you lately,

215
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,958
seeing as how you've gotten
used to your power.

216
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,375
[MAI]
Get a grip, Nagi.

217
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,666
Why would I do
something like that?

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,875
Well, good, that's what
I wanted to hear.

219
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,708
The powers you and the others
possess are primarily

220
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,500
for your own benefit, after all.

221
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,583
[MAI groans]

222
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,416
All units are in
place now, Haruka.

223
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,000
[HARUKA]
Good.

224
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,458
All right, vampire or pervert,
come on out whenever you want!

225
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,458
Now let us commence

226
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,958
and carry out our mission to
usher in the next Golden Age.

227
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,041
There's nothing wrong with using
our power any way we want to.

228
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,708
[MIDORI]
The good always triumph!

229
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,708
I'll get them. I'll do whatever
it takes to bring them down.

230
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,750
[MIKOTO]
Wow!

231
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,041
This looks super yummy!

232
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,833
[MIKOTO]
I need to find my brother,

233
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,958
and I'll fight anyone
who gets in my way.

234
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,208
End of story.

235
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,958
Mai, can you make this please?!

236
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,791
[MAI sighs]

237
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,291
[MIKOTO giggles]

238
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,333
So will you make it for me?

239
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,833
Tell you what, Mikoto.

240
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,375
What do you say we go out and
do something fun tomorrow?

241
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,833
[MIKOTO gasps]
Really?!

242
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,458
C'mon, Akira, how 'bout it?

243
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll do whatever I can to help,
so how about doing

244
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,625
that secret ninja thing
to protect the school?

245
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,958
All right! All right!

246
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,208
I'll go outside and do
a little patrol, okay?

247
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,375
Let me come with you!

248
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,958
No, you just stay
put here in the dorm.

249
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,291
If you collapse or something,
your sister will kill me.

250
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,791
Hey! Ah! Aw...

251
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,958
Shiho, we're not supposed to be
out here this late, you know?

252
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,458
But I can't do my homework
without my notebook.

253
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,208
Besides, you can beat up
any perverts we come across!

254
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,500
[grunts]

255
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,208
Maybe, maybe not.
What if it's a real monster?

256
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,000
[SHIHO giggles]

257
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,291
What? You really believe that?
There's no such thing, goofball.

258
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
I hope you're right.

259
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,708
Ah...

260
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,333
[SHIHO giggles]

261
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,125
Wah!

262
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,041
I'm a vampire!

263

[YUICHI whimpers]

264
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,500
[SHIHO]
Come on. What's the matter?

265
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,000
I was just joking around.

266
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:54,750
[YUICHI whimpers]

267
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,791
[SHIHO]
Hmm?

268
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
[screams]

269
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,250
[YUICHI whimpers]

270
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,958
[MIKOTO laughs]

271
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,958
Where do you think we
should go first, Mai?!

272
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,041
Yeah, good question.

273
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,708
[AOI]
Ohh! I'm gonna miss the train!

274
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,583
'Morning, Mai.

275
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,833
Good morning.

276
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,750
You're going out for the day?

277
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,541
[AOI]
Mm-hmm. To a concert.

278
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,125
Where's Nao at?

279
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,750
[AOI] She spent the night out.
Breaking the rules, as usual.

280
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,083
Oh. I'm gonna be
back late. See ya!

281
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,875
But it's dangerous
around here after dark.

282
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,250
[AOI]
Don't worry!

283
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,125
Besides, I heard that
nothing happened last night.

284
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,875
[MIKOTO whines]
C'mon, Mai, let's get going!

285
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,375
Okay.

286
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,791
[HARUKA]
So?

287
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,750
This is the only person
you caught, then?

288
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,916
Don't get your panties
in a knot just because

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,250
I was out all night.
I'm not a kid, you know.

290
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,083
[HARUKA growls]

291
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,250
How rude.

292
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,708
Maybe we should teach her
a thing or two

293
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,333
about proper manners
before we let her go.

294
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,833
Sister, she's all yours--
let her have it.

295
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,541
Oh, um. Uh... Listen, Nao.

296
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,875
I'm not certain, but perhaps
you'd rather discuss things

297
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,500
in private, so let's
talk over there?

298
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,166
The confessional...

299
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,625
Fine by me.

300
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,375
I'll give you a nice,
long confession, Sister.

Please, stop!

I'm not even
half way through yet.

304
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,125
I don't want to hear
any more of it!

305
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,750
It's so disgusting!

306
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,625
Huh. You sure have some nerve,
trying to lecture me,

307
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,291
when you can't even listen to
a tame little story like that.

[ISHIGAMI chuckles]

311
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,958
That's quite a spot
she put you in.

312
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't laugh. It's not funny.

313
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,291
I feel like I'm losing
my confidence

314
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,833
when it comes to guiding
these young girls.

315

[ISHIGAMI]
Hmm...

316
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,875
Then how 'bout immersing
yourself in the secular world

317
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,291
for a change? I'm certain
you'd find it refreshing.
