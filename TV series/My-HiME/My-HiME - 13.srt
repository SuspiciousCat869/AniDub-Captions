Hey, how did it go with Mamoru?

00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,250
[GIRL B] Nothing really
happened this summer, either.

[STUDENTS chatting]

00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,125
[MIDORI]
Why didn't you just call me?

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,791
[MAI]
I did call. Lots of times.

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,208
[sighs] I needed you, but you
weren't answering your cell.

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,291
We were in serious
trouble, you know.

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,875
What a shocker though...

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,083
Finding out about Miyu.

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,791
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm! She was strong.

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,833
Real strong.
What was she?

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,416
An android?

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,041
Robot. Cyborg.

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,583
Whatever you call her, she
is not a regular human being.

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,583
An andro-bo-borg?

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,708
Android.

17
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,583
This is like a bad joke.

18
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,916
So a girl who controls
Orphans, an android,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,958
a mysterious organization
that's going after HiME...

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,750
Ah! This is getting exciting!

21
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,791
We sat through the previews
and now the main attraction's

about to start!

23
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,458
Except... Miyu and
Alyssa are gone.

24
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,791
They're not here.

25
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,041
I've heard things about
the Searrs Foundation.

26
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,791
It seems they've been looking
into the power of HiME

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,791
for quite some time now.

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,791
I doubt that they'd
give up so easily.

29
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,291
We'd better be very careful.

30
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,208
[MIDORI]
It's almost time for homeroom.

31
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,791
And remember, it's the first day
of second trimester,

32
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,833

[NATSUKI]
It's me. Right.

35
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,041
What did you say?!

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,541
[MIDORI] There's me,
Mai, Mikoto, Kuga, Nao,

37
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,916
Sister Yukariko,
and the mysterious "Diana"

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,708
who told you guys about Kuga.

39
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,708
And there's the girl with the
frog monster that saved Tate.

40
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,583
So that's eight of us.

41
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,166
There must be another four.

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,000
What do you mean?

43
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,666
There're 12 HiME in all,
so that leaves four.

44
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,041
[MIDORI] Then there's
the Golden Angel...

45
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,833
Maybe it's weird
to call her that now.

46
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,000
If she's a HiME as well,

47
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,041
then there're only
three left to find.

[MAI]
Hey...

50
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,791
Hey, in your opinion,
what is a HiME?

51
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,375
Good question-- that's
what I'm working on.

52
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,083
HiME powers...

53
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,791
...and the religious
rituals here at Fuka...

54
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,791
How they relate to
the Battle Princesses.

55
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,791
Religious rituals?

56
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,458
That rock painting
at the shrine,

57
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,666
you saw it, right?

58
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,416
[MIDORI] I'm positive
that rites involving HiME

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,625
have been taking place here
every few hundred years or so.

talk about what happened?

Absolutely not.

00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,416
What you saw was just
an illusion, right?

Besides, I didn't see anything.

Well, I did!

between you and Tate?

Hardly.

Huh. Anyway, I'll look into
the whole HiME thing,

so leave that to me.

I'll be going to the Fuka Shrine
during the Tamayura Festival

The Tamayura Festival is
pretty famous in these parts.

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,166
Most of the action is centered
around the Fuka Shrine...

...but this is a
popular spot as well.

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,083
[squeals]
I'm so embarassed!

164
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,166
Such a pervert!

165
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,250
[NATSUKI] So you didn't have
any luck digging up those files.

166
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,583
[YAMADA] No, I was only able
to hack into the directory.

167
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,625
Except... Get this...

168
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,125
Under Fuka Academy,

169
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,458
I happened to see a file
for Akane Higurashi.

170
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,833
Her?

171
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,541
Why would she have one?

172
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,333
[MAI grunts]

173
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,458
All right!

174
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,875
[MIKOTO grunts]

175
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,666
[MAI] I've gotta focus on what's
most important to me,

176
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,000
and that's Takumi.

177
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
I've got way too many
complications in my life,

178
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,833
and being a HiME doesn't
make things any easier.

179
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,208
That's enough!

180
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,291
I don't have time to be
distracted by anything else,

181
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,500
so I won't!

182
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,791
Huh...?

183
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,541
[TAKUMI] Akira's always
taking care of me,

184
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,375
so I promised him that I'd
make his lunches from now on.

185
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,291
Thanks, Sis,
but starting tomorrow...

186
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,458
I tried to turn him down,
but he wouldn't let me.

187
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,958
Problem solved: I'll make
your lunch, too, Akira!

188
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,750
[TAKUMI]
No, don't.

189
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,333
I can handle it.

190
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:44,000
Anyway, you gotta know I can't
be a burden on you forever.

191
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,625
Oh, uh... Yeah, sure...

192
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,333
Okay.

193
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,125
[AKIRA] I know you said
you'd make my lunches

194
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,208
in exchange for me doing
the patrol rounds

195
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,041
during that
vampire thing, but...

196
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,666
I dunno.
Are you sure about this?

197
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,958
I saw your sister.

198
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,333
She seemed totally
shocked, you know.

199
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,166
Yeah... But I've been thinking.

200
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,000
I rely on my sister
way too much.

201
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,166
I've gotta start
looking after myself,

202
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,041
even if it's just
the little things.

203
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,500
[AKIRA]
Hmm.

204
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,166
[grunts]
All right! Well said, Takumi!

205
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,625
Now you're starting
to sound like a man!

206
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,875
What do you say?

207
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,875
Will you go to the
festival with me, Mai?

208
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,083
[MAI]
Mm... Well, I...

209
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,541
[MAI]
Sorry!

210
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,666
Huh?

211
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,541
[MAI] It took me a lot longer
to get ready than I thought.

212
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,625
It looks good on you.

213
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,875
Great, even.

214
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:44,958
[gasps]

215
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,583
Mikoto, you're here.

216
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,916
[MIKOTO]
Mm-hmm!

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,791
[CHIE] So she's stuck
with a tag along, huh?

218
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,375
Trust Mikoto to get in the way.

219
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:58,083
Wow, Reito looks
so good in his <i>yukata</i> .

220
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,541
What a waste. They might
as well be babysitting.

221
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,125
Yeah, I kinda see what you mean.

222
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,708
What was the point in me
coming all the way here

223
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,583
if I can't see them together?

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,083
[CHIE] I know. Whaddaya
say we stir things up?

[SHIHO]
Mom and Dad aren't around today.

227
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,750
You can do it, Shiho!

228
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,166
You look great!

229
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,750
This is it.

230
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,750
I'm really serious
about tonight.

231

Let's go there!

232
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,333
Not now.

233
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,333
Wait till we get to school.

for one minute and she's gone.

Gimme a break.

First you force me to come out,
and then you show up late?!

Le... L-L... Le-Let's get going.

252
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,416

[MIDORI]
My name is Midori Sugiura.

255
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,125
I teach Japanese history
at Fuka Academy.

256
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,916
You don't say...

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,875
Haven't we met somewhere before?

258
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,791
[MIDORI]
Mm! Nah...

259
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,000
Doubt it.

260
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,208
You wanna get to the
fourth floor, underground.

261
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,208
That's likely where it is.

262
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,333
[NATSUKI]
Hmm.

263
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,208
[NATSUKI grunts]

264
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,125
So, Mai. Anywhere
you'd like to go next?

265
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,250
Just name it.

266
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,333
I dunno...

267
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,166
[REITO]
I didn't invite Takumi's sister

268
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,250
or Mikoto's guardian on a date.

269
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,166
I came here with
a very cute girl

270
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,583
who's two years younger than me.

271

[MAI]
Uh... Huh?

272
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,958
So, tell me what
you'd like to do.

273
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,875
Otherwise, I'll end up
looking pretty silly.

274
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,500
I was the one who asked you out.

275
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,208
And not too timidly, either.

276
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,583
Okay, Reito...

277
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,416
[TAKUMI groans]

278
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,208
Aw...

279
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,291
You're hopeless.

280
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,583
Gimme those things!

281
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,875
[TAKUMI] Cool! The secret
ninja does it again!

282
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,791
Hey! You making fun of me?!

283
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,291
Nah, I'd never do that!

284
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,000
[BOTH laughing]

285
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,708
Hey, we've gotta go and find
ourselves some fun, too.

286
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,791
Right!

287
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,000
[NAGI] There's not much time
left until contact.

288
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,250
You go, Mai.

289
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,750
Have fun while you can.

290
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,500
[MASHIRO]
It's been a while.

291
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,416
[JIN]
Well, how about that.

292
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,958
[MIDORI]
Headmaster! You're here!

293
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,375
Miss Sugiura. Nice to see you.

294
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,083
Mr. Munakata.

295
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,333
I'm looking forward to making
the rounds again this year.

296
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,166
Take your time and
enjoy yourself.

297
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
[JIN]
She comes every year.

298
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
[MIDORI]
Huh.

299
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, right. You were asking about
the history of this event.

300
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,625
The Tamayura Festival is
based on the legend

301
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,708
of the Battle Princesses.
It's well known in this region.

302
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,458
These maidens fought hard
to protect the ones they loved,

303
00:14:55,541 --> 00:15:00,500
but their lives were fleeting,
as they all died in battle.

304
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,958
[JIN] They say that the
tradition of tying ribbons

305
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,166
to the Crystal Hall railing at
the school comes from a story

306
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,791
of how the maidens tied their
headbands onto a tree

307
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,708
that once grew in that spot.

308
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,791
[JIN] This was their
prayer before going into

309
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,291
that final battle that
they would once again

310
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,166
be reunited with
the men they loved.

311
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,541
[SHIHO]
Make my wish come true.

312
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,541
For me and Brother
to be together.

313
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,125
Aren't you going
to tie one, Haruka?

314
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,833
Now why would I want to
create more work for myself?

315
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,875
Ah?

316
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,041
[sighs]
I-I-I guess you're right...

317
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,000
[HARUKA] They're so
shameless about it, too.

318
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,541
Do you think that's for Kuga?

319
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,875
Well, if that's not deffective,
I don't know what would be.

320
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,375
It's "effective."

Okay. I kinda think you're
missing the point, though.

Your "like" isn't the same
as everyone else's.

You haven't changed much

I'm sorry.

I got carried away and

[REITO]
It's not a problem.

The only thing

is that you have a good time.

So don't apologize.

You... seemed a bit down lately.

No, it's nothing like that.

I'm actually pretty happy.

it's all over now, right?

Yeah, that's over.

But I'm almost positive
something like it

[REITO] You're always
watching out for Takumi

and you're constantly
worried about your powers.

You take on all
this responsibility,

all means nothing to you.

then just admit it.
