1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,166
The radius of this artificial
island is just over 3 miles.

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,916
We plan on constructing an
amusement park with a dome

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,458
from about two levels below
the sea to eight levels above.

26
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,125
What's that?

27
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,708
Red tide.

28
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,625
It's the remains of plankton.
There's no need to worry though,

29
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,541
the development plans
took this into account.

30
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,000
It's completely harmless.

31
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,708
Of course I have
nothing to worry about.

32
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,958
Huh?

33
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,083
It's your asses on the
line here, not mine...

34
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,458
If anything happens,
you're responsible.

35
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,791
If you value your jobs,
you'll see to it

36
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,250
this opening goes
without a hitch.

37
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,833
♪ The ocean green is crying. ♪

38
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:38,458
♪ And the sky of
blue is sobbing. ♪

39
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,000
♪ The future of-- ♪

40
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,416
Damn hippies.

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,333
Why should you even
bother worrying about

42
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,250
a future where you
won't even exist?

43
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,791
It's been years since
the previous Governor

44
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,208
broke ground on this project,
or I should say "broke sea"?

45
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,916
After overcoming numerous
obstacles, I'm very proud

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,250
to announce the completion
of Tokyo Fortune Island.

47
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:05,916
And now, the doors to a
Utopian dream will finally open.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,666
Five! Four! Three!

49
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,000
Two! One!

50
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,625
Damn... lot of fine
ladies out there.

51
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,541
Or haven't you noticed?

52
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,833
Uh, yeah.

53
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,250
Come on... What's your deal?

54
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,833
It's just not my thing.

55
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,416
Check it out!

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,916
This place is great.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,083
Sure is.

58
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,500
Hey boys. Are you two
having a good time?

59
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,583
It's nice to see you
getting along so well.

60
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,125
Uhh... Hi Sei!

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,791
Looks like you barely fit
into that suit, Leo.

62
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,458
Yes, I'm aware...

63
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,083
It's been awhile since
I've gone swimming.

64
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,625
Y'know, I've been thinking.

65
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,375
You and I should get together
and have some adult time,

66
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,458
if you catch my drift.

67
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,291
I just might take you
up on that sometime.

68
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,583
Leo...! Heads up!

69
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,750
Meg!

70
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,416
What...? I warned him.

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,875
It's not my fault
he didn't move.

72
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,250
Come on, Leo. Get up.
Want a chance at revenge?

73
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,125
I wouldn't be a man if I
backed down from that...

74
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,458
Let's go, Kyo.

75
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,250
Here comes the power serve!

76
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,041
Where are you aiming?
That wasn't even close.

77
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,208
What...? You're not
gonna play with them?

78
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,875
Hey! Over here!

79
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,041
I think I'll sit this one out.

80
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,125
How's everything going?

81
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,500
Swimmingly, if you
pardon the pun.

82
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,958
The bigwigs keep blabbing
to the press about the

83
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,208
state-of-the-art gaming machines
and the automated food court.

84
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,708
But the real masterpiece of
innovation has got to be this:

85
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,375
our Super-EM electric plant,

86
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,250
which harnesses ocean water
to power the whole island.

87
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,708
Once the public catches on,

88
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,666
they'll never want to go to
a real beach resort again.

89
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,625
What a gorgeous day.

90
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,416
What are you doing Amy?

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,291
I'm digging for some
insider dirt on this place.

92
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,541
You know you should be
having fun with the other kids

93
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,541
instead of playing
around on your laptop.

94
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,416
What do you know...?

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,541
This just happens to be my most
favorite thing in the world!

96
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,541
Suit yourself.

97
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,666
Oh, and speaking of suits...

98
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,833
That one you're
wearing is so lame.

99
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,541
You really think so?

100
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,375
Totally. It's not cute at all.

101
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,458
Oh.

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,708
Well, I have to disagree.

103
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,708
I think... that suit looks
incredible on you... Right?

104
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,041
Most definitely...

105
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,333
You wouldn't happen to
be a model, would you?

106
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,708
Or maybe an actress?

107
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,916
Now that you mention it,

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,166
I think I have seen
you somewhere before.

109
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,958
Like on a magazine cover.

110
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,125
Are you boys trying
to flatter me...?

111
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,625
Because I like it.

112
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,875
If you're not an actress,

113
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,083
then you could totally
be one if you wanted.

114
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,625
Yeah, you must be
someone important

115
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,000
to be invited here today.

116
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,875
This Grand Opening has a
super exclusive guest list.

117
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,708
Ugh. You guys're so
outta your league.

118
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,458
Oh! You must be
her little sister.

119
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,125
I love your sunglasses.
You look so cute in them.

120
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,583
Bet you're in
grade school, right?

121
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,958
You want me to check
your homework for you?

122
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,291
Moron.

123
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,208
Whoa... What happened to Kyohei?

124
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,583
The game got a little bit
rough and he passed out.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,875
You see his face?

126
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,958
Yeah.

127
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,583
Hello. Sei here.

128
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,708
Hey. It's been awhile...

129
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,416
Yeah, we'll take the job.

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,666
So you've got half a
dozen gangs in a turf war

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,041
and you want us to
take out the whole lot?

132
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,958
South Point
Shopping Mall? Got it.

133
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,333
I'll send my best girl
to take care of it.

134
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,916
It'll take half a day at
the most. Talk to you then.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,541
Jo, we got a job.

136
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,958
Ready to go whenever you are.

137
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,083
Not yet... You'll
act as a bodyguard

138
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,625
for the city's vigilante
corps tomorrow morning...

139
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,041
You can relax for
the rest of the day.

140
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,416
I should get some info
on those three losers

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,791
from the invitation list
and mess around with 'em.

142
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,458
No, you should put
your computer away

143
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,541
and go play with the other kids.

144
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,458
Aww, come on!

145
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,166
Kyohei. You should
go play with Amy.

146
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

147
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,666
Yahoo!

148
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,625
Yay!

149
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,750
This rules!

150
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,541
Scared? You should be!
I am unstoppable!

151
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,333
It's Leo time!

152
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,625
What the hell... You're
a grown man, not a child.

153
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,833
Don't you have any common sense?

154
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,916
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

155
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,583
You guys wear me out.

156
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,625
Here you go.

157
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,250
Oh, Sei.

158
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,125
It's nice and cold... Drink up!

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Thanks, you didn't
have to do that.

160
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,208
Oh, before I forget, Kyo,
I have a favor to ask of you.

161
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,750
Huh?

162
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,375
My grandfather's friends are
having a party tomorrow night

163
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,625
and they're... picky
eaters, so I was hoping

164
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,708
I could borrow your
culinary expertise.

165
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,583
I'd be happy to help...

166
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,500
So, what should I
have on the menu?

167
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:46,416
That special dessert of yours,
for a thousand people.

168
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,375
A thousand?

169
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,250
I don't know, that's a little--

170
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,791
Great! I'm counting on you.

171
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,000
But, w-wait!

172
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,750
Good luck with that sport.

173
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,791
You're young.
Just pull an all-nighter.

174
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,125
Oo! I want to have
some dessert, too!

175
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,166
Yeah, me three. Dessert's
my favorite meal of the day!

176
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,666
Isn't that great, Kyohei?

177
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,416
No. There's nothing
great about it.

178
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,708
Sorry. I was just
messing with you.

179
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,750
Sei...

180
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,458
That's right. The noise
isn't coming from the motor.

181
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,375
It must be something else.

182
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,791
No, I don't think
that'll be necessary...

183
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,208
It's probably just the machines

184
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,458
not being used to
these conditions.

185
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,791
No prob. I'll go ahead and
put it on the top of the list.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,916
Must be hearing things.

187
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,833
I've been looking
all over for you...

188
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,833
Hm?

189
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,916
Feels nice and cold, doesn't it?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,916
Yeah, a little.

191
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,833
You're so weird sometimes.

192
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,166
You know you haven't changed one
bit since the first time we met.

193
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,750
Ever since I came
to this country,

194
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,291
so many different things
have surprised me...

195
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,000
Never thought I'd
make it this far.

196
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,625
In fact, being here like this
almost seems like a lie.

197
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,750
I wish everyday
were like this one.

198
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,125
Oh yeah?

199
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,958
Say, Jo...

200
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,041
I...

201
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,750
Sometimes I wonder what you
were like before we met...

202
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,833
If I had to guess,

203
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:46,125
I would think you were
probably fighting every day...

204
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,333
But, whether you're working
or not, you always seem to be

205
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,125
fighting in some
way or another...

206
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:59,125
It's like you're just not
interested in anything else...

207
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,333
But I suppose that's
not a bad thing!

208
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,666
I fight for you, Meg.

209
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,500
Really?

210
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,833
Yeah. You saved
my life after all.

211
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,833
Really...? You mean that?

212
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,541
Yeah, I do.

213
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,000
Jo...

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,166
I'm happy...

215
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,291
I'm very happy to have met you.

216
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,125
Hah! I'm in!

217
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,625
Wow, this place is huge!

218
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,458
Jo. What are you
doing down there?

219
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,708
I can hear it.

220
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,583
I don't understand.
You can hear what?

221
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
What is this?

222
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,041
Your attention please.

223
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,375
We will now be resetting

224
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,375
all of the facilities here
at Tokyo Fortune Island.

225
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,375
We are terribly sorry
for the inconvenience...

226
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,083
Meg. Let's go.

227
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,833
What?

228
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,875
Please gather your
belongings and make your way

229
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,416
to the park's exit in
an orderly fashion.

230
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,250
Shuttle buses will be
waiting there to drive you

231
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,625
back to the mainland
and to your vehicles.

232
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,083
For security reasons,
we ask that you help us

233
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,166
avoid any possible dangers
by refraining from smoking.

234
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,208
No smoking?

235
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,875
This must be the reason.

236
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,708
That looks nasty, ugh.

237
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,250
No one's talking,

238
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,833
but it looks like there was
an oil tanker accident nearby.

239
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, okay. So that's
why we can't smoke.

240
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,958
Try lightin' up a butt here,
and one stray spark

241
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,125
could turn the place
into a blazing inferno.

242
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,125
Seriously?!

243
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,000
"Any possible dangers?"
If they know there's trouble,

244
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,500
they should just say so!

245
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,208
The truth would only cause
unnecessary panic, Meg...

246
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,625
C'mon... We should
get moving too.

247
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,666
The oil fence is 60% complete.
However, the flow rate

248
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,958
is accelerating faster
than anticipated.

249
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,000
The shuttle buses have arrived.
Commence evacuation.

250
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,208
What the?!

251
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,916
Everyone please line
up single file here.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,250
Remember to keep hold of
your children at all times.

253
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,875
You guys need to
learn to chill out

254
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,375
and enjoy yourselves sometimes.

255
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,625
You got a point but how can we,
when all the chicks are gone?

256
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,791
Look dude, I had to work
for my dad for a whole month

257
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,875
so he'd use his
connections to get us in.

258
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,583
You could show a
little gratitude...

259
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,416
Whoa, dudes, check that out!

260
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,333
Please tell me it's a couple
of hot, young mermaids

261
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,000
looking to party.

262
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,500
Whoa! Mermaids?

263
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,708
What?

264
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,708
Crap!

265
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,875
No way!

266
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,458
This can't be good.

267
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,916
Yeah, and the trailer's on
the other side of the bay.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
With these flames
as high as they are,

269
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,291
there's no way we can get to it.

270
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,666
What's gonna happen?

271
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,791
I dunno. Probably nothing.

272
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,166
I don't get you people!

273
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,208
How can you be so calm
at a time like this?

274
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,291
Let's get to the roof for now

275
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,416
and hope a rescue team
comes to get us.

276
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,541
Good idea. Let's hurry.

277
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,625
We're in luck!
Everyone get to the chopper!

278
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,541
What, so you're
a pilot now, too?

279
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,041
Heh. Yeah!

280
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,166
What the hell?!

281
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,166
Ah, shit...! Not the chopper!

282
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,000
What...

283
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,250
...is that?

284
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,833
I think it's an octopus.
You saw its tentacles.

285
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,125
Or a gigantic squid.

286
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,625
It's a damn tentacle beast.

287
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,750
What do you mean a few
people were left behind?

288
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,000
That's what the shuttle
bus driver reported.

289
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,208
I'm afraid it's hopeless
to attempt a rescue

290
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,625
in that flaming ocean.

291
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,791
Understood... but
the real problem is in

292
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,708
whom to blame for this...
gross negligence.

293
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,125
I seem to recall an
environmental preservation group

294
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,375
who opposed this project.

295
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,916
Pin it on them... Got it?

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,291
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,125
Gather all of the
evidence we'll need

298
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,416
and release it at tonight's
press conference.

299
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,166
I'm counting on you.

300
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,333
Let me go!

301
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,708
Sei!

302
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,958
Sorry for being so heavy.

303
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,916
We got ourselves one
slimy situation...

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
This is no time for
stupid jokes, Leo!

305
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,625
How are we gonna
get off this island?

306
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,000
You probably made it angry

307
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,750
when you ate its parents
for dinner the other night!

308
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,916
Shut up, Amy! That
doesn't even make any sense!

309
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,833
Hey boys.

310
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,458
Why didn't you get on the bus?

311
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,958
We--We were just
sneaking around...

312
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:27,875
And...

313
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,375
I was smoking a cigarette...

314
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,500
Then the whole place
just went up in flames!

315
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,750
Ah ha. So you're the ones
that started the fire.

316
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,125
Yeah? Well, this
wouldn't have happened

317
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,541
if we had just left
with everyone else!

318
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,375
Shut up, assface! Don't try
to blame all this on me!

319
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,041
I didn't force you
to stay behind.

320
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,666
But you were--

321
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
Shut your traps.

322
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,333
I'm sorry!
Please don't shoot me!

323
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,333
Gimme that.

324
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,666
What are you
planning on doing, Jo?

325
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,958
Amy. Be ready to go as
soon as I get in the air.

326
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,916
Ready for what?

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,041
We're gonna kill that
damn tentacle beast.

328
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,916
She's so cool!

329
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,375
Jo!

330
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,833
Jo!

331
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,375
Oh, no, no!

332
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,250
She let herself
get thrown on purpose.

333
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,791
What for?

334
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,125
What for...?

335
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
Because she needed a way
to get past the flames...

336
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,708
Damn, she can be
reckless sometimes.

337
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,333
Amy. Get on your laptop

338
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,541
and open the trailer's
hanger for Jo.

339
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,750
Oh okay. Now I see what
Jo was talking about!

340
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,666
Someone might want
to fill in Meg.

341
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,208
I don't think she gets it.

342
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,333
I think the oil has
seeped into the building.

343
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,541
This whole place
is going up soon.

344
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,625
No, please make it stop!
I don't want to die a virgin!

345
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,458
Someone save us!

346
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,666
Knock it off you twerps!

347
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,083
You're whining like
a bunch of little girls!

348
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,000
Ah, there she is!

349
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't believe it! Jo's alive!

350
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,625
--You made it!
--She's alive!

351
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,291
You guys okay?

352
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,166
The bastard's regenerating.

353
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,958
What the...?

354
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,958
I can't see a thing!

355
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,541
Gross!

356
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,291
Uh...! He's covered in oil!

357
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,583
I can't believe this, I just
waxed him the other day.

358
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,666
Sorry Leo, couldn't avoid it.

359
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,541
You can at least
help me re-wax him.

360
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,916
Come on you two.

361
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,625
What matters is that
we're safe now.

362
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,750
But my poor Jango!

363
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,500
Looks like you need
a waxing too, Leo.

364
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,916
Thankfully, those
that we couldn't save

365
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,791
before the fire erupted
managed to escape unharmed.

366
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,291
While we are
currently investigating

367
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,708
the exact cause of this
horrible accident,

368
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,166
we have received
word that the ONPOT,

369
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,875
the Organization for the
Nature Preservation of Tokyo,

370
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
were directly involved.

371
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,666
If these accusations
are found to be true,

372
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,291
then the ONPOT is guilty of
multiple terrorist acts,

373
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,833
and I assure you all,
we will prosecute them

374
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,583
to the fullest
extent of the law.

375
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,541
You should just be thankful

376
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,666
you weren't seriously
injured, or worse!

377
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,208
No kidding!

378
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,625
That's what happens

379
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,875
when you decide to go
somewhere fun without us.

380
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,375
Squid! Not squid!

381
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,458
What's wrong, Kyo?

382
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,083
Oh man. Get a grip!

383
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,916
I hate squid.

384
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't know why I can't move

385
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,875
My mind is lost in this cloud

386
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:29,250
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

387
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:36,875
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

388
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:42,166
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

389
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,333
and smile with each other

390
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,625
It hurts inside
when we don't...

391
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,250
we don't... we don't
know what to say

392
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:58,000
I only hope that
someone will be there,

393
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:02,083
and be watching over me

394
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,083
so take my hand,

395
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:12,875
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

396
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,666
An unknown enemy hiding
in the darkness.

397
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,208
A battle that's not quite
nightmare or illusion.

398
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,208
And Jo is drawn
into another world.

399
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:44,208
Next Burst Angel:
The Man With No Name.
