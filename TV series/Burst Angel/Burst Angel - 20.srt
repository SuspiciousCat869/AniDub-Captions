1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,833
Why are you doing this?

24
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,500
Please just leave me alone!

25
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,625
Jackass shoulda
stayed outta our way!

26
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,708
Attention motorcyclists:
It has been determined you are

27
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:44,000
in violation of RAPT Traffic
Regulations, Articles 5 and 8.

28
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,708
You are hereby advised
to stop immediately

29
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,208
and surrender yourselves
to the authorities.

30
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,208
Like that'll happen.

31
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,666
This is your final warning.

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,833
Any further violations will
result in summary execution.

33
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,833
You have 20 seconds to comply.

34
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,125
Whatta you gonna do about it?

35
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,375
Just try and stop us.

36
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:09,750
Judgement issued: All verbal
warnings have been ignored.

37
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,416
Initiating Summary
Execution mode.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
What the frig?

39
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,125
He's fast.

40
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,666
Execute.

41
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,791
Execute.

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,083
This can't be real!

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,666
What--What kind of cop are you?!

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,875
Someone help!

45
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,416
Suspect has ignored
all verbal warnings

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,208
and has interfered with
official RAPT duties.

47
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,541
Suspect forfeit's his
right to an attorney

48
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,916
and an official hearing.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,375
Judgement:

50
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,041
Execution.

51
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:10,000
Execution complete. Removing
Mega-Highway lockdown.

52
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,958
In regards to our
recent field tests

53
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,916
of the new mega-highway patrol
vehicle, we have been met with

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,333
overwhelming gratitude
from Tokyo's residents.

55
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,250
With this new project, RAPT
continues its devotion

56
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,833
to the people of this city
in our continuing effort

57
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:32,083
to maintain order and improve
the quality of life in Tokyo.

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,541
It's so weird looking,
like a praying mantis.

59
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,875
Kinda...! But the specs are
more amazing than that, Meg.

60
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,958
Its high-speed
combat configuration

61
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,750
is just as good as
Jango's, if not better.

62
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,166
We currently have one
prototype deployed...

63
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,791
If mass-produced,
emergency dispatches would be

64
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,458
available across the city
twenty-four hours a day.

65
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,791
That would be ideal.

66
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:15,000
As the population grows so
does the number of vermin.

67
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,875
From now on people won't
choose their cities...

68
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,333
The cities will
choose their people.

69
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,375
Thanks again for the ride,
I owe you one...

70
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:34,166
I reckon it's about time I got
back home to Osaka, anyway.

71
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,333
It's quite a surprise,
seeing you...

72
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,458
I never thought I'd run
into you here in Tokyo.

73
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,125
Talk about surprises.

74
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,416
You're the one who's
married now, Mika.

75
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,958
We all gotta settle
down sooner or later...

76
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,500
Isn't that right, Tatsuya?

77
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,708
That's right.

78
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,000
Best watch out for those
lovers' quarrels...

79
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,208
Mika gets mad enough,

80
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,416
she'll shove a knitting
needle up your nose!

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
She'll do what?!

82
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,083
Now that's mean, Boss.

83
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,125
Aahhh! I'm sorry,
me and my big mouth!

84
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,333
You know I didn't mean it!

85
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,916
[TEXT]
"TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS"

86

[TEXT]
"RECKLESS DRIVING"

87
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,250
You stupid pigs don't scare me!

88
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,416
You stupid pigs don't scare me!

89
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,166
You are interfering with
RAPT business and have

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,125
ignored all verbal warnings
to cease and desist...

91
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,791
You will now be removed
from the premises by force.

92
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,208
Disperse!

93
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,083
Disperse!

94
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,583
Damn you, bastards!

95
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,000
What the hell is that...?

96
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,166
All right Tatsuya,
just drive casual...

97
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,416
We don't want any
trouble from that thing!

98
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,000
I see it.

99
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,666
Oh man... This can't be good.

100
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,125
All right you two...
Listen up...

101
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,916
You're gonna have to jump!

102
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,583
C'mon, Boss! Jump!

103
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:07,333
You picked the wrong girl
on the wrong day, pal!

104
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,375
Boss! Are you all right?

105
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
Oh, that is it...!

106
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,416
You are not gonna
get away with this.

107
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,041
You heard me!
Send out your boss... now!

108
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,250
Miss, I'm gonna have to ask
you to calm down, please.

109
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,291
Don't you tell me what to do.

110
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,166
One of your stupid cruisers

111
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,375
busted the crap out
of my friend's van!

112
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,000
So turn around and go
get your head honcho!

113
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,416
Model One has gone haywire?

114
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
Possibly.

115
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,250
The girl claims she was suddenly
attacked without provocation.

116
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,125
I can't be bothered
with this now.

117
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,625
Just get rid of her.

118
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,041
Yes but... If what
she's saying is correct,

119
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,125
then that would mean the
prototype was operating

120
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,708
beyond our programming
specifications.

121
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,916
Are you questioning me?

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,416
You do know...

123
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,416
the amount of research, talent,
and funding that have been

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,875
invested in the development
of the Road Radar project.

125
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,208
Of course, sir.

126
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,541
The Third Neuron portion
of the onboard AI program

127
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,791
was developed by the
world's top scientists

128
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,708
in complete secrecy...

129
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,833
And the result is
something amazing...

130
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,291
quite possibly the
ultimate evolution

131
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,916
in scientific progress...

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
That is why I have
poured my heart and soul

133
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,458
into this project.

134
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,166
We all feel the same way, sir!

135
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,583
Sacrifices are an inherent
part of the scientific method.

136
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,250
They are to be expected...

137
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,958
If we fret over every one,

138
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,375
our dreams of a perfect future
will remain but dreams.

139
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,708
I'll say it again...

140
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,000
There's nothing wrong
with Model One...

141
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,416
Now get that troublesome girl
out of here immediately.

142
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,708
I ain't leavin'
till he comes out.

143
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,958
I see how it is...

144
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,791
Shoulda known you'd
resort to this.

145
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,916
All right-y then.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,416
We do it the fun way!

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,291
I'm gonna show you Tokyo trash
how we do things out West...!

148
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,125
This means war!

149
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,208
Sorry, I have to take this...

150
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,791
Whaddya want? I'm in the
middle of somethin' here!

151
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
Uh... What did you say...?

152
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,125
Behind me?

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,583
Why'd you stop me?
Things were just getting' good!

154
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,250
Hate to break it to you,
but you were way outnumbered.

155
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,875
I coulda handled it...

156
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,916
I been itchin' to pound on some
of them crooked Tokyo cops...!

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,416
Besides... I ain't the kinda
girl to back down from a fight.

158
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,625
It's my sworn duty to protect
and serve the people.

159
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,000
So there's no chance of you
returning quietly to Osaka.

160
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,333
Why would I do that?

161
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,083
If you decide to
take on RAPT now,

162
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,625
it will make our jobs
a lot more difficult.

163
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,000
See? That's the problem
with you Tokyo people.

164
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,500
That's right. You're in
Tokyo now, not Osaka.

165
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,625
There's an invisible power
struggle going on here...

166
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,458
Nothing is as it seems.

167
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,833
Yeah, whatever...

168
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,250
But... I have been hankerin'
for some good takoyaki.

169
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,333
I knew you'd see things my way.
I have your ticket right here.

170
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,750
What would you have done
if I refused to go?

171
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,291
I would have found you a
nice seat in a freezer truck.

172
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,708
Ouch.

173
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,166
There's no mistake?

174
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,666
No sir... I just received
confirmation...

175
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,833
Model One's program data
is being hacked into.

176
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,958
What've they gotten?

177
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,750
Over fifty percent so far.

178
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,875
It appears our
Information Control Center's

179
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,666
encryption has been compromised.

180
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,666
Has the hacker been identified?

181
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,500
We're hitting a
snag there, sir...

182
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,083
They seem to be on the move.

183
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,416
Switching relay stations before
we can get a trace on them...

184
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,625
Definitely not the
work of an amateur.

185
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,416
Ah... If this is
a professional job,

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,916
we may be dealing with
some new terrorist threat.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,375
Shall I inform the
Governor-General, sir?

188
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,083
No, not yet...
This is not the time.

189
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,083
Put Model One on
the dock and shut down

190
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,291
the control center link before
any more damage is done.

191
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,833
We are currently making
preparations for

192
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,166
mass production at a number
of private factories.

193
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,791
Please assure
Governor-General Ishihara that

194
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,250
Models Two and Three will roll
out on schedule, as promised...

195
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,625
In addition, Model
One will be undergoing

196
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,708
several readjustments
before we move on to Stage 2.

197
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,958
Readjustments...?

198
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,375
Has Model One been exhibiting

199
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,333
complications with
its programming?

200
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,166
Not at all... We're simply
installing a device to record

201
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,125
the unit's combat activities

202
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,708
so we may continue to upgrade
the Models capabilities.

203
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,750
[TEXT]
"Slippery When Wet"

204
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,833
The buildings here look
like giant tombstones...

205
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,375
Shoot, in this city even
the sun looks kinda sad.

206
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,791
You picked the wrong girl
on the wrong day, pal!

207
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
Come again?

208
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,583
Model One is ignoring
our commands,

209
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,791
and is currently traveling
on the Mega-Highway, sir.

210
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,083
Is this the work of
that damn hacker?

211
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,333
We don't know, sir.

212
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,833
Where is Model One heading?

213
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,291
We don't know that either, sir.

214
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,166
It's not responding
to our communications.

215
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,083
Send a chopper out to
find it immediately...

216
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,583
And until this is resolved,

217
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,958
I want all access to the
Mega-Highway shut down.

218
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,791
What...? Are you
absolutely certain?

219
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,083
Yes sir, I'm afraid so...

220
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,166
Both models suddenly
awoke from standby-mode,

221
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,666
destroyed their hangar
doors and escaped.

222
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,208
They uh, they appear to be
heading for the Mega-Highway...

223
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,458
Sir...? Sir?!

224
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,916
Model One...
It's controlling them.

225
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,166
Hey...! That's where
it happened...!

226
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,041
That's where that no-good RAPT
bastard attacked us earlier.

227
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,166
How exactly did it attack you?

228
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,291
I can't say for sure, but all of
a sudden it came outta nowhere

229
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,000
and latched onto
the back of the van...

230
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,583
Then... Right as I turned
around to get a look...

231
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,958
Aw, crap! It's back!

232
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,541
What?! Are you serious?!

233
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,916
Yeah, and it looks like
it's comin' after us!

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,083
No way! We didn't
do anything wrong.

235
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,916
I know, that's what I'm sayin'!

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,875
The thing's a
no-good RAPT bastard!

237
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,083
Y'know... It could be
that thing likes you.

238
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
That's the worst
thing I've ever heard!

239
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,125
Attention tractor trailer: A
suspect wanted for interference

240
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,166
of RAPT duties has been
detected aboard your vehicle.

241
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,916
Stop the vehicle immediately and
await further instructions...

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,250
Failure to comply or
attempts at resistance

243
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,833
will be viewed as aiding and
harboring a known fugitive,

244
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,333
and will be met with
the use of force.

245
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,250
This doesn't look promising.

246
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,500
Here it comes.

247
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,916
Eat lead!

248
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,583
Impossible...

249
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,000
Model Two is performing in
ways it shouldn't be able to

250
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
without completing its
battle simulation program.

251
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,375
We believe that Model Two is
under the guidance of Model One.

252
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,208
Damn it... What the hell
has happened to Model One?

253
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,791
Oh, crap!

254
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,541
Sei, don't slow down.

255
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,750
Why not?!

256
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,666
Take that hard turn
at this speed...

257
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,958
And when I give the word,
lower the rear hatch!

258
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,250
Got it!

259
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,500
Do it now!

260
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,291
I knew it. That patrol car
was no ordinary cybot.

261
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,333
A glowing brain.

262
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,833
What is it?

263
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
Stupid thing had one of those
glowing brains driving it.

264
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,708
Well that explains it...!

265
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,791
Must've been some kind of
psychopath behind the wheel!

266
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,416
No, I just told you!

267
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
It was a sentient,
pre-programmed bio-device!

268
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,250
Eh... Sorry, you lost me...

269
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,791
But what I still don't get
is why it attacked us.

270
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,250
Y'know, Takane might
have been partly right.

271
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,458
What if they built it using
the brain of some psychopath?

272
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,041
That would definitely explain

273
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,791
why its Thought Control
systems went haywire.

274
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,208
It sort of reminds me of
Frankenstein's monster.

275
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,458
I'd like to gather more data

276
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,250
before we make any
major decisions,

277
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,458
but I think we should get
off the highway first.

278
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,875
Might not be an option!

279
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,083
Looks like they wanna
play another round of tag.

280
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,791
So you've determined Model One's
target is this trailer truck?

281
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,166
According to our files it's
an unregistered vehicle...

282
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,708
And I'm just guessing here,

283
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,500
but it might be related
to the hackers somehow.

284
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,500
If that's so... then perhaps...

285
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,083
Model One assessed the vehicle
as some sort of a threat...

286
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,833
and acted on its own volition to
bring the drivers to justice.

287
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,041
I see...

288
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,291
Model One's objective

289
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,916
is to remove any and all
suspicious vehicles...

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,291
In order to do that

291
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,958
it needed to enlist the help
of Models Two and Three.

292
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,791
Indeed... Model One is not
out of control after all...

293
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,666
It simply called for backup.

294
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,291
Execute.

295
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,958
Amy, where's an exit?

296
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,541
Right side. 200 meters ahead.

297
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,208
Hang on tight!

298
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,625
Oh, my head.

299
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,166
I get the distinct feeling
they don't want us to leave.

300
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,166
They're tryin' to
shut us up for good!

301
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,125
Amy, can you disable the
locks on the exit gate?

302
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,958
I think I can, but...
it might take a while.

303
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,500
That's what you call a while?

304
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,166
Way to go, Amy.

305
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,583
But I didn't do anything yet.

306
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,375
Aw, man...
Just how many are there?

307
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm making a break for it.

308
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,583
This is Sky Fish
Four-Zero-Four...

309
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,708
Model One is currently in
pursuit of an unknown cybot...

310
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,333
Now entering the
Red-Blue Bridge.

311
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,333
No good.

312
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,708
I can't move...
Damn thing's got us.

313
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,791
Jo, save yourself!
Get out of here!

314
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:42,333
No, Sei... I won't...
I won't run...

315
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,833
But, Jo...

316
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,000
C'mon... Gun it!

317
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,958
Hang on, Sei! What the
hell are you doing?!

318
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,541
Are you trying to kill us?

319
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,541
Jo... You can do this--
I trust you!

320
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:45,958
Execute. Execute. Execute...

321
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
Four-Zero-Four reporting...

322
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,375
Models One and Three
have been destroyed...

323
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,750
The unknown cybot and trailer
are headed for the coast...

324
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,541
Repeat... Models One and three
have been destroyed...

325
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,208
I don't know why I can't move

326
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:22,083
My mind is lost in this cloud

327
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:29,458
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

328
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:37,083
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

329
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:42,375
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

330
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,541
and smile with each other

331
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,833
It hurts inside
when we don't...

332
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,458
we don't... we don't
know what to say

333
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:58,208
I only hope that
someone will be there,

334
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:02,291
and be watching over me

335
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,291
so take my hand,

336
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:13,083
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

337
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,875
When the city glows
red in the evening sun,

338
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,333
the Angels, stripped
of their wings,

339
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,791
will soar into
the sky once more...

340
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:44,333
Next time on Burst Angel:
New Sheriff in Town.
