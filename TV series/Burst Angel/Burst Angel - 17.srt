1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,875
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,041
No, wait! You can't
kill it with a sword!

24
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,875
It's not a demon...

25
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,625
It's a cybot!

26
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,500
Hey...! Are you all right?!

27
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,458
Damn it!

28
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,250
Wait for it...

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,583
Saw that coming.

30
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,041
Hey! Where you going?

31
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,875
Wait up!

32
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,541
Time to feel my heat!

33
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,583
Damn!

34
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,541
This isn't working!

35
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,291
I've got to find a way
to draw the pilot out!

36
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
That got him!

37
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,666
I'll finish you myself!

38
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,458
What the hell was
all that about...?

39
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,583
That thing was...

40
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,625
It was like it spoke to me...

41
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,833
I felt it.

42
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,833
Hey... The village is
in cinders, right?

43
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,083
So, there's no reason
for you to stay

44
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,541
and try to kill that
thing, is there?

45
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,083
But you're going to
fight it anyway...

46
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,750
Your sword is strong, I know,

47
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,750
but the cybot is
hardened steel...

48
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,000
You simply can not
beat it that way.

49
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:56,083
You should just walk away...
to stay a suicide.

50
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,291
You listenin' to me?! Hey!

51
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,666
What am I doing here?

52
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,125
Why do I give a
damn about this guy?

53
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,833
Something's very wrong.

54
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,291
The men who fought along
side you are buried here.

55
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,333
So, this'll be your final
resting place too, won't it?

56
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,500
A secret weapon?

57
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,500
Fate deems you die with that
sword in your hand, is that it?

58
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,041
Maybe... you won't have to.

59
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,125
It's possible what
I've been experiencing

60
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,166
is some sort of
telepathic communication.

61
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,000
If so, we may be linked somehow
mentally or spiritually...

62
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,875
If that's the case,
I should be able

63
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,916
to send messages
telepathically as well.

64
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,750
I'm willing to bet I can
make the enemy come to us.

65
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,583
Come on out. Come and get me...

66
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:06,791
I know you can hear me...
I'm right here.

67
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,250
What are you waiting for...?

68
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:21,791
You want to kill me, right...?
Well, here I am...

69
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,166
I won't run and I won't
hide... Come on!

70
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,125
She's here.

71
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,416
So, you're the pilot.

72
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,125
You can call me... Maria...

73
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,958
I'm here to bring you back.

74
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,458
Bring me back...
What's that mean?

75
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,375
Some kinda joke?

76
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,541
That's what I was told
to do... By our boss.

77
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,791
Boss...? What the hell
are you talking about...?

78
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,833
And, what exactly do
you mean by "our"?

79
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,333
I guess, you really
don't remember, do you?

80
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,708
Remember what?

81
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,083
They informed me of your
mysterious amnesia...

82
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,875
But, since we were
programmed together

83
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,083
with complete parallel
coding streams,

84
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,041
I didn't think it possible.

85
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,791
Programmed how?

86
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,458
That's really not important now.

87
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,958
It seems that during
our fight a rift formed,

88
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,916
and we drifted into
another dimension.

89
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,291
But how...? I have a theory...

90
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,125
As we fought, we both
struggled at the peak

91
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,750
of our capabilities
without a clear victor.

92
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,250
The energies we released
caused a portal

93
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,291
to open between dimensions.

94
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,416
No way... It can't be...

95
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,916
I assure you it can...

96
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,166
We're definitely not
in the sphere of reality

97
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,458
we're supposed to be ...

98
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,791
We are trapped...

99
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,458
...somewhere between
the real and the unreal.

100
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,208
I'll try this again...
Who are you...

101
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,083
...and what do you want?

102
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,958
You fail to understand.

103
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,375
Our programming does not
allow us attack each other...

104
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,000
But you did.
You evaded my capture

105
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,500
and attacked me without
a second thought.

106
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,458
It's all over now...

107
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,791
You bitch...! Nothing's over!

108
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,583
It's inevitable, you will die.

109
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,375
I will...?
You're screwin' with me.

110
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,083
I'm afraid not ...

111
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,541
The memory degradation
proves that your system

112
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,500
isn't developing properly...

113
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,791
The physical, biological
aspect of your existence

114
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,041
simply will not
tolerate it forever...

115
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,750
There is simply
no way to escape...

116
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,541
...your fate.

117
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,041
I may not be very good
at remembering things...

118
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,750
But, I will never forget

119
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,416
your merciless attack
on my friend Leo!

120
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,291
I see no reason you and
I can't be friends...

121
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,666
The boss hasn't ordered
your termination yet,

122
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,583
so I have no reason to hurt you.

123
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,416
But I have every reason.
I want to see you dead.

124
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,541
Come peacefully and
you might survive...

125
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,333
If you don't...

126
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,250
Now that sounds like a threat...

127
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,791
If you're itchin' for a fight,
you know I'll take you on!

128
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,083
Aw, that slippery bitch!

129
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,416
Damn it...!
She's taunting me!

130
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,000
Your little games won't work!

131
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,916
Hidin' in that tin can of
yours won't work either...!

132
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,708
You're mine!

133
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,125
Oh, what the hell?! Who's that?

134
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,416
Jo, do you read me?

135
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,291
It's Sei...! Please,
respond...! Jo...?

136
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,750
Who the hell is that down there?

137
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,333
I hate to break it to you,
but she can't hear you...

138
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,833
She's alone...

139
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,083
Lost in the battle, fully
consumed by her berzerker rage.

140
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,583
I don't give a rat's ass who you
are or where you're from...

141
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,833
It's just you and me out
here... To the death!

142
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,583
Come on...

143
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,625
It's about time
you showed yourself!

144
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,500
Don't do it!

145
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,000
Wha--!

146
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:01,125
Why are you doing this?
What will this accomplish?

147
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,125
Listen, buddy, I am in no
mood to fight you either...

148
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,250
I think maybe we just got
off on the wrong foot...

149
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,625
Of all the times...

150
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,000
What's wrong?
You're not eating?

151
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,750
This village is ancient.
Are you alone here?

152
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,916
And why are you here?
What happened to everyone else?

153
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,708
I understand.

154
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,958
You were brought to this village
to get rid of that demon.

155
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,500
And, now you alone
remain here...

156
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,750
...to exact your revenge.

157
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,833
Jo, please respond!
Are you okay...?

158
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,208
Jo?!

159
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,750
Yeah... I'm here.

160
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,333
I don't know why I can't move

161
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,208
My mind is lost in this cloud

162
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:29,583
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

163
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:37,208
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

164
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:42,500
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

165
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,666
and smile with each other

166
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,958
It hurts inside
when we don't...

167
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,583
we don't... we don't
know what to say

168
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,333
I only hope that
someone will be there,

169
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,416
and be watching over me

170
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,416
so take my hand,

171
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:13,208
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

172
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,041
A promising future extinguished.

173
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,291
A house of violent greed.

174
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,250
Hopes and dreams
shattered by one law:

175
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,291
Survival of the Fittest.

176
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,291
Next Burst Angel:
The Immortal Classmate.
