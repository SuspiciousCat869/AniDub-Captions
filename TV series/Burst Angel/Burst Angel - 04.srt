1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,791
Commencing link.

24
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,208
Right, men! Move out!

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,083
Wanna tell me who you are?

26
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:01,500
My name is Liang. That man
you shot is my twin brother.

27
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,000
His name is Wong.

28
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,250
What's all the fuss over
this one little guy?

29
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,166
You ask me, he's
just some crazy bum.

30
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,458
Hinode Pharmaceuticals was
conducting secret experiments.

31
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,083
They used human test subjects
at their facility in Shinagawa.

32
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,666
My guess is that Wong
was one of their lab rats,

33
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,791
one of their "samples."

34
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,250
I'd also be willing to bet
RAPT is involved, too.

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,750
Other than that, I don't know.

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,291
Got it!

37
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,458
It's beneath Tokyo Terminal,
hooked up to a freight train.

38
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,875
Destination?

39
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,000
Heading north!

40
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,041
We going after it?

41
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,750
Are you kidding?

42
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,500
Tell me the truth.

43
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,958
You're working for Hinode
Pharmaceuticals, aren't you?

44
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,625
Hinode? I wouldn't work
with a company like that.

45
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
Stop lying!

46
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,833
I'm telling the truth!

47
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:09,041
We were sent to find your
freaked out brother! That's all!

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,375
So if you're gonna
shoot me, then shoot!

49
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,250
Don't think I won't jump
and take you with me!

50
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,750
It's Liang, right? What are
you trying to accomplish here?

51
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,458
I want my brother
back. That's all.

52
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,208
That dude's a total basketcase.

53
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,916
I don't see why anyone would
bother trying to save him.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,750
Yeah. So he wasn't
exactly a model citizen.

55
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,083
But, he wasn't
always so messed up.

56
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,250
He helped me a lot.
He even loaned me the money

57
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,541
to open my first restaurant
in this country.

58
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,666
Hey, brother-man,
any business today?

59
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,125
You always show up when
the food's hot, don't ya?

60
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:07,375
Liang, this is great! It's the
best fried rice I've ever had.

61
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,291
You wanna keep eating
my fried rice,

62
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,708
you better keep your nose clean!

63
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,625
Don't worry about me, bro!
I got it all figured out.

64
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm destined for
greatness in this town!

65
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,250
I don't why, but he
got into some trouble

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,625
and RAPT hauled him in.

67
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,916
When he got out,
he was different.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,875
He wasn't the brother
I knew before.

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,208
C'mon, bro! What is your deal?

70
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,416
He hated taking medicine,

71
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,458
but now he was popping
pills everyday.

72
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,375
He said they were just vitamins,

73
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,375
but when I realized the
truth, it was too late.

74
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,791
He's my brother,

75
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,208
so I had to try and figure
out what they did to him.

76
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,250
Turns out the dealer he
was getting his stuff from

77
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,125
was working for RAPT.

78
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,666
It was obvious they
were intentionally

79
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,583
trying to get him strung out.

80
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,458
That way he'd do anything
they wanted him to,

81
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,125
as long as the
drugs kept coming.

82
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,416
Experiments, tests,
I don't know.

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,916
I took the pills away
and he just disappeared.

84
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,250
Hey Jack, today ain't your
pick-up day! Go home.

85
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,208
Come back on Thursday,
and I'll set you up.

86
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,750
Wait! Please stop this.

87
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,166
What did you say? Stop?

88
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,125
I'm begging you to stop
peddling this trash.

89
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,875
You wait! Who do you think
you are, you little shit?!

90
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:47,916
No!

91
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,791
Why? Why do this--

92
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,375
Shut up!

93
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,958
Don't mess with me! I'll make
your life miserable, ya hear me?

94
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,125
Back off!

95
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,500
You wouldn't!

96
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,791
If I'd killed him
right there and then,

97
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,291
my brother might
still be around.

98
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,958
Now, sleep.

99
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,666
They took him to a secret
lab in Shinagawa.

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,166
The facility is owned
by Hinode Pharmaceuticals.

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,458
They perform live
human experiments there.

102
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,250
I think they're after something
inside my brother's body.

103
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,250
Something he developed.

104
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
Developed? Huh?

105
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,958
Do you think he's
telling the truth?

106
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,291
He seems pretty sincere.

107
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,375
We're on our way now. You
just stay right where you are.

108
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,250
'Kay. Meg out.

109
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,333
Don't know about you,
but I'm going in.

110
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,333
That's a bad idea.

111
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,125
Wait! What are you doing?

112
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,625
I'm gonna cut this cable

113
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,166
and force the train
to stop in the tunnel!

114
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,458
The tunnel's dark.

115
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,208
I should be able
to sneak onboard

116
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,833
while they're trying
to fix the train.

117
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,833
Uh, wait! Maybe we should...

118
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,375
Oh, no!

119
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, hold on!

120
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,750
Yeah. Right! Just don't drop me!

121
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,083
Don't let go.

122
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,458
I can't hold on much longer!

123
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,583
Wong!

124
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,083
Damn you! That's my brother!
Let him outta there! Let him go!

125
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,916
Liang! What did you--

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,916
Shut up! Or you'll
end up the same way!

127
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,208
They bring in the test subjects

128
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,166
when the desired effects
begin to manifest physically.

129
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,250
In order to get
detailed data,

130
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,666
they have to transport
them to a proper facility.

131
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,791
After that, well, who knows?

132
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,500
Bingo!

133
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,958
At the end of
that freight line

134
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,625
there's a Hinode research
and development lab.

135
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,708
Did Bai-Lan tell us
to protect Wong

136
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,375
because they knew about
the ongoing experiments?

137
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,500
Are they after the same
information as Hinode?

138
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,416
Check it out!

139
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,250
We caught up to 'em!

140
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,416
Amy. I need you to
contact Meg, right away.

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,625
Are they ready
for him at the lab?

142
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,083
Yeah, they're ready,

143
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,875
but this guy's bio levels
are going through the roof.

144
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
I'll try and adjust
the regulator balance.

145
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,250
Now you guys call me.

146
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,958
Open fire!

147
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,291
What is that?

148
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,666
You call for backup?

149
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,625
I wish. That's not Bai-Lan.
It's someone else.

150
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,125
Whoever they are, they can
only be after one thing.

151
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:12,750
But what exactly? What is
hidden inside of Wong's body?

152
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,000
Attention! This will be
your only warning!

153
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,500
Stop the train and lay down
your weapons immediately!

154
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,916
Attention!

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,750
A Ratman has engaged an enemy
cybot in cargo area three!

156
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,541
Stay clear!

157
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,208
Heavy assault is imminent!

158
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,333
All medical research
personnel are instructed

159
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,041
to remain inside
the bio-transport car!

160
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,666
W-What's going on?

161
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,000
Um, short version?
Things are getting ugly.

162
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,666
Hey! You two keep quiet!

163
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,375
Chill out!

164
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,416
I said, shut yer traps!

165
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,541
All Hell's about to
break loose. Ready?

166
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,000
That's what I was
born to do, baby!

167
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
What the--?

168
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,208
They're closing in!
Release car number 3!

169
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,750
Meg!

170
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,750
Amy, there anywhere up ahead
we can get off the Mega Highway?

171
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,916
Yeah, I think so, why?

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
All aboard.

173
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,041
Line up with the train
as close as you can.

174
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,916
Okay, I'll give it a shot!

175
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,875
I've never seen
anything like this before.

176
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,000
The cellular structure is
active, like it's alive.

177
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,166
The mutation has reached
the secondary stage.

178
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,625
Let's increase the density
of the bio-solution.

179
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,625
So, this the new
lab rat? Ugly bastard.

180
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,208
We've upped the dosage
considerably on this guy.

181
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,708
I look forward to
seeing the results.

182
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,500
What the--!

183
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,083
The assault is over. How are
things in the bio-transport?

184
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,208
Bio-transport respond!
Come in bio-transport!

185
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,166
My god, Wong!
Are you in there somewhere?

186
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,000
You serious? That's not
your brother anymore.

187
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,166
Wong! Say something if you can!

188
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,458
Oh, don't do that!
He'll come over here!

189
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,291
Brother! It's me, Liang!

190
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,458
You have to remember me!

191
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,583
Br... Brother.

192
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,875
That's it, brother. Come on.

193
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,625
What is that?

194
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,791
You monster!

195
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
You tore these men to shreds!

196
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,708
He's coming at us!

197
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,166
Shoot it! Shoot it!

198
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,583
Wait! I'm your brother.
I won't hurt you.

199
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,750
Wong... I'm sorry.

200
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,583
Guys this is really bad!
We found Liang's brother,

201
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,875
but then he turned
into a monster,

202
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,500
and then there was
blood everywhere,

203
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,375
and he killed Liang
and the other soldiers,

204
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,083
and then it went
up front and... and...

205
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,625
Meg, calm down!
What are you saying?

206
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,208
I'm perfectly calm!
Now listen to me!

207
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,708
Wong turned into a monster,

208
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,750
killed everyone, and
now he's in the cockpit!

209
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,541
Oh, so he's the one
speeding up the train!

210
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,458
Jo, it's going too fast!

211
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,208
At this rate it's gonna
smash right into the lab!

212
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,208
He's got that thing
at full throttle.

213
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,250
Suicidal son of a bitch!

214
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,666
He wants revenge against
the company that turned him

215
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,000
into a mutant, into a monster.

216
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,625
Oh, so killing us too
makes perfect sense!

217
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:53,916
But you know, it's okay.
We die together, twin brothers.

218
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,583
There we go,
pull up that section.

219
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,083
These are the last roads
that will lead to the facility.

220
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,250
Now zoom in on
that intersection!

221
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,041
Actually, it's not a road.
It's an old railroad bridge.

222
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,125
What's underneath the bridge?

223
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,375
How should I know?

224
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,166
It's not like satellite
cams have X-ray vision!

225
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,541
Then what good are you
and your computer?

226
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,583
Can you catch up to it?

227
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,750
I think so. But that
old iron railroad bridge

228
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:39,000
probably can't hold the
weight of our vehicle. Ideas?

229
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,208
Yeah, I got something in mind.

230
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,041
Meg here.

231
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,750
Meg, I need you to get to
the rear car! Right now!

232
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,833
Okay!

233
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,000
Wh-What on Earth
happened up here?

234
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,125
Hey! Let go!

235
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,416
Meg!

236
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,166
You wanna die?! Next stop: Hell!

237
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,083
In other news, an alligator
escaped from its pen

238
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,916
in a West Azabu club and
made its way to Shinjuku

239
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
through the city's
underground sewer system.

240
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,458
Tragically, a hot dog vendor
was killed and a mime's legs

241
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,875
were gnawed off as a
result of today's attack.

242
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,750
A young infant
made history today

243
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,541
with the release of his
debut full-length album.

244
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,250
The implantation of an
intelligence-accelerator chip

245
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,250
in the language center
of the infant's brain

246
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,916
--made it possible to translate
--Whatever.

247
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,458
the young idol's
thoughts into song.

248
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,791
Here Meg, eat this.
It'll cheer ya up.

249
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,375
Huh. What is it?

250
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,875
It's Kyo's fried rice
and steamed dumplings.

251
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,666
Twin brothers...

252
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,375
Huh? What did you say?

253
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,958
Oh, nothing. This looks good.
Down the hatch!

254
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,833
I don't know why I can't move

255
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,708
My mind is lost in this cloud

256
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:30,083
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

257
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:37,708
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

258
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:43,000
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

259
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:47,166
and smile with each other

260
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,458
It hurts inside
when we don't...

261
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,083
we don't... we don't
know what to say

262
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:58,833
I only hope that
someone will be there,

263
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:02,916
and be watching over me

264
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,916
so take my hand,

265
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,708
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

266
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,666
In a remote area,

267
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,875
the Saint Luciana
Academy For Girls

268
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,708
becomes the site of
an evil spirit's trap.

269
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,000
Meg is snared by the demon
and must fight it alone.

270
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:44,250
Next Burst Angel: "The
Mansion Where Lurks The Demon."
