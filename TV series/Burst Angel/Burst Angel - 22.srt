1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,875
Tokyo has fallen ill.

24
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,416
Terminally ill...

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,916
Think of the newly instated
Tokyo Restoration Initiative

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,666
as the surgeon...

27
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,041
We must work swiftly

28
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,958
to remove the cancerous
elements from Tokyo...

29
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,083
I have made it
my personal crusade

30
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,625
to lead us in this manner.

31
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,458
However...
All of you can help...

32
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,916
You can help with
your prayers

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,750
for the rapid and complete
recovery of our fair city...

34
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,875
Each and every one of
you hold the key...

35
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:06,166
And together, I am certain we
can make Tokyo great once more.

36
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,291
Martial law has been
declared in Tokyo.

37
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,083
All traffic going in
and out of the city

38
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,666
will be subject to inspection
at various checkpoints.

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,916
Citizens are encouraged
to stay in their homes

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,333
whenever possible.

41
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,625
Chief Administrator Glenford's
declaration today sent

42
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,166
shockwaves throughout
the international community.

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
In response to
concerns from abroad,

44
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,125
the Japanese government
has begun using

45
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,666
its United Nations
representatives to foster

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,333
support from other
countries around the world.

47
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,958
Right from the start, your
only goal was capturing Jo...

48
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,791
So, this is how I can expect
you to run things now?

49
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,875
Do not misunderstand...

50
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,291
We merely brought back a child
who'd run away from home.

51
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,875
That's exactly right...

52
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,291
Jo was created by us to be
an elite living battle weapon.

53
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,375
Living battle weapon?

54
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,833
Who--Who's there?

55
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,458
Meg, are you all right?

56
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,000
Sei...? Do I look like
I'm all right...?!

57
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,208
What the hell's going on here?!

58
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,083
Try to stay calm, Meg.

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,833
Oh, no! Don't you dare
tell me to be calm...!

60
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm totally freaked out

61
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,458
and I have a whole
crapload of questions!

62
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
Why am I here? What the
hell is this place...?

63
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,291
And why the hell are you here?!
Jo and Leo disappeared, too!

64
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,458
I know you know what's going
on, Sei! Just tell me!

65
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,916
Listen to me... Jo is here too.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,416
She's here... but, she's
no longer the Jo you knew.

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,666
What does that mean?!

68
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,125
Hey! I deserve a straight
answer, Sei...!

69
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,583
What happened to Jo?!

70
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,875
Let her go!
That girl is my prey!

71
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,958
Maria and Jo...

72
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
It was clear their
abilities were outstanding

73
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,583
right from the start...

74
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,000
Even during their earliest
training missions

75
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,041
on that deserted island
in the Pacific.

76
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:43,583
Children of ZERO...
You are the chosen few...

77
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:48,083
The time of your
awakening is at hand.

78
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:53,541
Now and forever, this world will
act according to ZERO's will.

79
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,625
Just as it always has.

80
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,416
Those poor girls--
and so many of them.

81
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,208
They were created in
a secret laboratory.

82
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,666
Genetically engineered

83
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,125
to develop exceptional
gifts and abilities.

84
00:09:55,875 --> 00:10:00,500
And Jo... was one of them.

85
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:04,125
I don't get it... What on Earth
were they training for?

86
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,833
To be soldiers...

87
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,208
The girls were designed
to communicate directly

88
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,875
with special cybots they
were trained to pilot.

89
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,041
All of those cybots
with the glowing brains

90
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,416
we have been sent after
were built for them.

91
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,750
Like a hunter who uses
dogs to track its prey,

92
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,458
Jo and the others like her
have the ability to control

93
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,000
the glowing brain cybots
using their minds.

94
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:59,708
Sei...? Is that...?
Is that true?

95
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,625
It's part of the
syndicate's plan...

96
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,208
Their plan to bring
about a world war...

97
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,500
and conquer the entire planet.

98
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,625
No way... This is...
It's crazy...!

99
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,333
I don't believe you!

100
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,458
None of this makes any sense!

101
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,958
Cerebral transmission
activity is over four times

102
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,541
that of a normal human.

103
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,375
Muscular response is pulsing

104
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,125
at an unbelievably
accelerated speed.

105
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,208
On top of that, her Spatial
Wave Resonance Frequency

106
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,250
is reading far above average.

107
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,333
I wonder what the results
would be if we were to

108
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,583
draw out all of her
latent abilities at once?

109
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,416
There's only one way to
find out. Let's try it.

110
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,541
Professor?

111
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,875
She is, after all,
the perfect specimen

112
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,250
for sating our
scientific curiosity.

113
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,250
You're right sir.
I must admit to being

114
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,083
a little excited when
studying her data files.

115
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,458
Professor, let me say again

116
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,291
what an honor it is
to be part of your team.

117
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,625
The combat exercise will
begin in ten minutes...

118
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,166
This will be your final test...

119
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,875
You may use any means necessary
to ensure your survival.

120
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,875
Twelve hours after
battle commences,

121
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,833
the girl who has eliminated
the most enemies will earn

122
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,416
a place as the organization's
top commander.

123
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,291
So, how do you think this'll go?

124
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,250
According to our simulations, 

125
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,583
thirty minutes after
the exercise commences,

126
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,916
only one in ten of the girls

127
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,041
will still be alive
and able to fight.

128
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,875
The Angels have all been given
motion detection abilities.

129
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,416
They can sense the other
girls as they approach...

130
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Naturally, this
exercise will become

131
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,250
quite the endurance match.

132
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,791
When all is said and done, only
one of these girls will remain.

133
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,791
She will be our Genocide
Angel prototype.

134
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,458
We're down to the final
three competitors.

135
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,833
Including Lava, what are
their odds of winning?

136
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,375
Let's see, Maria,
92.02 percent...

137
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,875
Jo, 7.76 percent...

138
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,166
And Lava, only a
.22 percent chance.

139
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,708
Ha, just as I predicted.

140
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,833
Fighting will only
make it worse.

141
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,916
Sorry. The game is mine.

142
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,875
Jo's vital signs
have disappeared.

143
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,000
So, then...
Maria's our prototype.

144
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,916
Wait... hold on a minute!

145
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,833
It's Jo, she's still alive.

146
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,000
I can't believe that's
really how Jo grew up...

147
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:38,875
I--I had no idea...
Do you believe it, Sei?

148
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,416
Then let's... Let's go save her.

149
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,458
I'm sorry, but I can't.

150
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Sei!

151
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,833
Listen...

152
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,500
You are the only one who
can save her now, Meg...

153
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,833
They know as long as they have
you, Jo won't put up a fight.

154
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
She won't resist.

155
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,750
So that's why... I'm here...?

156
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:08,791
No, I... I can't see Jo...
Not like this!

157
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,083
Meg...

158
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:15,166
Give her back...!
Give me back the Jo I know!

159
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,875
I'll grab as much ammo
and weaponry as I can...

160
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,291
But I need you to find soldiers.

161
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,791
You can count on me...

162
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,708
I'll get the Kanbaku
girls together.

163
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,500
We'll tear Tokyo up...
Ain't no one can stop us.

164
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,958
What's this?!

165
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,958
Oh, daddy...

166
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,916
What are you doing?!

167
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Keeping you out of trouble--

168
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,958
But, I owe Jo my life...

169
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,125
If I don't help her now,
I may not get another chance!

170
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,708
You're the one who taught me the
importance of duty and humanity!

171
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me out of here...! Daddy!

172
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,541
And, now that I got those sweet
nitro-boosters for my ride,

173
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,625
we just blew past
that old broad!

174
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,791
Yeah, totally... So then I
mooned her out the window...

175
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,458
And the old bitch
was all like...

176
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,333
"Oooh! You horrible
children! In my day--!"

177
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,958
There you are, Kyo...!

178
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,958
Sorry, man, I got
stopped by the po-pos

179
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,041
twice on my way over here.

180
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,166
C'mon... Let's go somewhere
else, it's too loud.

181
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,333
Really?! I don't wanna
deal with the cops again!

182
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,791
See what I mean?!

183
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
Which one of you degenerates

184
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,083
has the souped-up car
out in the parking lot?

185
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,125
Uh... I know it's not
street-legal but...

186
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,333
We'll fix it right away.
I promise!

187
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,833
We'll have to take you
in for questioning.

188
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,458
Aw, Come on, man,
it's no big deal!

189
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,833
That's obstruction
of police business!

190
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,500
Take 'em down!

191
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,250
Give us a break man!

192
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,708
Who the hell are you...?

193
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,625
Oh, I see... You're one of them.

194
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,000
One of the girls like Jo,

195
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,500
and now you've been
caught by the bad guys, too.

196
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,375
That's so sad. They've been
training you for combat

197
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,416
and nothing else
since you were born...

198
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,166
I feel so sorry for you.

199
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,791
Listen to me.
You can't give up hope now...

200
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,791
Before you know it,
Jo's gonna bust in here,

201
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,333
knock the crap out
of all the bad guys,

202
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,500
and rescue everybody...! Okay?

203
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,791
Jo?

204
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,083
She's only the coolest ever...!

205
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,208
Once you get her going,
she's like, totally unstoppable!

206
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,916
And, if you can believe it,
I am her number one partner!

207
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,458
I know...

208
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,375
I don't look like much,
but Jo really depends on me!

209
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,708
I thought I was
dead meat, for sure!

210
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,791
But then, I looked
up at the bridge...

211
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,041
There was Jo-- inside Jango--

212
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,250
standing there just
waiting to save me...!

213
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,625
It was so unbelievably
freakin' cool!

214
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,000
You have no idea...!

215
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,833
I swear, you can search
all over the entire world...

216
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,166
and you will never find
anyone better than Jo!

217
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,083
I consider myself lucky
just to be around her.

218
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,333
She makes me feel
happy, you know?

219
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,875
Anywhere Jo goes... I go...

220
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,458
Wait-- Whaddayou--?!

221
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,208
You smell nice!

222
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,666
I'll be the one to save you Meg.

223
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,666
You just... Wait...!
How do you know my name?

224
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,125
Then I'll track down
your beloved Jo...

225
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,083
And beat her until she's
drenched in her own blood.

226
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,083
Who the hell are you?!

227
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,416
My name is Maria.

228
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,333
There's Moon Empire now, sir.

229
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,916
She's surfaced just off
the coast of Tokyo Bay.

230
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,375
Good. I want the transfer
of the new cybot models

231
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,041
completed within
the next 24 hours.

232
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,458
We'll be ready, sir...

233
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,583
Sir, we've got an
emergency transmission

234
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,291
coming in from the
research facility!

235
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,583
What?

236
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,833
Maria... did that?!

237
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,916
Maria wants to settle things...

238
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,333
To prove she is
better than Jo...

239
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,208
It seems to have
something to do with that

240
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,083
partner of Jo's we had
in custody at the lab.

241
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,916
I'm sure Maria will
take them somewhere

242
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,916
they can fight and
no one can interfere.

243
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,041
Where no one can intefere...

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,791
I don't know why I can't move

245
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,666
My mind is lost in this cloud

246
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:30,041
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

247
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:37,666
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

248
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,958
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

249
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:47,125
and smile with each other

250
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,416
It hurts inside
when we don't...

251
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,041
we don't... we don't
know what to say

252
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:58,791
I only hope that
someone will be there,

253
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,875
and be watching over me

254
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,875
so take my hand,

255
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:13,666
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

256
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,708
To survive, they must fight...

257
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,708
To continue on,
they must fight...

258
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,000
To understand one another,
they must fight...

259
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,125
Next Burst Angel:
"Red Sea Gallows."
