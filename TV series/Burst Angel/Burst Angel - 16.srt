1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,625
Stop hiding!

24
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,625
Come on out here
and show yourself!

25
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,458
Damn. How did I get
myself into this?

26
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,041
So, what's his deal?

27
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,208
He's wanted for multiple
abductions and murders...

28
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,791
including children.

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,375
What a scumbag!

30
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,333
Take care of him...
Do it your way.

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,958
I need this thing fixed
while I'm gone...

32
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,583
Maybe have Amy give it a look.

33
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,250
Aw, man! Jo and Meg left?

34
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,041
Jo was hoping you
could fix her TV.

35
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,208
Sheesh, this whole
place is a dump!

36
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,708
That just means he's got
a lot of places to hide.

37
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,875
I like what he's
done with the place.

38
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,666
We'll probably find him
faster if we split up.

39
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,333
And Meg... Watch yourself.

40
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,250
What was that?

41
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,291
Who's there?!

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,083
My partner's on the way, so if
you're smart you'll let me go!

43
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,333
I'm not doing anything wrong.

44
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,250
You're the one waving
the gun around.

45
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,250
That's not very smart!

46
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,416
I have been wrongly accused!

47
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,541
But, if you insist on
pointing that gun at me,

48
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,750
I'll have to do
whatever it takes

49
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,041
to protect myself and
I do mean whatever.

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,291
You have no idea
what a huge mistake

51
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,083
you're making right now...

52
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,500
Let her go or
it'll get real ugly.

53
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,458
The only mistake'll be
when you force me to...

54
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,708
slice up this pretty
little face over here.

55
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,583
I'll tell you what I'll do,
if you just walk away now,

56
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,958
I'll let her go;

57
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,666
and I'll throw you a little
cash for your trouble...

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,541
It's a good deal for you
and a good deal for me.

59
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,958
It'll be a real pleasure
doing business with you.

60
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,541
Here's an idea...

61
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,375
How about you let her go then I
put a bullet between your eyes!

62
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,458
That's no good...
If you try to shoot me...

63
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,875
then my hand might slip

64
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,541
and this bottle might go
right through her tender neck.

65
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,666
Jo, wait a minute!
This guy's crazy!

66
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,416
I think he'll really do it!

67
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,125
Ouch...! Damn...! I can't
believe you just shot me!

68
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,458
I want to speak to my attorney
right now, you hear me?!

69
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,750
You're going to speak
to somebody all right,

70
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,625
it just won't be a
lawyer, you maniac!

71
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,250
Get a hold of Sei--

72
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,083
Right.

73
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,000
Oops, I slipped!

74
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
Let me down, you
crazy little bitches!

75
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,875
Get me down from here...!

76
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,166
You two are going to regret
this, I promise you that!

77
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,458
My attorney's gonna sue you
both and send you to prison...!

78
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
Jackass!

79
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,958
Wh-What is it?

80
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,750
Not again--

81
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,458
Jo?

82
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,666
Is it fixed?

83
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,541
Well, I switched out all of the
major components with new ones,

84
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,000
but it didn't make
much difference.

85
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,000
The insides were all melted.

86
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,375
Here's your culprit...

87
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,541
What is it?

88
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,500
Um... To be honest
with you...? No idea.

89
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,333
Jo...! Heads up...

90
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,666
Leo's on the phone for you.

91
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,791
What's the old man want?

92
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,750
I appreciate you
helping me out, Jo.

93
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,666
What exactly is it
you need me to do?

94
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,583
Wherever there's cybot action,

95
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,333
there's gonna be a crap
ton of combat data...

96
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,000
I download this stuff from
all kinds of sources...

97
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,125
I find it comes in
handy with Jango.

98
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,541
Downloading with permission

99
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,833
or just helping yourself
to whatever you want?

100
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,583
Hey! These files are
collectors items!

101
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,541
I graciously archive
them for fun and profit.

102
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,625
So you're a data thief.

103
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,875
Oh, don't make me out
to be such a bad guy...

104
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,291
I take only one a day...

105
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,500
A real pro utilizes all
resources at his disposal.

106
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,625
We got about
thirty minutes left.

107
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,166
What's wrong?

108
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,541
Nothing... Just a headache...

109
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,125
Hurry it up... I got a bad
feeling about this.

110
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,708
What now?!

111
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,791
Bad guys, obviously.

112
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,666
Let's move!

113
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,000
It's Leo! We got a situation!

114
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,458
I don't know who these guys are
but they're armed to the teeth!

115
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,708
Jo's still here, send Jango!

116
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,125
Make a hard right, now!

117
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,958
Whaddaya think I am?
Some kinda racecar driver?

118
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,250
Old man...

119
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,541
Stay here, Leo, don't move!

120
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,625
Yeah...

121
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:05,166
These are my-- No...
they're not my memories...

122
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,541
Someone--someone's
watching me...!

123
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,000
But who?!

124
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,500
Ah-ha!

125
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
Found you, bastard!

126
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,541
Don't be shy!

127
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,666
Quit playing hard to get
and come down from there!

128
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,500
Can't get down by yourself?

129
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,416
Then let me help you!

130
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,708
Great! Just what I need!

131
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,333
Son of a bitch!

132
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,000
It's about time
you showed yourself!

133
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,375
Don't do it!

134
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,583
Wha--?!

135
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,875
Why are you... doing this?
What will this accomplish?!

136
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,458
That figures...
Just like all the rest...

137
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,916
You got a death wish!

138
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,500
Damn, he's strong...
and well trained...

139
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,166
Doesn't seem like a cybot pilot.

140
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,333
What's the matter?!

141
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,666
Lost the will to fight?!

142
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,875
Listen buddy, I am in no
mood to fight you either...

143
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,041
I think maybe we just got
off on the wrong foot.

144
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:46,166
Don't suppose you've seen a
giant cybot pass through here.

145
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,666
My hands are still tingling...

146
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,375
That's a hell of
a sword you've got.

147
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,583
No... I see now, it's not
the sword that's mighty,

148
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,125
it's the man who wields it...

149
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:07,083
Huh? Of all the times...

150
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,083
Yeah, I know...
Real tough girl, huh?

151
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,000
What's wrong?
You're not eating?

152
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,541
This village is ancient.
Are you alone here?

153
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,916
Have you been here a long time?

154
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,583
You're a pretty quiet guy...

155
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,375
Were you born here
in this village...?

156
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,958
Then why are you here?

157
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,625
What happened to everyone else?

158
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,000
Thanks. The fish
was really good...

159
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,833
Have you got any water?

160
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,041
He doesn't talk at all...

161
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,875
Bet something terrible
happened here.

162
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,166
I understand ...

163
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,375
You were brought to this
village get rid of that demon.

164
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,291
But, you couldn't defeat it.

165
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,708
You and the others...
fought that thing...

166
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,083
with everything you had

167
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,708
to try and save the people
of this village...

168
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,083
But you couldn't protect
them, could you?

169
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:48,041
And, now you alone remain
here... to exact your revenge.

170
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,208
Tell me... Is that thing still
hiding in the mountains?

171
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,041
Finally decided to come out
and show your face, huh?!

172
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,083
No, wait!

173
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,458
You can't kill it with a sword!

174
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,333
I don't know why I can't move

175
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,208
My mind is lost in this cloud

176
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:29,583
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

177
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:37,208
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

178
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:42,500
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

179
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,666
and smile with each other

180
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,958
It hurts inside
when we don't...

181
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,583
we don't... we don't
know what to say

182
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,333
I only hope that
someone will be there,

183
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,416
and be watching over me

184
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,416
so take my hand,

185
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:13,208
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

186
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,583
The roars of the steel demon
echo across the battlefield

187
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,666
and stir a hidden
memory from Jo's past.

188
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,291
The ancient warrior awakes!

189
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,458
Next Burst Angel:
"Dueling Angels."
