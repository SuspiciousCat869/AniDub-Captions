1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,333
You sure are hard
on this thing, Jo.

24
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,708
It's creaking like
rusty old bucket.

25
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,875
Well, it's still in one piece--

26
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,541
No thanks to you.

27
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,500
Aw, I hurt your baby!

28
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,583
Change its diaper,
it'll be fine!

29
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,875
No, it will not be fine!

30
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,125
I swear, Sei. Every time
those two get together

31
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,875
it always ends up
in an argument.

32
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,833
Well, Leo built Jango,
and Jo likes to play rough...

33
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,875
Can't be helped.

34
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,541
At any rate, I can't do
nothin' 'bout it here.

35
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,291
I'll have to take
it to my shop...

36
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,916
You know... major re-fit.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,583
So, how long will it take?

38
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,500
That depends,
how fast do you want it?

39
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,291
You've got three days...

40
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,583
You never know when we
might see some action.

41
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,125
Special attention like
that will cost you extra.

42
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,916
Don't worry ladies, I'll have
him back to you in no time!

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,541
Great, I'll have to ask for more
money from my grandfather.

44
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,625
Cool, we're off
for three days!

45
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,208
Hey Jo...?

46
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,958
You want to go hang out at that
amusement park up the street?

47
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,583
What kind of enemies
are there to shoot at?

48
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,375
Could you stop thinking
about work for five minutes?

49
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,083
I'm talking about
having some fun!

50
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,458
I'll pass.

51
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,750
I can't believe you'd
pick bounty hunting

52
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,250
over roller coasters!

53
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,125
What is this...?

54
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,750
Oh, now that's just
downright disgusting...

55
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,541
I don't know who
you think you are...

56
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,708
but no one messes with Amy!

57
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,291
What do you need at
the Cyber-Market?

58
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,458
Um... I need to get some new
components for my computer.

59
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,458
Why don't you just order them
online and have them delivered?

60
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,791
That's no good...!

61
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,958
I have to be there to
check them out first hand!

62
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,416
Last time you tried that excuse,

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,750
you blew a small fortune
on a bunch of useless crap.

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,791
You're a classic example
of impulse buying.

65
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,708
I can't let you do
any more shopping until

66
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,750
you learn some self-restraint
and financial responsibility.

67
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,500
But, that's not fair...!

68
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,041
I promise I'll think
before I buy today!

69
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,125
Aw, just give it a rest, Amy--

70
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,291
It's rare we get Sei
in such a good mood...

71
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,833
So chill out, huh?

72
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,291
Hey wait a minute...
You're all dressed up!

73
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,958
Cool, let's go.

74
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,583
What is going on here?

75
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,833
What? I can't just sit
around here all day long,

76
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,750
I'll go all mush-brain!

77
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,083
You and Jo can
hold down the fort.

78
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,333
That's not fair!

79
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,500
Why do you guys always
get to do the fun stuff?!

80
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,541
Um, because...

81
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:36,000
Sei and I are grown ups and
you are still a little kid.

82
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,708
The city's dangerous, Amy!
So no sneaking out on your own!

83
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,791
Thanks for nothin'.

84
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,625
Even if I did wanna leave,
I don't have any money to spend!

85
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,166
So, you'll be in
Osaka next week?

86
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,250
Yeah, I wanted to
talk it over with Sei

87
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,083
before I left, but she's gone.

88
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,875
Ahh, I wouldn't bother
if I were you...

89
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,000
She's out blowing a small
fortune impulse shopping

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,291
for useless junk...

91
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,791
No self-restraint or
financial responsibility.

92
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,625
You need to find a
good, cheap market

93
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,541
to stock up before you
skip town... I'm your girl!

94
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,291
Sounds perfect! I'd greatly
appreciate it, young lady.

95
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
No need to sound so formal...

96
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,166
Jeez, and I was just starting
to think you were cool!

97
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,291
Um... What is this place?

98
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,458
Doesn't look like there's
much food around here.

99
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:02,166
Sure there is...!
Just trust me okay?

100
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,416
There's so much good stuff
at these resale shops.

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,750
Here, it's the latest
Security Interface module.

102
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,708
I've been holding on to it
for you in case you came by.

103
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, I guess I should
take it and try it out.

104
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,541
Now, how about the
stuff you promised me?

105
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,333
Maybe next time!

106
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,708
Whoa, dude! I want to buy
that rig you're wearing.

107
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,458
Go on! Beat it, you punk!

108
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,291
Hey, check out what I got...
Look familiar?

109
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,916
It's the one they never
released in stores.

110
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,833
Enter a world of
dragons and danger.

111
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,208
Of fantasy and illusion.

112
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,958
The Destiny Brothers
take on 101 dragons in

113
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,250
Dragon Bomber Brothers!

114
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,708
Yeah, maybe when I'm
having trouble sleeping.

115
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,333
Well, maybe you'd
be interested in

116
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,250
the latest of the Alien Ninja
Detective Fighters series?

117
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,416
Time to leave your
mom's basement, dude.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,041
Nobody plays that
kinda junk anymore.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,625
Been puking a whole lot
cuz of the chemicals lately.

120
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,958
Sounds like you're trying
to run a chem.-based medium

121
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,208
through a non-bio
system--not gonna work.

122
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,791
What you need to do is
convert your non-bio system

123
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,541
with organic uptake servos
and see if that helps.

124
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,125
Yeah, maybe...
I think that would work!

125
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,333
Amy, you're brilliant!

126
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,375
What on Earth are
they talking about?

127
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,958
It's weird, you sure do know
a lot of people around here.

128
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,041
Yeah, I've been hanging
around here since I was little.

129
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,125
"Was little?"
As if it's past tense?

130
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,375
How are you folks today?

131
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,833
Just two of you?

132
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,083
Yep...

133
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,541
And, we need your biggest
Modem-Bot, please.

134
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,083
It'll cost you a little
extra. Is that okay?

135
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,791
No prob...! Kyo--money!

136
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,500
Why do I hafta pay?

137
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,750
I'll get Sei to pay you
back when we get home...

138
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,000
C'mon, cough it up already.

139
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,125
I really hate using
my credit card

140
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,666
at these back-alley
kinda places.

141
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,500
Welcome, Amy and Kyo.
Follow me please.

142
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,291
Connection verified. Please
enter your destination.

143
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,083
What's up?

144
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,375
C'mere a sec! Help me move this!

145
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,750
Move it where?

146
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Heavy!

147
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,833
And... stop...!
Put it down right there.

148
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,666
Should you be doing that?

149
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,250
Don't worry, I won't get caught.

150
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,833
Time to let my fingers
work their magic.

151
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,250
This computer is super-powerful

152
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,000
but totally easy
to hack in to...

153
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,041
I'll enter a coded
algorithm loop that will

154
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,250
take down their firewall,
access their mainframe

155
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,625
and trace their signal.

156
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,291
Firewall...?
This doesn't sound--

157
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,375
Yes!

158
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,541
That's you... This is what
you do with your free time?

159
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,791
Now, why would I do something
like that, you idiot...!

160
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,625
Someone out there
is jacking with me!

161
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
Well that can't be legal!

162
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,000
We need to report this to RAPT!

163
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,166
And what would that accomplish?

164
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,333
What the hell?

165
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,208
Hello...? Hello?

166
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,208
Oh, What have you done now?

167
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,208
Shut up! It wasn't me!
I got caught!

168
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,583
By who?

169
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,083
I have no idea. Someone
was monitoring my upload...

170
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,833
We have to get out of here!

171
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,250
What are you trying to pull?!

172
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,958
We were right in the
middle of a business deal!

173
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,625
I demand you refund our money!

174
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,416
I have no idea what's going on!

175
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
We're experiencing
technical difficulties.

176
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,916
Aw, yeah. Finally...

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,625
A demo reel that's
gonna make me a star...

178
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,250
Tomorrow I'll get it to a
producer and the legend begins!

179
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,625
Hey! Wait up!

180
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,958
Wait a minute! My legend!
Where are you going?

181
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,000
Stop!

182
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,041
Ohh, lucky!

183
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,333
No! No, don't do that.

184
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,000
Come back. My legend!

185
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,833
Isn't that the girl?

186
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,833
Yeah, that's her!

187
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,208
Let's go!

188
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,666
No pictures, you jerkwad!

189
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,291
Where you goin'?!

190
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,708
You all right, Amy?

191
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,375
Ohhh, now you've done it.

192
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,583
It was almost funny at first,

193
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,583
but then you went
and made me angry...

194
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,000
You hear me? I'm coming for you!

195
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,833
You don't have to come
if you don't want.

196
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,458
I can't leave you alone in
a dangerous place like this.

197
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,208
We're not quite open yet.
Who's there?

198
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:32,125
It's me, Amy. C'mon open up!

199
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,958
Oh, Amy, how are you, darling?

200
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,958
Good and you?

201
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,416
Right as rain, dear...

202
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,541
So, who's this
young whippersnapper

203
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,958
you have with you, a boyfriend?

204
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,791
You kidding...?
He's my personal chef.

205
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,375
A personal chef-- how marvelous!

206
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,125
What am I doing here?

207
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,083
It was so weird earlier...

208
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,250
Your face was on
every sign in the city.

209
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,125
I know, that's
why I came to you.

210
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,750
I need you to help
me catch the guy

211
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,125
who's transmitting the signal.

212
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,375
I see...

213
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,500
Well you know I'd love
to help you, darling.

214
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,125
But that would put me
in a very tight spot!

215
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,416
Although...

216
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,916
There is some data
you could send my way...

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,458
Again?

218
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,583
C'mon, Amy...!

219
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,291
What'd you go through
all my stuff for?

220
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,333
I needed that Security
Interface Module I got earlier.

221
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,708
Oooh, you look
good enough to eat!

222
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,833
Oh my stars, that's
the tastiest thing

223
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,958
I've put in my mouth... ever!

224
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,375
So, um... Who is that guy?

225
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,125
He's like an underground
tour conductor...

226
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,250
For a price, he has
ways of getting people

227
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,250
wherever they want to go.

228
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,666
Sooo... Any place
special you wanna go?

229
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm in! I got you now!

230
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,500
Marvelous!

231
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,541
It's Amy's turn!

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,583
This is where all of
the tours begin...

233
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:07,875
Each door leads to a distinctly
unique underworld environment.

234
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,875
Okay, so which one
of them do we go in?

235
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,583
This one.

236
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,583
The place has been
abandoned for some time now

237
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,208
but I just recently monitored
some renewed activity.

238
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,000
Your data was streaming
from beyond that light...

239
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm guessing their
processor is over there.

240
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,916
Oh, and here, take this.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,166
What is it?

242
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,375
A data gun that's loaded
with compressed viruses.

243
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,541
A little "thank you"

244
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,208
for bringing that
adorable boy with you.

245
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,250
Thanks.

246
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,000
Good luck! You're gonna need it!

247
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,875
You know, maybe we should
just head home now.

248
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,416
Chickening out already...?

249
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,625
Whatever happened to
protecting me with your life?

250
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,458
I never said that!

251
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,791
You're pathetic, you know that?!

252
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,583
It's like we're
inside a computer.

253
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,750
Hate it when there's
no real dataflow...

254
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,666
I guess we can never
totally get rid of all this

255
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,041
Stone Age pre-quake tech.

256
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,208
What is that?

257
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,458
A spy-bot! They've been
watching us the whole time!

258
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,375
Oh, no you don't!

259
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,875
We've been waiting
for you, Amy dear.

260
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,291
Welcome! Welcome, to our world!

261
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,916
Yes, welcome dearest
Amy... (Yeah.)

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Who are you guys?
How do you know who I am?

263
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,541
Where am I?

264
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,458
You're inside the main processor

265
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,625
that controls our
virtual planet.

266
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,333
Yes... And now you have
been digitized as well!

267
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,833
And, you guys would be who now?

268
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,083
We are the caretakers
of this world.

269
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,291
What's up with the monitors
you have on your faces?

270
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,250
We've undergone
cyborg transplants

271
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,125
to better commune
with the network.

272
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,416
Our consciousnesses have
been joined together

273
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,041
via a virtual Hyper-LAN. (Yeah.)

274
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,833
We anxiously await the time when

275
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,458
the rest of the world
catches up to us. (Yeah.)

276
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,041
One day soon we
will reconnect with

277
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,583
your world and reveal
ourselves to everyone.

278
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,208
Of all people, you, Amy,

279
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,541
are the most qualified
to evolve with us!

280
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,125
Evolve?

281
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,583
You got it!

282
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,666
That is so pathetic!

283
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,041
You're all nuts...!

284
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,916
Going through life
trapped in a machine.

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,250
In this state we have
no need for food, water,

286
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,833
or even restrooms.

287
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,791
We can simulate any sensation
via our electronic sensors.

288
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,666
Your simple, organic body
will someday weaken and die.

289
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,000
Come with us, Amy! (Yeah.)

290
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,708
Stop it!

291
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,125
You can't possibly
enjoy life inside those

292
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,541
cold metallic shells.

293
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,625
What-what did you do to him?

294
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,666
Organic brains are
very inefficient

295
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,208
processors of information.

296
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,541
He's so data-heavy
he's experiencing lag.

297
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,708
Hey! What are you
guys doing to Amy?

298
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,166
Darn you!

299
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,375
Oh! Huh-huh...

300
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,875
We should delete this
meatsack's memories

301
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,208
and speech functions,
then send him back outside!

302
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,875
Okay...

303
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,291
Maybe it would be cool to
evolve with you four studs.

304
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,791
This lame body will only last
a hundred years or so anyway...

305
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,541
I could live forever,
and I'd love to see how

306
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,416
cyber-tech progresses.

307
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,250
Right! Right!
You're exactly right!

308
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,583
Oh, wait...!

309
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
I have a super-cool gift
I want to give you guys...

310
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,916
It's in my bag,
back in the real world.

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,291
Any chance you can
drop us off there?

312
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,250
It's a dump for old electronics.

313
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:19,041
Correct! Most impressive, Amy!

314
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,208
All right, Kyo,
give me the bag now.

315
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,041
Amy, you can't be
serious about this.

316
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,083
Just shut up and
gimme, Cube-Head!

317
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,708
Okay, take it easy!

318
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:33,208
Where is it? That's not it.
It's in here somewhere...

319
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,541
Found it!

320
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,833
That's-that's Dragon
Bomber Brothers!

321
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,166
They never even
released it in stores!

322
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,125
We searched every file-share
but could never find it.

323
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,250
It's incredible! Where on earth
did you find it? (Yeah?)

324
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,958
Oh, I just picked up from
an old friend of mine.

325
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,541
It's sweet. You guys should
really check it out.

326
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,083
Load it up! (Yeah.)

327
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,708
It's amazing!

328
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,125
Utterly unbelieveable!

329
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:13,875
Hurry up!

330
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,208
Let me try, let me try!

331
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,208
Stop hoggin' it!

332
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,416
What happened?
Did you lose already?

333
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,750
Come on, we want to try it, too!

334
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,875
Today, I'll be
preparing roast chicken

335
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,208
with mashed potatoes
and green beans.

336
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,250
What's wrong?

337
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,583
Something's
definitely messed up!

338
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,583
Oh, no! Fatal error!
Complete system crash!

339
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,916
Don't tell me there
was a virus in there...

340
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,583
It's a virus all right!

341
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,875
Prepare to go off line you
sniveling data-faced dorks...!

342
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,625
Now I'll crash your
hard drives for good

343
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,458
with this little number courtesy
of the unevolved world.

344
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,166
Amy, you can't be serious!

345
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,500
You're acting like a total human
and it's making me very upset!

346
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,291
I don't care what you
overgrown toasters think!

347
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,875
Me neither!

348
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,541
Come on, let's go...!

349
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,666
You guys want a
piece of me, huh!

350
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,333
Amy, how could you?

351
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,958
You have betrayed
our emotion chips.

352
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,583
After this, we'll never be
able to trust you again.

353
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,166
Just get out of here!
Get out! Get out!

354
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,208
H-Hey...!
Th-That's dangerous...!

355
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,875
Watch it...! Idiots!

356
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,250
Holy crap...!

357
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,541
We gotta get out of
here right now, Amy.

358
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,125
I can't!

359
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,541
I-- I can't move my legs, Kyo.

360
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,291
I'm... I'm scared!

361
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,541
Hey, wait! What are
you doing?! Stop!

362
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,750
Kyo, stop!

363
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,458
I thought I said
no sneaking out...

364
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,208
I was worried.

365
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,083
Sei has been waiting
here all night.

366
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,625
Were you trying to
kidnap her Kyohei?

367
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,291
No, way! What are
you talking about?!

368
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,416
I couldn't help it that
she got into trouble.

369
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,875
It's okay, I'm just glad
you're both all right.

370
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,083
C'mon... Let's go
back inside, now.

371
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:22,208
What's wrong? Are you
feeling sick or something?

372
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,750
Amy?

373
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,083
Amy...

374
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:33,916
Hey.

375
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,708
What's wrong, hon?

376
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,583
All right, what happened?

377
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,583
I know this is all your fault.

378
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,791
What'd you do?

379
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,458
Who? Me? Nothing.

380
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,000
There was this weird computer
world that she took us to

381
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,250
and these guys with
TV's on their head and--

382
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,416
What the hell are
you talking about?

383
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm telling the truth! Really!

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,791
I don't know why I can't move

385
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,666
My mind is lost in this cloud

386
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:30,041
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

387
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:37,666
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

388
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,958
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

389
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:47,125
and smile with each other

390
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,416
It hurts inside
when we don't...

391
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,041
we don't... we don't
know what to say

392
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:58,791
I only hope that
someone will be there,

393
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,875
and be watching over me

394
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,875
so take my hand,

395
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:13,666
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

396
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,791
The city of Osaka is
overrun by terrorists.

397
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,791
And as Jo investigates
another monster outbreak,

398
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,750
she runs afoul of
the local constabulary!

399
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:45,041
Next Burst Angel: "Eastern
Angel, Western Hawk."
