1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,791
Come on!

24
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,333
Ease up, will ya? It's hard
to do this with just one hand.

25
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:11,458
All right! Come on, baby!
Mama needs a new pair of shoes!

26
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,291
Keep it rolling and you
could double your money

27
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,333
--on the next spin.
--Oh yeah! Come on!

28
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,375
Let's go! Big money!

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,750
There they are!

30
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,625
Pay me! Pay me!

31
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,291
Hey! That's supposed to pay
my rent! Someone help me!

32
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,500
Hey! What are you doing?
Get back here!

33
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,500
Target has fled on foot, leaving
the High Stakes Pachinko Parlor,

34
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,333
traveling east on Third Street.

35
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,166
Move your ass!

36
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,250
I'm going! I'm going!

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,833
Attention all Ikebukuro units!

38
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,833
Target sighted near the
Fourth street subway station.

39
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,875
Secure all entries!

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,333
No use trying to get
lost in the crowd, Jo.

41
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,625
There's no escape
from my subordinates.

42
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,166
Meg's trapped in the crow's
nest at the top of Tokyo Tower

43
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,083
and the NI-50 in
Kyo's bloodstream

44
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,041
will activate at 6:00 am.
Less than five hours left.

45
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,083
So, do you think
Kyo's gonna make it?

46
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,625
If we can get the
NI-50 out in time.

47
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,250
But, then what
will happen to Meg?

48
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,583
We will get Meg back,
of course. Trust me.

49
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,541
But right now, Jo is hell-bent
on rescuing her by herself.

50
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,750
Unfortunately, that means
she's willing to put

51
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,208
Kyo's life in danger as well.

52
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,833
Take the airship and see
if you can get a fix on them.

53
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,875
Um... I'll be right back.

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:49,083
Again? Lay off the sodas, Amy.
They're bad for your bladder.

55
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,750
Sorry. It won't take long.

56
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,666
This is terrible.
Without Kyo around

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,875
we'll be back to eating
fast food and cold pizza,

58
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,291
not that I don't want Meg and Jo
to make it through this, too.

59
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,791
What to do, what to do!

60
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,916
We need to hurry, this thing
inside me's ticking away!

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,750
We get hasty, we could
walk right into a trap.

62
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,458
Great. Perfect. Sei's little
minions are all over the place!

63
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,833
Just my luck.

64
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,875
What did I ever do in
my measly little life

65
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,958
to deserve something like this?

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,166
Well, sitting there whining
about it isn't gonna get

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,291
that thing out of you any
quicker. Get a grip on yourself.

68
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,958
Get a grip on myself?

69
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,541
You're not the one who's
gonna burst in four hours.

70
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,041
Look, once I kill that
bird and get Meg back,

71
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,875
I'll hand you over to Sei.
Until then, calm down!

72
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,166
So, now we have to figure out
a way to get to Tokyo Tower

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,791
before we all run
out of time! Got that?

74
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,708
Here's the deal: if you help me
with this now, you get to live.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,750
Fine, it's a deal.
I'll try my best.

76
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,791
Hello!

77
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,875
We're looking for a rave

78
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,708
that's supposed to be going
on in this neighborhood.

79
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,375
Judging by the handcuffs,
I guess you're going too.

80
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
So, where's it going down?

81
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:23,333
We're not from around here
and I think we're kinda lost.

82
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,166
Ask those guys over there.

83
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,875
Oh yeah, they're working
security for the party.

84
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:34,083
Come on. Ogitagi is supposed
to start in like ten minutes!

85
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,791
Why don't you tell us man?

86
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,625
What the hell are
you talking about?

87
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,791
I get it! They're testing to see
if they should let us in or not.

88
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,458
Look, we already know
it's a secret party.

89
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,666
Okay, enough! Don't you
brats have parents?

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,458
No way, you guys
have to let us in!

91
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,166
Yeah, we got all dressed up
and everything!

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,166
You could've fooled me, lady.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,166
Jo, no! You can't shoot in here!

94
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,166
Jo!

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
I'm sorry! The station
was just too crowded!

96
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,166
Yeah, I know.

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,541
♪ Hmm, hmm, hmm, Loosey
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, Crazy ♪

98
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,708
I sure cleaned up tonight.

99
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,708
Sorry, mister!

100
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,916
Hey, man! That's my bike!

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,541
Dammit!

102
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,458
Okay, I finally picked
them up! Sorry Jo.

103
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,916
That's odd. Why are they staying
out in the open like this?

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
It's not like Jo
to be so concerned

105
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,208
for the safety of
innocent by-standers.

106
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,750
Attention! All units!

107
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,833
Target is traveling north on
Kasuga Street by motorcycle.

108
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,833
Report to Bai-Lan operatives
in the vicinity at once.

109
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,833
Be careful, Jo.

110
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,625
Your greatest asset, Kyo, could
become your biggest weakness.

111
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,291
Sei here.
What've you got for me?

112
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,375
Roger that. I'll send
back-up right away.

113
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,250
Secure the perimeter
and seize the equipment

114
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,458
before the police show up.

115
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,125
So? What did they say?

116
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,708
They've got a location on
the Crow's hiding place.

117
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,875
It put the girls it snatched
into power plants

118
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,166
that extract lymph fluid
from their bodies.

119
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,916
Ehh? What for?

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,625
Probably because the
crow needs it to survive.

121
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,250
It's an essential
substance for the growth

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,583
of any organically
based machine.

123
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,416
I gotcha. Because the
crow's body is so huge,

124
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
and it keeps burning off energy,

125
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,750
it needed more and more fluid
in order to stay functioning.

126
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,750
So, does that mean it's
an animal or a cybot?

127
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,958
Maybe an evolved form
of both. But for now,

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,416
I need you to stay focused on

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,166
keeping track of Jo
and Kyohei, all right?

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,375
Hello. Excuse me!

131
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,791
She's been hurt.
I need some bandages.

132
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,458
Yeah, sure. Hold on a minute!

133
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,541
We do not have time for this.

134
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,500
But, you're bleeding pretty bad.
You need medical attention.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Let's have a look, here.

136
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,291
Oy, this is really bad.
What happened to you?

137
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,000
It's time to die.

138
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,666
Let her go!

139
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,666
Outta the way, dumbass!

140
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,500
Not so fast.

141
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,625
Punk-ass kids.
They just escaped on foot.

142
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,500
They're moving north
toward the dome.

143
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,250
One of them is
seriously injured.

144
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,791
Hate sayin' "I told you so."

145
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:43,875
I'm sorry. It's just your
arm was... Is it okay?

146
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,333
C'mon Jo, stay with me! Jo? Jo!

147
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,333
You lost them?

148
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah. They disappeared
somewhere around Jinbou-cho.

149
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,750
Amy! Please tell me you're
not purposely ignoring them.

150
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,458
No, no way. I'm on
your side! I promise.

151
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,458
For real! I'd never
do something like that.

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,958
How you feeling?

153
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,791
What time is it?

154
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,083
About five minutes after three.

155
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,416
You look better. I was
starting to get worried.

156
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,791
You passed out on me.

157
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,333
Lucky for us,
those guys came along.

158
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,041
That guy over there
removed the handcuffs,

159
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,208
said he used to be a locksmith.

160
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,750
Say, you guys
care for a cocktail?

161
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,750
We got soup over
here if you want it.

162
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,583
You kids don't start
any trouble here

163
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,291
or the cops'll trash our camp.

164
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,916
I got my eye on ya'.

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,750
The truth is,
we lose this place,

166
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,166
we ain't got no
wheres else to go.

167
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,583
We gotta keep a low profile,
if you know what I mean.

168
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,541
Here, have some.

169
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,666
Don't know your story, but you
ain't gonna get very far in life

170
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,208
gettin' shot fulla
holes like you did.

171
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,250
And, the law don't give
two cents about nobody.

172
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,291
No wonder there' so many
youngins runnin' off to be cops.

173
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,083
It's sad. Everybody
wantin' to be a cop

174
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,166
so they can push others around.

175
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,291
Yeah. But none of 'em
are Japanese folks.

176
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,791
This country don't belong
to the Japanese anymore.

177
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,208
Not like that's
anything new, though.

178
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,208
Why didn't you run?

179
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,541
Well, how could I?

180
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,166
You were hurt really bad

181
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,250
and I couldn't just
leave you by yourself.

182
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,791
It was my fault you
got shot, after all.

183
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,125
You know, you're a
very strong person, Jo.

184
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,166
I would've given up long ago.
I admire you for that.

185
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,458
Give it a rest.

186
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,458
I don't take
compliments too well.

187
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,125
Make me all sick
and itchy inside.

188
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,291
Yeah, so, what was
your name again?

189
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,291
It's Kyohei. Kyohei Tachibana.

190
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,791
Never caught it before.

191
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,625
Oh, really?

192
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,875
Oh, your appetite's back.
That's always a good start.

193
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,541
You want more?

194
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,541
I can always run out to the park
and hunt down some more meat,

195
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,208
if there ain't
enough there for ya.

196
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,625
No, thank you.
We have to go now.

197
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,833
We're leaving, Kyohei.

198
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,416
She sure keeps him on
a pretty short leash.

199
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,083
Ahh, he's all right.

200
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,750
He wouldn't be runnin'
around with her

201
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,708
if he didn't want to be.

202
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,333
We have to run. Can you keep up?

203
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,083
Yeah. I'll be just fine.

204
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,125
Here goes.

205
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:33,708
Hot noodles, get your
hot steaming noodles!

206
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,041
Hey! Hold up a minute, would ya?

207
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,083
You can do it.

208
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,750
You made it. Good work.

209
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,375
How'd you get here?

210
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,166
Outta my way Sei.

211
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,458
Be smart Jo.
The enemy is right above us.

212
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,375
Besides, do really think you
can make it past all of us?

213
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,083
If that's how you
want to play it.

214
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,000
You know I can go the distance.

215
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:31,708
But, when I go down, keep in
mind, you go down with me.

216
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,666
The enemy's hideout
has been secured, Jo.

217
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,458
There's no place
left for it to escape.

218
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,708
If we work together we can
both have what we want.

219
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:46,208
Honestly, how did you plan
to fight it without Jango?

220
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,083
Work with me here.
Hand over Kyo.

221
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,125
No deal! The Crow's
not going to play ball

222
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,375
unless we trade both
of the hostages.

223
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,833
I can beat it!

224
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,541
Just let me have Jango and
stay the hell out of my way!

225
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,541
All right, then.
We'll let Kyo make the choice.

226
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,041
So, what do you think?

227
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,625
Do you want to take
your chances with Jo?

228
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,375
Or stay and get
the NI-50 out now?

229
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:22,666
It is your life on the line.
So it's up to you.

230
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,958
It's not... I can't
just choose like that.

231
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:37,166
I... I, um...
I think that... Well...

232
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,541
We should let Jo go and, um...

233
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:47,250
I think... she can do it.
I know Jo can save Meg!

234
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,416
Damn it, Sei.

235
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,416
Calm down, that dart
may save his life.

236
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,583
It'll slow down his
metabolism for a while.

237
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,208
Which will in turn
keep the NI-50

238
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,625
from activating when
it's supposed to.

239
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,583
But, keep in mind Jo,
it won't last long.

240
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,625
All this is just so
you can get your hands

241
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,541
on the crow's brain,
isn't it? Tell me.

242
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,416
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
been here waiting for us.

243
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,833
I just want to see Meg and Kyo
rescued safely, that's all.

244
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,125
But, I need you Jo.
I need your strength.

245
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,458
And, I need your uncanny ability

246
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,458
to kill two birds
with one stone.

247
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,458
Right now, I'm gonna
make sure Meg is safe

248
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,750
and kick that crow's ass.

249
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,000
But then I'm coming back

250
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,416
to knock that damn
smirk off your face.

251
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,416
I suppose that's fair.

252
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,583
What you're after is
inside this man's body!

253
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,083
Meg!

254
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,458
Meg, can you get over here?

255
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,625
Jo.

256
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,416
Look out!

257
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,666
What is that?

258
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,625
No way!

259
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,708
Jo can't lose!
This isn't happening!

260
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

261
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,333
We've got to figure something
out here! Jo just fell!

262
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,791
You damn crow!
Now you've done it!

263
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,291
Yeah, Jo!

264
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,041
Where you think you're going?

265
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,791
Jo, do you read me?

266
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm trying to locate
the central core lock

267
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,291
that houses the
crow's control systems.

268
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,000
Better make it quick!

269
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,291
Amy, whatta ya got?

270
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,250
Jo! Uploading to your screen.
That's the crow's weak spot!

271
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,666
All right! You did it, Jo!

272
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,375
Well, at least you left us a few
scraps of metal we can analyze.

273
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,208
Most of it's charred
beyond recognition though.

274
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,875
Didn't have a choice.

275
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,083
I know. Recovery'll be tough,
but we'll make the best of it.

276
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,625
How's Kyohei?

277
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,333
Concerned? He's fine.
We got it out in time.

278
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,875
And all the girls the
crow took are okay too.

279
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,375
That's a new one for
you, saving people.

280
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,125
It's new for you too.

281
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,541
Don't patronize me.

282
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,166
That reminds me, weren't
you saying something

283
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,958
about knocking the
smirk off my face?

284
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,958
Well, I'm waiting.

285
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,458
I'll have to get
back to you on that.

286
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,041
I gotta go check on
a friend of mine.

287
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,625
I don't know why I can't move

288
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,500
My mind is lost in this cloud

289
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:29,875
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

290
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:37,500
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

291
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,791
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

292
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,958
and smile with each other

293
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,250
It hurts inside
when we don't...

294
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,875
we don't... we don't
know what to say

295
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:58,625
I only hope that
someone will be there,

296
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,708
and be watching over me

297
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,708
so take my hand,

298
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:13,500
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

299
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,583
An old man who
desires eternal peace,

300
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,333
and a youth entrusted
with that hope.

301
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,166
But when all becomes fiction,
the bloodshed begins.

302
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,458
Next Burst Angel:
Party of the Dragon
