1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,000
You guys hear that?

24
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,791
Whoa!

25
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,458
Aww, crap! What are
you guys doin'?

26
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,041
I'm here in Shibuya,
where you can see

27
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,625
a RAPT mobile unit
conducting an urban...

28
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,250
Let's see here...

29
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:33,083
120 grams of cake flour...
442 calories...

30
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,166
2 eggs... 170 calories...

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,208
So, the metabolic
rate is 1.02 times...

32
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,291
What's going on?

33
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,875
What's happening... to Tokyo?

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,833
We have no need for wolves
or stray dogs in this city.

35
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:08,500
All our ranch needs... is a
flock of gentle little sheep.

36
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,541
Obedient, mindless,
ignorant sheep.

37
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,583
You seem to be doing well.
I'm glad to see it.

38
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,416
Thank you for coming, Sei.

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
Just seeing your face

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,083
is the best medicine
for me at this point.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,500
How have you been? Well, I hope.

42
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,625
I am... Thank you for asking.

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,458
Sei... Ever since
you were a child,

44
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,708
you have had a strong sense
of responsibility to others.

45
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,875
But you always try to carry
the burden by yourself.

46
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
Grandfather...

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,875
You needn't any longer, Sei.

48
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,416
I can't help but
feel responsible

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,083
for placing such a weight
upon your shoulders...

50
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,041
It is my fault.

51
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,458
Nothing in this world
lasts forever.

52
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,791
Everything in existence
undergoes change...

53
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,416
Even with Bai-Lan,
nothing is absolute.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
I had a dream this morning.

55
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,625
In it, a golden dragon ascended
from a sea of crashing waves,

56
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,541
through a storm,
and up into the heavens.

57
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,916
Sei... For once,

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,250
forget you are the grandaughter
of the Bai-Lan Elder...

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
And instead, follow
the path that you,

60
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,916
as a human being,
believes to be best...

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,375
It is on that path

62
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:37,041
where you will find
what it is you must do.

63
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,791
Hello? Amy? It's been awhile...

64
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,083
Hey Sei! Long time no hear!

65
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,041
Heck, I'm surprised
you even found me.

66
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,625
Never mind that...

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,375
I've had something urgent come
up, and I could use your help...

68
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,666
Are you up to it?

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,500
I dunno...
Is this a Bai-Lan job?

70
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,541
No, it's for me.
A personal request.

71
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,208
I want you to locate Jo and Meg.

72
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,791
Well yeah, of course I'll do it.

73
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,416
I'll be at Leo's.
Keep me posted.

74
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:35,458
I would kill for a nice,
hot cup of coffee right now.

75
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,166
Jo, are you all right?

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,833
Meg? Where are we?

77
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,000
Not sure. On a beach somewhere.

78
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,291
What happened to Maria?

79
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:51,083
She died... So that you and
I could get off the ship.

80
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,375
She's dead?

81
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,541
I see.

82
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,375
But... I'm really
glad you're alive, Jo!

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,583
Sure, I feel sorry for Maria...

84
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:05,583
but you're the most important
person I have in my whole life.

85
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,791
Once my clothes are dry,
I'll head into town

86
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,958
and pick up some food
and stuff for you to wear.

87
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,625
You just stay here and
rest until then, okay?

88
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,916
Yeah, sure... My head
still feels a little hazy...

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,666
I'll try to sleep
it off for a while.

90
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,083
Jo, I was thinking.

91
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,625
'Bout what?

92
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,875
When you're feeling better,
let's take a trip somewhere...

93
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,416
You know, just get away
from all this craziness.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,583
Find a place with
no bad guys to kill

95
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,333
where we can have a happy
life, just you and me...

96
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,708
What do you think? Sound good?

97
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,833
Sleep well, Jo.

98
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,583
From now on, I'll protect you.

99
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,166
This doesn't make sense.
Fighting is all I've ever known.

100
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't even comprehend
not wanting to fight...

101
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,083
What am I supposed to do, Jo?

102
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,375
Live on and you'll
find the answer.

103
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,541
Maria.

104
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,875
Is it true...? Are you
really gone forever?

105
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,666
Jo! Hit the dirt!

106
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,666
Oh yeah, now that felt good.

107
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,250
I mean that
felt real good...

108
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,541
O-kay...

109
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,708
Ugh. Gross!
What are those things?

110
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,583
Puppets... Controlled
by monster brains.

111
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,791
Anyway, how did
you find me here?

112
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,416
Oh no, please, there's
no need to thank me.

113
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,250
I only saved your hide
from certain death.

114
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,958
Not yet!

115
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,625
There's one more left. Above us!

116
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
Friend of those other
guys, I take it.

117
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,541
Looks that way...
This one's a bit tougher.

118
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,458
Who is that in there?

119
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,458
It's Leo.

120
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,125
What is that?

121
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a micro-beacon
they implanted in her...

122
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,625
This is how they were
able to find her.

123
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,708
But... Thanks to
this little bugger,

124
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,375
we were able to
find her as well.

125
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,250
Sei sent you?

126
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah.

127
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,458
She told me where she had
Jango and the trailer stashed.

128
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,916
And she had Amy hack the
micro-beacon to track you down.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,083
I see... Well then... Did she
happen to say anything else?

130
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,083
All she said was that she's
going to RAPT headquarters.

131
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,666
Don't get me goin' 'bout RAPT.

132
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,500
They're pretty much
runnin' Tokyo now...

133
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,125
And they got no concept
of proper law enforcement.

134
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,208
Haulin' in anyone who
breaks even the tiniest law.

135
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,458
Last I heard, Sei's group
was working with RAPT...

136
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,166
Why the hell would they
willingly give Jango back to me?

137
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,375
Ah... I almost forgot. Sei left
me one more thing for you.

138
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,583
Here.

139
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,875
This is... from Sei?

140
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,458
Here's the deal...

141
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,166
I have been requested to assist
RAPT in a special operation...

142
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,375
Bai-Lan's new leadership has
decided to merge the syndicate

143
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,416
with the organization
that's been controlling

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,791
RAPT in secrecy.

145
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,541
So are you a member
of RAPT now, Sei?

146
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,125
No! It's not like that at all...

147
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,666
The situation
I've been put in...

148
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,583
I know.

149
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,416
So tell me your plan.

150
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:32,166
Wait for me, Sei.
Just hang on 'til I get there.

151
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,875
I'm going to RAPT headquarters.

152
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,208
That's my girl!

153
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,875
Naturally, we'll have
your back the whole way.

154
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,250
Now this makes beating up
Daddy and running away worth it!

155
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,208
Don't do this!

156
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,291
This is RAPT
we're talking about!

157
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,625
You can't possibly beat them!

158
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,625
There's no reason
for you to do this.

159
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,458
Like I was telling
you earlier...

160
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,291
We can just get out of here...

161
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,541
Go far away and have
a happy life together.

162
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,708
You're always fighting...

163
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:21,666
always risking everything...
always tearing yourself up.

164
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,875
But there's no reason for you
to hurt yourself anymore, Jo!

165
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,041
Come with me!

166
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,875
Please Jo.

167
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,625
Meg... Sei plans
on fighting alone.

168
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,708
She's taking on RAPT, trying to
free Tokyo from their control...

169
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,458
Then she can get to the true
enemy pulling the strings,

170
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,708
and destroy them too...

171
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:48,458
I'm going... I have to.
I can't let Sei die.

172
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,916
Then... then I'm
going with you...!

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,583
I'll follow you to Hell
and back if I have to...

174
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,875
I'll never leave your side--
no matter what!

175
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,625
Listen to me, Meg.

176
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:03,375
I'm not... a normal human being.

177
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,083
I was built for war. I'm no
more than a living weapon.

178
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,166
Believe me, I didn't
ask to be this way...

179
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,458
But I am...

180
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,416
And if I can do something
with these abilities

181
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,541
I've been given...
something positive...

182
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,750
Then I have to try. It feels
like it's what I'm fated to do.

183
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,791
And I can't run from my fate.

184
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,416
What happened to you...?

185
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,000
It's like you're not even
the Jo I know anymore!

186
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,666
My Jo was always kind and
she always protected me...!

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,000
Whenever I was in trouble,
she came to my rescue...

188
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,333
And she never, ever
let me leave her side...

189
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,833
Goodbye Meg... I'm sorry.

190
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,791
From now on, Meg...

191
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,416
You must fight for
someone who needs you...

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,750
That is what your
future holds...

193
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,916
It's the future you
must now search for.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,083
No!

195
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:05,125
That's not the kind of future
I want. Without you, I... I...

196
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,916
I know... You can
stop crying now, Meg.

197
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Really?

198
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,875
So you mean... I can,
come with you then?

199
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,208
No.

200
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,500
I'll go prep the trailer...
We gotta move.

201
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,125
Forgive me... Meg.

202
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,750
Amy, do you copy? This is Jo.

203
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,875
We're on our way to
demolish RAPT headquarters.

204
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,083
Bring me up to speed.

205
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,500
Roger that, Jo...

206
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,375
My end of the operation
is underway...

207
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,916
RAPT has set up blockades on
every road leading into Tokyo.

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,250
There are large barricades
on the Mega-Highways

209
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,750
being defended by Guard Cybots.

210
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,125
Plus, they have a whole bunch of

211
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,333
brand new models guarding
RAPT headquarters.

212
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,541
Jo, if you can break
through the barricade...

213
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,958
I can totally fry their
com circuits into oblivion.

214
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,375
Sounds like a plan.

215
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,708
I'm Sei, from Bai-Lan...

216
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,375
Please, inform Mr. Glenford

217
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,000
I've come on an urgent
business matter.

218
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,916
Jo, please don't go!

219
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,583
Was it a dream?

220
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,291
J-Jo.

221
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,750
Jo! You idiot!

222
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,791
Target acquired.

223
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,708
Leaving downtown,
heading for Shinjuku fast.

224
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,500
Son of a bitch...!
Outta the way!

225
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,500
Special delivery, bastards!
This one's straight from Osaka!

226
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,500
Okay everybody. Are you ready?

227
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,916
--You know it, Amy!
--I'm all set, girl!

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,375
All right...
Begin upload... Now!

229
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,375

[TEXT] "Fools" "Idiots"
"Imbeciles" "Stupid"

231
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,708
Alert! Alert! Deploy all units
and secure the perimeter.

232
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,041
Here they come!

233
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,708
'Kay, Jo... This is your cue!

234
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,416
What?!

235
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,416
Oh, you're just asking for it!

236
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,541
Aw, shit!

237
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,083
Jo, watch out!

238
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,458
This wouldn't happen to be the
urgent matter you spoke of...?

239
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,458
Don't tell me you came all
the way down here for this.

240
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,458
Yes. That's right.

241
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,833
I arranged the whole thing

242
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,250
so I could get you
right where I want you.

243
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,791
Really...? Are you sure...?

244
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,500
In doing this,
you are guaranteeing

245
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,875
Bai-Lan's future
will be forfeit.

246
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,416
Yes, but so will yours.

247
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,083
This is it! Go time!

248
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,083
[TEXT] "Fools" "Idiots"
"Imbeciles" "Stupid"

249
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
We're back on line!

250
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,208
What the--?!

251
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,041
Do you really think you've won?

252
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,375
If you take my life,
it will accomplish nothing...

253
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,250
I am merely a part
of the program.

254
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,208
When damaged, the program
will repair itself

255
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,750
and return to normal...
And the cycle will continue.

256
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,041
We will feed the
sheep of this nation.

257
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,291
We will shear and slaughter
them as we see fit...

258
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,666
And they will live their lives

259
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,416
completely oblivious
to this fact.

260
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,333
You and your cause
will be crushed...

261
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,250
Your deaths will be pointless...

262
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,375
You can't possibly
hope to change a thing.

263
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,041
Sei!

264
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,833
Jo.

265
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,750
Shoot that thing!

266
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,625
You just entered
a whole new world...

267
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,500
Welcome to Hell!

268
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,708
Jo... Keep fighting.

269
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,666
Farewell. Jo.

270
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:33,250
I don't know why I can't move

271
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,125
My mind is lost in this cloud

272
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:44,500
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

273
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:52,333
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

274
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,791
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

275
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,750
and smile with each other

276
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,916
It hurts inside
when we don't...

277
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,500
we don't... we don't
know what to say

278
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:13,250
I only hope that
someone will be there,

279
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,333
and be watching over me

280
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,333
so take my hand,

281
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:28,125
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky
