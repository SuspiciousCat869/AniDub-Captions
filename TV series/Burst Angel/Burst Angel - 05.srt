1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,958
Aw, man. Clouds have it so easy.

24
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,833
The crime rate in most of
the major metropolitan areas

25
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,791
has been steadily dropping
since the year 2020.

26
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,916
Most of this success
can be attributed

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,291
to a prevention program
initiated at the time.

28
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,333
Who's she kidding?
Nobody believes this crap.

29
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,250
Maybe the truth would keep
me from falling asleep.

30
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,416
As the program
became less centralized,

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,958
its integration with R.A.P.T.

32
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,541
has become much more fluid--

33
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,375
Achoo! Ahh!

34
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,083
My bad. Allergies, you know?

35
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,083
Uh... Wh-What do you want?

36
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,791
Meg, you just don't seem to
fit in here very well, do you?

37
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,666
Just being around you makes
me want to get into trouble!

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,833
What?

39
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,208
Oh, yeah, Meg!
You're full of surprises,

40
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,083
plus we think you're so funny!

41
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,500
Y'all really think I'm funny?

42
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,416
Absolutely.

43
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,041
Oh, you! What can
I say? You got me!

44
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,375
I'm just a regular
comedian, I tell ya!

45
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,541
You know, I really appreciate
you guys welcoming me.

46
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,833
Well, honestly,
we wanted to find out

47
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,708
if there was something
wrong with you.

48
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,208
Whadda you mean?

49
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,708
Like, maybe you've been sick
and missed a lot of school.

50
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,750
Or maybe you were
a real troublemaker

51
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,958
and you got kicked out of your
last school and sent here.

52
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,083
But, now that we've met
you, you seem to be okay,

53
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,791
nothing weird.

54
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,833
Look, don't get the wrong idea.

55
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,208
Things are just really
boring around here

56
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,083
and you're something
new and interesting.

57
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,291
We just wanted to make
sure you weren't going to

58
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,541
bust up our circle of friends.

59
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,666
Hey! That's cool, I understand.

60
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,250
You guys got nothing
to worry about!

61
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,416
We'll just have to make the
circle a little wider. Right?

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,291
Oh, Meg!

63
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,625
You're so funny!

64
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,291
I am?

65
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,666
Come on, our next class is
in the upperclassmen wing.

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,000
Make sure you greet them
if you pass them in the halls.

67
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,375
How are you ladies doing today?

68
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,750
We're doing wonderfully.

69
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you very
much for asking.

70
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,041
You're new here.

71
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,666
Uh... Uh, yeah.

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,625
Yes. Sister Angelique,
this is Megumi Mitarai.

73
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,750
She's a new transfer student.
She just started last week.

74
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,291
Well, there is still
much for you to learn

75
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,041
about our fine academy.

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,250
I'd be happy to show you around.

77
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,458
Won't you please
stop by our dorm room

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,291
when you have some free time?

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,875
Good day, then. Ladies.

80
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,208
Stop by her dorm room?

81
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,250
That's great, Meg!

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,541
They must really like you!

83
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,791
You've been invited
to the Ishtar club!

84
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,458
It's quite an honor!

85
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,458
The... The Ishtar Club?

86
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,916
It's an exclusive
members-only club

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,833
founded by Sister Angelique.

88
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
It was set up to serve
as an exemplary model

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,625
for the rest of
the student body.

90
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,125
Only the top students
are selected to join up.

91
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,708
She even got a special charter

92
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,250
from the head of
the school board.

93
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so jealous!

94
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,166
Uh! Well I guess...

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,541
...some people just know
how to recognize greatness

96
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,000
when they see it!

97
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,333
Oh yes, it's finally over!

98
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,708
How can y'all stand to sit
here so quietly for so long?

99
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,541
They say that 'truth lies in
the words of your teachers.'

100
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,541
They also say that
idle chatter and gossip

101
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,083
only attracts laziness
and ignorance.

102
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,208
Yeah! We take it very seriously.

103
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,208
The students of St. Luciana's
believe class is a holy ritual,

104
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,833
in which we commune with
the spirits of our instructors.

105
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,125
If this prayer gets any
longer, we'll never eat!

106
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,458
Aww, same food all week!

107
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,833
I've had it with all these
strict rules and regulations!

108
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,041
This stinks!

109
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,333
Keep it down in there
young lady! It's lights out!

110
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,041
Oh, sorry!

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,541
Oh, shoot! It's time!

112
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,666
Oh wow, this Indian
curry is so super yummy!

113
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,791
Don't you like it, too, Jo?

114
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,791
Yeah, but this soup
is a little spicy.

115
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,833
That's not soup, you
savage, it's curry sauce!

116
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,041
You're not supposed to drink it!

117
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,750
I swear. You have no concept of
fine cuisine, whatsoever, Jo!

118
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,125
Calm down. I made another
one 'specially for you.

119
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,708
And, this one's all mine!

120
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,083
Whoa! This is awesome!

121
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,708
I love you, Kyouhei Tachibana!

122
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,083
Yeah. Um, Amy? I appreciate it.
Really, I do,

123
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,666
but I think I might be just
a little too old for you.

124
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,166
You know?

125
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,041
Aw, geez. Am I the only one
here with a sense of humor?

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,500
Okay y'all, I'm hungry
and I want to come home!

127
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,833
You're busy stuffing your
faces with the good stuff

128
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,041
while I starve
on cafeteria food!

129
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,708
Well, Kyo did make some
killer curry tonight!

130
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,541
Meg! Give us your report!

131
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,208
Everything is going
as planned, Jo.

132
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,833
But this place is like
filled with total whackos.

133
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,416
What do you mean?

134
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
It's just that the girls
are all so prissy!

135
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,791
They're like,
'How do you do?'

136
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,791
And then they look
down their nose and say,

137
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,666
'Ooh, you're so funny!'
It is so obnoxious!

138
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
Oh, and you have to be polite
to the upperclassmen

139
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,458
and no one says a word
in class or at meal-time!

140
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,708
Hey, are you guys there?

141
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,791
What'd you expect? It's a
school for spoiled rich kids!

142
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,666
Spoiled is right!

143
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,958
Just don't forget
why you're there.

144
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,833
I won't forget!

145
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,666
I don't want to end up like that
poor girl either, you know.

146
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,666
Help me!

147
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,875
Stay away! No!

148
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,458
Stop! Stop! Help me,
please! Get away!

149
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,958
The hallucinations
were driving her insane.

150
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,666
But, no matter what
the doctors tried,

151
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,208
she just got worse everyday.

152
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,083
They suspect that
drugs may be involved,

153
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,666
but they don't know
anything for sure.

154
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,375
All we are sure of, is that
whatever happened to her,

155
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,458
it started at
St. Luciana's Academy,

156
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:21,041
and it's slowly eating
away at her mind.

157
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,291
That, and we know her
father's connected to Bai-Lan.

158
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,958
You know, there's drugs out
there that leave no trace.

159
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,666
No matter how nice
those girls are

160
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,333
you can't let your guard down.

161
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,875
Well, I haven't seen anything
out of the ordinary yet.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,541
There is something odd going
on with the older girls.

163
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,333
They formed this club, Ishitaw,
Ishidai... Oh, yeah, Ishtar!

164
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,000
It's all exclusive
and members only.

165
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,000
I think they get
special privileges too.

166
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,500
You think you can you get in?

167
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,583
Yeah, I met the leader
today, and she invited me,

168
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,041
so no problem.

169
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,666
Meg? What's going on? Meg!

170
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,125
No, don't hurt me.

171
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,833
No don't. Please, stop.

172
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,666
No, don't take me!
Leave, me alone!

173
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,333
Please, no!

174
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,375
Wait! Hold on!

175
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,791
What are you doing?
You could fall!

176
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,958
I'm sorry, please forgive me!

177
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,458
Whoa! Hold on. Just calm down.

178
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,958
Leave me alone!

179
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,708
Just hold on!

180
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,375
I gotcha!

181
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,583
These girls really are a...

182
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,791
...a bunch of nutjobs.

183
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,625
I'm so hungry.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,083
What the--

185
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,125
Hey!

186
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,375
Are you feeling any better yet?

187
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,666
Who's that?

188
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750
I don't know.

189
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,500
Wait up! Don't just walk away.

190
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,583
Let go!

191
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,541
Oh, sorry.
But, how are you feeling?

192
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,166
What do you mean?

193
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,625
I was wondering if you'd
pulled yourself together.

194
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,375
I was kinda
worried this morning.

195
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,041
Do I know you from somewhere?

196
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,916
You don't even... Last night,
up on the roof you--

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,250
Look, I'm not asking for a big
thank you or anything like that.

198
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,750
It's just weird that
you don't remember.

199
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

200
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,375
Come on! You don't remember
trying to jump off the roof?

201
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,208
You shouldn't say such things.

202
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,375
Spreading bad rumors like
that will ruin my reputation!

203
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,500
Got it?

204
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:22,375
I don't know why I can't move.
My mind is lost in this crowd.

205
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,041
No one even hears...

206
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:33,750
Geez, what am I doing here?
This place is driving me nuts.

207
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,250
And this lame get-up
is getting really old.

208
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,875
Megumi Mitarai?

209
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,500
Hi there. Are you
missing something?

210
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,875
I can't believe
you didn't notice.

211
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,708
You're lucky a teacher
didn't catch you without it.

212
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,708
Actually, it was
Sister Angelique

213
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,416
who found your ID card.

214
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I imagine you would like
to thank her in person.

215
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,166
Come this way.

216
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,833
Only a very select
few are allowed

217
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,708
the privilege of
admittance here.

218
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,333
Ah, Megumi.
But you prefer "Meg?"

219
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,041
Right.

220
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:28,875
Welcome to the Ishtar club.
I'm delighted you could drop by.

221
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,416
Yeah. Those girls said you
made sure I got my ID back.

222
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,208
I really can't thank you enough.

223
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,416
No thanks are necessary,
I assure you.

224
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,958
We are all friends here.

225
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
And I'm sure
you'd do the same.

226
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,833
Won't you please make
yourself at home?

227
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,625
Oh, great!

228
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,958
No way!

229
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,625
My, you certainly have
a unique way of eating!

230
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,208
Bordering on primal!

231
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,250
Relax, we've got plenty of time.

232
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,166
Why don't we all enjoy
a soothing pot of tea.

233
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,125
This one has a truly
wonderful aroma.

234
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,291
Ah, so that's how you do it.

235
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:15,041
You are so right! It smells
absolutely enchanting.

236
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,708
Aah! Hot!

237
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,791
I... I'm so sorry! I am such
a klutz, are you all right?

238
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,416
Wha--

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,416
Honestly Meg, don't worry
about it. I will be fine.

240
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
We shall get this
mess cleaned up.

241
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,000
Your only concern should be
to get to your next class.

242
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,333
But--

243
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:51,166
I totally blew it today.
But I got candy, so big deal!

244
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,708
Meg?

245
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,791
Who's there?

246
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,208
It's you.

247
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,041
I'm sorry about earlier today.

248
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,791
So, you do remember
what happened last night.

249
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,291
Kinda. But I'm
still so confused.

250
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,708
My memory of last night
is really fuzzy.

251
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,875
I do remember one thing, though.
You tried to help me,

252
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
but I was just a burden to you.

253
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
It's okay.

254
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,958
If something like
that happened to me,

255
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,375
I'd probably be a little
wigged out too.

256
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,375
But I am concerned. What made
you try to commit suicide?

257
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,666
Well, I...

258
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:30,458
It's okay if you don't feel like
talking, I understand, however--

259
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,583
We were all put on this
earth to enjoy life.

260
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,500
Suicide will never
solve anything.

261
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,041
You really think things
will be better if you die?

262
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,250
Do you know what happens

263
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,708
when you jump off
a building like that?

264
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,750
Your head busts open
and your brains splatter

265
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,333
all over the place
like bad Italian food.

266
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,166
You don't want to
end up like that.

267
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,708
Suicide is just running
away from your problems.

268
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,916
You just end up dead.

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,875
Your only real option
is to suck it up

270
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,958
and get on with your life.

271
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,125
I may not be as proper
and refined as you guys,

272
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,333
but I do have friends.

273
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,333
Friends who helped me
learn that fact the hard way.

274
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,375
Thank you for your help.

275
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,916
I think it's really good
that I got to meet you Meg.

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,750
I've never had anybody really
talk to me like that before.

277
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,125
Can I see your hand?

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,083
It's really warm.

279
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,750
If you don't bring
me some real food,

280
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,208
I'm bustin' outta this joint!

281
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,333
Not another jumper?

282
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,916
Aren't you the new transfer
student, Megumi Mitarai?

283
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,375
How do you know who I am?

284
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,375
It's quite a small school.

285
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,125
Rumors about new
arrivals tend to spread

286
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,958
rather quickly around here.

287
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,708
I'm Nadesico, the President
of the senior class.

288
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,791
Nice to meet you.

289
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,458
Yes, of course.
Nice to meet you too.

290
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,541
You know, it's forbidden

291
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,333
to leave your room
after lights out.

292
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,500
And here you are on the roof.

293
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,333
Oh, I didn't know.

294
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,458
See, I was just looking
for another restroom.

295
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,583
The one on my floor's
all backed up.

296
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,250
Well, you certainly
won't find any up here.

297
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,541
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

298
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,041
I'm like you,
I couldn't sleep either.

299
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,750
So, I came up here
to look at the stars.

300
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,500
Why don't you and I keep our
flagrant little violation

301
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,625
of school policy strictly
between the two of us? Okay?

302
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,208
Here. Take my jacket,

303
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,291
you look like you're
starting to get cold.

304
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,416
Thank you, Nadesico.

305
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,750
Nadesico, huh...

306
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,375
Smells good.

307
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,833
Hey Meg! Over here!

308
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,333
Over here!

309
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,708
Laugh it up, Meg.

310
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,041
I don't think the whole
school heard you yet.

311
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,458
Sorry, I can't help it!

312
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,541
They made me wear it this
just in case I was spotted.

313
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,333
Enough! Have you found
anything out of value?

314
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,541
There's definitely
something going on

315
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,458
with the girls in
that Ishtar club.

316
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,750
They seem to have a lot of pull
with everyone at the school.

317
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
And, the leader,
Angelique, has this

318
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,625
really nasty scar on her arm.

319
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,875
Maybe she's a lot
tougher than she looks.

320
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,166
Speaking of Angelique,

321
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,041
I discovered her father
was an important player

322
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,958
involved in Tokyo's
4th Reconstruction Plan.

323
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,416
One other thing: The name
of that club, "Ishtar,"

324
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,833
was the ancient Babylonian
goddess of love.

325
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,750
Oh! How cheesy!

326
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,583
New guy, show it to her.

327
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,250
Yeah, right.

328
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,916
What are you doing, you perv?

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,416
I'll have you know I have
no interest in you like that,

330
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,583
so keep your clothes on!

331
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,000
Look, there's a miniature
camera built in the button.

332
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,958
Yeah. Not too shabby.

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,583
This is the main lecture hall.

334
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,000
Wait a minute. Why am I
talking to the camera?

335
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,750
What is she taking pictures of?

336
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,958
Who knows?

337
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,125
That should about do it-

338
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,333
Oh, I almost forgot
the most important place.

339
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,458
Perfect. There's nobody here.

340
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,666
Might as well get
a shot of everything.

341
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,416
Damn it, Meg.
Stop goofing around!

342
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
She can't exactly
hear you, y'know!

343
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,416
Yeah, I know.

344
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,833
Now where do
they keep the candy?

345
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,875
I know! Maybe it's hidden
behind one of these books!

346
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,833
What's this?

347
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,958
Meg!

348
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,833
Gimme a break.
I didn't sign up for this!

349
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,416
Holy--

350
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,750
I don't know why I can't move

351
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,625
My mind is lost in this cloud

352
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:32,000
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

353
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:39,625
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

354
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:44,916
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

355
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,083
and smile with each other

356
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,416
It hurts inside
when we don't...

357
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,000
we don't... we don't
know what to say

358
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:00,750
I only hope that
someone will be there,

359
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,833
and be watching over me

360
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,833
so take my hand,

361
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:15,625
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

362
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,416
Is it an illusion
or is it reality?

363
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,750
Jo's bullets echo within
a strange world of dreams

364
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,000
against a demon without a face.

365
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,833
Next Burst Angel: "Wash this
Garden Away with Blood!"
