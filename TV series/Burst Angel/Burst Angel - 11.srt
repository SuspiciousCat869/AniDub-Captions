1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,333
Man, it's impossible to
get a taxi in this town.

24
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,708
So what, did the all cabbies
go on strike or something?

25
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,541
Drivers don't like coming
down into this part of town,

26
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,083
it's too risky...

27
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,708
Kids with guns causing trouble,
sticking up cabs for cash.

28
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,041
They're outta control.

29
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,083
Yeah, so what, you never
get out of control.

30
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,375
You're one to talk.
You're worse than me.

31
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,708
Next stop, Great Osaka!

32
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,375
There are no more connecting
trains at this stop today.

33
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,708
The transit authority reminds
you this is a non-smoking car,

34
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,666
and mobile phones
are prohibited.

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,875
You see the article
in the paper today?

36
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,166
Man, Tokyo's a total
mess these days.

37
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,541
How do you mean?

38
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,416
It's all the young people...

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,166
They're running around Shibuya
with unlicensed guns...

40
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,625
causing a heap of
trouble for everyone.

41
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,416
So, you saying we're safer here?

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,375
And now, my oldest
daughter's just started

43
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,583
college in Tokyo this month.

44
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,583
That must be tough on you.

45
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,875
Oh, it is...

46
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,000
But, I can't convince
her to even consider

47
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,333
a different school.

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,666
Oh, no!

49
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,208
See... I told you this was
a really bad part of town,

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,958
but you didn't
believe me, did you?

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,875
Shut up...! You and
your lame-ass jokes!

52
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,375
I can't believe you'd screw
around at a time like this!

53
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,208
Yeah... The damn thing
just flew off...!

54
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:11,833
What...?! No, not my toupee,
you idiot...! The train car!

55
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,500
Hey, where'd Shane go?

56
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:18,375
Probably scanning chicks...
Like he's got a chance to score.

57
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,625
Assistant Inspector!

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,875
You don't see this everyday...

59
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,625
An empty train car running
alone on the tracks.

60
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,250
Then its slams head-on
into another train.

61
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,416
It was empty?

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,416
According to the station
security monitors,

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,166
there was no driver
or passengers

64
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,916
when the train left the depot.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
So then...

66
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,875
you're sayin' the empty train
just up and drove off by itself?

67
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,666
Well, maybe it's haunted...

68
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,250
Possessed by the spirit of
someone the train ran over.

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,291
Inspector Iriki!

70
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,833
What?

71
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,166
You got a call at the station.
Says he'll only talk to you.

72
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,583
Who was it?

73
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,458
Some guy says he has
information about the accident.

74
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,208
He's called several times--

75
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,500
thought you'd want
to check it out.

76
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,916
Right.

77
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,708
Who is this?

78
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,833
That doesn't matter.

79
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,166
What's important is
what happens next.

80
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,708
You say you have
some information--

81
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,041
Yes, I do.

82
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
I certainly have what
you want to know.

83
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,208
So, let's make a deal
with one another.

84
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,583
All right, listen here!

85
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,875
If you got a point, you
better get to it darn quick!

86
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,416
You're not taking me
seriously, that hurts.

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,791
You've seen too many movies!

88
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,500
I ain't got time for this.
I'm hangin' up.

89
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,666
I wouldn't do that, Inspector.

90
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,416
The train that
crashed last night,

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,625
there was no one
on it, was there?

92
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,791
That ain't public knowledge
yet. Who are you?

93
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,125
Does it matter?

94
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,541
What you fail to understand

95
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,458
is that all of this
is far from over.

96
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,500
In fact, I'm just
getting started!

97
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,833
Be warned,

98
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,333
I will utterly destroy
the Hanshin Police Force.

99
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,583
And that's not all.

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,125
I will bring down
all of Osaka with you!

101
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sure you'll all going
to be looking forward to it.

102
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,625
No more games! Who are you?

103
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,208
Why don't you just
think of me as

104
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,291
a whole new breed of terrorist.

105
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,416
You get a trace on that?

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,791
No... He must have been
jamming it on his end.

107
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,458
We got a psycho on our hands!

108
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,833
That's pretty obvious...

109
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,666
And we didn't get a damn
thing out of him either.

110
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,500
I want y'all to
sweep the city...

111
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,750
You got that?!
Haul in anyone suspicious!

112
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,083
What are you doing here...?

113
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,750
You causing trouble...?
You don't look so friendly...

114
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,333
C'mon, answer me!

115
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,625
Hey, I ain't done nothing wrong!
Why don't you leave me alone?!

116
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,833
Oh, man! It's Tetsuzo of Minami!

117
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,458
Good morning, sir.

118
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey you, get back here!

119
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,750
Good morning to you, Ossifers!

120
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,041
I was just fixin' to do
my mornin' exercises!

121
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,458
And a-one, and a-two,
and a three!

122
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,041
Good afternoon!

123
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,666
Once you've made your selection,

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,958
please place your
order at the counter.

125
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,375
Okay, put your hands behind
your head and turn around!

126
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,166
What? am I under arrest
for eating my lunch?

127
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,416
Just pipe down and
put your hands up!

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,625
You don't look like
you're from around here...

129
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:25,083
Whoa, those look like some
pretty fancy guns you got there!

130
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,625
Well, you're just a kid.

131
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,416
Gotta permit for those?

132
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,875
Tokyo must be a mess--
I can't believe they'd

133
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,666
give out a license
to a girl your age.

134
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,708
Though, there have been
a lot of fake permits

135
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,125
goin' 'round lately.

136
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,625
Why don't we head downtown
and get this verified.

137
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,625
No can do--Got somewhere to be.

138
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,208
Yeah, where...? I'd be
happy to have a patrol car

139
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,416
drop you off when you're
done at the station.

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,083
Ever heard of the D.D.D?

141
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,125
Oh, you're here
for the fights...

142
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,541
I'm a fan myself.

143
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,375
Masa-yan--

144
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,500
Take a pill...

145
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,458
She came all the
way out from Tokyo...

146
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,708
Be a cryin' shame
if she missed it.

147
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,541
I'm sure you're okay...
Enjoy the fights.

148
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,875
Fine then...

149
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,583
I s'pose if Masa-yan's
willing to vouch for you.

150
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,166
But, watch yourself...

151
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,666
I don't want to hear
any more 'bout them

152
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,208
fancy guns of yours...
Be seein' ya--

153
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,583
Good work! We're all clear.
Now get back to your search.

154
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,750
Yes, sir!

155
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,916
Let's see...

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,208
Oh, here it is!

157
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,625
They're closed...?

158
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,458
That's weird! The brochure
says they should be open.

159
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, anyone here?

160
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,250
I came a long way for
your takoyaki parfait!

161
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,666
You there! What are you doing?
Trying to break in, are ya?

162
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,458
Sorry! I just wanted some food!

163
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,625
Hot dogs! Getcher Hot dogs!

164
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,958
Tonight, everyone's favorite
hero, Mega Rider,

165
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,000
will face his most
deadly opponent yet!

166
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,916
In their last match,
the evil Ultra-Beast

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,041
suffered near-fatal injuries
and Mega Rider was triumphant!

168
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,750
But now Ultra-Beast is back,
and out for revenge!

169
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,875
But, first,
Clash and Full Throttle

170
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,958
will fight it out
in the battle zone!

171
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,958
There's no way
Mega Rider can lose!

172
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,916
Yeah! Ultra-Beast
is going down...!

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,416
Mega Rider's gonna
kick his butt!

174
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,958
Go Mega Rider!

175
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,791
Hurry kids, we gotta
close down in five minutes!

176
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,250
We've only got three Mega Rider
vs. Ultra-Beast battle sets left

177
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,083
and then they're history!

178
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,000
Nice of you to join us.

179
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,208
I stopped for lunch.

180
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,625
A woman?

181
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,041
Yeah, that's right.

182
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,416
And, just a kid at that!

183
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,666
And, you're just
a tired old man.

184
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,833
You better watch
your mouth, missy!

185
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,791
Enough! I need someone
who can get the job done

186
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,000
not some snot-nosed punk
with a smart mouth!

187
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,458
I understand.

188
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,125
But since I'm here, I'll let
you in on a little secret.

189
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,166
What's that?

190
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,541
You've got a big rat
in the rafters.

191
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,375
It's him...
That trash tabloid writer.

192
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,500
I see. That is quite a big rat.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,833
I like you, kid.
Come sit down over here.

194
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,750
I thought I was
a snot-nosed punk.

195
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,625
And, Iron K takes down Red Giant
with an explosive power kick!

196
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,416
The Giant doesn't
know what to do!

197
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,250
These matches are a
major source of income

198
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,333
for the western Bai-Lan,

199
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,750
which in turn supports
Japan's economy.

200
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,958
Of course, Mega Rider is the
biggest superstar in the league.

201
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,666
He's worth more money to me

202
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,958
than all of the rest of
these oafs combined.

203
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,625
You talk like you own the guy.

204
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,166
Regardless, I'm counting on
you to protect my investment.

205
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,083
If anything happened to him,
we'd have a serious problem.

206
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,083
We've just learned that
the terrorists behind

207
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,166
the train incident
the other day have chosen

208
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,541
the Tiger Dome as
their next target.

209
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,208
The Hanshin P.D. are well
aware of the situation,

210
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,708
but so far have done nothing.

211
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,291
And though the
thrill of explosions

212
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,750
may be part of our appeal...

213
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,208
We cannot afford any
destructive surprises.

214
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,000
You must protect Mega Rider.

215
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,375
So, I just make sure
there's no interruptions.

216
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,875
If everything goes as planned,

217
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,583
it'll be over in
fifteen minutes...

218
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,625
That's easy work for you...

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The time has come!

220
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,833
Good battles evil in the
timeless struggle between

221
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,083
the forces of light and
the treachery of darkness!

222
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,375
Mega Rider must rise
to the challenge

223
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,875
and send Ultra-Beast back to
the hole he crawled out of!

224
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,500
And, now, the hero of the world!

225
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:11,541
The champion of all that
is good... Mega Rider!

226
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,541
It's him! Mega Rider in person!

227
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,416
Whoa, check it out,
dude! His bike is flying!

228
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,666
Behold!

229
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,083
But, the challenger awaits!

230
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:39,750
Returning from Hell itself
and screaming for vengeance!

231
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,291
He's the beast from below

232
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:47,125
with a power never
yet seen by humans!

233
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,583
Man, that egg is huge!

234
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,208
So what...?!
C'mon, Mega Rider!

235
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,625
Crush that egg and make
an omelet out of him!

236
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:59,250
The ultimate evil, Ultra-Beast!

237
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,458
It's so bright!

238
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,166
I can't see!

239
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,416
This is it... You ready?

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,291
And, if the match runs long?

241
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,833
I wouldn't worry...

242
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:21,791
Long as they keep to the script,
it'll be done in no time.

243
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,125
You're gonna wish
you'd stayed in that egg!

244
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,791
This will be the last
time we meet Ultra-Beast!

245
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,291
The fight's about to start...

246
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,333
You mean "play"... don't you?

247
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,250
Ha! Is that the
best you've got?!

248
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,291
Dang! He sent Mega Rider flying!

249
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,083
No way! Ultra-Beast's not
supposed to be able to do that!

250
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,791
Here it goes, folks!

251
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:22,375
Mega Rider's coming in
with his Super Dash Punch!

252
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,166
Whoa!

253
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,416
What are you doing, dude?
You're supposed to go down!

254
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
What a surprise turn of events!

255
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,875
Ultra-Beast really did come
back stronger than ever!

256
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,375
Mega Rider's got his work
cut out for him tonight!

257
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,875
Go get him, Mega Rider!

258
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on! Get up!

259
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,166
Now...

260
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,166
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't the script we settled on

261
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,041
call for Mega Rider
to punch Ultra Beast

262
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,791
and knock him off the stage?

263
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,916
Yes, it's not going as planned.

264
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,291
Where did he learn to
fly around like that?

265
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,041
Geez, come on, man...

266
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,916
You may have sharpened your
skills in the underworld

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,541
but you're still no
match for Mega Rider!

268
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,500
You will lose!

269
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:43,791
C'mon Steve...! Follow the
script... like in rehearsal...

270
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,291
If you keep up like this and I'm
gonna have you fired tonight!

271
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,958
Whoa...! You all right dude?

272
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,416
Okay, now that is definitely
not in the script...

273
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,416
Unbelievable!
He really transformed!

274
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,333
This is why I love
the D. D. D. league!

275
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,875
Yeah, but it looks totally
different than in the picture.

276
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,083
I guess they changed their mind.

277
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,083
C'mon, Mega Rider,
what are you waiting for?!

278
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,333
Take him out!

279
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,416
Um, folks...? I could
use a little help here.

280
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,750
Oh, the humanity!

281
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:48,000
Mega Rider's been thrown off
the stage and is out cold!

282
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,666
No way... Hey, get up
Mega Rider...! Please?

283
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,041
What a rip-off! Mega Rider's
not supposed to lose!

284
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,625
What kinda hero are you?!

285
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,750
This was totally worth
the trip from Tokyo...

286
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,916
It's so real in person!

287
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,125
Help me! Somebody!
I've been slimed!

288
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,541
Now you're gonna
have to deal with me...

289
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,250
Who ya' s'pose that girl is?

290
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,750
Probably some new
character... I guess.

291
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,625
That's it! Pulverize the beast!

292
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,125
I wish I could've gone.

293
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,958
Probably, duking
it out right now.

294
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,125
Hanshin Police Department...

295
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,041
Oh, hey Takane,
what's going on?

296
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,625
Say that again...

297
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,583
Ultra Beast turned
into a real monster?!

298
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,416
Let's move out!

299
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,916
Right!

300
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,833
All forward units--report to
the Tiger Dome immediately!

301
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,541
Be on alert for a large creature
considered extremely dangerous!

302
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,625
Damn thing's
tougher'n I thought!

303
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,708
Everything's ruined because
you failed to accomplish

304
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,166
a very simple task...

305
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,625
You were supposed to
protect Mega Rider!

306
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,041
Yeah? Take it up
with Bug-Boy, here.

307
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,583
Just do something about him!

308
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,666
I take it this
wasn't in the script?

309
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,791
Go to Hell!

310
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,541
Hey, are you guys all right?

311
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,958
You twit!
This is all your fault!

312
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:01,916
He's in the sewers...

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,583
Beneath the Midosuji Line,
moving north... and fast!

314
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,666
Where's he going?

315
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,083
On this headin'...

316
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,125
Right below the site of
yesterday's train accident.

317
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,000
Interesting. What's your 20?

318
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,333
'Bout a third a mile west
of Umeda Underground.

319
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,375
If I stick to the tunnels,

320
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,125
I should be able
to get there first.

321
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,500
10-4, Takane, move out!

322
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,166
Missed my calling.
Shoulda been an exterminator.

323
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,791
Hold still you damn cockroach!

324
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,458
Aw, crap... One of them.

325
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,333
Just shut up and die already!

326
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,541
Who're you?!

327
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,250
I'll ask the questions
'round here!

328
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,833
Now put down the guns--

329
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,375
Not likely, pretty girl.

330
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,041
You must have some
kinda death wish,

331
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,416
jumpin' your bike
over me like that.

332
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,208
That a threat?

333
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,916
Thanks to you,

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,083
a vital piece of material
evidence has gotten away.

335
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,041
You better have a damn
good explanation!

336
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,250
Material evidence?

337
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,250
Not to mention... Blatant
obstruction of police business!

338
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,333
What the--?

339
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Hanshin Police, Elite
Division. Hawk squad.

340
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,916
Independent Investigator,
Takane Katsu...

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,333
I'm a detective!

342
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,291
Takane! You all right?

343
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,541
Well I'll be damned...

344
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,333
I don't know why I can't move

345
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:23,208
My mind is lost in this cloud

346
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:30,583
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

347
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:38,208
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

348
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:43,500
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

349
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,666
and smile with each other

350
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,958
It hurts inside
when we don't...

351
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,583
we don't... we don't
know what to say

352
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:59,333
I only hope that
someone will be there,

353
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:03,416
and be watching over me

354
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,416
so take my hand,

355
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:14,208
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

356
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,208
A town in need of protection;

357
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:38,208
loved ones torn by duty;
a heated battle...

358
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,708
And a monstrous plot,
finally revealed...

359
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,625
Next Burst Angel:
"Tower of Tears."
