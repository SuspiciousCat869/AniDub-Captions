1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:55,916
Startin' today...

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This town belongs
to the new King.

25
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,416
What, is this a joke?!

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,583
I can assure you... it's not.

27
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,250
I'm the new law in town,

28
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,333
and those who oppose
me get no mercy.

29
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:11,291
And this pathetic excuse
for a cybot is an eyesore!

30
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,916
If you try to send
another my way,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,333
I'll kill the girl
without hesitation.

32
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,875
As long as he has a hold of Meg,

33
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,708
we can't afford to make
any careless moves.

34
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,708
You're the only ones left!

35
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:26,500
All work and low pay is
nothin' to give yer lives for!

36
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,916
Damn you. How could you
betray us like this?!

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,416
Because of incompetent
morons like you.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,750
Made me sick.

39
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,916
What you called a "police
force" was no more than

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,250
a gang of sniveling twits
clinging to their titles.

41
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,583
He's taken credit for a
number of terrorist incidents

42
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,000
in Osaka to prove how worthless
the Hanshin Police Force is.

43
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,583
Then he took his cause
to the National Diet.

44
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,791
So the government was behind
all the terrorist activity?

45
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right...

46
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,125
We believe this cop,
Togo Iriki was promised

47
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,583
a position giving him control
of a large portion of Osaka.

48
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,666
But there must be a
powerful political figure

49
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,500
that's working
behind the scenes.

50
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,083
All these guys Jo's fought
have had cutting edge tech,

51
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,916
and trust me,
that isn't cheap.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,708
I'd bet the group
backing them is huge.

53
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,583
Amy... You think you can
pinpoint their hideout?

54
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,166
We came across an
underground cybot factory

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,458
beneath that truck
we chased down...

56
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,625
Once again, they were
using a glowing brain

57
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,750
to control the bot...

58
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,208
Based on its size,

59
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,833
my guess is it came from
the last beast Jo took on.

60
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,208
I had Bai-Lan's men
look into it,

61
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,041
but by the time they showed up,
there wasn't anything left.

62
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,791
I also noticed they
used a strong EM signal

63
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,125
to create a sort of
a magnetic storm...

64
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,125
So unless we're right on top of
'em, our sensors are useless!

65
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,125
Then why don't you do
something about it... genius.

66
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,875
Hey, that's mean...!
I'm not stupid.

67
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,625
I could read an entire book in
binary code if I wanted to.

68
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,875
Leo. Start prepping Jango.
We need him right away.

69
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,291
No problem.

70
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
It'll be a good chance to
test out his new upgrades.

71
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,541
But with his pilot
in this condition...

72
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,291
Do me a favor.

73
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,583
And what's that?

74
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,333
About Jango... I want you
to put wings on him!

75
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,583
We really appreciate
your assistance.

76
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Sure, that's one private jet
engine and a whole ton of ammo.

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
Looking to start
a war or something?

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,208
No... We're just planning to put

79
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,291
the hurt on the new
sheriff in town.

80
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,041
I see... Good luck with that.

81
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,916
All right...
Bring in the trailer!

82
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,250
C'mon Leo... You really
gonna put wings on him?

83
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,875
What? You don't think I can?

84
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
No way.

85
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,375
Hey Mama... How come
Daddy won't wake up?

86
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,291
Mama?

87
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,500
Because... Milly.

88
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,875
Your daddy... He can't wake up.

89
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,375
He's gone to sleep forever.

90
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,041
But I don't want him to!

91
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,083
Mr. Katsu gave me
a bunch of toys

92
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,750
and I wanted to
show them to him!

93
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,125
Daddy, please!
Please! Wake up...

94
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,708
Why won't you wake up?

95
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,875
Milly. I know this
is hard for you,

96
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,666
but you'll understand some day.

97
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,208
Takane...

98
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,416
What is it?

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,666
My husband... Did he at least
die bravely? With honor?

100
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,791
Osaka's justice will never die!

101
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,583
Yeah... He most certainly did.

102
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,875
Really?

103
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,041
Your daddy was a hero.

104
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,791
Mom... I'm sorry.

105
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,625
Your name... is Jo, right?

106
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,541
You really did it this time.

107
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,291
The symbol of Osaka
is now in ruins.

108
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,375
Are you going to
arrest me again?

109
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm not in the mood.

110
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,375
So lemme skip the awkward small
talk and get to the point...

111
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,625
Thank you for trying
to save Masa-yan.

112
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,375
I truly appreciate it.

113
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,625
I won't rest until
he's avenged...

114
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,416
I'm gonna make that
bastard, Iriki, pay.

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,000
And then I'm goin' after
whoever was drivin' that cybot.

116
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,916
That cybot didn't have a pilot.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,541
What do you mean?

118
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,708
Remember the monster
that escaped?

119
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,041
Its brain was put
in that cybot...

120
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,375
That's what's controlling it.

121
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,750
Is... that even possible?

122
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
Go ahead.

123
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,833
I see. I'll be
right there...

124
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,000
Jo. I don't know how yet,

125
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:17,416
but I'm going to pay you
back... I promise you.

126
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,291
Ugh. Déjà vu.

127
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,750
So what do you think?
Quite a shiny brain, uh...?

128
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,208
Do you have any idea how much
it costs to make one of those?

129
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,791
How the hell should I know?!
You sick pervert!

130
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,041
Long as this cybot has
that brain installed,

131
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,083
Bai-Lan's pathetic dolls
won't stand a chance.

132
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,041
No good king would
ever cause suffering.

133
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,458
As such, I'll have to plow the
entire town in one fell swoop,

134
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,125
before I can cultivate
it in my own image!

135
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,791
And I got me a big old
bulldozer to do it with!

136
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,250
My associates were
quite ecstatic...

137
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,750
when I told them I had
gotten my hands on

138
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,750
one of these here brains.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,416
Next week...

140
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,000
That bulldozer's goin' into
the shop for a full upgrade!

141
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,458
Whaddaya say, sweet thing?
Wanna be a part of it?

142
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,333
No, no! I don't want
to be bulldozed!

143
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,791
Tomorrow's festival
cannot be canceled

144
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,875
under any circumstances!

145
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,708
If we did so... Osaka's
spirit would vanish!

146
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,083
We have to locate
that cybot's hideout.

147
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,708
If we fail, we won't
stand a chance.

148
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,750
Use any means necessary.

149
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,250
Just get out there and
find that cybot...!

150
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,375
The som'bitch is
definitely hiding out

151
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,000
in this city somewhere!

152
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,000
Leave it to us, boss girl!

153
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,958
We'll have that ugly beast's
head on a platter for you.

154
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,625
Didn't you say
those exact words

155
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,416
when your third husband
decided to split town?

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,875
Listen up! This is war!

157
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,416
The greatest battle since
the formation of the Kanbaku!

158
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,791
At all costs... defend our city!

159
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah!

160
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,666
Keep it moving people!

161
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,875
Do not stop in the
middle of the road!

162
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,708
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

163
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:33,791
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

164
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,500
Whoa! They just ran
into that house!

165
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,333
That house gets
hit every year...

166
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,375
Funny thing is... They never
even seem to complain about it.

167
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,125
Huh... Hey, wait a minute,
what happened to Tetsuzo?

168
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,375
You don't mean the Tetsuzo?!

169
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,583
Uh, yeah, I just met him.

170
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,625
Now you listen...
This is for your own good!

171
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,541
Get your ass back to Tokyo!

172
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,125
What?

173
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,000
Ahhhh... This sucks.
We're missing the entire parade.

174
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,166
Would you can it, already?
I want to see it too, you know.

175
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,500
It wouldn't hurt to take
a small peek, right?

176
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,208
That's true...
What the hell, let's do it.

177
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,958
From the ocean?!

178
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,208
What the...

179
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
That poor house just
got nailed again!

180
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
Well, looks like the
owner might actually

181
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,083
file a complaint this year.

182
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,125
Damn you cybot!

183
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,416
--Hey look!
--It's Tetsuzo!

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,375
We're saved!

185
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,625
Beat the crap out of that cybot!

186
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,166
Listen you sonuvabitch!

187
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm gonna shove a handful of
roman candle's up your ass

188
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,041
and send you straight to the
Grand Canyon! You got that?!

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,750
The Grand Canyon?

190
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,083
Tetsuzo seems to think the
Grand Canyon is in Hiroshima.

191
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,083
He just won't listen.

192
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,166
Look!

193
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,125
He stopped it with his head!

194
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,416
A recent chain of terrorist
attacks in Osaka

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,166
has brought the city
to a standstill.

196
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,291
In response, Tokyo's RAPT
Squadron has been deployed.

197
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,125
A source within RAPT
was quoted as saying

198
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,250
their only objective is to
suppress the violence quickly

199
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,458
without causing further damage
to the city's infrastructure.

200
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,750
Man that really
tightens my jaws...

201
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,333
We don't need them to save us.

202
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,208
Course we do, the force don't
have the firepower for all this.

203
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,208
Besides, that robot
can hide in the ocean,

204
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,083
so there's no way we
could possibly find it,

205
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,375
and even if we did...

206
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,083
Cap'n, you're back.

207
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,458
Looks like the cavalry's
heading in from Tokyo.

208
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,500
What you think we should do?

209
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,083
I don't...

210
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,500
I don't know!

211
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,083
Captain, wait!

212
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,625
What should I do?

213
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,291
Are we unable to defend
Osaka by ourselves?

214
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,666
Yeah, Takane speakin'.

215
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,458
Takane--

216
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,500
Daddy?

217
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,875
There's no time
so listen carefully.

218
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,500
I'm listenin'.

219
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,250
The Hanshin Police Force
has lost its way...

220
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,375
It's gotten so lost, in fact,
it's just going in circles.

221
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,250
I fear this is the end.

222
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,916
In times like these, you need to
go back to where you started.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,791
Where we started?

224
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,500
That's right. Return to where
this whole mess began.

225
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,250
Search the scene
a hundred times.

226
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,750
That's the heart of
good investigation.

227
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,541
Remember the monster
that escaped?

228
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,916
Its brain was put
in that cybot...

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,166
That's what's controlling it.

230
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,958
That's--!

231
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,500
Damn it...! The monster
pulled a fast one on us!

232
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,208
It hid and waited 'til
we were all gone...

233
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,833
Then it just waltzed
right out of here!

234
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,250
This is Takane.

235
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
Get forensics over to
Grand Osaka Station right away.

236
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,916
We need to find out exactly

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,333
where that monster
lost its brain!

238
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,500
That was hilarious!

239
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,083
The tourists finally
got some action

240
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,791
out of that stupid parade.

241
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,375
Damn it! You're a cop.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

242
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,250
I've heard that line before
and it's a bunch of crap.

243
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,458
Any reasonable man
with an ounce of dignity

244
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,458
would prefer being
a king over a cop.

245
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,916
And by the way...

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,958
That pretty mouth of yours says
such nasty things to the king.

247
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,541
Bitch!

248
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,000
I've tried to be nice with you,

249
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,500
but I see that's
getting me nowhere.

250
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,833
Get up! C'mon!

251
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,041
You wanna break
an arm or a leg?

252
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
Or how 'bout both?

253
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm falling!

254
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:20,750
Uh, no you're not.

255
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,250
Oh, um, hi there!

256
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,041
Iriki!

257
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,416
Nice work.

258
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
I was hoping to play
hide-and-seek a little longer,

259
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,625
but it looks like you found
me sooner than I expected.

260
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,833
Smart girl. My compliments.

261
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,083
Shut your mouth...!

262
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,708
I won't be forgiving
you this time around.

263
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,333
Nah... Really...?

264
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,833
I wouldn't expect such
kindness from you.

265
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,041
Only the king can decide who
is forgiven and who is not.

266
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,875
And you're looking at him!

267
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,291
Now, hail to the king, baby!

268
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,875
You refuse, eh?
Then I'll take it upon myself

269
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,500
to crush you and
your pathetic fort!

270
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,791
Pissants! Now you kids
go to your rooms

271
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,166
and think about
what you've done!

272
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,708
It's that cybot! Run!

273
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,666
It's coming right at us!

274
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,958
You'd best be gettin'
back to Jo now.

275
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,541
Tell her my debt's been paid!

276
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,708
She said her debt is paid, huh?

277
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,958
Uh-huh.

278
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,125
So he said he's going to
destroy their fortress?

279
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,541
Yeah.

280
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,791
Sei, let's go!

281
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,333
Of course.

282
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,458
Get him good, Jo, and don't
forget to bring me a souvenir.

283
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,541
Whatever. I'm not
holdin' back on this one.

284
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,916
From now until sunset...

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,083
Your lives are in the hands
of the Kanbaku Hawk!

286
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,625
Now, fire!

287
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,083
Never mess with a pissed
off cross-dresser!

288
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,041
You don't know pain 'til
you squeeze into a girdle!

289
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,916
I put a whole can of
whoop-ass in my muffins!

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,708
Come have a bite!

291
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,916
Let's see how they like
frozen tuna heads!

292
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,541
Osaka has been defendin' itself

293
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,041
since the days of
the Tokugawa Sieges!

294
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,000
We cannot give up!

295
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,875
Hold on... I call this one
Operation: Angel Wing.

296
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,708
Playtime is over!

297
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,041
Stupid trash.

298
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,500
Not just you folks...

299
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,333
This whole city is a trash heap!

300
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,250
Osaka carries the stench
of sweaty old ladies!

301
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,666
And it's up to me to make
this place clean again!

302
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,250
And now it's time
for you to die!

303
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,125
Listen up, prick...

304
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,583
If you want to kill our boss,

305
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,666
you'll have to go
through me first!

306
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,333
So go ahead and
try, you bastard!

307
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,083
That's right! We ain't
gonna let you touch her!

308
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,541
Ah, well isn't that
just adorable...

309
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,166
Is that what they call
friendship among trash?

310
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,208
You can all die together!

311
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
You're the one
who's going to die!

312
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,750
What the...

313
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,666
Hey, watch it! Thought
you were on our side!

314
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,375
That a friend of yours?

315
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,416
A little help from back East.

316
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,833
Sweet!

317
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,708
Thanks for saving me some.

318
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,791
Sorry 'bout that.

319
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,958
Oh man... Y'all're good!

320
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,375
That girl is insane!

321
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,916
I've had just about enough
of this game of tag.

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,791
It's time for an old
fashioned gunfight!

323
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,083
Oh, no! It hurts, it hurts!

324
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,416
Yeah, right!

325
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,291
Now the other arm!

326
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,500
Think so!

327
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,833
You're gettin' cocky!

328
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,875
Keep it up, you'll just
be part of the trash dump

329
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,625
I've begun accumulating.

330
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,041
What the...

331
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,666
Show some freakin' respect
for Osaka's landmarks!

332
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,041
Pot and the kettle, psycho!

333
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,708
You started this mess,
I'm finishin' it!

334
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,250
There it is!

335
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
This is for
disobeying your king!

336
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,625
I'm gonna rip your head off
and hang it at Osaka Castle!

337
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,041
You're pathetic, Tokyo!

338
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291
Lose to that slimeball,

339
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,333
and you'll never make
it out of Osaka alive!

340
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,708
Stay back...! You won't make it!

341
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,458
Somethin' you should know, Jo...

342
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,750
Don't underestimate
the Kanbaku Hawk!

343
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,166
Say your prayers Iriki,
I'm coming for ya!

344
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,291
Now choke on Masa-yan's
last words...

345
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,750
Osaka's justice will never die!

346
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,958
Did we get 'im?

347
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,291
Yeah, we got him.

348
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,666
Quick! Jump!

349
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,333
I guess I'll see you next time.

350
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,041
Won't be a next time.
I won't be back.

351
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,041
Then maybe next time I'm
in Tokyo, I'll look you up.

352
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,500
Move it, Princess!

353
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,416
Places to go, people to see!

354
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,041
Catch ya later, Hawk Lady.
It's been real!

355
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,375
Seems like y'all have
a lot of fun together.

356
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,750
Stay outta Tokyo.
It's dangerous... and noisy.

357
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,125
That sounds like even more fun.

358
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm proud of you,
Takane... Good work.

359
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:42,041
I'm sorry. I couldn't
visit Mom's grave...

360
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,541
You don't have to say a thing.

361
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,958
You made her proud too.
I'm sure of it.

362
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,333
I don't know why I can't move

363
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,208
My mind is lost in this cloud

364
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:29,583
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

365
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:37,208
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

366
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:42,500
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

367
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,666
and smile with each other

368
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,958
It hurts inside
when we don't...

369
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,583
we don't... we don't
know what to say

370
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:58,333
I only hope that
someone will be there,

371
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,416
and be watching over me

372
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,416
so take my hand,

373
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:13,208
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

374
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,625
Children who live bravely in
the valley of the metropolis.

375
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:38,000
A young soul who
awaits a ray of hope.

376
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,708
Can a miracle emerge?

377
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:44,375
Next Burst Angel... Wild Kids.
