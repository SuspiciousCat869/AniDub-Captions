1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,708
So, like, then I said to him,

24
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,416
like, I just don't think
we should be, like,

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,125
going out any
more, you know.

26
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,208
And, he goes, like,
I bought you a lot of stuff

27
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,666
and took you out
like every night,

28
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,541
and then he starts crying!

29
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,125
If he only knew, like, I
hated the junk he bought me.

30
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,833
I threw it all away!

31
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,291
And then he's like asking,
why don't you like me anymore?

32
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,916
What's wrong with me?
Tell me! Tell me!

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,666
And, now he keeps calling me.

34
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,291
He's, like, left me like
a million messages!

35
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,250
Seriously, men are such
little babies these days.

36
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,541
If only they could see like
how totally pathetic they are.

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,166
Yeah. Like, no duh! You should
totally come with me next time!

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,083
It's like the
coolest dance club.

39
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,291
Guys are like always
buying me drinks and stuff.

40
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,625
Oh! Okay. Later!

41
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,458
Aw, it's too bad Ichimonji
couldn't come too.

42
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,416
Yeah. His dad is in town today,
so I guess he couldn't.

43
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,541
Maybe next time.

44
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,416
Oh, well, his loss!
Hey, check it out!

45
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,750
Whoa!

46
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,625
This looks good!

47
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,625
Oh! What is this?

48
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Snake!

49
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,083
These are tasty, too!

50
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,916
Unbelievable, some people
will eat anything.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Uh-huh.

52
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,958
That was fun, though. The food
was great and I learned a lot!

53
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,583
I'm glad we came!

54
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:19,500
Really? I had fun too,
so I'm glad I invited you.

55
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,916
It is nice being around a
normal girl for a change.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,833
You know, I was
actually kinda worried.

57
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,041
You've been missing a
bunch of classes lately

58
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,416
and half the time you're there,
you seem sorta spaced out.

59
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,208
I thought maybe something
was bothering you.

60
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,708
Well, yeah, kinda,
but it's nothing really.

61
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,041
Do you think it would help
if you talked about it?

62
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,208
As team leader, I'd be happy
to lend a friendly ear.

63
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,708
Because you're the team leader?
Is that the only reason?

64
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,166
If you screw up on
our next group project,

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,000
then everyone on the team
winds up with a bad grade.

66
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,291
Yeah, I see.
That is a good point.

67
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,166
But, seeing you back
at the food fest

68
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,708
made me feel a little better.

69
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,333
You really got into all the
different cuisine styles,

70
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,333
just like you used to,
when class first started.

71
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,208
Well, what did you expect?

72
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,958
You know, my goal
is to study abroad

73
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,416
and become a
world-renowned patissier.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,666
Is this a shortcut?

75
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,583
What's the matter, Kyo?
You afraid of ghosts?

76
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,166
You have nothing to
worry about, I promise.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,458
Oh, did you hear? They said
there's been a buncha sightings

78
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,250
of the giant
Crow-Man in Ikebukuro.

79
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,583
The... the Crow Man?

80
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,208
They say a crow
the size of a man

81
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,041
snatches girls
right off the street.

82
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,791
A bunch are already missing.

83
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,416
Don't tell me you buy into
those ridiculous urban myths.

84
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,291
No way.

85
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,458
This is getting creepy.

86
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
I-It's the Crow Man!

87
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,625
Come on! Let's get out of here!

88
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,208
Damn you!

89
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,750
Kyo, help me!

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Kazami!

91
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,208
Kyo!

92
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,083
Seriously! You have to
believe me! It was huge!

93
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,375
It's out there!
You gotta... You...

94
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,750
But, I'm telling the truth!

95
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,333
Do we look like complete idiots?

96
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,416
You expect us to believe
a giant bird swooped down

97
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,291
and stole your
little girlfriend?

98
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,625
There are stories on the
net about the Crow Man.

99
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,875
But the only sites referring
to it are urban legend boards

100
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,375
and weird occult
sites. Nothing legit.

101
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,000
Then where's, Sei?

102
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,083
She would listen to my story
and not think I'm crazy.

103
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,583
Sorry Crow Boy,
you're outta luck there, too.

104
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,208
She's off prepping
for our next job

105
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
and she won't be
back anytime soon.

106
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,333
Hey Kyo, since
nobody's listening

107
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,958
to your stupid story anyway,

108
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,291
why don'tcha go in the kitchen
and whip us up some dinner?

109
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,625
This isn't the
time for that, Amy!

110
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,333
You said this was in Ikebukuro?

111
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,833
Lead the way, New Guy.

112
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,208
Jo, don't!

113
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,500
You're not really
going to go are you?

114
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,166
Come on, Jo!

115
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,583
Thank you, Jo.

116
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,125
Jo what are you doing?

117
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,333
Let's do it.

118
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,375
Yeah!

119
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
What's the matter, Meg? Jealous?

120
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,625
You afraid they're gonna
run off and get married?

121
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,791
If anything happens to
her it'll be all my fault.

122
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,708
We have to find her, Jo!

123
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,208
Shut up.

124
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,208
Don't shoot! It's just me!

125
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,958
Look who's here!

126
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,333
You're supposed to
watch the trailer.

127
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,833
Don't worry about it!

128
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,541
Besides, I want to check out
this giant Crow Man of his.

129
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,375
Come on, Jo,
don't be mad!

130
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,500
It's not like I get captured
all the time or anything!

131
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,333
O-Okay. Let's not get crazy
with the gun there, Jo.

132
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,500
Hold still!

133
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,583
What the--

134
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Okay! I believe your story now!

135
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,958
Looks like it's
hunting for its dinner.

136
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,625
Don't shoot! We have to
find out where it took Kazami!

137
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,125
Don't think he's talkin'.

138
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,500
Jo, look out!

139
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,125
Get out of here, Meg!

140
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,375
I'm coming, Meg!

141
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,000
I can handle it!

142
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:12,833
Put me down! You'll be sorry!
Help me Jo!

143
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,958
Hate sayin' "I told you so!"

144
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,375
Yeah, what?

145
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,500
It's me. Listen, about that
bodyguard job we discussed...

146
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,625
Save it for later.
Meg's in trouble!

147
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,000
There's a huge mechanized crow
flying southeast from Ikebukuro.

148
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,250
Have Amy track
for a destination!

149
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,458
Okay, listen up!

150
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,541
This is how we're going
to handle the situation.

151
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,791
The client is
already in the air.

152
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,708
I'll have them land
somewhere in your vicinity.

153
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,250
The client has received
multiple death threats.

154
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,750
He is our top priority and
must be protected at all costs.

155
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,916
Forget that!
We have to help Meg!

156
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,125
Amy and I will
track Meg from here.

157
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,291
In the meantime, I need you
to handle the client.

158
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,916
We'll let you know as soon
as we get a fix on her.

159
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,833
Trust me, Jo; just do
as I say until then.

160
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,083
That was our agreement.

161
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,500
You tryin' to give me an order?!

162
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,916
I told you!

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,333
A crow the size of a small
truck just kidnapped Meg!

164
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,583
I've got my mission.

165
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,208
I know you're worried, Jo.
But Amy and I will find Meg.

166
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,041
Your only responsibility is the
protection of Bai-Lan's client.

167
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,291
Got it?

168
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,708
Rendezvous at the landing
point in Sector 3110.

169
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,541
We're heading that way as well.

170
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,541
What's a landing point?

171
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,041
Just come on!

172
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,000
Amy, what've you got?

173
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,666
Well, I've told her repeatedly

174
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,166
to keep her Nav-System
online at all times, but...

175
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,708
I'm not picking them
up on aerial scans.

176
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,291
The crow may have
landed somewhere.

177
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,375
Course, it's
entirely possible

178
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,291
she's not even wearing
her Nav-Sys today.

179
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,833
I knew I should've gone
with the sub-dermal implants

180
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,333
while they were sleeping.

181
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,708
One minute, twenty seconds late.

182
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,833
Just be glad I'm here
at all. You find Meg?

183
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,041
Amy's working on it right now.

184
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,583
Um, Sei.

185
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,708
Please, tell me
you can find them.

186
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,375
I'm sure Kazami's with her.

187
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,625
Not to worry. I'll mobilize
the entire Organization.

188
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,250
We'll scour all of Tokyo
and the surrounding areas.

189
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,958
I am certain they'll turn up.

190
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,125
The "Organization"?

191
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,666
So, you're the contact
from the Japanese Branch?

192
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,583
Yes. Technically, I'm Commander
of a detached strike force.

193
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,958
I understand you've acquired
one of the glowing brains.

194
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,375
If I hear right,
it's quite astounding.

195
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,708
Who's the kid?

196
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,916
It's the new guy.
He's with us. That a problem?

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,166
Sei!

198
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,083
Hurry! Inside the trailer!

199
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,875
Let's go! Move!

200
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
Back off! Don't get near it!

201
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,375
New Guy! Get him
the hell out of here!

202
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,666
Get down!

203
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,791
You okay?

204
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,916
This is what they're after.

205
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,791
This right here.

206
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,375
What is it?

207
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,833
Hey!

208
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,250
Your body will make just as
good a hiding place as any.

209
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,875
Hiding place for what?!

210
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,458
Stay down!

211
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,375
Come on, Jo! Shoot it!

212
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,083
Should've known.

213
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,666
Whoever's got Meg
are the same ones

214
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,041
who issued our
client's death threat.

215
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,333
Gotta admit it is
a good hiding place.

216
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:23,583
He said that too. What exactly
was I injected with, Sei?

217
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,166
An experimental nanobot virus.

218
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,958
Nanobot?

219
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,333
They call it the NI-50.

220
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,208
It's an array of
microscopic machines

221
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,041
that kill you from
the inside out.

222
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,208
Once injected,
it mutates your DNA

223
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,500
and within six hours,
you will be dead.

224
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,875
Six hours?!

225
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,041
That's what was in the
case the crow grabbed?

226
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,458
Sucks to be the New Guy.

227
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,916
Lemme get this straight.

228
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,666
That bird thing isn't just
kidnapping girls at random?

229
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,375
Not a chance. Someone is
definitely controlling it.

230
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,333
For now, we need to
get you into surgery.

231
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,791
With Bai-Lan's tech at our
disposal, it can be removed.

232
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,958
Tell me straight,
am I gonna make it?

233
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,041
Of course. But we'll need as
much of that time as possible.

234
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,875
It's coming back!

235
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,833
Did it forget something?

236
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,083
Hand over the NI-50 at once.

237
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,416
And, we will return your
friend to you unharmed.

238
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,208
There's Meg!

239
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,833
Hold on, that looks like--

240
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,000
Yes. It's the Tokyo Tower.

241
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,750
Jo, wait, what are you doing?

242
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,166
Come on, Jo. Don't do this.

243
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,583
What's going on?

244
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,583
Step away from
Kyohei right now, Jo.

245
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,625
We need to let Bai-Lan recover
the NI-50 from his system.

246
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,208
If we don't, then
he is going to die!

247
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,750
Yeah, well if we do, Meg dies.

248
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,000
I promise you,

249
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,708
we'll find another way
to get Meg out of there.

250
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,833
Now stop this foolishness.

251
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,208
Come on!

252
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,416
Damn it, Jo!
Don't force my hand!

253
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,583
You're gonna be my collateral,
so I can go fight that crow.

254
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,250
I don't give a damn
about anyone but Meg.

255
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,458
If you try to run,
I'll kill you.

256
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,583
Attention all Tokyo Units!
All points bulletin!

257
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,791
All units assist

258
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,083
in the apprehension of
an 18 year-old male.

259
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,416
Suspect is reported
to be traveling

260
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,041
with an 18 year-old female.

261
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,000
The female is to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

262
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,625
Use of lethal force in their
apprehension has been approved.

263
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,166
Less than six hours left
until the NI-50 takes over.

264
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:53,291
Jo, you stupid, stupid girl.
You can't do this on your own.

265
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,250
And now, you've made it
so I can't help you either.

266
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,375
I don't know why I can't move

267
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,250
My mind is lost in this cloud

268
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:30,625
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

269
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:38,250
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

270
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:43,541
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

271
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,708
and smile with each other

272
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,000
It hurts inside
when we don't...

273
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,625
we don't... we don't
know what to say

274
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:59,375
I only hope that
someone will be there,

275
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:03,458
and be watching over me

276
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,458
so take my hand,

277
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:14,250
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

278
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,750
Traps set all over the
late-night metropolis

279
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,541
attack with a snarl,
and Jo races against time!

280
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,083
Will Kyo and Meg survive?

281
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:45,375
Next Burst Angel:
The Wounded Fugitive.
