1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,333
This is fun! Tokyo's
festivals ain't too shabby!

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,000
Eh. Not as rough as
Osaka's last festival...

25
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,083
Yeah, we tend to do
things on the wild side.

26
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,541
Damn...

27
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,333
Maybe you should slow
down on the snacks a bit.

28
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,541
Well I can't help
carry the shrine,

29
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,583
so I reckon I'll just eat!

30
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,375
You hungry, Leo?

31
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,791
Now that you mention it...

32
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,458
I could go for some of that...

33
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,958
Ooh! I'll go get us some!

34
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,125
It was him!
That guy right there!

35
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,166
Somebody stop that guy!

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,833
What is this world coming to?

37
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,416
Oh, that poor girl!

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,416
Hold it right there.

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,416
The girl's nuts.
I never touched her!

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,708
Whatever, hippie. You're
lookin' awful suspicious to me!

41
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,250
But I'm innocent.

42
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,958
Yeah? All that crap in your
face is tellin' me otherwise!

43
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,500
What's the problem here?

44
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,541
Break it up or we'll
haul you both in.

45
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,583
Don't worry, I got this!

46
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,083
I'm with the Hanshin
Police, Elite Division...

47
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,250
Hawk Squad Independent
Investigator...

48
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,291
Detective Sergeant Takane Katsu!

49
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,750
Thank you, Tricia...

50
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,750
Today in Asakusa, several
female festival spectators

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,125
became victims of random
physical attacks...

52
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,125
The perpetrator
is still at large,

53
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,041
but no description
has been given...

54
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,833
Police urge anyone who may
have seen suspicious activity

55
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,958
to contact the nearest RAPT
public safety branch office

56
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,458
immediately before this
serial thief strikes again.

57
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,625
I'm gonna find that
jerk and take him down.

58
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,958
He totally ruined my
afternoon at the festival...

59
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,416
I look forward to this all year.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,291
He musta been some
kind of mental case!

61
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,875
I mean, you saw him,
didn'tcha, Leo?

62
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,708
Sure...

63
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:53,333
So... How long do you
plan on staying in town?

64
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,083
Can't say for sure yet.

65
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,333
I've got some vacation
time stored up,

66
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
and that big hoo-hah is
finally over and done with,

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,083
so I reckon they can do
without me for a while...

68
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,208
And besides,
I can't go back home

69
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,083
until I've visited
a real life TV studio!

70
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,958
TV studio?

71
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,208
Yeah! My favorite show...
They shoot it here!

72
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,708
And what show is that?

73
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,666
"Skyscraper Godfather Saga"!

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,125
It's only based on the
best movie ever made...!

75
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,375
Oh, I know that one!

76
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,916
I'll watch anything with
that hunky Hiroki in it!

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,291
Yeah, totally...!

78
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,166
I heard they're giving
a behind the scenes tour

79
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,000
at the Media Complex
Tower downtown.

80
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,375
Well, hot damn!
We should totally go!

81
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,041
There's a map around here...
I'm sure you could find it!

82
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,708
How sweet... You know I
don't know Tokyo real well...

83
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,166
Couldn't one of y'all
help show me around?

84
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,458
Check it out, Leo!
I'm on the TV.

85
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,791
That's great. Now put that
wooden sword away, would ya?

86
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,250
Ninety eight percent of
Japan's film and TV industry

87
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,916
is located here in
J-Wood Studios...

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,708
And the heart of the studio
is the Media Complex Tower,

89
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,416
or MCT for short.

90
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,583
And here we are folks.

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,166
This is the moment you
have all been waiting for.

92
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,666
The final episode of
"Skyscraper Godfather Saga"

93
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,416
is being shot here today.

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,666
Yes! I watch every week!
Man, this is cool!

95
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,208
Cut... That was beautiful.

96
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,416
All right, so what's going
on with them crazy get-ups?

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,541
Ah...! That's a great question.

98
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,916
As some of you may know, all
the backgrounds and costumes

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,416
for our shows are
computer generated.

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,291
This takes the unpredictability
of weather and props

101
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,166
completely out
of the equation...

102
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,541
And as a result, the filming
schedule always runs smoothly.

103
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,500
Alright! Quiet on the set.

104
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,500
Now we all get to witness a
little piece of the magic ...

105
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,000
Please, observe total
silence during shooting...

106
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,458
How I've longed for
this moment Kibei.

107
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,583
And for what...? What do you
think you're going to do?

108
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,666
You're all washed up, finished!

109
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,208
You have the gall to
speak of me that way...!

110
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,833
And just when I was going
to let you in on my secret.

111
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,958
It is that over
confidence and arrogance

112
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,166
that has sealed your
fate from the beginning!

113
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,625
Nice speech.
Are you finished now?

114
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,625
Then say your prayers.

115
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,416
Wait, I can't go
through with this...

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,250
Please... I've lost
everything to you...

117
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:50,500
I only thought I wanted
revenge... but I can't do it.

118
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,083
He's lying.

119
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,875
Good God, man...
You actually mean it.

120
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,125
No, Hiro-yan, he's lyin'!
He's out to get you.

121
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,000
So... Then it's finally over.

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,750
Hiro-yan, watch out!

123
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,208
Don't worry, Hiro-yan.
I'll avenge you.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,208
My beloved Hiro-yan couldn't
finish you off, so now I will!

125
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,375
You gotta stop her!
She's tearing the place apart!

126
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,833
Hey! Cut that out!

127
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,916
Get your hands off!

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,416
And in other news, the
taping of the season finale

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,291
of "Skyscraper Godfather Saga"
was interrupted today

130
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,541
when a young woman
began to smash the set...

131
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,000
The release of the final episode

132
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,083
has been pushed
back indefinitely.

133
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,375
Fortunately, no injuries
resulted from the incident,

134
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,250
and the young woman, along with
several other enraged tourists

135
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,000
were taken into custody by
security guards and transferred

136
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,791
to a nearby hospital for
psychiatric examination.

137
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,041
MCT Studios has released
an announcement that

138
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,416
all public tours of the complex

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
will be suspended
until further notice.

140
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,791
Looks like Takane has trouble
telling reality from fiction.

141
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,125
Yeah, it figures.

142
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,458
She's always swinging that
wooden sword around...

143
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,750
What do you think?

144
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,625
There's definitely something
strange about her.

145
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,125
What is it, Sei?

146
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,833
'Interference Plateau?'

147
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,833
Yes. It's a phenomenon
characterized by

148
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,291
strong reactions to
specific wavelengths.

149
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,791
Based on her symptoms, it
appears that her nervous system

150
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,833
is being influenced by
some outside stimuli.

151
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,666
Outside stimuli...?
Like what, Doctor?

152
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,666
I won't know for certain until
I run a few more tests...

153
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,916
but it appears to be
an energy wavelength

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,916
that affects the minds of
impressionable children.

155
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,708
Affects the minds of
impressionable children...

156
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:22,708
What you see before you are the
results of our experimentation.

157
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,583
If the human race is to evolve
any further, it will be

158
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,750
through the tremendous
capacity of their brain.

159
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:35,291
The brain is the mechanism
that brings about evolution.

160
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,666
The body is but a tool used
to carry out its orders.

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,958
There will come a time
when the brain develops

162
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,916
beyond the need for a body,

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,458
and the limitations it
presents will be no more...

164
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,291
Our research has been aimed
at expediting this process,

165
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,791
and with considerable results.

166
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,666
Throughout history man
has dreamed of a paradise

167
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,250
and wasted his life
searching for it...

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,916
We will be the ones
to find that utopia.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,666
Here in this deathtopia...
called Tokyo.

170
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,750
Yeah, she's finally asleep.

171
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,875
Guess I'll be headin' out now,
I'm just in the way here.

172
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,208
Thanks, Leo...

173
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,666
I'll send someone else
to check on her tomorrow.

174
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,208
Aw, hell!

175
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,916
Damn it.

176
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,583
Got it. Thanks again...

177
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
The four of us will
handle things from here.

178
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,916
Hey, Amy heads up!

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Already on it. Tracking
Leo's GPS as we speak.

180
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,291
Almost... Just a few more
seconds and I'll have it.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,416
Amy is tracking the vehicle.
Stand by for its coordinates.

182
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,750
Sure thing...
Meg, time to go.

183
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,916
Aw! But I haven't
finished shopping yet.

184
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,708
You can't die, Hiro-yan!.

185
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,625
With the data we've received
from these children,

186
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,666
we've completed the first
successful transmission

187
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,958
of the mind control
frequency over MCT airwaves.

188
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,041
Good. Very soon now,

189
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:37,250
we will be able to move into
the final stage of our plan.

190
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,875
All right, I got it...
I've tracked the signal

191
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,333
back to somewhere
within the MCT complex.

192
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,458
Lemme refine the search
to pinpoint her location.

193
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,333
[TEXT]
"Danger"

194
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,333
[TEXT]
"Infiltration"

195
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,666
Watch out!

196
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,750
What?

197
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,291
That was close.

198
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,541
We woulda been pancakes if
these things had hit us.

199
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,500
Oh no, it's coming!

200
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,250
Get outta the way!

201
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,875
Jo, look at this.

202
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,750
[TEXT]
"This is a warning."

203
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,916
Fumihiko...?

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,541
If you're going out, please
take your cell phone with you.

205
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,791
These incidents with
Takane's shift in behavior

206
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,333
and tonight's attack are
obviously not coincidences...

207
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,916
They were designed
to seem unrelated,

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,416
but I'm convinced they're
connected somehow...

209
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,625
And I'm sure we'll find
all of our answers

210
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,250
at the Media Complex Tower...

211
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,458
I just hope we aren't too late.

212
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,833
Jo, are you ready?

213
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Let's do it.

214
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,250
Happy hunting.

215
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:36,833
This is the Bai-Lan Battle
Weapon we saw in Maria's report.

216
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,541
This will be a perfect
opportunity to verify

217
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,333
the combat effectiveness
of our experiment.

218
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,916
How does the old saying go?

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,291
Ah, yes. Like a moth
to a flame...

220
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,500
Let's go over the
attack plan once more.

221
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,750
First you'll patch Jango

222
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,250
directly into the main
cable in MCT's basement.

223
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,291
As long as we're able
to complete the hookup

224
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,958
before we get caught...

225
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,083
I'll be able to get in
there with no problem

226
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,833
and strip their systems bare.

227
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,208
That warning we saw earlier...

228
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,791
It was for something big.

229
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,416
But we don't have
enough information yet.

230
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,125
So, until we know
who's behind this

231
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,875
I want you to avoid all
contact with any hostiles.

232
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,583
Jo... Just remember, if
things get rough out there...

233
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,791
You're the best there is!

234
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,875
Thanks, I needed that.

235
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,333
I've uploaded new stealth
protocols to Jango.

236
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,666
You should be invisible to
their automated defenses.

237
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,083
Here we go.

238
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,083
At this rate I'll be
able to find Takane

239
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,291
and the others
in no time at all.

240
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,541
Um, you guys I think
we might be in trouble.

241
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
We're kinda being surrounded.

242
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:44,250
Oh, great... Amy!
Amy, do you copy...?

243
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,916
I need a status report
on the MCT thing, stat!

244
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,875
Any luck yet...? Amy?!

245
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:55,333
Help... Somebody
help me, please.

246
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,916
What are they doing...?
They're nuts!

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,833
My God, all those kids...

248
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,958
This must be the
'Interference Plateau'

249
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,875
the doctor was talking about...

250
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,166
But if the mind control waves
are being broadcast from MCT...

251
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
Jo's in danger.

252
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,500
What the...?

253
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,791
She doesn't know it,

254
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,375
but she is now in combat
with a virtual opponent.

255
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,916
She cannot win. Her mind
will soon reach its limits

256
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,500
and she will break down,
and be destroyed.

257
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:31,291
Hey... Nice illusion...
Enjoy the rest of it in Hell!

258
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,625
Where am I?

259
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,125
Okay, I'm confused.
What just happened here, Sei?

260
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,000
The kids seem to have
somehow broken free

261
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,416
of their mind control,
and just in time.

262
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,083
So, then that means Jo won.

263
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes, I believe
she did... For now.

264
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,375
Man, I must be losin' it.

265
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,333
She possesses such
tremendous mental strength...

266
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,625
Not even our top soldiers
tested that well.

267
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,208
This one is certainly
worthy of our attention.

268
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,666
She'll make a strong ally...

269
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,583
Or a deadly enemy.

270
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,250
I don't know why I can't move

271
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:22,125
My mind is lost in this cloud

272
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:29,500
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

273
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:37,125
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

274
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:42,416
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

275
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,583
and smile with each other

276
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,875
It hurts inside
when we don't...

277
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,500
we don't... we don't
know what to say

278
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:58,250
I only hope that
someone will be there,

279
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:02,333
and be watching over me

280
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,333
so take my hand,

281
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:13,125
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

282
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,666
The hounds of the
mega-highway come charging

283
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,375
with fangs bared for revenge.

284
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,625
And only Jo stands
in their path.

285
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:44,166
Next Burst Angel:
Blood Red Highway.
