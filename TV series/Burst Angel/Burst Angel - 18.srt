1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,708
This crazy city never
sleeps does it?

24
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,791
Freakin' cops...

25
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,625
What the?!

26
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,000
You punk...! Who sent you?

27
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,458
Who was it that
paid you to do this?

28
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,708
Let go of him now!

29
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,416
You have no idea who
you're messing with!

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,583
Let him go!

31
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,041
Don't jack with us...! You stu--

32
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,458
You're a... a freak...

33
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,500
You're one of those cyberoids!

34
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,541
Okay then...

35
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,208
What about this?!

36
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,208
It's ready.

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,875
What is it?

38
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,166
I call it,
"A Fistful of Spaghetti."

39
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,125
Why do I always think of
him at times like this?

40
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,458
Hey Dad, can I order
what ever I want?

41
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,291
Anything for my boy.
What would you like?

42
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Cheeseburger and french fries!

43
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,000
My, you must be hungry!

44
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,541
Dad...

45
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,750
Hey, Akio...! Hi there, son.

46
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,916
Cut to the chase, Dad.
What do you need now?

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,416
Well, it's like
this son, you see...

48
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,083
I've got a little bit
of a problem, you know.

49
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,458
I need some money.

50
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,708
Not a whole lot, just enough
to pay off some things.

51
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
Again...?

52
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,125
Last time I gave you money,
you said that was it.

53
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,458
Oh, come on son,
don't be like that.

54
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,875
You can help out your old man.

55
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,083
Okay, enough with
the light in the eye!

56
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,750
You're just wasting time,
there's nothing wrong with me!

57
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,333
Cyberoid surgery isn't simple.

58
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,333
You have no idea if there's
something wrong with you.

59
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,750
Look, you're his brother,
right? Talk to him...

60
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,166
I can't operate and make
the necessary repairs

61
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,416
if he won't cooperate.

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,958
Akio... just do what
the doctor says, okay?

63
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,541
Just be cool, man.

64
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,375
Sorry, bro... I'm cool.

65
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,708
Well, now that we're
through wasting time...

66
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,625
You're young enough
I can probably get away

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
with some lower
grade components.

68
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,166
See what I'm talkin' about?!

69
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,416
He's gonna load me
up with salvaged junk!

70
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,458
Akio--

71
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,666
Bro... Come on!

72
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,041
Calm down will ya?

73
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,416
I need you to be strong...
You'll be fine.

74
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,416
You're like a brother
to me, Akio,

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,541
and we'll always stick
together like brothers.

76
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,208
When you're body is ready,
we're going to destroy

77
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,250
those people who betrayed us,
the ones who drove us out.

78
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,458
But to do that, I need
you to be strong for me.

79
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,750
I need you to become a man.

80
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,791
Oh, hi Meg... Can I talk to Sei?

81
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,875
I just picked up
the stuff for dinner...

82
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm on my way back there now,

83
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,541
you think you can
wait a bit longer...?

84
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,750
Okay. Cool, thanks.

85
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,166
Is that--?

86
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,208
Kyohei!

87
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,541
Akio...

88
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,125
Is that you?

89
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,000
Kyohei? Kyohei, wake up!

90
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,208
Where-- Where are we?

91
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,833
The lobby of the ward
registry office...

92
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,916
That was a weird coincidence

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,541
running into you
like that today.

94
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,958
Yeah, literally
running into me...

95
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,375
Guess it's just my luck,
seeing you again like this.

96
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,458
When you're in some
kind of trouble.

97
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,958
Sorry, I didn't mean
to drag you into this.

98
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,333
But you never have had
the best of luck have you?

99
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:08,000
N-Never mind all of that. Aren't
you hurt...? I thought I--

100
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,250
Hey, bro!

101
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,166
You found me!
How did you where I'd be?

102
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,208
I had the doctor
implant a tracking chip

103
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,833
during the last operation.

104
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,583
That way the second
you get into trouble,

105
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,125
I'd be able to find you.

106
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,208
But don't worry, I'm the only
one who knows where you are.

107
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,833
Man, I'm sorry...
I screwed it all up...

108
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,750
And, it almost got me killed.

109
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,541
Well kid, you're safe with me,

110
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,291
but they're hell-bent
on finding you now.

111
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,041
They even sent word to the boss

112
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,791
asking for help
to hunt you down.

113
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,916
Face it... everybody knows
you messed things up...

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,291
But what's done is done,
and one way or another,

115
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,958
we're gonna have to find a way
to resolve this situation.

116
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,958
Turn yourself in, Akio.

117
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,666
I'm sorry... bro.

118
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,666
Who's this guy?
Friend of yours or something?

119
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,458
Yeah... Kyohei... from school...
I ran into him today.

120
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,166
I see. We should head out.
I'll meet you at the car.

121
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,500
Kyohei, sorry we had to meet
again under these circumstances.

122
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Take care!

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,083
Come on, let's go.

124
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,500
Yeah, sorry--

125
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,416
Wait here a second.

126
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,375
Bro?!

127
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,666
Akio!

128
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,250
Forgive me, Akio.

129
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,250
But it's me who
can't let you live.

130
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,625
The other side has a
boss just like ours,

131
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,500
and I agreed to a deal
with his right hand man.

132
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,708
The plan is to eliminate
the two bosses

133
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:14,541
and join both Yakuza clans,
creating one massive syndicate.

134
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:19,000
Before any of this can happen,
you have to disappear.

135
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,000
Eiji...?! What is
the meaning of this?

136
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,916
What does it mean?

137
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,291
Thought it was obvious!

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,458
Akio!

139
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
Kyohei... Get outta here!

140
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,125
You screwed up
everything, you shit!

141
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,041
Now, be a good boy and die!

142
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,625
You're officially
no longer needed.

143
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,375
Damn you...

144
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,750
Damn you!

145
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,625
Akio?

146
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,583
Finally, we got
some food to eat!

147
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,583
Geez... You would think
you were starving...

148
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,458
I still can't believe that
Kyo blew us off for dinner...

149
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,666
He even called and said
he was on his way.

150
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,041
It's cuz you guys always
treat him like dirt.

151
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,375
He probably got sick of
it and decided to quit.

152
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,583
Whatever... Who are you
to talk, you little brat?

153
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,083
I'm not a little brat.
I'm an angel!

154
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,250
Yeah. You just keep on
tellin' yourself that...

155
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,916
Jo, aren't you eating?

156
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,125
Jeez, why don't ya have a little
pizza with your hot sauce?

157
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,250
It's good... You wanna try some?

158
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,166
That's okay.

159
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,750
I don't know how you
stomach all that hot stuff.

160
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,000
Better than "stomaching"
everything in the kitchen

161
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,375
like you do.

162
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,041
I do not...!

163
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,458
Jo, I think our
wicked little angel

164
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,958
needs to be
reprimanded, don't you?

165
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,750
That's right. He called
in about two hours ago

166
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,250
from a grocery store on
the other side of town.

167
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,666
That was the last
I heard from him.

168
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,958
What...? In that
same neighborhood?

169
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,833
That's got to be him.
Thank you so much for your help.

170
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,208
Jo? Sorry, but can you gear up?

171
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,958
We're going to have to
go out to find Kyohei.

172
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,000
He might be in trouble again.

173
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah... Sure thing.

174
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,000
Amy, what's the matter...?

175
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,125
Is your stomach hurting?

176
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,916
Help! My lips are on fire!

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,291
Your... Your mouth!

178
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,916
It burns!

179
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,958
Well, noboby forced
you to eat it!

180
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,958
Akio...? What's this all about?

181
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,125
Nothing... I'm just
in trouble... 'Course...

182
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,708
I've always been in some
kinda trouble, haven't I?

183
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,750
You listening to me kid?

184
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,208
We don't want no
trouble with you guys,

185
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,333
we just need a little cash.
Know what I mean?

186
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,333
Right, we just want to borrow
it and never pay it back.

187
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,041
Yeah, come on... fork
over your wallets, man!

188
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,458
You got it from your parents.

189
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,916
It's not like you guys
worked for it or anything.

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,041
Here's the deal, see?

191
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,958
Today just ain't
your lucky day...

192
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,625
Now cough up some
cash or it gets ugly.

193
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,833
I don't think they understand
the situation here.

194
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,625
Don't be a tough guy...
Give us the money!

195
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,500
Akio--

196
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,416
Don't worry, I'll handle this!

197
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,958
So, you think you're
pretty bad, huh?

198
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,666
Just stop it guys!

199
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,583
Ow, what are you doing?!

200
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,791
Get off me! You're crazy!

201
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,625
What are you guys lookin' at?

202
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,666
Get this prick off of me!

203
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,833
He's insane!
What's wrong with him?!

204
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,958
Ugh! Look at all the blood!

205
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,125
Oh, man!

206
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,166
We gotta get you
to the hospital!

207
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,458
You won't get away with this...!

208
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,500
Just wait 'til next
time we see you!

209
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,916
Yeah, we never
forget a stupid face!

210
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,958
You know what Akio...?

211
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,791
I thought you were
pretty cool that day.

212
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,875
If I remember right,
back in school

213
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
you didn't do so badly yourself.

214
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,625
Don't you boys realize,
your recklessness

215
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,833
could've gotten
someone seriously hurt!

216
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
You snot-nosed punks...

217
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
You need to learn
accountability...

218
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,625
You need to learn there are
rules that must be followed...!

219
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,583
All of you give me 10
laps in your underwear!

220
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,541
Or is that too
embarrassing for you ladies?

221
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you gonna do when you
grow up out in the real world?

222
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,125
You will learn to take
responsibility for your actions!

223
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,250
Those who can't are
nothing but cowards!

224
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,375
Now get your butts
out there and run!

225
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,708
Run you miserable cowards!

226
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,458
I... am not... a coward!

227
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,250
Oh, that's terrible! He's
running in his tighty whities!

228
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,083
I don't know, he's kinda cute!

229
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,083
What-ever!

230
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
What an idiot!

231
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,458
No one else had the stones
to go through with it.

232
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,208
The teacher was impressed,

233
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,291
and your courage got the
rest of us off the hook.

234
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,041
I always respected you for that.

235
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,250
Thanks, man... So that
'brother' of yours...

236
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,916
He's a yakuza?

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,833
Eiji picked me up
off the streets.

238
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,750
He was like a big
brother to me...

239
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,958
but, some big brother
he turned out to be, huh?

240
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,166
I listened to him like
he had all the answers

241
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,083
and he ends up
turning me into this...

242
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,750
How did you get involved
with the Yakuza?

243
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
It just kinda happened, okay?

244
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,041
Come on, just lend me some cash!

245
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,541
Dad, cut it out!

246
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,750
Money! Give me some money!

247
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,875
Dad, please, stop this!

248
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,041
Trust me... You can have a
better life with us, Akio.

249
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,083
He talked me into it...

250
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,166
He made it sound like
there was no other choice.

251
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,291
But I suppose it was
bound to happen...

252
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,916
There's nothing all that out of
the ordinary about my situation.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,625
The world's filled
with people like me...

254
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
Our paths through life just
wind a little bit differently

255
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,916
than in the world you
live in... Just a little.

256
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,750
This it...? This is where that
friggin' backstabber Eiji's

257
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,083
little cyberoid errand
boy is hiding out?

258
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,083
Akio... Let's go...!

259
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,250
If you stay here
they'll kill you...

260
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,750
I-- I have some money
I can give you.

261
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,666
Always trying to do
the right thing...

262
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,125
I don't plan on going
down that easy...

263
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,791
I still have some
unfinished business to do.

264
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,291
From what we got outta Eiji,

265
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,041
them cyberoid enhancements
of his ain't no joke...!

266
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,666
Now I want you to
find that freak,

267
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,916
take him down and
bring him to me!

268
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,875
Don't run off!

269
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,041
Akio?! Let me out of here!

270
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,958
Akio, don't do this!
They'll kill you!

271
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,583
Get off me!

272
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,000
Holy... Mother of--

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,500
A-ki-o. A-ki-o.

274
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,041
Eiji?

275
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,208
What? Is this some kind
of joke... Ironic...

276
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,791
They turned you into that so you
could kill me, didn't they?

277
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,750
This is bad... Traffic is at
an absolute stand-still...

278
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,708
I wonder what on Earth
could be going on up there?

279
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,666
Sei... I'll get out
and have a look.

280
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,541
Found him.

281
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,625
Must kill you...

282
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,666
Eiji, listen...
You and I... It's over.

283
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,750
We don't belong in this world
anymore. We're trash.

284
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,833
The bottom of society.

285
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's go now...
Let's go together...

286
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,791
Just like real brothers.

287
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,166
Akio!

288
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,958
I don't know why I can't move

289
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,833
My mind is lost in this cloud

290
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:29,208
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

291
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:36,833
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

292
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:42,125
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

293
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,291
and smile with each other

294
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,583
It hurts inside
when we don't...

295
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,208
we don't... we don't
know what to say

296
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,958
I only hope that
someone will be there,

297
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,041
and be watching over me

298
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,041
so take my hand,

299
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:12,833
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

300
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,666
The power to create

301
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,416
is used in the most
horrible way imaginable.

302
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,958
Will the launch of a terrible
invasion go unnoticed?

303
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:43,958
Next Burst Angel,
"24-Hour Strategy."
