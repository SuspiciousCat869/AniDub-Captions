1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,208
How are you feeling... Jo?

24
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,250
What the hell do you want?

25
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,458
Tell me what you're
doing with Meg.

26
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,625
From now on, she's going
to do what I tell her.

27
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,166
I see. Did Meg tell you that?

28
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,583
No, but she will soon enough.

29
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm quite certain of it...
I am going to kill you soon.

30
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,625
And when she sees that,
she'll come around.

31
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,291
Don't screw with me.

32
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,625
You should know where I am.
I'll be waiting.

33
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,166
I'm coming... Just hang on, Meg.

34
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,083
This is so exciting...

35
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,541
I'm going to tear your
girlfriend to shreds.

36
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,416
And you...

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
No way. Never happen.

38
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,500
I already told you
I'm stuffed...

39
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't eat another bite.

40
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,166
But that's Jo's food.

41
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:04,500
Go keep Jo company until
she finds her way to me.

42
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,083
All of the guard cybots on
board have been activated...

43
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,333
They're under Maria's
direct control.

44
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,875
Uh... Professor, I don't
understand Maria's logic.

45
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,208
Why doesn't she just
take the fight to Jo?

46
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,375
Think about it...

47
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,833
It makes perfect sense
for Maria to lure

48
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,083
Jo aboard Moon Empire in order
to stage their final battle...

49
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,041
Maria... most likely
is trying to recreate--

50
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,333
and resume--that final test.

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,000
Is it possible it's due to
Jo's memory-related trauma?

52
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,083
You're partly right.

53
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,208
It seems that Jo has
no memory of the powers

54
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,250
lying dormant within her.

55
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,208
Maria instinctively
knows this and wants

56
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,125
desperately for Jo
to regain her memory.

57
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,208
Then, hopefully, this
will shed some light

58
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,125
on the hidden power
Maria herself holds.

59
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,958
And when she taps into it

60
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,083
and stands in absolute
dominance over Jo,

61
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,875
she will devastate Jo
in body and mind.

62
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,333
Maria has no concept
of fear, so she thinks

63
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,458
with a completely rational mind.

64
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,250
She is amazingly calm
in battle and can make

65
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,666
only strategic decisions
towards winning.

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,666
We should expect nothing less.

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,666
After all, she is
the Genocide Angel.

68
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,708
And we created her.

69
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,833
Attention, citizens of Tokyo.

70
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,125
When traveling outside city
limits, be sure to carry

71
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,916
your RAPT-issued
Citizen Registration Card

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,541
with you at all times.

73
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,958
Non-citizens of
Tokyo will require

74
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,458
a Residency
Authorization License.

75
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,666
If asked for your
permits, please follow

76
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,458
the officer's instructions
promptly and respectfully.

77
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,750
Furthermore, evaluations for
firearm license applications

78
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,416
have also been revised.

79
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,166
From this point forward,
those wishing to carry

80
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,083
firearms will be required
to pass government-prescribed

81
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,750
tests of physical and
psychological fitness.

82
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,958
Thanks to RAPT's new "Peaceful
Purification" Initiative

83
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,708
hitting the streets this week,
nearly two hundred criminals

84
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,375
were arrested last night alone,

85
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,208
totaling almost 600
in the last five days.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,333
To help increase the
efficiency of these patrols,

87
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,875
RAPT officials have imposed
a mandatory curfew

88
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,541
for all citizens and business
owners from sundown to sunup.

89
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,041
This curfew will be
strictly enforced.

90
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,666
Later this month, Tokyo's
Reconstruction Committee

91
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,333
will begin
investigating all leads

92
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,666
dealing with illegal residents,

93
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,291
jobs and organizations
in an effort to further

94
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,000
the city's development against
the UGP, or Underground People.

95
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,208
This includes a plan of
selection and isolation

96
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,083
of the growing
underground rebellion.

97
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,916
The committee will
coordinate with a team of

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,541
international sociologists
in this effort.

99
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,291
At a conference earlier
today, the city of Tokyo

100
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,541
announced an ordinance
requiring all residents,

101
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,833
including foreigners,

102
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,208
to undergo regular
medical checkups...

103
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,291
Through ongoing
investigations by RAPT's

104
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,208
Environmental
Preservation Section,

105
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,416
violators will be
located and punished.

106
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,541
We have now infiltrated
every major media outlet

107
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,875
and control 100%
of what they say.

108
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,166
All video and audio will
be routed through us

109
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,791
so we can edit them as we
see fit before they air.

110
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,375
Excellent work...

111
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,416
There's something else I need
you to take care of immediately.

112
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,125
Maria has taken control
of Moon Empire.

113
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,000
Make sure not one word of this

114
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,250
slips out until the
situation is dealt with.

115
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,333
Understood. I will
make it my top priority.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,250
Status report please, Professor.

117
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,875
Yes, Mr. Glenford. Unfortunately
it appears that a change

118
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,958
even we couldn't
predict is taking place.

119
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,041
Maria has begun to act on
her own, of her own volition.

120
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,916
She wants to secure her desires.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,583
I don't understand. She is a
genetically engineered soldier.

122
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,375
What desires could
she possibly have...?

123
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,000
Maria and the others like her

124
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,083
are no more than weapons
given human form...

125
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,500
We designed and programmed

126
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,916
each and every cell
of their bodies...

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,458
Neither the fear of death,
nor the joy of living

128
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,708
are even possible for them...

129
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,458
The sole purpose of
their existence--

130
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,333
everything that they know--

131
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,208
is to seek out enemies
and destroy them.

132
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,166
Desire was never part
of the equation.

133
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,875
The efficiency and
accuracy of a machine,

134
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,833
combined with the survival and
battle instincts of a beast...

135
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,416
That is what the Angels
were intended to be...

136
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,833
But unfortunately,

137
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,708
they were never able to escape
from one simple truth...

138
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
They were still human...

139
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,833
Fueled by an unconscious
desire to seek out enemies

140
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,333
stronger than themselves

141
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:22,916
and unknowingly find happiness
in destroying them.

142
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,166
Once Maria tastes victory in
the most extreme of situations,

143
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,541
it is possible she will evolve
into an even greater asset.

144
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,625
And if, she loses?

145
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,000
She will most likely experience
a loss of her identity

146
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,666
as a living battle weapon.

147
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,541
I expect she would then
choose to kill herself.

148
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,083
Where are we?

149
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
The ocean?

150
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,083
No one can interfere
with us out here.

151
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,583
This is insane!
What am I doing out here?!

152
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,375
And Jo... Where is Jo?!

153
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,625
I'm not sure, but I would
guess somewhere on this ship.

154
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,250
What, you guess?!

155
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,333
It is here that I will
finally destroy her.

156
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:31,291
And once I have...
You will belong to me, Meg.

157
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,916
M-M-Meg...?

158
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,291
Bitch, you have no right
to call me that name...!

159
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,416
Anyways, Jo would never
lose to someone like you!

160
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,875
Never!

161
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,583
What are you gonna do to me?

162
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,375
You may think you're
holding me hostage,

163
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,250
but I'm warning you now:
those games won't work on Jo!

164
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,416
Someone's gonna get slaughtered
here, but it's gonna be you!

165
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,833
How can you keep
talking to me this way?

166
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,833
You know I'm stronger
than her... And yet...

167
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,291
I don't understand.

168
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,791
How...?

169
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,250
How can you always rely on Jo?!

170
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,291
Ow...! Hey, let go of my arm.

171
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,541
I've changed my mind.

172
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,875
I will kill Jo... right now!

173
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,750
And then... I will kill you.

174
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,333
Wait, no... What'd you--?!

175
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,166
You're cute...
but you're weak, Meg...

176
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,416
However...

177
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,750
If you will truly have
no one else but her...

178
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,000
Then I have no use for you.

179
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,208
I... I can't move.

180
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,208
Be a good little girl and
stay right there, will you?

181
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,875
She's... coming... Damn it.

182
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,083
They're converging at
Nuclear Storeroom One.

183
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,375
No! Maria! You mustn't
fight there!

184
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,291
Wait a minute... These are all--

185
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,083
She's here.

186
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,458
What's the matter?
Miss me already?

187
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,041
No, not quite...

188
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
Now die!

189
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,875
Amazing. Maria's combat
neuron production

190
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,458
is increasing exponentially.

191
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,250
If this continues, her synapses
won't be able to keep up.

192
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,291
Amazing... This must
be why the Angels

193
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,666
were forbidden from
fighting each other...

194
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,916
Won't work!

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,083
I know!

196
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,791
Professor. Is there any way
we can stop them from fighting?

197
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,125
Even our own override
program has been blocked.

198
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,125
We cannot intervene until
the battle has come to an end.

199
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,333
Are you telling me
that it's not possible

200
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,500
to hack into the Moon Empire?

201
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,250
There's nothing we can do.

202
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,791
Moon Empire is a crewless mother
ship with an artificial brain.

203
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,125
And is currently under
Maria's complete control.

204
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,416
However, there is a
prototype cybot on board

205
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,333
that doesn't have
such limitations.

206
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,000
I win.

207
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,333
How is this possible?

208
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:53,666
Maria's combat neurons
have completely disappeared.

209
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,958
Wh-What is this...?
What's happened to me?

210
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,791
I don't understand it...

211
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,500
but for some reason, I've
lost the will to fight you.

212
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,583
Same here...
I've hit my limit, too.

213
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:19,458
No, wait...! Why don't
you want to fight anymore?

214
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,791
Because you don't
wanna fight anymore.

215
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,875
This doesn't...
This doesn't make sense...

216
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,875
Fighting is all I've ever known.

217
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:31,250
I can't even comprehend
not wanting to fight.

218
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,666
What am I supposed to do, Jo?

219
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,000
Jo, no!

220
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,125
A perfect being
who knows no fear...

221
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,958
Wasn't that what a Genocide
Angel was supposed to be?

222
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,833
Regardless of upbringing,
those who are born human

223
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,666
cannot suppress
their humanity...

224
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,750
Even if they are
created in a lab,

225
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,333
that is a barrier I'm
afraid we will never break.

226
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,333
It's far too early to draw
conclusions, Professor.

227
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,250
What I find most surprising

228
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,625
is the extent of
Jo's latent abilities,

229
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,958
which surpassed even
Maria's combat programming.

230
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,250
Amazing... The more Jo fights,

231
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,458
the greater the power
that is awakened within her.

232
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:25,000
And all for the sake of saving
that ridiculous partner of hers.

233
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,458
Jo... You can beat her...

234
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,375
It can't be... Jo lost?

235
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,166
No, that's impossible--
Jo doesn't know how to lose.

236
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,041
Jo... Wake up...!
Please wake up!

237
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:59,375
Please Jo, you can't die
like this! Answer me!

238
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,166
Jo is not dead.

239
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,458
Damn you! How dare you hurt her!

240
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,916
Give her back to me!

241
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,583
There's nothing to
worry about, Meg.

242
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,291
She simply expended too much
energy while fighting me...

243
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,125
It's all right.
She'll be unconscious

244
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,458
until her cerebral
programming has been reset.

245
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:23,333
But aren't you and Jo enemies?

246
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,750
No, not anymore.

247
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,625
Believe it or not, I've
realized I want Jo to live...

248
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,583
Because... I like her.

249
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
What are you saying?

250
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,583
Maria. Obey your orders and

251
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,125
return for additional
programming immediately.

252
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
If you refuse these orders,

253
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,708
we will have no choice
but to eliminate you.

254
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,166
Maria... Respond!

255
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,250
I will not subject myself to
your programming any longer!

256
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
So be it...

257
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,625
With those words, you have
chosen your own execution.

258
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,791
Do it.

259
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,333
Meg! Take Jo and
get out of here!

260
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,791
Jump into the ocean...! Hurry!

261
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,625
Maria!

262
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,250
I don't know why I can't move

263
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:22,125
My mind is lost in this cloud

264
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:29,500
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

265
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:37,125
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

266
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:42,708
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

267
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,583
and smile with each other

268
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,875
It hurts inside
when we don't...

269
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,500
we don't... we don't
know what to say

270
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:58,250
I only hope that
someone will be there,

271
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:02,333
and be watching over me

272
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,333
so take my hand,

273
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:13,125
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

274
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,750
Here in this Hell on Earth...

275
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,958
where an immense
evil reigns supreme...

276
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,833
the Angels begin their
ultimate mission...

277
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:44,458
The final Burst Angel:
"Angels, Explode!"
