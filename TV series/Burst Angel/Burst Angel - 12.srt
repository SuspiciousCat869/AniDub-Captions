1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,041
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,875
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,333
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,791
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:52,500
And a-one! And a-two!
And a-three!

24
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,500
Huh? Yeah... No, I tried...

25
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,375
Well, I'm trying to write
a report on Osakan food...

26
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,916
Yeah, I know... 'Kay, bye.

27
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,041
Hey what's up...? That yer
lady friend from home?

28
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,791
No, it's my teacher...

29
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,250
From my cooking school
back in Tokyo.

30
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,708
You're goin' out
with you're teacher?

31
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,250
That's sweet!

32
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,541
Tell her to get on out here too!
We can all have a good time!

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,333
Uh, I think I've had
enough fun for one trip.

34
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,000
Say, man...! Y'ever
see a frog rocket?

35
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,166
It's where you shove
a buncha fireworks

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,458
up a frog's butt
and send 'im flyin!

37
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:45,125
Oh man, when scrawny dudes
like you ignore me...

38
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,583
They get to fly
like the frogs!

39
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:52,750
And a-one! And a-two!
And a-three! Fly!

40
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,500
Ow... That hurt.

41
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,250
Well, Hells bells!

42
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,791
I didn't know folks from
Tokyo could sit on water...!

43
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,458
Shoot, I could do that!

44
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,541
Hey, kid...! Check me out!

45
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,416
I can sit on top
of the water, too!

46
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,208
Why...? Why can't
I sit on water...?!

47
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,791
Help! I can't swim!

48
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,916
What's your name...?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,875
I asked you a question!
Get it...?!

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,666
Can the act, Tokyo!

51
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,125
What's the matter? Need me
to draw you a picture...?

52
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,916
You deaf or somethin'...? Huh?!

53
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,916
It's Jo.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,583
Now was that so hard? "Jo" what?

55
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,458
Mamasfat.

56
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,000
Jo... Mamas... fat.

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,208
Do not screw with me!

58
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,500
Your pencil broke.

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,708
I've about had it
with you...! Now talk!

60
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,083
You were at the D.D.D.
fights last night...

61
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,333
You know, a lot of
people were very upset

62
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,208
with Mega Rider's defeat.

63
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,166
So tell me, what were
you doing there?

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,750
Part-time job.

65
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,000
What kind of part-time
job requires you to carry

66
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,791
big guns like this around and
interfere with police business?

67
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,500
Cut the crap and start talkin'.

68
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,250
You could try to
be more ladylike...

69
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,250
This is Hanshin
Police Incorporated.

70
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,708
A top-rate law
enforcement company.

71
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,833
I was just...

72
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,375
Going off like a
big-shot biker chick...

73
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,875
I know, but that
ain't the way to do it.

74
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,750
You're better than that.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,833
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,375
You ever heard of the Kanbaku?

77
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,625
Piss off.

78
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,083
Watch your mouth!

79
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,708
Iriki!

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,041
They're a Kansai biker gang...

81
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,416
And li'l Takane here
was their deadly leader.

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,791
If I were you, I would
try not to make her angry.

83
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,708
That should teach her.

84
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,625
Thought she was just
some dumb biker chick.

85
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,791
The Hanshin Police Department
has been in operation

86
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,666
since the days of the
Bakuto gambler class...!

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,666
We have since risen
above our dark past

88
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,291
and gained the trust
of the people!

89
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,708
In other words...

90
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,083
We are the ones who
hold this city together!

91
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,791
Takane--

92
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:42,541
If you go and make enemies of
the people in this room...

93
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,875
Then you've gone and made
enemies with all of Osaka.

94
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,708
Understand?

95
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,083
I wasn't listening--

96
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,750
You want a thrashin'?!

97
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,541
I got bad news!

98
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,458
Bad enough we gotta deal
with flying trains,

99
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,666
but now it's flying lunches?

100
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh... Sorry...
I didn't mean to...

101
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,875
So, what's the big emergency?

102
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,458
They found some kinda
crazy, giant insect corpse

103
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,458
down in Dotonbori...

104
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,541
Some big-city kid jumped on top
of it and hurt his dumb self.

105
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,875
Let's go--

106
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,041
Right!

107
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,208
Oh yeah, Tokyo! There's
some lady here to see ya.

108
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,583
Hurry up Masa-yan!

109
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,041
Well lemme wash my face first!

110
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,458
Quite a mess you
managed to cause.

111
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,041
Caused itself.

112
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,875
Thanks to you,
I got a stern lecture

113
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,458
and we got our budget cut.

114
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
Sorry, I'll buy you some udon.

115
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,708
Really? Well if you're buying...

116
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,791
Let's go get okonomiyaki.

117
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,208
All right, so let me guess.
About this creature--

118
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,500
Yeah, it was like the ones
we've seen before...

119
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,875
It had that same glowing
brain on its head.

120
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,875
But a mutant bug and a subway
attack both on the same day...?

121
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,375
That seems like an
odd coincidence.

122
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,583
There has to be some kind of
connection between the two.

123
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,791
In which case, we're in
for some more action.

124
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,541
Well, the D.D.D. job's over

125
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,500
so there's no reason
to stay in Osaka.

126
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,666
We'll head out today.

127
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,416
Hey. You see that
huge beetle they found?

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,583
It ain't a beetle.
It's a mutated cockroach!

129
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,208
I'm telling you,
it's one of them

130
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,375
big ol' Hercules beetles
from Australia...

131
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,208
I should know, I lived down
there for almost four years.

132
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,333
Looks like they're prepping
for a showdown...

133
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,458
Guess pretty girl
does have a death wish.

134
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,166
A professional killer
will aim for your head!

135
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,875
You cannot rely on your vest!

136
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,958
Aim quickly and fire...!
Stay calm and focus!

137
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,583
Hey, there y'are.
Good work today.

138
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,625
Yeah? Ain't no thing.

139
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,250
Y'know, I love a good cuppa joe.
Ever since I was a little kid.

140
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,458
I guess you do.

141
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,166
We have to protect it--

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,375
This city... our home, Osaka...

143
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,500
We'll die doin' it if we hafta.

144
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,208
Yeah--

145
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,583
Welcome back, Chief Inspector!

146
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,333
Thanks... good to be back.

147
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,916
Welcome back, sir!

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,333
We've been expecting you.

149
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,208
Hi, Dad!

150
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,708
That's Chief--

151
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,041
Sorry, Dad.

152
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,916
Wish I had time for you,
but I have to leave town.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,208
What for?

154
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,666
The National Public Safety
Council wants to gripe at me

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,291
about these recent
unfortunate events.

156
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,541
I'll be countin' on y'all
to hold down the fort.

157
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,625
Count on it, sir.

158
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,291
We've got the
festival coming up...

159
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,083
And there's no way
I'm going to cancel it...

160
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,666
We gotta get this under
control... Got me?

161
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,666
Understood.

162
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,458
Oh and, Masa-yan?

163
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,833
Yeah?

164
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,041
Today was your daughter,
Milly's birthday wasn't it?

165
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,416
That's right... her third.
My wife's throwing a party.

166
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,541
Being away from your family
on days like today is tough...

167
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,708
I thank you.

168
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,666
Oh, no, no thanks
necessary... I, uh...

169
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,750
Oh, Takane?

170
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,250
Yes?

171
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,333
Don't forget to take some
flowers by your mother's grave

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,250
while I'm outta town.

173
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,208
I won't.

174
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,041
All, salute!

175
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,875
Good luck, sir!

176
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,125
Bye, dad...

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,583
Hey! Eyes on the road!

178
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,000
Freakin' moron!

179
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,583
Sorry 'bout that...
You two girls all right?

180
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,166
We're fine.

181
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,416
I didn't mean to shake you up

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,208
but that guy pulled out
right in front of me.

183
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,333
It was like he was
trying to hit us.

184
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,083
Hell, ever since that
subway incident...

185
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,208
I've seen lots of those trucks.

186
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,833
One of these days they're gonna
cut in front of the wrong guy

187
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,166
and then they'll be sorry.

188
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,000
People in Osaka don't like
getting pushed around

189
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,541
by outsiders. And you
know how payback can be.

190
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,958
Hey, listen...

191
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,791
I don't suppose you could
follow that truck for me?

192
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,583
Well, I reckon I could.

193
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,666
♪ Oh, Jango! How I love you! ♪

194
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,625
♪ You're the best. My Jingy,
Jangy, Jang-Jang-Jango! ♪

195
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,500
Yeah... Okay... Got it.

196
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,541
Oh, Amy!

197
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,375
You awake in there?

198
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,708
Oh Meg, is it morning already?

199
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,208
Um... Amy...?
What are you doing?

200
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:16,250
Nothing... Just working out some
issues with our optic cables.

201
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,875
Geez,... if you're
this weird now,

202
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,000
what are you gonna be
like when you grow up?

203
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,625
Anyway, Sei just called

204
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,458
and she needs us all
in Osaka right away.

205
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,000
Osaka? Let's go! Let's go!

206
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,500
But, who's gonna
drive the truck?

207
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,875
Leo.

208
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,666
All right, I got a line on
that truck you're after...

209
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,000
Just turned west
onto Ninjo Avenue...

210
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,250
You should be able to
spot him any second...

211
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,000
Hold on, he's
stopped at a light

212
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,791
about a half a block
ahead of you.

213
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,833
Okay, thanks fellas,
I just spotted him!

214
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,833
Yeah, that's right,
the girls from Tokyo.

215
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,666
Best be careful,
one of them carries

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,166
a pair of mean-looking
guns... Handle it.

217
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,833
I'm live at the National Diet...

218
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,000
where inside, representatives
from all branches

219
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,375
of law enforcement and many
concerned citizen's groups

220
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,416
have gathered to discuss
the recent acts of terrorism.

221
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Earlier today, Chief Katsu
arrived from Osaka

222
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,333
for a briefing that
preceded the conference.

223
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,875
After the accident, an
anonymous call was received.

224
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,500
What follows is a
tape-recording of that call.

225
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,916
If you got a point, you
better get to it darn quick!

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,083
You're not taking me
seriously, that hurts...

227
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,750
Doesn't matter...
What you fail to understand

228
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,750
is that all of this
is far from over.

229
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,750
In fact, I'm just
getting started!

230
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,916
Be warned, I will
utterly destroy

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,375
the Hanshin Police Force.

232
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,833
And that's not all.

233
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,250
I will bring down
all of Osaka with you!

234
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,750
I'm sure you'll all going
to be looking forward to it.

235
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,083
We gotta stop him.

236
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,500
Chief Katsu, is this a
claim of responsibility?

237
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,541
Did the caller identify himself?

238
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,500
Please, everyone calm down!

239
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,958
Later today,

240
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,458
Chief Katsu will meet with
top officials from R.A.P.T.

241
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,750
to discuss strategies for
combating the terrorist threat.

242
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,625
From The National Diet
Building, I'm Sean Billings.

243
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,916
This can't... be real?
Can it, Inspector?

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,125
Wish I could tell ya.

245
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,625
Hey, I got a lead to
check out, all right?

246
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
Time to do a
little detective work?

247
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,291
You recognize that logo?

248
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,166
It was on that train we were
chasing a few weeks back.

249
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,750
Yeah, so?

250
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
This might have something to do
with that creature you ran into.

251
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,375
You did say it had
the same glowing brain.

252
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:38,375
But why did the truck come
here to this abandoned park.

253
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,958
That's what we're
about to find out.

254
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,583
What is it?

255
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,375
The driver's been shot!

256
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,666
What? It's a set up?

257
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,666
A trap...

258
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,000
Get down!

259
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,333
Take it easy. You don't have
to be so rough about it.

260
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,458
Sorry, didn't mean to be...

261
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,500
Stay under the truck
and keep your head down.

262
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,833
No problem.

263
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,083
There he is!

264
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,708
Hey Sei, you can come out now.

265
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,791
Sei!

266
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,916
Hey check it out. I'm picking
up a huge EM signal!

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,541
And despite its crazy-big size,
my readings say it's flying.

268
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,916
Where's it headed?

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,375
Let's see...

270
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,916
Tracking toward something
that looks like Tokyo Tower.

271
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,375
What is that thing?
It's gone berserk!

272
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,000
It's some kind of robot!

273
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,625
You think it can see us in here?

274
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,333
What is that thing
tryin' to do?!

275
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,833
You are witnessing the debut
of the cybot Giganits.

276
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,500
Cool, isn't it?

277
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,375
Let's cut the small talk.
What are you trying to do?

278
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,833
You're a smart guy.
Why don't you figure it out?

279
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,208
How original.

280
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,250
You're gonna blow up
Tsutenkaku Tower, aren't you?

281
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,708
You know, I hadn't
thought of that,

282
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,208
but it's an interesting idea.

283
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,875
You wouldn't dare...!
I will hunt you down!

284
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,958
Ooh, scary!
The detective who's too busy

285
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,791
for his own family has
a really nasty temper.

286
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,916
What? What did you say?

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,166
Attention, we have an
emergency situation.

288
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,333
All mobile and attack
units report to the tower

289
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,125
and establish a defensive
perimeter immediately!

290
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,750
A rogue cybot is attempting
to destroy the tower!

291
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,041
Roger!

292
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,958
You sons of bitches...!

293
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,583
I'll turn y'all into
sashimi, you hear me?!

294
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,041
Yeah! Get the hell
out of our town!

295
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,125
Dang! That thing's huge...

296
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,958
Well, go get him!

297
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,250
I love the way an
historic structure can

298
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,958
captivate the public and come
to symbolize an entire city...

299
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,416
Tsutenkaku Tower
is one of those.

300
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,416
Why are you making me
sit here and watch this?

301
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,458
No real reason, my good Chief...

302
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,958
I just wanted you to
have a front row seat

303
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,000
for the collapse of Osaka.

304
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,250
When this is over,

305
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,625
a great opportunity will
have presented itself.

306
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,041
And, what's that...?

307
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,333
Are you gonna take over Osaka?

308
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,041
To be perfectly frank...

309
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,708
I've always been a little bit
jealous of you out there.

310
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,375
How's that?

311
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,291
Osaka's great sense
of community...

312
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,791
How can Tokyo even
hope to compare?

313
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,166
Our streets are littered
with worthless vermin

314
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,666
and unchecked immigrants.

315
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,916
You see, that's the
reason I created RAPT.

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,833
To eliminate those
unwanted elements

317
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,000
and rebuild a solid community.

318
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,416
Interesting... Y'know
you're quite insane.

319
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,625
If you go along with us,
we can avoid

320
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,250
the real unpleasantness that
most certainly will follow.

321
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,166
I'm sure we can work out
a suitable "bargain."

322
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,916
We must defend the tower!
We must defend Osaka!

323
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,375
Honor our history...!
Remember Osaka Castle!

324
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,625
Don't get upset.

325
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,958
Who the hell do
you think you are?

326
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,916
You and your corruption made
Tokyo into the cesspool it is!

327
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,875
The will of the
people still thrives

328
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,625
on our side of the Hakone Wall!

329
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,583
If you want Osaka...
then fight us!

330
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,375
I'm sure you'll fight bravely,
but you just can't win.

331
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
This is Inspector
Masa of Tiger-1!

332
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,458
All units open fire!
Aim for the torso!

333
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah, kill it!

334
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,375
Die you gravy sucking pig!

335
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,833
Hell, yeah!

336
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,125
Takane...

337
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Inspector Iriki...! Inspector,
where are you...? Inspe--

338
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,000
Masa-yan.

339
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,708
Hey... I can't--I can't
find Inspector Iriki.

340
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,541
Is he with you...? Masa-yan?

341
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,250
Takane... will you
do me a favor?

342
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,375
My daughter turned
three today...

343
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,958
When she's old enough,
tell her about me.

344
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,125
Tell her about what
kind of cop I was.

345
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,666
It would mean a lot...

346
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,500
Oh, yeah... Don't take any
shit from those traitors!

347
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,625
Osaka's justice will never die!

348
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,375
Masa-yan!

349
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:49,375
Milly...! I was...
a good cop...!

350
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,416
I lived to serve
the city I loved...!

351
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,708
Your father died so
that you could live!

352
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,666
How ya like that...?!

353
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,833
Here! Y'want another taste?!

354
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,208
What the--?

355
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:43,750
Hurry!

356
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,541
I know, I know!

357
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,458
Who the hell are you guys?

358
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,583
You're Takane of the Elite
Division, Hawk Squad, right?

359
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,750
Yeah...

360
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,583
That's Jo taking care
of things for you.

361
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,291
Not good...

362
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,875
You let go of Jo...!
Let go! Let go!

363
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,833
Gigantis, go ahead and crush
that thing like a tin can.

364
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,625
C'mon! We need to get
to the trailer now!

365
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,708
Why...? You traitor...

366
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
You traitor!

367
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:19,458
I don't know why I can't move

368
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:23,333
My mind is lost in this cloud

369
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:30,708
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

370
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:38,333
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

371
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:43,625
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

372
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,875
and smile with each other

373
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:51,083
It hurts inside
when we don't...

374
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,708
we don't... we don't
know what to say

375
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,458
I only hope that
someone will be there,

376
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,541
and be watching over me

377
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,541
so take my hand,

378
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:14,333
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

379
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:36,833
Justice spoiled; trust
betrayed; sadness endured...

380
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,666
And unlikely heroes

381
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,791
who rise from the brink of
despair and destruction...

382
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,666
Next Burst Angel:
"Showdown in Osaka."
