1
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,375
To the rhythm!

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,416
Check it!

3
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,416
OK, fellas!

4
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,875
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,583
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,958
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,458
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,125
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,416
Everybody, loosey

10
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,583
Vividly, crazy

12
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,958
Fly up, angel

13
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,000
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,208
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,833
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,791
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,333
It goes flying frustration

18
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:20,291
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,750
Everybody, loosey

20
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,333
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,750
Vividly, crazy

22
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,208
Fly up, angel

23
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,416
You can eat it, chief!
Now, pay up!

24
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,750
Shut your mouth! Like I'd ever
pay a cheating punk like you!

25
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
Drop the tough act, old man!

26
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,166
Take a swing at me! I beg you!

27
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,416
If I did, they wouldn't
be able to identify the body.

28
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,750
You talk big for a cheat!
How do you walk it?

29
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,333
I'll walk it right
over your grave!

30
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,291
Well I'm still standing
here, ain't I?

31
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,875
What the heck is going on?!

32
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,708
Eat this!

33
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,250
And all of the sudden,
it's like pow, pow, pow, pow!

34
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,666
Machine gun fire was everywhere.
I swear, I thought I was dead.

35
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,375
Yeah, well, ever since
they signed the law

36
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,416
that says anyone can
carry a weapon around,

37
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,041
things began crashing.

38
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,041
I hear the higher-powered
guns are selling the most.

39
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,375
You would think we would
start to be a little safer

40
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,666
with the new RAPT
headquarters in town.

41
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,666
The criminal apprehension
rate's gone up,

42
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
but the arrest rate's gone down.

43
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,833
Wait a minute. Apprehension
is up, but arrests are down?

44
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,083
How's that?

45
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,750
It means that the number
of crooks caught alive

46
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,041
has decreased,
all thanks to RAPT.

47
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,291
Hello, Kyouhei.

48
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,250
I heard word that you're
seeking new employment.

49
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,791
Yeah. That other place
wasn't challenging.

50
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,458
A job builds character,

51
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,166
but be sure not to neglect
your regular schoolwork.

52
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,375
Of course. I won't.

53
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,291
Hey, teach, what's that?

54
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:22,166
This? Oh, nothing. I get
a ton of spam email everyday.

55
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,833
Most are just pranks
from former students,

56
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,541
so I don't even know
if this is real.

57
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,916
"Desperately Wanted:

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,750
A wonderful man to make
fancy and delicious cuisine.

59
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,833
Great pay, superb
working conditions.

60
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,333
First come, first serve.
Give us a call ASAP."

61
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,458
Is this for real?

62
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
In a world of
violence and greed,

63
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,041
one man is given
a second chance.

64
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,916
--Released from New Alcatraz
--No! You can't!

65
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,791
after 10 long years, he faces
an even harsher reality:

66
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,083
--Broken bonds, betrayal,
--What have you done with her?

67
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,375
--and bitter rivalry.
--Stop this now.

68
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,875
Starring Hiroki
Machikata as Kibei.

69
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,208
With Shinichi Kiba,

70
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,458
and multiple award winning
actress, Yuka Salmon.

71
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,416
"Skyscraper Godfather Saga."

72
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,958
Coming soon to
theatres everywhere!

73
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,250
And now for the news.

74
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,458
Last night, a road crew
working on a raised highway

75
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,916
south of the city was attacked
by an unmarked work cybot.

76
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,166
Several materials were
taken from the work site,

77
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,916
and this isn't the first
time this has happened.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,458
Since the beginning
of the month,

79
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,708
at least four such incidents
have been reported and verified.

80
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,750
Jurisdiction of this
matter has been taken

81
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,750
from the police by RAPT.

82
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,250
Kyouhei Tachibana

83
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,416
from the Love and Happy
Culinary Design School?

84
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
Uh, yeah, that's me.

85
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,208
You were saying
you wanted to save up

86
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,833
so you could study abroad?

87
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,625
Well, I'm studying
to be a patissier.

88
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,625
Oh, a patissier is a pastry
chef, makes cakes and things.

89
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,833
Patissier, huh?
I've never heard of that.

90
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,583
To be a great chef,
I really should study in France.

91
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,791
It's the only way to
get a foot in the door.

92
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:09,250
But they've got this huge tax
on studying overseas right now.

93
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,875
And I can't really ask
my parents for help, so...

94
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,166
That's admirable.
You may be young,

95
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,250
but you're smart enough
to have a goal.

96
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,416
I like that in a person.

97
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,250
Uh, thanks.

98
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,250
My specialty is pastries,

99
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,541
but I also know
Japanese, French, Chinese,

100
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,000
and Italian style dishes,

101
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,375
so I'm pretty
versatile in the kitchen.

102
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,833
I think this price tag
has an extra zero.

103
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,583
Yes.

104
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,583
Sei? Where are you?

105
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,583
Grocery shopping
with our new cook.

106
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,000
Just be patient.
We'll be back soon.

107
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,458
Give me that! Hurry it up!

108
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,083
My stomach is starting
to make strange noises.

109
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,666
Let's hurry.

110
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,916
'Kay.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,208
Man, We bought so much stuff.

112
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,958
How many people am
I cooking for anyway?

113
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,583
You guys must live
in a huge mansion.

114
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,958
Something like that.

115
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,666
It's felt empty since
our previous cook left.

116
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,583
Had to go back to
his home country.

117
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,166
Here?

118
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,708
Hey, it's me. And I've
brought the new cook along.

119
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll be right down.

120
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,875
It's about time! I take it
that's our new master chef?

121
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,166
It is.

122
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,375
Uh, hello.

123
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,541
And this is where
you'll be working.

124
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,041
Your job will simply be to cook
nutritious meals for all of us.

125
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,958
So, do you, like,
take this motor home

126
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,541
on picnics or something?

127
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:24,083
Uh, no. This is our home 24-7.

128
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,291
We all live here.

129
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,791
And by 'all' you mean
your families live here, too?

130
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,291
Left to their own devices,
these girls eat only junk food.

131
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,541
They need a cook like you

132
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,625
who can whip them up
something substantial.

133
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,625
That's Meg.

134
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,708
And this is Amy.

135
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,916
Turn around.

136
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,875
Turn around a hundred
and eighty degrees.

137
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,583
Okay. Like this?

138
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,041
Don't you think he's too young?

139
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,583
Can the attitude.
You wouldn't know it,

140
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,791
but he's an excellent cook,

141
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,625
attending a certified
culinary school.

142
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,666
Well, I don't know
about excellent.

143
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,208
He smells like cake!

144
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,333
Oh, yeah, I was
practicing earlier.

145
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,166
So, hey! Didn't you think
our little flier was cute?

146
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Was that your work?

147
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,625
Yeah! I was kinda worried
about who would respond

148
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,250
to such a cool flyer,
but I guess you're all right.

149
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,416
And besides, it looks
like you could handle

150
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,916
a little pain now and again.

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,250
Don't get your hopes up.
He's got a pansy-looking face

152
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,541
and he's thin as a rail.
He won't last two weeks.

153
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,625
Girls, Kyouhei is
saving up to study abroad.

154
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,041
Wouldn't it be wonderful

155
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,875
if through this we could
help him achieve his dream?

156
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,541
He takes this job,
he can study four of 'em!

157
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,750
Achieve his dream! Funny stuff!

158
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,166
Geez, Sei, when did you
grow a sense of humor?

159
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,791
Just ignore them.
So how about it?

160
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
Would you like to
come work for us?

161
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,833
Yes, of course,
if you'll have me.

162
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,208
Wait a minute!
Doesn't Jo get a vote?

163
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,625
Jo?

164
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,041
Oh, is she here?

165
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, she just got back.

166
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,666
Said something about
finishing that pro-bono job

167
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,083
she was talking about.

168
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,125
I bet she's somewhere
watching videos.

169
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,000
She always does
that after a job.

170
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,000
Aha!

171
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,666
Hold on a sec!

172
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,875
Look away.

173
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,125
Huh?

174
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,500
Don't you say anything
besides 'huh' or 'what'?

175
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,375
Sorry about that.

176
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,208
She may be rude,
but deep down

177
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,875
she actually cares
for others quite a bit.

178
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,750
Meg cares for others?

179
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:41,166
Man, Sei! Your jokes are
really on the money today.

180
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,958
Um, so you are all sisters?

181
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,000
No. We're just
very close roommates.

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,041
Jo, so this is the new cook.

183
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,708
What do you think of him?
'Cause I think he's a tool.

184
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,708
It's a guy.

185
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,125
Whatever. Like I care.

186
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay then.
Mr. Kyouhei Tachibana,

187
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,375
we will be counting
on your services.

188
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,125
Oh, thanks.

189
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,625
Excuse me for a moment.

190
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,500
Excuse me, miss. But, did you--

191
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,500
What kinda line is that?
'Excuse me, miss!'

192
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,125
You better not be
trying to hit on her.

193
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,125
I was just talking!

194
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,541
It couldn't be.

195
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,083
[TEXT]
"Acquire Data Disc"

196
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,250
We've got a job.
Everyone get ready.

197
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,458
What? A job?

198
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,583
Oh! But I'm starved!
I haven't eaten all day!

199
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,125
Can it, Miss Selfish!

200
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,125
The world doesn't revolve
around your stomach!

201
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,875
When the job's over,
you can have

202
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,958
whatever it is you
want for dinner.

203
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:18,416
All right! Let's get
to work! W-O-R-K!

204
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,833
So, what should I do until then?

205
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,083
I apologize. But would you mind
going home until I call you?

206
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
It shouldn't be long.

207
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,250
Jo, we got a job.

208
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,166
Jo, stop it! You!
Get out of here, already!

209
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,291
Why don't you stop by
after school tomorrow?

210
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay...

211
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,125
See you then.

212
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,125
What the heck are you
staring at? We said scram!

213
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,875
What just happened here?

214
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,958
Those girls have gotta
have some serious cash.

215
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,750
I wonder how they
know each other.

216
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,833
They're nice looking and
seem cool, but something's off.

217
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,333
What is this job that they--

218
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,083
Wait! What are--

219
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,333
What do you s'pose
the cook would think

220
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,333
if he knew what we do?

221
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,000
He'd probably run.

222
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,833
He had that gutless coward
look down to a science.

223
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,708
Jo, you ready?

224
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,041
Let's do it.

225
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,791
The job is simple. There's an
exchange between weapons dealers

226
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,041
in a warehouse down in Harumi.

227
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,458
One side is selling a disc.
That's our target.

228
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,666
What's on it?

229
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,291
Not sure. But Bai-Lan
wants us to get it.

230
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,291
Maybe the plan is to copy
it for mass production.

231
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,333
Don't turn around, but
you've got a car following you.

232
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,291
Uploading satellite images now.

233
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,416
Great, we've got a tail.
What do we do?

234
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,875
Nothing for the time being.
We don't want to cause a scene.

235
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,875
They can't do anything
out here anyway.

236
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,458
Just like our intel said.

237
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,083
The deal's going down right now.

238
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,458
Good. Proceed as planned.

239
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,625
Can I mow 'em all down?

240
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,583
Negative.
Don't make a big scene.

241
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,125
I want you to be discreet.

242
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,916
It's verified.

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,166
Same here.

244
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,708
Don't move.

245
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,541
Behind you, too.

246
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,125
I thought our
target was the disc.

247
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,791
Call it a perk.

248
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,333
You're Bai-Lan's gang.

249
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,666
We knew you broads would
come after the disc.

250
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,875
And we got another surprise.

251
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,583
We took your little
buddy as insurance

252
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,333
for just such an occasion.

253
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,875
Buddy? What are
you talking about?

254
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,375
Freakin' Sei let
her guard down.

255
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,458
No, she wouldn't.

256
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,291
What's he doing here?

257
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,375
Who is it?

258
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,708
That pansy-ass cook!

259
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,500
Now hand over the case,

260
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,750
or the kid's head
splatters and stains

261
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,916
both of your trendy,
teenybopper outfits.

262
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,000
Go ahead and shoot.

263
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,333
--Gladly.
--You'd like that. Wouldn't you?

264
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,666
He's got seconds here!
Make a decision!

265
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,250
I told you to shoot.

266
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,875
What just happened back there?

267
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,958
Doesn't matter! Just run!

268
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,958
What the heck is going on?!

269
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,666
Do not leave my side.

270
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,875
Right.

271
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,375
Meg, no!

272
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,500
Ow, hot!

273
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,500
Don't move!

274
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
Don't shoot me!

275
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,625
You'll have to escape
by yourself. Got it?

276
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,625
Thanks.

277
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,375
Meg!

278
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,416
Quit playing around
and get down from there!

279
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I-I can't get loose!

280
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,708
Meg! Jo! Status report!
What's going on down there?

281
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,083
Where the hell did
that cybot come from?

282
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,125
What? You don't know either?

283
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,833
Well, he's not on our side.

284
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,541
It's got Meg. Bring out Jango!

285
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,958
Jo!

286
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,541
Wakey-wakey, Jango.

287
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,875
Jo's waiting for you.

288
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,416
This isn't over yet,
you son of a bitch!

289
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
That's the mark
I saw in Shinjuku!

290
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,166
You just entered
a whole new world.

291
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,750
Welcome to Hell!

292
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,583
I don't know why I can't move

293
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:23,458
My mind is lost in this cloud

294
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:30,833
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

295
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:38,500
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

296
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:43,791
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

297
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,958
and smile with each other

298
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,250
It hurts inside
when we don't...

299
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,875
we don't... we don't
know what to say

300
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:59,625
I only hope that
someone will be there,

301
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,791
and be watching over me

302
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,708
so take my hand,

303
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:14,500
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

304
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,333
After a mysterious cybot 
appears during their mission

305
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:37,833
and abducts Meg, Kyouhei is
drafted into the rescue plan.

306
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,791
The next step: at Jo's side,

307
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,208
sneak into the lawless
district of Shibuya.

308
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,916
Next Burst Angel:
The Heartless Gunfighter.
