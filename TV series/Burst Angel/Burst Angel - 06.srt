1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,125
Nestled deep in a remote forest
stands St. Luciana's Academy,

24
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,458
an elite prep school
for the well-to-do.

25
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,958
After a series of
bizarre occurrences

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,583
and unexplained
psychological traumas,

27
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,625
Meg enrolled as
a transfer student

28
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,750
to investigate the school
from the inside out.

29
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,833
One night, Meg discovered
a young girl on the roof

30
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,125
and stopped her from
committing suicide.

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,708
The girl, Yoko, was fraught with
terror and seemed possessed,

32
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,625
as if tortured by
some unseen phantom.

33
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,708
At the center of it all
was the Ishtar Club,

34
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:49,208
a highly secretive and
exclusive student organization.

35
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,208
Meg was invited to join,

36
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,625
and immediately had
suspicions about Angelique,

37
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,250
their beautiful and
intelligent leader.

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,416
Her curiosity piqued, Meg's
investigation pressed forward.

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,125
But, before she knows it,

40
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,416
she's attacked by a monster
and running for her life.

41
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,250
Oh, Jo! Thank you!

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,125
So, where the hell did
that thing come from?

43
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,541
The dormitory,
I think. I'm not sure.

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,916
Well, the sneaky detective
bit's not gonna work anymore.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
But things are definitely
getting interesting.

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:56,125
No, they are not getting
interesting! I wanna go home!

47
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,583
I don't wanna be here anymore!

48
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,375
This is not fun!

49
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,583
Startin' today, I'm going
undercover with you.

50
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,166
Really?

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah. You'd have had a hard time
fighting that thing by yourself.

52
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,458
But, Jo...

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,750
That uniform's not your style.

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,541
Oh. You think?

55
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,958
Ladies. I would
like to introduce

56
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,791
our new transfer
student, Jo Carpenter.

57
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,708
Jo has been overseas for the
last few years with her father,

58
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,000
an important Japanese diplomat.

59
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,625
So, Kyo, my little devil...

60
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,291
How do you suppose Jo
is doing in there so far?

61
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,250
She gets points in my book
just for wearing that uniform.

62
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,458
--So not her!
--So not her!

63
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,208
Yeah, yeah.
I got it. Understood!

64
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,625
I just got some news.

65
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,583
The drug tests on the Bai-Lan
girl came back positive.

66
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,958
It looks like she's been taking
them daily for some time now.

67
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,333
Stop! Stop!

68
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,458
It turns out there's a
compound present in the drug

69
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,833
that sends the subject
into an extreme manic state.

70
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,833
It's like they're
in some trance.

71
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,333
So then--

72
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,458
Yes, we need to get
word to Meg and Jo

73
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,750
not to eat the food there.

74
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,166
Listen Kyo, I know it's crazy,
but we're counting on you.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,375
Oh, sure!

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,375
Well we know Jo can
take care of herself,

77
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,250
but do you think
Meg's gonna be okay?

78
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,625
Dear Lord, please make this food

79
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,708
taste just a little bit
better than yesterday's.

80
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,833
Only one way to find out.
Gotta dig right in!

81
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,166
Bon appetit, me!

82
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,458
Don't eat any of the food here.

83
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,750
Ahh, this is getting
worse everyday!

84
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,250
This sucks. The biggest
danger in this crappy place

85
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,708
is starving to death.

86
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,500
Dig in if you
enjoy hallucinations.

87
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,833
Halluci-- So, are you saying
all the food here is drugged?

88
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,666
More than likely.
Amy contacted me.

89
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,875
No way. So, everyone here has
been eating poisoned food?

90
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,833
Hey, Meg. What's up?

91
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:19,875
Oh, hi, Yoko.

92
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,208
You're eating lunch
with Jo, I see?

93
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,541
You guys are friends already?

94
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,458
But you're in different grades.

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,625
Um, yeah! Y'know we're
both pretty new here, and...

96
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,916
We just hit it off
right from the start!

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,833
Oh, well, if you're good
enough to be Meg's friend,

98
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,375
then you're good enough
to be my friend too.

99
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,041
Great.

100
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,041
What's the matter?

101
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,666
Aren't you going to eat?
Lunchtime's almost over.

102
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,625
Uh, I really wasn't
very hungry today.

103
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,916
--Oh, my!
--Uh, you see...

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,750
Meg's on a new diet.

105
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,750
Hey! Watch the hands!

106
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,791
She was just telling
me how careless she is

107
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,791
about what she eats.

108
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,666
Oh, Jo, you crack me up
almost as much as Meg does!

109
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,625
Maybe I should be on a diet.
What do you think?

110
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,041
Ladies! I need a moment
of your time please.

111
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,041
Earlier this morning, someone
broke into the Ishtar club,

112
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,125
and with extreme prejudice,
vandalized it!

113
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,416
This is a horrible blight
on our entire school.

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,083
Some miscreant devil
thought it would be funny

115
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,458
to destroy the harmony
of our environment!

116
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,666
Miscreant devil?
Exaggerate much, Drama Queen?

117
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,958
She's completely mental.

118
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,875
And those gloves she was
wearing were so obvious.

119
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,333
You know she's hiding
that wound you gave her.

120
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,125
Totally suspicious.

121
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,375
Once I discover her
true identity-- Ha!

122
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll give her a good
pounding and teach her

123
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,958
not to mess with us!

124
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,958
Megumi.

125
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,833
Would you kindly
come with me, please?

126
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,583
We have some questions
we'd like to ask.

127
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm kinda busy now. Later?

128
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,833
Just go.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,875
But I...

130
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
Get moving.

131
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,041
All right, all right. Whatever!

132
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,791
Tell me. Where do
you come from, Meg?

133
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:31,083
You know, I moved around a
lot with my dad. So, all over.

134
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,375
Your transfer papers here,
say you're from Okinawa,

135
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,833
is that correct?

136
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,875
Yeah. That's right. I was
born and raised in Okinawa.

137
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,750
What is she doing
with my transfer papers?

138
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,125
Oh, you know what?
I misread that.

139
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,583
It actually says you
were born in Hokkaido.

140
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,708
What? Oh, yeah.
That's right. Hokkaido.

141
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:56,041
Wait one second. My mistake,
this isn't even your file.

142
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,958
Cut the crap!

143
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,125
You think you're special just
'cause your daddy's rich?

144
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,500
If you've got something to say,
why don't you spit it out?

145
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,500
All right, let's
cut to the chase.

146
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,041
So uh, what are you gonna do?

147
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,958
Not like that little butter
knife scares me or anything.

148
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,791
Not too much.

149
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,625
This is no way to handle things!

150
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,750
How can you be certain
Meg was the intruder?

151
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,541
Are you prepared to
take responsibility

152
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,666
if you're mistaken?

153
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,833
What do you mean?

154
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,625
Meg was with me this morning.

155
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,875
After breakfast, we
enjoyed a leisurely walk

156
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,750
in the courtyard in
front of the school.

157
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,125
Now, put down the knife.
This matter is settled.

158
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,750
Thanks for helping
me out back there.

159
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,125
Don't worry about it.

160
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,791
Angelique can definitely
get carried away sometimes.

161
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,833
I didn't think you'd
mind me stepping in.

162
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,750
This school can be pretty
rough on new kids,

163
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
and I hate seeing
people get picked on.

164
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,000
So, the underclassmen have
swim class next period, right?

165
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,958
You better hurry
so you're not late.

166
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,791
Yeah. I better get going.
And thanks again.

167
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,916
I'll return the favor, if I can.

168
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,583
Jo? What are you doing?

169
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,958
Nothing.

170
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,250
Are you trying to embarrass
me in front of Nadesico?

171
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,791
No one here but me.

172
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:34,291
What the... Where'd she go?
She was just here.

173
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,750
Man, I'm getting sick and
tired of those prissy snobs

174
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,000
picking on me all the time!

175
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,375
I am not the kind of girl
that gives in to threats.

176
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,125
No sir-ree.

177
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,708
Are you even listening to me?

178
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,958
You're wearing my
favorite pair of panties!

179
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,333
Sorry. I was in a rush so I
just grabbed whatever was clean.

180
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,750
But that's my underwear! Who
takes other people's panties?

181
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,791
Who cares? We share
everything else.

182
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,000
Take 'em off!

183
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,250
I was going to.

184
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,708
I said off!

185
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,666
Take it easy! What if an
enemy showed up right now?

186
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,166
What do you care?

187
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,166
You're the one who prances
around half-naked all the time!

188
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,333
It's easier to fight that way.

189
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,666
Hey. You okay?

190
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,416
I guess. That swim
really wiped me out.

191
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,041
I think you're right.
Maybe I do need to go on a diet.

192
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,875
I'm feeling really heavy today.

193
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Meg!

194
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,166
Meg? Jo?

195
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,750
Just stay out of our way,

196
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,041
or you'll be getting another
visit from the monster.

197
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,000
Meg, stay with me!

198
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,541
Get out of the pool!
You're okay now.

199
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,333
Jo!

200
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,083
Meg!

201
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,750
Jo, help!

202
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,375
Ahh! No!

203
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,875
So, what now? Jo?

204
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,375
Get a hold of Sei right away!

205
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,583
Tell her we've got a really
mean algae problem in the pool.

206
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,208
Are you okay?

207
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,458
Get out of here right now!
Run for the trailer.

208
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,208
Right!

209
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,041
Oh my god, oh my god,
it's here, it's here!

210
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,916
And it's like,
totally going nuts on Jo!

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,958
Meg, what are you talking about?

212
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,416
Calm down and tell
me what happened!

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,375
There was like,
this giant algae problem!

214
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,958
I mean, it was, like, a monster!
And it attacked us in the pool!

215
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,125
And then the other
students went all

216
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,666
"Night of the Living
Schoolgirl" on us!

217
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,958
This is really bad!

218
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, and now Jo's fighting
that monster thing!

219
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,375
What did this monster look like?

220
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,375
Meg are you there? Meg?

221
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,500
Not again.

222
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,958
You're not getting
away that easily.

223
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,708
Hey, let me go!

224
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,666
Take me down! You jerks!

225
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,041
You have been chosen.

226
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,916
It was my sworn duty
to watch over you.

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,416
I have fulfilled my task,

228
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,208
and now I have been allowed
to return to the fold.

229
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
Hey, that's the soup
they serve at lunch!

230
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,666
Just drink it, Meg.

231
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,875
We have done as
you have commanded.

232
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,500
Why are you here?
Where did you come from?

233
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,916
I don't...

234
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,875
I used to... I, uh...
I lived in New York.

235
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,208
What else?

236
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,208
That was where I met Jo.

237
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,666
Jo? The other transfer student?

238
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,291
Yes, that's right.
She's usually laid-back,

239
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,166
but Jo always protects me.

240
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,041
When she's angry,
she's unstoppable.

241
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,833
Meg!

242
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,833
Wha... What's going on?

243
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,416
Stop! I will not allow
any further violence.

244
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:09,708
Unless it's retaliation for
this wound. I'll make you pay!

245
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,166
See that?

246
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,000
She's the one controlling
every one of those crazies.

247
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,625
No way!

248
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,333
Nadesico, we need to
get you away from them.

249
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,291
Quickly!

250
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,000
Jo, don't shoot!

251
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,625
They're not in control of
themselves! You'll kill them!

252
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,791
They work for the demon girl.

253
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:33,125
I know. But still,
we have to help them!

254
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
You can make it,
just a little further.

255
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,875
Yoko! Get a grip!
It isn't reality.

256
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,083
Meg, the only choice
is to kill Nadesico.

257
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,125
Jo!

258
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,083
Looks like she's
finally lost control.

259
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,875
The cerebral mutation
has peaked at only 88%,

260
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,625
but her life signs are strong.

261
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,958
Then let's watch
and see how it ends.

262
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,666
It'd be a shame to abandon
one of our top students.

263
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,875
Here! Choke on this!

264
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,458
Wait. There's no head.

265
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,958
Don't tell me... Jo!

266
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,666
Jo!

267
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,500
It's me! It's Meg! Jo?

268
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,333
Thank you, Meg.

269
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,500
Why do you always have
to play the cowboy?

270
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,208
Don't scare me like that!

271
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,333
Did you shoot this?

272
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,583
Well, yeah! You were in danger.

273
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,166
Ta-da! What's up?

274
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,833
Thank you for everything.
You're too kind to me.

275
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,416
Oh hush. I just hope
you're feeling better.

276
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,625
You'll be out of here
before you know it.

277
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:51,250
Meg, are we... Are the two of
us still going to be friends?

278
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,083
Yeah, you bet we will!

279
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,666
Once you get out
of the hospital,

280
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,250
I'll take you some place where
we can eat some real food, okay?

281
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,541
Great.

282
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,583
Jo?

283
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,541
I... I just had to lie to her.

284
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,000
Sei said they shut down
that school for good, right?

285
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,208
Why did it happen?

286
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,750
Why do you think Nadesico
turned into that monster?

287
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:33,708
Some bad people took advantage
of her. It's sad, really.

288
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,166
What's that supposed
to mean, "Bad people"?

289
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,500
The weak who are consumed

290
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,208
by the demons inside themselves.

291
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,583
What? What are you,
a fortune cookie or somethin'?

292
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,083
Jo, wait up for me! Wait up!

293
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,458
I don't know why I can't move

294
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,333
My mind is lost in this cloud

295
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:31,708
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

296
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:39,333
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

297
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:44,625
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

298
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,791
and smile with each other

299
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,083
It hurts inside
when we don't...

300
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,708
we don't... we don't
know what to say

301
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:00,458
I only hope that
someone will be there,

302
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:04,541
and be watching over me

303
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,541
so take my hand,

304
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:15,333
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

305
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,875
An evil bird preys on the young.
Jo and the gang are confronted

306
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,583
by minions of the night

307
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,583
as they try to stop
these terrible attacks.

308
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,916
Next Burst Angel: Black Sky.
