1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,958
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,458
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:51,166
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,500
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,000
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,666
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,958
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,541
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,125
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,500
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,541
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,750
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,375
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,375
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,916
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,875
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,333
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,875
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,291
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,750
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,666
Wakey-wakey Jango!

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,541
Jo's waiting for you!

25
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,125
Traffic routing online, check!

26
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,541
You just entered
a whole new world.

27
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,833
Welcome to Hell!

28
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,250
Jo!

29
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,250
Jango, stop!

30
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,083
Meg! You okay?

31
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,458
Jo, remember your
primary objective.

32
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
You must get that disc.

33
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,708
Screw you.
Saving Meg comes first.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,458
Move, kid. You're in the way!

35
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,750
Jo, are you alright?

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,666
Alright, Jo!

37
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,708
Let me out of here,
you stupid cybot!

38
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,458
Oh, no you don't!

39
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,125
Amy. Eye-in-the-sky!

40
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,041
Where the hell did he go?

41
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,750
I can't find him. I'm hitting
a level 5 magnetic field.

42
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,958
Sei, do you read me?
This is Meg.

43
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,333
Anyone?

44
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,291
Come on, fess up!

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,958
What group are you spying for?
And where did they take Meg?

46
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,750
I swear I'm not a spy!
I'm just a student.

47
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,458
Don't play dumb with me.

48
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:11,291
No gunfire inside here.
You promised me.

49
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,250
I don't remember that.

50
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,375
It seems to me the boy
is telling the truth.

51
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,458
The way I see it,
he's an innocent victim

52
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,000
that was caught up in
our work, not some spook.

53
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,916
Who the hell are
you people anyway?

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,916
A secret RAPT squad?
Female Yakuza commandos?

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,541
You are, aren't you?

56
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,625
So, Jo...

57
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,958
Whatever the case,

58
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,083
we need to identify the
cybot that stole the disc.

59
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,250
And track down the owner.

60
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,708
It's an extra request
from Bai-Lan.

61
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,791
Hey, guys! We just got
a transmission from Meg.

62
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,291
She couldn't talk so she emailed
us some images of her location.

63
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,958
Have you had any luck
finding out where that is?

64
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,875
No, nothing solid.
So that leads me to believe

65
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,500
she's in an area with
no transmission relays.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,625
These pics should be
in chronological order.

67
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,541
Looks like they took
the downtown loop,

68
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,583
then down
Roppongi Boulevard.

69
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,375
Hell of a drive.
Where was that cybot heading?

70
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,000
This is the last one
that came out clear.

71
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,958
What is that thing?

72
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,666
Get ready.
You're coming with me.

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,500
But wait. I'm the
helpless victim here.

74
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,916
Besides, it's late
and I need to go home.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
I-I have a big
assignment tomorrow.

76
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,000
Listen up.
Meg was taken hostage

77
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,708
because she tried to
save your sorry ass.

78
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,958
A real man would
return the favor.

79
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,625
I'm a real man.

80
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,250
I can't believe I'm doing this.

81
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,666
Why aren't we taking a car?

82
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,958
Where we're going you
can't get to by car.

83
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:08,833
Mmm...

84
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,083
What?

85
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,625
I'm impressed you got
a permit to carry a gun.

86
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,541
I heard there is a really
tough background check

87
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,750
before you can get one.

88
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,125
So what's in the bag?
It sure is heavy.

89
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,250
Say one more word
and I'll kill you.

90
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,916
In case you didn't notice,
I'm in a bad mood.

91
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,583
No way! Is this--

92
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,166
Shibuya? The Anarchy District?

93
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,875
Let's go.

94
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,166
Hold on!

95
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,666
This place is a No-Man's-Land.

96
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,666
The government abandoned
the entire district

97
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,041
after the big quake.

98
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,541
If we get into some
kind of trouble,

99
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,625
the police won't be
able to help us.

100
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,458
We could be killed
if we go in there.

101
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,958
Any more whining
out of your mouth

102
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,458
and I string you up
next to that mannequin.

103
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,708
We're very close to Meg.

104
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,500
I don't know about this.

105
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:38,375
Everyone looks so rough
and they all have guns.

106
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,833
He looked at me.
Oh no, I made eye contact.

107
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,625
Look. Fresh meat.

108
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,875
I see you got some luggage
with you. What's inside the bag?

109
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,541
Why don't you leave that
for us and head home.

110
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,583
Then we won't have
to carve you up.

111
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,666
Your face is alright,
but you ain't got no titties!

112
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,541
You've gotta have at
least this much up top

113
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,000
or ya ain't gonna
get no customers.

114
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,458
Funny girl here looks
like she wants to fight.

115
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,375
You're gonna take
me to your boss.

116
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,958
It's been a long time, Jo.
I swear I was gonna come visit,

117
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,666
but you know how it is.

118
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,166
I wanted to thank you for
taking out that psycho for me.

119
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,833
Sure makes this place
a lot easier to control.

120
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,625
Psycho?
Take a look in the mirror.

121
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,916
Forget the reward money.
I'm here for information.

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,125
Oh, yeah? Nothing
goes on around here

123
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,083
without me knowing
about it, honey.

124
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,916
So, what would you like to know?

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,458
I'm looking for
a giant cybot

126
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,583
that's using your turf
as a hiding place.

127
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,208
Not like the RAPT ones.
Probably military.

128
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,166
That sounds like a
dangerous piece of machinery.

129
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,750
And I don't wanna brag,

130
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,750
but our mics can pick up even
the fanciest new-tech cybots.

131
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,333
'Specially them military ones.

132
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,166
Their engines got a
very unique sound.

133
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,750
Right boys?

134
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,166
It's unwritten code here

135
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,166
to never stick our
heads in too deep.

136
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,125
So with that said,
we don't know nothing

137
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,958
about the cybot
you're looking for.

138
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,708
We ain't heard nothing either.
Sorry we can't help.

139
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,083
If you're lying to me,

140
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,208
I'll come back here and
personally cut your throat.

141
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,916
That girl's got
some serious balls.

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,583
She's fearless. Who is she?

143
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,041
Yeah, she a relative
of yours, or something?

144
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,375
She's whatcha call
an angel of death.

145
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
I could still take her.
She's all bone.

146
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:03,000
She got the wings of the
Devil himself on her back.

147
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,750
Anyone who sees 'em... gets a
one-way ticket straight to Hell.

148
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,833
You wait here.

149
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,583
What?! All by myself?

150
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,333
If you run, I'll have
Amy track you down.

151
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,666
You can hide in Peru,
or the Himalayas for all I care.

152
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,916
Either way, I'll find
you and kill you.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,583
Okay.

154
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,750
How dare you tie up a young girl
like this against her will?

155
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,958
I swear, if I get one bruise,
you're gonna pay.

156
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,041
That's the disc
we were sent for.

157
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,500
Ooh, pretty colors!

158
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,833
My phone!

159
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,583
Okay, I finally got the data.

160
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,166
And it was a pain to track down,
so I hope you appreciate it.

161
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,291
Good work, Amy.
So what is this place?

162
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,791
An underground highway
that was being constructed

163
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,875
with plans to connect
to the Downtown Loop.

164
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,500
But then the big quake hit
and construction was halted.

165
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,791
Later the project was
abandoned all together.

166
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,041
We also got some
intel on the enemy.

167
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,458
The cybot you're dealing
with was secretly developed

168
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,833
by RAPT for deployment
sometime later this year.

169
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,541
RAPT, huh?

170
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,208
It's still in design stages.

171
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,541
Seems a third party
got ahold of the plans

172
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,583
and built one ahead of
schedule with stolen parts.

173
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,000
This related to the
groups trading the disc?

174
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,791
Negative. We have
reason to believe

175
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,083
the cybot was attempting to
retrieve a spare part it needed.

176
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,750
We're checking the contents
of the disc right now.

177
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,291
Or you can save us the headache:

178
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,708
find the guy and
ask him yourself.

179
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,333
Your jokes aren't funny.

180
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,208
You don't mean that.

181
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,708
It's no use.

182
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,250
Don't tell me that green blob
was the cybot's brain!

183
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,333
Almost there.

184
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,708
Wha-- No, wait! Stop moving!

185
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,500
I found Meg!

186
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,458
It was only for a split second,
but I picked up her GPS signal.

187
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,791
Where?

188
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,958
Um... A side tunnel about
500 meters ahead of you.

189
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,666
Your ad promised
you could connect

190
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,041
from anywhere you stupid phone!

191
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,458
This does not look good.

192
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,458
Jo!

193
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,875
Take cover, Meg!

194
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,500
Wouldn't it make more sense

195
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,666
to fight a cybot
with another cybot?

196
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,833
Amy! You heard the lady!

197
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,000
Jango's on his way!

198
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,250
What's taking them so long?

199
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,958
I wonder why she wanted
to bring canned food along.

200
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,583
Maybe she was hoping to take
a lunch break or something.

201
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,708
What's that?

202
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,500
Run, you idiot!

203
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,416
What about the food?

204
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,750
Here it is, boys. Hell on Earth.

205
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,166
We have an explosion
in the Shibuya District.

206
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,041
Alpha platoon
deploy immediately.

207
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,916
Heavy resistance expected.

208
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,208
That's not your everyday
run-of-the-mill cybot.

209
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,583
It has a brain in it.
I saw it glowing earlier.

210
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,083
Really?

211
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,875
But it's got the
mentality of a T-rex.

212
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,500
Great! You made it angry.

213
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,291
This sucks!

214
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't stop! Keep going!

215
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,208
Jango!

216
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,416
Here's where the fun starts!

217
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,250
Jango's loaded with
super armor-piercing ammo,

218
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,625
so blast away!

219
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,833
I found out what's on the disc.

220
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,958
It's a dump of the
newest combat protocols

221
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,666
used in the conflict
in West Africa last year.

222
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,041
They want to max out
this cybot's abilities,

223
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,875
so they busted up the deal
and stole the disc.

224
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,333
So don't expect this thing

225
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,250
to act like it did
at the warehouse.

226
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,125
This cybot has a whole
new operating system.

227
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,666
Yeah, it's a whole
different beast all right.

228
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,833
Jo, when you're done...

229
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,333
Recover as many of its
parts as possible.

230
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,250
Another request from Bai-Lan.

231
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh, that'll be real easy.

232
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,375
I got your spare
parts right here.

233
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,583
Oh yeah! You rock, Jo!

234
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,666
Great, looks like
the fuzz finally arrived.

235
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,833
Don't move!

236
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,083
This is the RAPT Mobile Unit.

237
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,833
Stand down and
follow our instructions.

238
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,375
We're saved! Now I can
go home! Over here!

239
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,500
No, wait!

240
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,916
Stay right there! Now lie
down on the ground slowly.

241
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,916
What the--?

242
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,791
We're in Hell.

243
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,958
Told ya.

244
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,458
This is Mobile Unit
number 7 reporting in.

245
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,416
We're currently investigating
the source of the explosion

246
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,541
in Shibuya District, H Block.

247
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,666
Blast radius approximately
70 meters of total destruction.

248
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,625
We have confirmed
existence of an armed group

249
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,291
we believe is connected
to the incident,

250
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,708
but are unable to identify.

251
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,875
Retrieval of the cybot
is a negative;

252
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,708
looks like it self-destructed.

253
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,833
Unfortunately, one male and
one female, both unidentified

254
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,333
but believed to be
with the armed group,

255
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,208
were able to escape
in the commotion.

256
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,125
That's it?

257
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,291
Best I could do.

258
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,375
So we spend time,
money, and ammunition;

259
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,208
we don't get the
enemy's identity

260
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,125
and this pile of junk
is all you brought back?

261
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,250
Grandfather is so not going
to be happy about this.

262
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,916
It wasn't a total wash,
I can identify the parts

263
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,333
once I run a trace on this!

264
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,416
Ooh! What've we here?

265
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,250
"I'm sorry I caused you
guys so much trouble.

266
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,125
To make up for it, I made
you dinner before I left.

267
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,458
Enjoy and goodbye."

268
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:13,000
Crazy. Maybe he's not
such a bad guy after all.

269
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,625
Meg, try this! Oh, yummy-yummy!

270
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,708
She's right. Did he really
make this all by himself?

271
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,375
I guess the kid
does have talent.

272
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,458
I want to eat like
this everyday!

273
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,250
I'm sure we can
convince him to come back.

274
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,208
I don't know why I can't move

275
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,083
My mind is lost in this cloud

276
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:30,458
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

277
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:38,125
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

278
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:43,416
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

279
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,583
and smile with each other

280
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,875
It hurts inside
when we don't...

281
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,500
we don't... we don't
know what to say

282
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,250
I only hope that
someone will be there,

283
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,416
and be watching over me

284
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,333
so take my hand,

285
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:14,125
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

286
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:34,750
What happened to this man?
Who set him up?

287
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,916
Through a concrete jungle
born of dark intrigue,

288
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,916
Jo's anger will reach
its boiling point.

289
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,833
Next Burst Angel: "The City
Where The Beast Howls."
