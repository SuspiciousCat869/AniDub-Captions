1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,000
This is the place where
they're having the party?

24
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,500
It's totally luxurious!

25
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,041
Funny. I'd call it
totally tacky.

26
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,500
What...? Just Look at it!
It's super mega-cool!

27
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,250
I dunno, Amy. I don't
think I'm up for this...

28
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,583
These clothes, the limo,
I'm a little uneasy as it is.

29
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,791
but this is just too much.

30
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,500
So, what? You're not going in?

31
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you mean?
Of course, I'm going in.

32
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,000
There's a five course Chinese
feast waiting in there for me.

33
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,750
I wouldn't miss
that for the world.

34
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,750
Let's make tracks to that food.

35
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,333
I swear, food is the only
thing you get any joy from.

36
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,875
It's food...

37
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,000
Nobody knows what's going to
happen from moment to moment.

38
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,833
You got to eat whenever you can.

39
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,166
Don't worry about it, Meg.

40
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,166
I'm sure you'll
live a long life.

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,625
You think so?

42
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,541
Yes. So you should try to
actually enjoy it a little.

43
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,291
I'll have you know
I'm using this body

44
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,666
to the fullest to
enjoy life every day!

45
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,416
You're only using two parts:
your mouth and your stomach.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,166
You brat! When we get home--

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,458
Young ladies,
if you wouldn't mind

48
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,416
entering the ballroom this way.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,583
See? He called me a lady.
Shows what you know!

50
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,791
Idiot.

51
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,208
So that's Don Laoban's
granddaughter, Sei?

52
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,500
What a beautiful young
woman she's become.

53
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,916
She just glows.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,791
And that dress is perfect
for such a momentous day.

55
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,291
Wow... Sei's like a
celebrity in this place.

56
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,833
Hey, Meg, are you watching this?

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,958
Yep, she really is just
a mouth and a stomach.

58
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,416
You look more and more
like your mother every year.

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,208
If only she was still alive,

60
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,916
you wouldn't have to bear
so much on your own.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,250
I don't really think
about Mother anymore...

62
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,625
Being raised by you

63
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,625
has made me into a truly
happy person, grandfather.

64
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,333
I am both proud and honored
to have a granddaughter

65
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,541
such as you: beautiful,
intelligent, and full of life.

66
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,375
If only all of our
young countrymen

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,000
could be half the
person you are.

68
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,833
Many have changed
in recent years,

69
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,000
I believe, because of this
country's poisonous influence.

70
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,000
You heard about the
bombing last week?

71
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,250
Yes... Of course.

72
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,250
The work of a radical
faction. Deplorable.

73
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,375
We value discipline, and
honor our pledge to the clan.

74
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,291
Our organization is a family.

75
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,541
For the family's prosperity,
each member has devoted

76
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,250
what strengths and
abilities they possess.

77
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,833
And the mark of the person
who puts the organization

78
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,083
above all else, who holds
the family together...

79
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,291
Is this, the Bai-Lan
Seal of the Dragon.

80
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,583
It is something I intend to pass
on to you someday, my child.

81
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,458
But Grandfather!

82
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,916
I would imagine you
know about the Kokuren.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,625
Of course, our sister
organization from Japan.

84
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,041
But it's been years since
they severed their ties.

85
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,833
Yes. However, in order to
stamp out the radicals,

86
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,291
I have decided the time has come
to reunite the two families.

87
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,625
White Lotus and Black Lotus
will once again be one.

88
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,791
The best way to
ensure such a union

89
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,625
is through the bonds
of wedlock...

90
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,541
And I have nominated you as our
representative in this regard.

91
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,125
I have also invited
the man nominated

92
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,625
by the Kokuren aboard
this ship today.

93
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,625
So that's what
this party is for.

94
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,291
Of course, today is
just a formality.

95
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,125
I don't know
anymore than he does

96
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,000
if he will accept you
as a lifelong partner...

97
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,750
I just hope that you can try to
understand this old man's wishes

98
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:53,666
for his only granddaughter, whom
he loves more than life itself.

99
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,041
I understand. And as your
nominee from this family,

100
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,166
I will do my best
to represent us.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,333
Thank you...

102
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,333
I'm very happy to
hear you say that.

103
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,333
Sir, the other party
has just arrived.

104
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,208
Yes. Thank you.

105
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
Grandfather, I can't.

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,291
As favor to me, wear the Seal
upon your chest today,

107
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,541
and represent Bai-Lan proudly...

108
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,291
And we shall forever
keep it our little secret.

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,750
I am grateful for your
invitation, Don Laoban.

110
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,458
It is I who am grateful...

111
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,916
I would like to introduce you
to my only granddaughter, Sei.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,875
It is my pleasure.

113
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,666
No, The pleasure is all mine.
My name is Jay.

114
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,916
And I must tell you,
you are just as beautiful

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,166
as all of the rumors I've heard.

116
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,666
Wow... Sei's actually blushing.

117
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,166
Oh, man! We'll probably
never see that again!

118
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
Whoa! Check that out!

119
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,375
There's a ton of totally
hot boys guys over there!

120
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,083
Now, that's what
I call eye candy!

121
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,791
Yeah... Don't get your hopes up.

122
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,041
I bet those losers follow
their pretty-boy boss

123
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,333
around like mindless sheep.

124
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,166
Poor child, when will you learn?

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,416
With men, good looks
are all that matter!

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,625
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,541
Everyone knows brains
are more important.

128
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,833
No, it's looks that count!

129
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
You believe that?

130
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,125
Talk to them for five minutes,
tell me how it goes.

131
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,666
Come everyone...!

132
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,666
Let us all raise a toast to
Bai-Lan's beautiful young bride!

133
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,541
Look out!

134
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,375
Are you all right?

135
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,833
Oh, no. You ruined
your nice suit for me.

136
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,583
No way.

137
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,791
I wonder... What's that
party they went to for?

138
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,208
I bet the food
there is five-star.

139
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,500
What I wouldn't give to
learn from those chefs.

140
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,750
Then I'd spin your
heads with my cooking.

141
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,500
You hungry?

142
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,458
Oh, gosh, uh...

143
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,625
Don't be shy.

144
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,833
Sorry, I uh...
I had a late lunch!

145
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,250
That obnoxious little
walking computer...

146
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,875
She's been in the
bathroom forever.

147
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,666
Ohhh... That sofa looks
comfy enough to sleep on.

148
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,750
Isn't there anyone here...?

149
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,500
Ah, they're silk flowers.

150
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,958
All that food made
me so sleepy...

151
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,041
Oh man, but that move
Jay pulled was so cool!

152
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
I wish I could do
something like that!

153
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,791
I could be all like...

154
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,833
"Jo! Bad guys,
twelve o'clock...!

155
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,416
Got your back! Hiyaa!"...
That would so rule!

156
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,208
Who's there?!

157
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,083
Oh, no...!

158
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,333
That's the most expensive
vase on this ship!

159
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,541
What should I do?

160
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,625
Nothing to be done,
I suppose. After all...

161
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,541
"That which has shape is
ultimately destined to crumble."

162
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,916
How much do you think its worth?

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,458
Let's see... Ming Dynasty.
I'd say about a million.

164
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,416
Dollars?!

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,583
No!

166
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,666
Uh...

167
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,500
You wanna explain what
you're doing there?

168
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,333
The price of my silence.

169
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,875
Huh?

170
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,041
If I keep quiet, they won't
know who to pin the blame on.

171
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,458
Amy!

172
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,375
So, Meg. I see you
got a new boyfriend.

173
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,416
No, wait! It's not
what it looks like!

174
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't just stand there.
Come on in.

175
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,666
It's great that you've found
someone you can connect with.

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,083
Ow!

177
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,875
And I got plenty more
where that came from,

178
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,500
if you don't watch
your mouth, kiddo.

179
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,166
Young girls are just
so cute when they argue.

180
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,416
Yeah, understood.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,416
Now, I'm just waiting
for the signal, right?

182
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,083
Yes. Our preparations
are finished.

183
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,000
Who's that?

184
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,333
Dunno.

185
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,583
Something smells fishy.

186
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,916
Who's there?

187
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,833
What are you doing
here, little girl?

188
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,250
I... I can't find
the bathroom anywhere.

189
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,166
The bathroom?

190
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
Yeah, I can't hold it anymore.

191
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,458
Bathroom's that way,
if you gotta go so bad.

192
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,166
I don't understand.
What's 'that way' mean?

193
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,416
It means, it's at the stern.

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,666
Can you... Carry me there?

195
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,041
You can't be serious.

196
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,208
Ah... I'm gonna burst!

197
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
All right! Fine! I'll carry you!

198
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,666
Climb on... Hurry up, let's go.

199
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,916
Thanks, mister.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,541
Whatever...

201
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,458
That girl's a
natural born devil.

202
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,708
But I swear that
bodyguard looks familiar.

203
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,000
Like one of Don Laoban's men...

204
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,250
Whatever he was saying
about 'preparations'

205
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
and a 'signal'
doesn't sound good.

206
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,166
Ooh, they're so hot!

207
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,541
Well, Sei...

208
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,625
I would very much
agree to my father

209
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,958
and your grandfather's plan,

210
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,125
as long as you are not
opposed to the thought.

211
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,541
If you do believe in this,

212
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,541
then we, the younger generation,
will be the new leaders.

213
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:12,250
I plan to crack the shell
of the old and begin anew.

214
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,583
You're quite the assertive one.

215
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,125
Got everything
figured out, don't you?

216
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,500
In my opinion, a great
organization can only

217
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
come into its own through
years of hard work...

218
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,958
That is the discipline my
grandfather always taught me.

219
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,000
"In the absence of
harmony with tradition,

220
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,875
the organization cannot grow."
I've heard that one a lot.

221
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,541
I can tell.

222
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,083
Looks like the conversation
is getting lively. Good, good.

223
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,583
Don Laoban...

224
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,583
Sei is not only beautiful,
but a very sagacious young lady.

225
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,833
Oh, thank you...

226
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,541
You are correct, but she
is still inexperienced.

227
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,791
I hope you will give
her your guidance.

228
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,333
As long as we are here together,

229
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,166
I'd like to ask a favor of
you, if you don't mind.

230
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,375
And that is...?

231
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,708
As a symbol of the era
when The White Lotus

232
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,458
and The Black Lotus
were one and the same...

233
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,625
The Dragon Seal of Bai-Lan
pairs together with this,

234
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,500
the Seal of Kokuren...

235
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,666
I would like them to be
displayed here together.

236
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,666
If I may have permission.

237
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,416
The Seals are passed down
through the generations

238
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,208
by the leaders
of both clans.

239
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,333
I am hoping that you
will allow me to

240
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,875
experience the depth
of that responsibility.

241
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,166
You fail to understand.

242
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,625
The Dragon Seal is a
mark of high lineage

243
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,041
bestowed upon us by the Emperor.

244
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,958
All members of
Bai-Lan have sworn

245
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,625
undying loyalty to
whomever possesses it.

246
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,166
And it is for that reason,

247
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,583
its use in public is
strictly forbidden.

248
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,458
Please accept my apologies.

249
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,416
That is unfortunate.

250
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,833
Perhaps we can begin
the next performance.

251
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,250
What are you doing?

252
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,000
Grandfather!

253
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,041
What is the meaning
of this, Jay?

254
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,125
I said it was a performance.

255
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,333
A performance...?
What the hell are you planning?

256
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,750
I guess you could say I'm
staging a coup, "Grandfather."

257
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,250
What?

258
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,416
See? I told you those hot guys
weren't worth the trouble.

259
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,041
Yeah... Reality can really
bite sometimes... Right.

260
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,583
Meg, wait!

261
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,166
"Trust in your superiors."

262
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,375
"Follow the
organization's customs."

263
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,250
I've heard every one
of your ancient sayings.

264
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,083
You're living in
the wrong century.

265
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,958
I can make the organization
greater than it has ever been...

266
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,791
Now, where's the Dragon Seal?!

267
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,791
Leave my grandfather alone!

268
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,375
I don't think that
hard-headed girl

269
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,333
quite understands
this situation.

270
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,000
Or maybe you want
to die together

271
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,875
for the sake of a measly
rock. In which case...

272
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,875
I'll be happy to help you out.

273
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,833
How dare you pull this
in front of family!

274
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,541
Grandfather...

275
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,791
Are you trying to toy with me?

276
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,708
Hand over the pendant, Sei.

277
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,458
Hang on, Sei, I'm coming!

278
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,041
Who are you, girly?

279
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,208
Y'know? I surrender.

280
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,041
Sei, you must protect the Seal!

281
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,875
Do not let her off this ship!

282
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,416
Get after her! Topside, now!

283
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,291
Let me go... That hurts!
Okay, I'm kidding--

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,750
Post guards outside the door.
Have the rest come with me.

285
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,125
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,416
Hang on, Stephanie!
I'm here to save you.

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,666
Noooo! You moron! Look!
They're right behind you!

288
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,833
Ah, I told you!

289
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,958
Meg, please, you gotta wake up.

290
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,875
Aw, such senseless
violence... Now...

291
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,375
What are you doing to her?

292
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,958
Observing... her chi.

293
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,791
But isn't that, like,
unscientific voodoo?

294
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,500
Do not judge! They say,
"Illness begins with energy."

295
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,000
She has quite an appetite...

296
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,500
It's so strong that her chi
flow is out of balance.

297
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,833
You hit that nail on the head!

298
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,708
I can make her better than
she was. Stronger. Faster.

299
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,750
Huh?

300
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,541
Get back!

301
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,500
Come on, not you again.

302
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,625
You, hold it right there!

303
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,916
That's unreal.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,541
She is far more powerful
than even I predicted.

305
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,916
You gotta tell me
what you did to her...

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,375
Did you use a modifying
chip or something?

307
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,791
Oh, no...

308
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,416
What I did was simply open
her "battle chi" pathway,

309
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,833
and direct all of her
tremendous hunger into it.

310
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,708
That's amazing!
Who are you anyway?

311
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,500
Who, indeed...

312
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,750
I was in the movies once.
Long, long ago.

313
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,208
[TEXT] This feature film is
a story based on true events.

314
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,333
What? It's over? That stinks.

315
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,083
Hello, Jo?

316
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,041
Yeah, it's me,
what do you need Amy?

317
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,750
It's terrible!
You've got to get here now!

318
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,250
What's terrible?

319
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,875
Some airhead pretty-boy betrayed
Sei, and then he hit Meg,

320
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,375
and then some freaky old dude
turned Meg into a wild tiger

321
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,875
and she tore through a
whole line of hot guys!

322
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,583
Amy, pretend I don't know
what you're talking about...

323
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,541
and try to explain it again.

324
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,916
Look... Sei's in a pinch.
She needs you.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,916
We're on a ship...
It's in the harbor.

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,250
The one with the big
dragon's head on top.

327
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,416
What was that?

328
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,458
Something about a
pretty-boy and a tiger?

329
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,125
That scooter I saw outside
belongs to you, right?

330
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,125
Uh-huh. Why?

331
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,958
Gotta little favor t'ask.

332
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,791
Go easy! It's not paid off yet!

333
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,458
Have you gotten it out
of your system yet, Sei?

334
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,708
Or do you want the
suffering to really begin?

335
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,750
That's right. That's my girl.

336
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,500
Smart move.

337
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,416
Quit trying to worm
your way out of this!

338
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,750
So, this is the Dragon Seal.

339
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,166
From now on the
organization is mine alone!

340
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,166
Uh, Meg? You're the
only one left now, Jay!

341
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,416
Even if you could escape,
we'd just hunt you down.

342
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,208
So... What is it you
plan to do with me?

343
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,416
It's not up to me.

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,375
I'll have to wait for
the elders to vote.

345
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,125
If you are still deemed an
asset by the Organization,

346
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,458
you will be allowed to live.

347
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,750
There you go with the
organization again.

348
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,791
You know, you still
don't get it.

349
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:34,125
I believe A person should choose
his or her life as their own...

350
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,958
And living in the
shackles of tradition

351
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,625
and obligation is not the
life I choose for myself.

352
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,041
I have no intention of
letting this end here.

353
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,541
And I'll be taking the Seal!

354
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,666
Whoa, what just
blew up down there?!

355
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,458
Oh, it's Jo!

356
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,375
Hey, Jo!

357
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,875
Aw, crap!

358
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,916
Jo, that guy up
there's the bad guy!

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,125
He's the one who hit Meg!

360
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,750
I've done it!
I have beaten destiny!

361
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,416
Nice move, Jo!

362
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
Meg was totally off the walls!

363
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,291
Even Jo was shocked
at what she did!

364
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,041
Next party, you're taking
me so I can see up close.

365
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,416
Just one problem...

366
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,208
I don't seem to
remember a thing.

367
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,583
And, Kyohei...

368
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,375
Sei said she'd reimburse
you in full for the scooter.

369
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,000
Isn't that nice?

370
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,875
It is... But Sei's not
coming today, right?

371
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,500
Didn't she have other plans.

372
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,750
We value discipline, and
honor our pledge to the clan.

373
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,541
Our organization is a family.

374
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,958
And living in the shackles
of tradition and obligation

375
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,291
is not the life I
choose for myself.

376
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,708
I won't run...

377
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,500
I would never run
from my own destiny.

378
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,208
I don't know why I can't move

379
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:23,083
My mind is lost in this cloud

380
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:30,458
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

381
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:38,083
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

382
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:43,375
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

383
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:47,541
and smile with each other

384
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,833
It hurts inside
when we don't...

385
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,458
we don't... we don't
know what to say

386
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:59,208
I only hope that
someone will be there,

387
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:03,291
and be watching over me

388
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,291
so take my hand,

389
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:14,083
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

390
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:36,666
Amy is lured into an electronic
labyrinth teeming with desires.

391
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,791
What awaits her on this
mysterious and untamed frontier?

392
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:45,416
Next Burst Angel:
Uncharted Cyberspace.
