1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,041
There once was a time
when dark ambition

24
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,416
reigned supreme over justice.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,375
Money and power determined
one's life or death

26
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,875
in a town of outlaws,
where powerful beasts

27
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,916
preyed upon the
flesh of the weak.

28
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,000
Nobody ever realized

29
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,708
they were possessed by
something unimaginable.

30
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,833
And time simply wore on.

31
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,208
Eventually, a new
leader came forth

32
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,291
and tried to bring
order back to the town.

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,458
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth

34
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,125
became the new law of the land.

35
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,291
And when the hunting
dogs with fangs of steel

36
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,083
were unleashed, the poor town
was swallowed by even greater

37
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,500
chaos and destruction.

38
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,750
What do you mean,
you already quit?

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,083
It was a bit more work
stress than I can handle.

40
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,791
I've got it!

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,916
Got what?

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,208
You were actually
hired by the mafia,

43
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,458
and they made you do all
their dirty work, didn't they?

44
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,625
After that, you saved
some damsel in distress

45
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,458
from an assassin, and
she hugged you tightly,

46
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,666
pledging an undying
love only unto you!

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,791
You big stud, you.

48
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,250
What am I saying?
That couldn't happen! 'Cause no!

49
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,291
You'd rather quit than actually
commit yourself to something.

50
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,083
Looking for another job, are we?

51
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,208
Oh, uh... Yeah, I, uh...

52
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,791
You should listen to
your friend for once

53
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,541
and try finishing
what you start.

54
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,208
You could excel at this
if you applied yourself.

55
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,416
Just remember the old adage:

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,958
"Even a rock can be comfortable

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,333
if you have to sleep
on it for three years."

58
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,083
Come on! Who wants to
try sleeping on a rock?

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,541
Well, actually, I already quit.

60
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,958
Hello? Well, I don't know,
who is this? Yeah.

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,583
You want me to look
out the window?

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,583
If I sleep on this rock for
three years, I'll wake up dead!

63
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,416
Wow, these are great. Kyo baked
these cookies today at school.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,125
They're almost too good!

65
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:02,375
If you guys aren't back
soon, they might be gone.

66
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,458
You're kidding. They taste okay?

67
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,458
Yeah, they rock!

68
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,375
Well, leave me
at least one, okay?

69
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,125
Maybe, if you're lucky.

70
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,750
You know, you'll get fat
if you eat enough of those.

71
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,708
Then I guess you must've
already eaten a whole batch.

72
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,041
Ha. Ha. Very funny.

73
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,666
Let's get this over with.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,625
We're going in.
Keep your eyes peeled.

75
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,208
You remember what the target
looks like, right?

76
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,375
Oh, you know,
I forgot that again.

77
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,375
Funny.

78
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,791
C'mon, I remember.
Have some faith.

79
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,541
She still can't
take a joke, huh?

80
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,791
Nah, but that's Sei.
And, you know,

81
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,375
I'm glad she's worried about
our health and stuff,

82
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,916
but I'd rather she
spent that energy

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,833
finding us a nice
apartment or something.

84
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,083
Jo, this mission calls for
capture and restraint only.

85
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,458
No killing.

86
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,083
No guarantees.
Target might force my hand.

87
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,750
Do what you must,
but we really need him alive.

88
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,041
We're going in
the back door now.

89
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:08,916
No! No! Quit messing
with my freakin' head!

90
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,583
You slimy-- What do you
think you're doing?

91
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,791
Ah! Get to work you filthy rats!

92
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,750
The stench!
This town is a disaster!

93
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:29,958
The moon!
The moon will fall soon! Ah!

94
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:37,375
Oh! I just stepped on something
and it was all squishy.

95
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,541
That was just a--

96
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,541
Don't tell me!
I don't wanna know!

97
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I stepped on something else.

98
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,583
But that was a--

99
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,125
I told you not to tell me!
Why aren't you grossed out?

100
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,125
'Cause I'm not.

101
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,000
But how?

102
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,958
Well, I am wearing boots.

103
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,083
Guess we can't all
be as cool as you.

104
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,583
This is boring.

105
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:07,750
I know you're there. I can smell
you. Before you try killing me,

106
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,125
you should know I have friends.

107
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,708
--Friends like monsters!
--Looks like we've found

108
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,541
the king rat and his nest.

109
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,208
Move in. You have to catch
him before he rabbits.

110
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm so sick of everything!
I swear I'll kill you someday!

111
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,416
It's all over now!

112
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,833
Every last one of you suckers
can burn, baby, burn!

113
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:28,333
I'm not going to run or hide.
Come on! Show yourself!

114
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,833
Uh... This is totally dangerous.
That freak is off his rocker!

115
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,000
We won't need these.
You stay put.

116
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,666
There you are.

117
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,458
Who could that be?

118
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,041
This isn't looking good.

119
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,833
You've done it now.

120
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:01,208
Welcome. Your timing is perfect.
I was just looking for you.

121
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,250
Who's that?

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,083
Beats me.

123
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,166
I n-need more stuff!

124
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,958
You still don't get it.

125
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,041
Now, sleep.

126
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,500
He killed our target.
Now what do we do?

127
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,333
You sure he's really dead?

128
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,375
Uh...

129
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,125
Well, yeah!
Of course he's not dead.

130
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,625
I know that! I was just,
um, testing you!

131
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:47,666
RAPT is waiting outside. Looks
like this is their operation.

132
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,833
Sei, do you copy? Any idea
why RAPT is after Wong too?

133
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,958
No ideas. But for the time
being, you guys should--

134
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,625
Follow them. I know, I gotcha.

135
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll send you as much
info as I can gather.

136
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,250
Please clear the road. Emergency
vehicle moving through.

137
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,500
Please clear the road.

138
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
I got us a cab.

139
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,166
Let's go.

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,750
Strange times we live in

141
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,333
that young girls like
you would need me

142
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,291
to follow an ambulance at
this hour. Something going on?

143
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,875
Yeah. Um... One of our
friends got a little sick

144
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,291
and is on that ambulance,

145
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,916
so we decided we should
follow it to the hospital.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,750
I see. You know, I've got a
daughter who's around your age.

147
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,583
I really don't get what
goes on in her head these days.

148
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,625
Yeah. Kids, huh?

149
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,416
Where are they headed?

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,833
Can't tell yet.

151
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,750
But it doesn't look like
they're headed to the hospital.

152
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,708
You're saying RAPT is
involved in a kidnapping.

153
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,458
We can't rule that out, yet.

154
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,291
I don't wanna lecture
you like I'm your father,

155
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,625
but this town's dangerous.

156
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,000
What would happen if
you got into trouble?

157
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,416
You shouldn't make
your parents worry.

158
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,583
Well, we're always
extra careful.

159
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,125
We usually try to stay away from

160
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,875
any of the really
dangerous places.

161
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,041
That's good. So, is your old man
at home waiting up for ya?

162
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,541
Huh?

163
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,250
Only ask 'cause I'm always
stuck workin' nights.

164
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,833
Time I get home, my own girl's
already snuck out to party.

165
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,708
Ah, I think a father's
place should be at home.

166
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:37,750
Um, we... We don't have a
father. But, uh... We, uh...

167
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,875
We do have a mouthy older
sister. That kinda counts.

168
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,416
Sorry to hear about that.
Family's important.

169
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,125
It's wonderful that you
have a good sister, though.

170
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,583
It sure is.

171
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,958
Still tracking that ambulance?
Where are they now?

172
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,250
Shinagawa District. Industrial
section. Could mean trouble.

173
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,083
Sorry, Meg.

174
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,750
It's spooky. Like a ghost
might pop out at any minute.

175
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,250
Don't you think?

176
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
Have you ever
seen a ghost before?

177
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,416
Uh... Not in person.

178
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,416
Thought so.

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,916
Oh, come on!

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
You mean you actually
believe in ghosts.

181
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,541
No, of course not!

182
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,458
We're in front of some sorta
factory where they took Wong.

183
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,208
Looks like some kind of
industrial chemical lab.

184
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,666
According to the
data I've got here,

185
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,916
it's been closed for two years.

186
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,083
You think you can get inside?

187
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,625
Yeah. Shouldn't be a problem.

188
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,375
Um, ladies, dinner is ready.

189
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,791
Thanks, we appreciate it.

190
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:14,166
Uh... I was wondering if this
could be my... my last night.

191
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,750
These girls are all
depending on you.

192
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,708
But...

193
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,208
They're very happy that you
are such an excellent cook.

194
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,416
Really?

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,458
We'll see you again tomorrow.

196
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,375
Okay. When you're ready to eat,

197
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,041
just throw the fried
rice and potstickers

198
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,250
in the microwave for a minute.

199
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,250
Piece of cake.

200
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,875
Now do those guys
look shady or what?

201
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,833
So the creepy things
here aren't ghosts.

202
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,333
They're a bunch of crazed
killers. I can sense it.

203
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,625
You've got one
messed up imagination

204
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,666
in that head of yours.

205
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,166
I'm getting strong EM readings
ahead of your position.

206
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,625
And I've lost the ambulance.

207
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,958
You what?

208
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,625
There's gotta be something
going on underground.

209
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,583
Found the ambulance.
Now we gotta find Wong.

210
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,666
What the-- What is he
doing inside that thing?

211
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,250
Jo, this is no time for jokes.

212
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,708
Who are you?!

213
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,458
Why did you do it?

214
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,291
What? No, it wasn't us!
The guys in the white suits,

215
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,291
they're the ones you want.
They did this.

216
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,625
Stop lying! I saw both of you
follow him into the alley.

217
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,875
You were planning on killing him
to begin with, weren't you?

218
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,500
That's not how it
happened. I promise.

219
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,208
They got to him before we did.
You gotta believe me!

220
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,416
You had nothing to do with this?

221
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,875
Of course not. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

222
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,958
Then how do you explain
that hole in his chest, missy?

223
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,083
You shot him point
blank, didn't you?

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,833
Your boy's not dead yet.

225
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,208
Cut the crap and talk,

226
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,583
or I blow the bitch's head
clean off her shoulders.

227
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,500
Spill it!
Why'd you kill this man?

228
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,500
Who put you up to it?

229
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:39,208
I know you have a name for me.
Now, out with it or I shoot.

230
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,458
Let her go.

231
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,333
Jo, listen. I... I don't think
he cares what really happened.

232
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,625
Do what he says.

233
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,916
I get the feeling
explaining won't help much.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,958
He doesn't seem all
that bright to me.

235
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,916
Yep, that's right!
You caught us!

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,291
We're the ones who shot
the crazy guy! Hooray for us!

237
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,166
We never laid a hand on him.

238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,666
Jo, he's going to do it.
He's going to kill me.

239
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,416
He's welcome to try,
if he dares.

240
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,041
Jo, no!

241
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,125
Fine.

242
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,041
No, no, no!
I'm too young to die!

243
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,333
Now who are you?
You with those guys in white?

244
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,458
Or maybe you're from RAPT.

245
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,041
They're over here!

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,666
Capture the intruders!

247
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,208
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

248
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,708
You nasty little--

249
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,166
Meg!

250
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,750
Idiots.

251
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,541
So they put Wong
into a capsule

252
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,916
and turned him into
some kind of specimen.

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,583
This is so out of our hands now.

254
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,875
Are you kidding?!
Is this thing following us!?

255
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,458
This doesn't look good.

256
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,458
They brought out
a cybot now, too.

257
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,333
Should we send
Jango in after them?

258
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,875
Until we find out why RAPT
wants Wong's body so badly,

259
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,041
we can't make any moves.
If we draw more attention,

260
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,750
their guard goes up and we lose
our chance to figure this out.

261
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,583
Grownups never accomplish
anything. Wanna know why?

262
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,958
'Cause they spend too much
time overthinking everything.

263
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,041
I just thought of something.

264
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,541
What if there's
a special quality

265
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,791
about Wong's body itself?

266
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,000
The crazy guy's gone!

267
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,333
Looks like this place was
just a rendezvous point.

268
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,000
Meg, you go undergound.

269
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,958
Oh, why do I have to?

270
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,166
I got a hunch.

271
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,875
What about you, Jo?

272
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,500
I'll meet up with you later.

273
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,583
Good luck.

274
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,333
Now, we fight.

275
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,583
Oh, come on.

276
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,541
Stairs it is!

277
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,375
Get out.

278
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,083
I got it!

279
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,833
Hinode Pharmacy
built that factory

280
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,625
and purposely left
it unattended.

281
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,291
Once public interest died down,

282
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,125
they contracted RAPT
to secure the place

283
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,583
so they could expand
their research facilities.

284
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,500
Hinode Pharmacy, aren't they--

285
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,583
Yup. They have that cybot
in their TV commercials.

286
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,583
"Your pain is our pain.
Let's help each other heal.

287
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,250
Hinode Pharmacy, yeah!

288
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,791
We'll always be here.
Hinode Pharmacy

289
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,208
--will always be here."
--Let me get this straight.

290
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,791
If Wong's kidnapping was
Hinode Pharmacy's doing,

291
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,916
then they must've been in league
with RAPT from the beginning.

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,041
Hold up. I also have
information saying that factory

293
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,916
used to be a warehouse
for medical storage.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,333
I'm finding data on
their shipping routes

295
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,666
from the city center
to the outskirts.

296
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,958
Seems they've been
shipping drugs all over Japan

297
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,833
from this location.

298
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,000
Did you say all over Japan?

299
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,708
A secret train?
Well, that figures.

300
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,458
I'm on my way, Meg!

301
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,041
All right. If there
was ever a chance

302
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
to take center
stage, this is it.

303
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,916
Nobody move!

304
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,250
What's that?

305
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,291
Hurry!

306
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,833
You okay down there?

307
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,458
What are you doing
driving that thing?

308
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,333
Meg!

309
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,166
Jo! Hurry!

310
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,791
So, we meet again.

311
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,333
No.

312
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,333
This isn't happening!

313
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:19,083
I don't know why I can't move

314
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,958
My mind is lost in this cloud

315
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:30,333
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

316
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:37,958
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

317
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:43,250
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

318
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:47,541
and smile with each other

319
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,708
It hurts inside
when we don't...

320
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,333
we don't... we don't
know what to say

321
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:59,083
I only hope that
someone will be there,

322
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:03,250
and be watching over me

323
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,166
so take my hand,

324
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:13,958
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

325
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,750
As the train runs wild,
fueled by enemies,

326
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,625
towards an unknown future,

327
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,916
Jo hurries to the
train's next stop,

328
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,250
which lies buried
in the darkness.

329
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,875
Next Burst Angel:
"The Brothers Die At Dawn"
