1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,083
Well, shoot...
Guess this is good-bye.

24
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,625
Yeah, next time you
should plan your trip

25
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,500
when things aren't
so crazy around here.

26
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,500
You're kiddin' me, right?
It just wouldn't be Tokyo

27
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,166
if there wasn't some
kind of craziness.

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,666
Watch out for RAPT, y'hear...?

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,708
After that dumb cop car thing...

30
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,458
I know they'll be
huntin' ya down.

31
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,833
Attention, please...!

32
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,291
All passengers: Train 726,

33
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,875
with service from New Tokyo
Station to Grand Osaka Station

34
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,041
will begin boarding
momentarily on Platform B.

35
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,458
Well, hey...
I guess that's me...!

36
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,916
Y'all stay in touch, all right?!

37
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,791
Send me an email...!
Or maybe a postcard!

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,750
Gone already?

39
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,541
So, what do I do with all this
food I bought for her trip?

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,125
And in order to ensure
the safety of our city

41
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,708
and prevent further incidents,

42
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,458
we must enact sweeping changes
within our security forces...

43
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,166
RAPT patrols will be
drastically expanded...

44
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,291
and a system to identify
convicted criminals must be--

45
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,166
The situation here is grim.
Thick smoke clouds the air...

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,125
Rescue teams are working
to locate survivors

47
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,208
but are in danger of succumbing
to secondary disasters.

48
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,083
What exactly are you
getting at here?

49
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,208
I think I've made myself
perfectly clear, young lady...

50
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,166
Your services are
no longer required.

51
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,625
I'm sorry, I must be confused

52
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,166
about the nature
of our mission...

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,500
We were instructed that
collecting intel on the

54
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,916
glowing brains and obtaining
one was our top priority.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,583
That was correct...

56
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,583
At the time, there was
a strong possibility

57
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,666
that another syndicate
would take advantage

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,666
of the glowing brains and
use them to oppose us.

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,083
Your mission was
based on that...

60
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,583
However, the situation
has changed.

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,083
I must say I'm impressed

62
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,083
with the way you ladies
have handled things.

63
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,958
You put up quite a fight, there.

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,416
Oh, no... You didn't!

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,875
Afraid so...

66
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,875
We have merged with the
competing syndicate.

67
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,416
Bai Lan's future is now
quite comfortably secured.

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,625
We are now known as ZERO...

69
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:34,958
The beginning and the end of the
world now rest within our hands.

70
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,500
Tell me. Was this
Laoban's decision?

71
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,958
This was my decision

72
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,041
as current Director of
Operations for Bai Lan...

73
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:46,166
It was necessary to ensure
the organization's survival.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Amy... She was the first.

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,166
Who're you?!

76
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
What the--?

77
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,208
Oh, very funny...

78
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,416
With her expertise,

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,333
I was able to assemble a list
of possible teammates...

80
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,916
What my plan needed was someone

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,791
who could make the
impossible possible...

82
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,708
If we had a job with a 99
percent chance of failure,

83
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,541
I needed someone who
could turn that job

84
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,875
into a success 100
percent of the time.

85
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:22,041
And, then finally...
I found her...

86
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,791
Let's see... Twenty thousand
yen for these guys...

87
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:29,750
But not quite thirty
grand over there...

88
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,750
Aw crap, it still
doesn't add up...

89
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,916
Did I miscount somewhere...?
Looks like we're one short.

90
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,625
Jo! You got 'em all!

91
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,666
Fifty thousand yen
in our pockets!

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,208
All right, so hey... What do
you want to spend it all on?

93
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,041
Show yourself!

94
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,416
That was some
impressive shooting...

95
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,083
Just one--I'm sorry, two--
teenaged girls taking on

96
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,041
and wiping out a hundred
members of the Cyberoid Mafia.

97
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,791
Who are you?

98
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,333
I'm here to buy
your unique skills...

99
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,250
I'm looking for...
an Angel of Death.

100
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,750
Huh... Well, that's us.

101
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,541
I have to cancel
all of your contracts,

102
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,875
so I'll pay you out for the rest
of the year, plus penalty fees.

103
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,750
In exchange, all ties with
the Bai Lan organization

104
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,000
will be severed,
effective immediately.

105
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,208
What?! I don't understand!

106
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,000
Lemme get this straight.
You're breaking up the team?

107
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,833
No, this is a joke!

108
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,041
Sorry... I need you all to
start gathering up your things

109
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,833
Amy, aren't you mad?
You heard Sei... It's over!

110
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,166
No big deal... The way I see it,

111
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,458
Sei's the one who put
the team together...

112
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:16,458
so if she says it's over
then, well, that's it.

113
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,041
But you know...? It sure
was fun while it lasted...

114
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,291
so I suppose I will
be sorry to see it end.

115
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,458
Amy... don't think that--

116
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,125
Sei... I'm confused.

117
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,375
Does this mean you just
don't need us anymore?

118
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,916
That's not it...

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,125
I know I've asked some
pretty impossible things

120
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,916
from you girls in the past...

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,291
But I can't now...
Things have changed.

122
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,791
I see.

123
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,750
I--I can't believe this!

124
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Hello, Kyohei... First off,
thanks for everything...

125
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,541
I'm sorry to spring
this on you so suddenly,

126
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,166
but as of today, your services
will no longer be required...

127
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,916
It's not much
consolation, I know,

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,458
but I've wired the
rest of your pay,

129
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,958
along with a little extra,
into your account...

130
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,750
I hope you will continue to
devote yourself to your studies.

131
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,875
You'll make a great
patissier some day...

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,250
In accordance with the Special
International Cooperation Act,

133
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,833
I have been asked to serve

134
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,541
as acting Governor-General
for Tokyo...

135
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,708
My name is Rick Glenford...

136
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,750
Since the tragedy
which claimed the lives

137
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,625
of the former Governor-General
and 58 others,

138
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,500
Tokyo has been gripped
by an unseen menace.

139
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,958
Given the situation...

140
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,750
appropriate steps must
be taken to ensure

141
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,000
our safety while
maintaining the peace.

142
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,791
Both governments...
American... and Japanese,

143
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,750
have deemed Tokyo to be
in a state of emergency...

144
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,125
As a result,

145
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,916
the Tokyo Restoration
Initiative has been created.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,041
As Chief Administrator
of the Initiative,

147
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,125
it will be my responsibility
to work hand-in-hand

148
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,250
with both government authorities
and the citizens of Tokyo

149
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,166
to restore the light of
hope to our great city.

150
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,666
The time for Tokyo's
rebirth has finally come...

151
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,750
And we'll do it together.

152
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,875
Hey! He seems pretty cool--

153
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,750
He kinda looks
like a movie star!

154
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,458
What the frig is this
guy yakking about?

155
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,458
Like he could do anything...

156
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,041
Tokyo's never gonna change, man.

157
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,958
C'mon, most of us're decent
law abiding citizens...

158
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,166
What the hell do
they want from us?

159
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,291
May their spirits
watch over us...

160
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,541
and help this city to
prosper once again...

161
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,833
"For your unwavering
sense of loyalty and duty.

162
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,958
Rest in peace."

163
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,666
Here goes nothing!

164
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,333
Another thrilling
day in the bag...!

165
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,375
What's it been, six days now?

166
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,833
No, seven--

167
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,416
It's been seven days.

168
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,333
Has it really?

169
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,083
Hey, Jo... You don't get bored
hanging out with me do you?

170
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,958
No... not really.

171
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,333
Aw! C'mon...!

172
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,041
We finally have some free time

173
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,916
and a whole fat stack
of cash, and...

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,708
Well, isn't there anything
you want to go and do?

175
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:06,833
Not at all. Whatever you
want to do is fine by me.

176
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:11,625
You're no help at all, Jo!
I don't know where to go.

177
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,916
Leee-ooo...! Hey...!
How's it hangin'?

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
Gimme a break, Meg...

179
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,708
I mean...
You and Jo got, what...?

180
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,916
A whole crap-ton
of cash from Sei--

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,750
Go live it up at a fancy hotel.

182
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,291
That's no good...

183
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,000
I can never really relax
in a hotel... y'know?

184
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,500
Well, regardless...

185
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,416
That doesn't mean you can
come over here and bother me...

186
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,000
I've got work to do and I can't
focus with you hagin' around.

187
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,458
Yeah, whatever...
Let's go do something fun...

188
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,041
It's not like you're busy.

189
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,791
Believe it or not...

190
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,541
We grown-ups have to work
to put food on the table.

191
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,958
This is Leo...
So what can I do ya for?

192
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,166
Leo...! Why haven't
you called me?

193
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,041
I been worried
sick about y'all...!

194
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,166
I heard about that
idiot Governor-General

195
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,250
gettin' blown up,
and now that bigger idiot,

196
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,166
Glenford, is taking over
all of Tokyo in his place...!

197
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,250
That's the worst pile
of crap I ever heard!

198
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,291
Hey, Takane!

199
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,458
Shut up!

200
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,166
Hey! Was that Meg's
voice I heard?

201
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,625
What's she doing there?

202
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,208
Not just me, girl!
Jo's here too!

203
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,833
All right, Leo...
What's going on?

204
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:30,916
Well...

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,750
Leo...! Hang up
the phone already...!

206
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,791
Come on! Let's go do
something wild and crazy!

207
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,000
Wait, what?

208
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,166
Damn it...! I'm working
here, you idiot...!

209
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,666
Leee-ooo! You promised...

210
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,708
Idiot?!

211
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,583
No, not you!
I was talking to Meg.

212
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,625
What? You were
talkin' about me...?!

213
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,666
You better watch your mouth!

214
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Shuuut uuuup!

215
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,500
It's weird. I thought
I hated that job.

216
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,708
But she was actually
great to work for.

217
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:08,125
Now it's over and--and, oddly
enough, I wish it wasn't.

218
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,458
Man, you seem
totally depressed...

219
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, whatever...
Here, check this out...

220
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:21,625
There's like this monster
attacking people on the subways!

221
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,041
A subway monster?

222
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,375
There's a total panic.

223
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,250
People are sayin' when
they look out the window,

224
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,000
they see some kind
of skeleton monster

225
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,916
running alongside
the train.

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,208
They won't admit it exists,

227
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,791
but RAPT is down
there looking for it...

228
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,333
They say it might
even be related

229
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,833
to the explosions downtown.

230
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,750
Oh, hey, gotta run.
See you tomorrow.

231
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,666
Oh, yeah...

232
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,166
We've got a life form up ahead!

233
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,666
Three o'clock! 70 meters
and closing...!

234
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,666
It's moving fast
and gaining speed!

235
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,916
Lock and load--let's be ready!

236
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,916
What is that?!

237
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,125
Fire at will!

238
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,875
Are you certain of this?

239
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,333
Absolutely.

240
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,750
I can only assume that the
shock which caused his death

241
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,583
led his Third Neuron
implants to activate.

242
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,458
What a truly dim-witted man...

243
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,333
He never even suspected we'd
been experimenting on him.

244
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,541
Now look at him...

245
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,291
He's so pathetic, he
almost deserves pity...

246
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,083
How sad that this is how it ends

247
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,958
for the man that
once ruled Tokyo.

248
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,291
He has managed to knock out the
network along his entire path.

249
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,583
If something is not done,
he may completely

250
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,291
disable Tokyo's municipal
control systems.

251
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,041
His inability to control
the people of this city

252
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,583
is what got him "dismissed"
in the first place...

253
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,000
It's no shock he
continues to fail us.

254
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,708
I want this disgusting blight
on our society eliminated,

255
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,458
and I want it done right...

256
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,416
In fact, I think
we'll bring our team of

257
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,875
monster-hunting specialists
in for one final job.

258
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:30,500
Guys, I'm bored... C'mon...
I wanna go do something!

259
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:39,750
Fine then...! I'm going out
to get food...! By myself!

260
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,250
Told them!

261
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,000
Love to help ya, but I thought
our contract was up.

262
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:04,916
It is... But now... I have a
job that only you can handle.

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,208
And you wanna use Jango?

264
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,625
Yes, the situation is--

265
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,416
Yeah, fine, I'm in. Whatever
gets me outta this dump.

266
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,916
I could use your
help as well, Leo.

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,375
If we're using Jango, I've got
all the time in the world.

268
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,625
Hello?

269
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Did they leave without me?

270
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,625
I could kill 'em.

271
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,791
J--Jo?

272
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,000
Oxygen level has been
reduced to 20%...

273
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:44,750
Target is currently heading
northeast at 9.3 miles per hour.

274
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,791
All systems online
and optimized...

275
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,875
Reducing oxygen levels
in all sealed areas.

276
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,458
Everything's going as planned...

277
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,333
The... creature you
need to deal with

278
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,541
will be here in a
matter of minutes...

279
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,416
You know, I'm letting
you run things now

280
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
because I was ordered to...

281
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,375
I sure hope you can
handle the pressure

282
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,041
and not run away when
things start to get crazy.

283
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,208
Get this straight...

284
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,125
I have orders from
Bai-Lan to assist you

285
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,041
in a job you couldn't
handle by yourselves...

286
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,541
However, that girl over
there waiting for the enemy

287
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,375
is no ordinary mercenary...

288
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,916
Make the mistake of
underestimating her...

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,791
And everything
here goes to Hell.

290
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,458
Sir! Emergency call from H.Q.!

291
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,208
I'm coming...

292
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,166
The package... will be here for
your mercenary as scheduled,

293
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,291
of that you can be sure...
After that it's up to you.

294
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,000
Jo.

295
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
Go ahead, Sei.

296
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,958
As I mentioned earlier,
our job is to act as backup

297
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,250
for RAPT in their mission.

298
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,958
I can't go into details,
but suffice to say

299
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,000
I was in no position to
refuse their request.

300
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,916
I understand...
But it doesn't matter...

301
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,625
I'm not doing
this for them--

302
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,916
I'm only doing this
because you asked me to...

303
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,125
And that's all.

304
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,625
Target approaching...!
Speed is increasing rapidly!

305
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,666
There it is!

306
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,166
Look at the size of it!

307
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,291
All right, freak!
Let's see what you've got!

308
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,041
Impressive, Jo.
You've done it again...

309
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,333
As you face stronger
and stronger opponents,

310
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,458
your combat skills
continue to improve...

311
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,791
So much so, it's frightening.

312
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,750
Excellent work...

313
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,041
But now, I'm afraid you're
going to have to come with us.

314
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,750
And bring your little
mercenary along with you.

315
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,375
Just hang on, Sei!

316
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,708
I don't know why I can't move

317
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,583
My mind is lost in this cloud

318
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:29,958
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

319
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:37,583
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

320
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:42,875
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

321
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,041
and smile with each other

322
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,333
It hurts inside
when we don't...

323
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,958
we don't... we don't
know what to say

324
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,708
I only hope that
someone will be there,

325
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,791
and be watching over me

326
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,791
so take my hand,

327
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:13,583
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

328
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:35,875
When did everything happen?
Who was behind it all?

329
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:40,291
An age-old battle erupts
into full-scale war.

330
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,750
Next Burst Angel,
"Genocide Angels."
