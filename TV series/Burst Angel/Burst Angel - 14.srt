1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,916
To the rhythm!

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:22,958
Check it!

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,916
OK, fellas!

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,416
Yeah yeah party people
let's go let's turn it up

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,125
Let's rush in let's send it
flying let's attack let's dash

6
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
The battlefields are sacred,
Bakuretsu Tenshi,

7
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
Crazy Burst Angel

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,625
They're a bother, they're
cheeky, come on, blast 'em good!

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,916
Everybody, loosey

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,458
Be in full bloom, bluesy

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,041
Vividly, crazy

12
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Fly up, angel

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,458
We are the risma so charisma

14
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,666
We soar, really prisma (bomber)

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
Hey! It's danceable OK
shake it right now let's go

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,291
Gutsiness let's go beat
let's ride the rhythm tension

17
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,833
It goes flying frustration

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,791
Alright let's go let's get it on
loosey beauty get your body

19
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:32,250
Everybody, loosey

20
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,791
Be in full bloom, bluesy

21
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,208
Vividly, crazy

22
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,666
Fly up, angel

23
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,041
Time to get going.
We need to find some food.

24
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,916
Would you stop
looking at her...?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,333
You know she's not an angel
because she doesn't have wings.

26
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:17,416
Besides, we don't even
know if she's dead or alive.

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,291
Let's go.

28
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,708
Come on, let's get
back to the bus.

29
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,083
What are you doing?

30
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,250
Shirley!

31
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,916
This is ridiculous!
Why do I have to save her?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,875
She'll just be
another mouth to feed!

33
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,291
You know we can barely
take care of ourselves.

34
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,166
And what if she's dead?
I'm not touching a dead body!

35
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,750
Don't you remember what
Sis always tells us...?

36
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,375
Do not help anyone, unless
it's your friend... Sheesh.

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
Don't! You're gonna fall!

38
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,500
Are, are you okay?

39
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,750
Now hold still. I'm gonna
start pulling us up.

40
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,875
Shirley!

41
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,041
This'd be a whole lot
easier if you quit moving!

42
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,791
I'm sorry.
This card has expired.

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,791
You may purchase a new
card at our main office,

44
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
or insert exact change.

45
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Oh great.

46
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,083
Stop you piece of junk! Damn!

47
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,458
Valued customer, we
appreciate your business,

48
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,875
but please refrain from
striking the machine.

49
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,708
Ah, cram it!

50
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,958
Get back here you little brat!

51
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,791
All right kid. Hand over
my bag... Right now.

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,416
Come on, nice and easy.

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,625
Catch!

54
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
Have a nice day, sir!

55
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,916
Damn it!

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,833
We're home.

57
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Welcome back, you two.
I see you got the loot.

58
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,291
And did you two behave
yourselves today?

59
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,166
Well, anyways we were
at that old cafe.

60
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,791
If you jack with
the machine a little,

61
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,041
it overflows the coffee cup,

62
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
giving us just enough
time to make the grab.

63
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,666
Really... That's a nice trick...

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,208
You screwed up last time
when you were with me.

65
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,750
That's because you
slipped and fell

66
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,916
on a pile of
dog crap, remember?

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,041
Oh, yeah...

68
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,583
It was right in
the middle of that

69
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,291
plaza full of tourists, too.
They even took pictures of you.

70
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,875
That old British couple
had to help you up.

71
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,875
And then you cried.

72
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,416
Yeah, you looked so lame.

73
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, whatever.
Still doesn't make it my fault.

74
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
No...? Coulda fooled me.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
It was a freak accident!

76
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,250
And you're the freak!

77
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,875
Too funny.

78
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,958
I've never seen a bag
locked up like this before.

79
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:48,958
There must be something valuable
inside. Like cash or jewels.

80
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,250
What is this?

81
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,708
I thought you said
there'd be jewels in here.

82
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,083
I never said that.

83
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,208
Whoa! Check it out!

84
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,416
Awesome... It's loaded too.

85
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,333
Maybe he... deals
guns for a living.

86
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,541
Yeah, I betcha that's it.
He did look kinda sketchy.

87
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,916
Huh.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,375
It looks real banged up...
Hey, Shirley. Here.

89
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,833
You know with this gun,
we could take on bigger jobs.

90
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,750
Make a lot more money.

91
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,666
I don't know about that.
Sounds pretty dangerous.

92
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,583
I'm not down for that.
Only bad guys do robberies.

93
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,000
Fine...

94
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,083
Then what if we all agreed
to only rob bad people...?

95
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,750
That would make us good
robbers, on the side of justice.

96
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,416
Is something underneath there?

97
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,666
Yeah... Shirley.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,833
It's nothing, Sis. There
must be... a draft in here.

99
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,666
Right...

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,041
You guys took in another
stray animal, didn't you...?

101
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,375
Why don't you ever listen to me?

102
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,583
Holy crap!

103
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,083
Okay... It's making
grunting noises...

104
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,916
Oh no...! It's a pig!
A gorilla! A rat!

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,166
I don't think rats grunt.

106
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,541
No means no.

107
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,791
Where did you find her?

108
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,625
Passed out in the river...

109
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,291
Floating underneath
the freeway bridge.

110
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,458
Listen... All of us were
abandoned by our parents,

111
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,333
so we have to help
each other out,

112
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,458
but this girl you picked
up isn't one of us.

113
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,541
She's an outsider.

114
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,208
We can barely take
care of ourselves.

115
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,500
What are we supposed
to do with her?

116
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,666
Shirley...

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,250
I told you, God and angels
don't exist in our world...

118
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,708
Although, sometimes
I really wish they did.

119
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,041
Hey you...!

120
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,958
You're the reason we're
having this discussion,

121
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,208
so you can at least
pretend to be interested!

122
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,500
Whoa! What's happening?

123
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,875
Who the...

124
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,208
What the hell is that?
Is it even human?

125
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,333
It's bad, whatever it is.

126
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,416
What should we do?

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,541
What do you mean we...?
You found her!

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,041
No! Shirley!

129
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,750
Shirley! Are-- Are you okay?

130
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Damn you!

131
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,166
Sis! Toss me the gun!

132
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,291
I'm gonna teach
this thing a lesson!

133
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,791
Right, uh... Gun, uh...
Where is it?!

134
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,875
I-It's there...! On the floor!

135
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,458
No way!

136
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:32,375
That... book is... is
Shirley's... Give it back.

137
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,208
Thank you, thank you, daddy.

138
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,458
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
We love you so much.

139
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,375
Sam... You still have
the day off, right?

140
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,416
'Fraid not... I just got a call.

141
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,958
Peter can't make it in,
so I have to cover for him.

142
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,958
Oh... Too bad.

143
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,458
Of all the days
to get called in.

144
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,083
Isn't there someone
else that can do it?

145
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,916
All right. Here's our stop.

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,916
Hurry up, Shirley.

147
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,000
Damn it.

148
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,083
What are we supposed to do now?

149
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,541
I wish I knew.

150
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,708
We don't even have a roof to
stay under because of her.

151
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,583
Why'd you bring
her along anyway?

152
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,541
Don't blame me.
It was Shirley's idea.

153
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,958
Guess we didn't
have a choice then.

154
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,083
So, just who the hell are you?

155
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,500
I don't remember.

156
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,458
Oh! How convenient.

157
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,333
Hey, so that was really
cool watching you fight.

158
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,416
You had some really
awesome moves.

159
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,125
What was that?
Karate or kung fu?

160
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,583
Was I in a fight?

161
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,375
Come on... That just happened
like two hours ago!

162
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,125
I know!

163
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,583
You must have lost your memory

164
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,500
when your spaceship
crashed in the river.

165
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,750
I didn't see the wreckage,

166
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,833
so you must have
ejected from the ship.

167
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
And that thing that
attacked our bus must be

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,166
a cyborg assassin
sent by the government

169
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,541
to eliminate alien threats!

170
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,791
That sound about right?

171
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,000
Charlie. That's the same plot

172
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,625
for that TV show
Galaxy Untouchable.

173
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,916
Does that mean I'm
a Galaxy Untouchable?

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,458
Um, no!

175
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,083
Last night, a neighbor reported
hearing some strange noises

176
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,541
followed by the sounds
of kids screaming.

177
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,041
Apparently the kids are normal,

178
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,541
but the sound she
heard beforehand

179
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,333
was unlike any
she'd heard before.

180
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,416
This area is a popular spot
for young squatters to hang out.

181
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,166
Some of them even work
for the mafia to get by.

182
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,166
Was that done by a kid too?

183
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,541
Beats me...

184
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,250
Maybe they used a crane
to pull the roof back.

185
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,750
Kids using a crane
on their own...

186
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,708
Hell, I don't know,
it was just an idea...

187
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,500
I mean, I've seen some
pretty crazy stuff

188
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,000
in my time on the job...

189
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,833
Kids pulling crimes that'd
put any adult crook to shame.

190
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,750
Okay, so once Charlie and I
get the cash from the register,

191
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,500
you make your move, got it?

192
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,166
Are you even listening?

193
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,375
You'll need to hold
them off, all right?

194
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,375
If you can't do this simple
task, we won't let you join us.

195
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,750
Hold them off?

196
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,083
What she's saying is
if we get into trouble,

197
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,791
you'll have to do your awesome
kung fu thing on them.

198
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,208
Just like you did to
that chick yesterday.

199
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,666
Got it.

200
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,916
Listen up! Open the register
and hand over the cash!

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,583
We know what you guys are up to.

202
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,333
Every one of these movies
you're selling is bootlegged!

203
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,291
And we also know
that your dirty money

204
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,750
can't be reported
stolen to the police.

205
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,375
Listen little girl,
you don't know jack!

206
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,250
Your turn... rookie...

207
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,458
Go teach these crooks a
lesson on how to behave.

208
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,333
What the heck are
you doing? Get them!

209
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,541
Stop!

210
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,125
What happened back there?

211
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,666
I don't know.

212
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,041
Let's just get the
hell out of here!

213
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,666
We're all dead if they catch us!

214
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,625
Well, what do you know?

215
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
D'you think you could
get away from us?!

216
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,458
Oh no!

217
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,541
I'm really sorry.

218
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,666
Kill her!

219
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,791
Why youse...

220
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,541
So you're telling us one boy
and four girls did this?

221
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,125
And you said one of them had
long silver hair, correct?

222
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,875
You gotta believe me here,
that ain't no kid!

223
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,416
Don't you get it...? We're the
ones being victimized here!

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,958
Okay, we get it.

225
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,750
Only advice we can give is next
time some kids attack you,

226
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,833
try baking them some cookies,
or maybe tell them a story.

227
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,291
Lava... Were you able to
get a fix on her location?

228
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,875
Not yet, but if I can
get within range,

229
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,541
we'll be able to
sense one another...

230
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,583
There's no need to worry.

231
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm not worried.

232
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,916
Now you can atone for your
failure of the final test.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,375
You do make the
perfect candidate.

234
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,083
The pain you're feeling is
from the cellular fusion.

235
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,083
It'll be over soon.

236
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,625
This time... you're
not getting away.

237
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,541
I can't believe this!

238
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,166
We didn't even take
a single dollar,

239
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,458
but now for some reason
we're wanted criminals!

240
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,041
That's it, this is goodbye.
Just get outta here.

241
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,958
Shirley.

242
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,875
Oh, leave with her
for all I care.

243
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,666
Be reasonable, Sis...

244
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,208
You saw how she
handled those guys...

245
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,458
This city isn't getting
any safer for us.

246
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,958
We could use the protection.

247
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,333
Yeah, come on...!

248
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,791
She did help us out when
we were in trouble today...

249
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,916
Give her time. I'm sure
she'll be more useful.

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,125
You got a name?

251
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,125
I forgot.

252
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,708
Whatever.

253
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,875
I'll start by teaching you
the simple stuff first.

254
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,708
Not right now.

255
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,041
Huh?

256
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,333
She's back.

257
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,833
This is Unit 55. Go ahead.

258
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,666
All available units.
Gunshots reported in Block C.

259
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,541
East side. Respond immediately.

260
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,916
That's Chinatown! Step on it!

261
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,416
I will not lose this time.

262
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,750
I will destroy you!

263
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,250
This is it! Stop the car!

264
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,458
What's going on up there, Sis?

265
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,500
I hope she can handle herself...

266
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,166
Maybe I could...

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,083
Charlie! Dorothy!

268
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,166
You guys get out of here.
Don't let Shirley get hurt!

269
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,208
What about you?
Aren't you coming?

270
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,916
I'm gonna give our new
friend some back-up.

271
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,916
All right... Now just calm
down and try this again...

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,125
What's going on up there?

273
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,166
Look out!

274
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,333
Charlie! Shirley!

275
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,833
Wait a minute,
you're that criminal!

276
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,875
Criminal...?
I'm a cop you idiot!

277
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,833
Now, what did you kids
do with my sidearm?

278
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Our "Big Sis" has it.

279
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,541
She's upstairs fighting the
monster with our friend.

280
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,291
What friend's that?

281
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,875
Galaxy Untouchable!

282
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm gonna bash in your skull

283
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,458
and tear out your
brains with my teeth!

284
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,041
You ugly freakshow...
Get off of my friend!

285
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,333
I guess Number Two
survived after all.

286
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,583
I wonder where Sis
and that girl went to.

287
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,666
All I know is, with
all that's happened,

288
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,583
these last two days are nothing
but a big blur in my head.

289
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,250
Yeah...

290
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,250
I think you're
right little girl.

291
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,500
Do you like that doll?

292
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,833
You guys hungry?

293
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,833
What do you say I treat you to
some hamburgers and milkshakes?

294
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,125
Why aren't you going with them?

295
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,875
Huh?

296
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,291
Oh, I don't know...
I just figure...

297
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,375
...they're better off
with him than with me.

298
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,458
They deserve better than
what I can give them.

299
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,541
Besides, I've found
myself a new partner.

300
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,958
A partner?

301
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,208
That's right. I took care
of you so you owe me one.

302
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,500
More importantly,

303
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,125
I think we work well
together, don't you agree?

304
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,166
Oh yeah... I guess
I never got around

305
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,458
to telling you my name...
It's Meg. How about you?

306
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, sorry, I forgot.
You lost your memory.

307
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,500
No, I remember.

308
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,750
It's Jo.

309
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,250
I don't know why I can't move

310
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,125
My mind is lost in this cloud

311
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:30,500
No one even hears my voice
and my tears fall to the ground

312
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:38,125
It's like my feelings of
loneliness are falling too

313
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:43,416
The truth is that we
all just want to smile

314
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,583
and smile with each other

315
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,875
It hurts inside
when we don't...

316
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,500
we don't... we don't
know what to say

317
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,250
I only hope that
someone will be there,

318
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,333
and be watching over me

319
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,333
so take my hand,

320
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:14,125
we'll walk tonight
underneath the sky

321
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,791
When our heroes are
invited to a new waterpark,

322
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,958
they're expectin'
a day of relaxation.

323
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,166
But naturally, danger
rears its ugly head.

324
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,750
Is it Mother Nature, or
something more sinister?

325
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,500
