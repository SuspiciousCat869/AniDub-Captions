1
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,333
Come on, hang in there, Shirley!

2
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,083
Shirley! Shirley!

3
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,833
So good to be back!

4
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:23,916
I thought the plan was we never
set foot in this city again.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,541
It was, but plans
can change, Jo.

6
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,333
Besides, this is
a special occasion.

7
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,916
Special how?

8
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,458
Today is the biggest day
of the year for Shirley.

9
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,750
It's her birthday.

10
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,500
Of course, none of us actually
know our real birthdays,

11
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,791
so we had to
improvise a little bit.

12
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,916
We always celebrated the
day when we first showed up.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,458
It just seemed to
make the most sense.

14
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,750
Only, we don't have
a dime to our names

15
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,708
so we can't get
the girl a present.

16
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,833
So, Meg.

17
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,166
Yeah, what?

18
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,208
When do you suppose my
birthday comes around?

19
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,166
Now, how the hell would I
know something like that?

20
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,916
Young ladies!
You two on the bench!

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,166
Would you help me?

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,625
My little baby is stuck
in the top of that tree.

23
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,500
Sure, lady. You got it!
We can discuss payment

24
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,208
for our services once
we get the cat down.

25
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,666
This should earn us enough cash
to get Shirley that present.

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,458
Well, snap into action already.

27
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,916
And I just have to get it down?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,833
That's it.

29
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,750
Whoa! What are you, nuts?

30
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,958
We're not trying to kill it!
Put the gun up!

31
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,250
That's not what I meant!

32
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:34,833
Ah, jeez. Why's everything
gotta be so literal with you?

33
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:40,291
Oh screw it! I'll climb up
and get the thing down myself.

34
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,583
Meg, wait.

35
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,250
Stand under the cat.

36
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,208
What do you have in mind?

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,416
I'm gettin' creative.

38
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:11,541
Why are you so ticked off? I got
the cat down without hurting it.

39
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,541
Gee, I dunno!

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,958
You couldn't have
come up with a less

41
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,583
explosive way to get a
stinkin' cat out of a tree?

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,083
It doesn't matter. At least
we got Shirley her present.

43
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,291
Hi.

44
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,166
I'm looking for a guy named Sam.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,416
Is that so? Well, my name's Sam.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,375
Yeah, not you, though. The one
I'm lookin' for's a big guy.

47
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,250
I mean like, really big.

48
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,791
And he's got this crazy-deep
"In a world" voice?

49
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,000
You mean him? Sam, you got
some visitors to see ya.

50
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,458
Hi, Sam. You remember us?

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,583
You two, come with me.

52
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,000
Please. Tell me you haven't
come back to New York

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,541
so you can round up
your old friends.

54
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,041
Not at all.

55
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,208
Then why are you here?

56
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,916
Special delivery.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,291
Jo and I bought a birthday
present to give to Shirley.

58
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,916
Is today her birthday?

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,208
Well, no. But when
we lived together

60
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,958
we all had our certain
days that we celebrated.

61
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,875
I didn't want
Shirley to get upset

62
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,333
and think that we had
forgotten about hers, so--

63
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:27,000
I see. It's nice you
went out of your way.

64
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,625
Sure. So how's everybody doing?

65
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,500
Uh, just fine. Listen,
if you don't mind,

66
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,125
we'll have to save this
small talk business for later.

67
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,458
Whatever you say, Mr. Happy.

68
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,916
Sam. Fill us in.
How's Shirley holding up?

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,583
It's terrible what happened.

70
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,625
Did something bad
happen to Shirley?

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,083
Sam, answer me.

72
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,291
Sam?

73
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,041
Sam!

74
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
We got an unsub who's been

75
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,250
randomly killing
people across the city.

76
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,500
Shirley's not gonna
die is she? She can't!

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,833
It's touch and go.
Though the doctors have

78
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,541
upgraded her condition
from critical to serious.

79
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,041
The other children have been
taken in as wards of the state.

80
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,125
Both Dorothy and Charlie
were sent to boarding schools.

81
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,375
Meg, this isn't anything
you need to worry about.

82
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,208
Like hell it isn't. No way.

83
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
Shirley's in a hospital bed.

84
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:22,166
She's torn to shreds and
no one knows if she'll live!

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,875
Meg. Listen.
We should avenge her.

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,416
I was just informed
there has been

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,958
another murder in the
West Land District.

88
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,208
That's correct.

89
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,291
And I assume no suspects
have yet been detained.

90
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,375
Also correct, sir,
but it's hard to stage

91
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,000
a full investigation
in that area.

92
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,333
And now, if there
are any more deaths,

93
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,625
the press'll have
a field day--

94
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,125
crucifying the police
and the politicians.

95
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,291
Public safety is my first
concern, I will not rest until

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,875
we rid this city of
the evil wretches

97
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,625
that plague our streets!

98
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,916
Tell me you don't
feel the same.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,250
Of course, I do, Mayor.

100
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,083
This city is a living organic
creature that sheds its old skin

101
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,500
to make way for the new.

102
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,750
As the old peels away,
it dies struggling to hang on.

103
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:24,083
And that, that is the sad fate
of the West Land district.

104
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,583
Whatcha got there?

105
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,041
A glass bottle.
It's been cut clean in two.

106
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,125
By the guy we've
been looking for?

107
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,833
If it is, then he's good.

108
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,791
Whoever he is, I'm gonna do
to him what he did to Shirley.

109
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,375
And then I'm gonna
start hurting him!

110
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,416
And Sam, I want to
tell you how sorry I am

111
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
about what happened to Shirley.

112
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,083
She's practically your
daughter, I get it,

113
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,000
but you need to back off.

114
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:17,000
See the thing is,
we don't want you too close.

115
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,666
Uh, listen, if you go out
there and act on your anger,

116
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,500
playing a crazy hunch,
it makes it hard for all of us.

117
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:30,291
We both want things to work out.
Let's just make sure they do.

118
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,708
Remind me again.
What do we do for a living?

119
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,875
We're cops. Ordinary cops.

120
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,208
Dry yourselves off.

121
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,750
Ain't no one walking out
on those streets tonight.

122
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,333
I bet even that killer
they talk 'bout on the news

123
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,000
is at home watching the tube.

124
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,583
Thank you.

125
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,208
That's gonna leave a mark!
Who the hell did that?

126
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
Wait a minute, it got dark!

127
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,625
Jo!

128
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,416
And I was just getting started.

129
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,291
Burn in hell, you
psychotic freakshow!

130
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,333
What happened? Are you alright?

131
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,125
You calmed down any?

132
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,333
That was a really
stupid thing you did.

133
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,541
Why take the risk?
You could have been killed.

134
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,250
Since you cops refuse to do it,
Jo and I took it upon ourselves

135
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:40,375
to catch the guy.
Lot of good that did.

136
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,958
He still got away.

137
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,208
At least I got a good
look at the pervert's face.

138
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,583
I need you to help me
draw up a composite

139
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,166
while it's still
fresh in my mind.

140
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,958
You got a pencil around here?

141
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,458
Meg, listen to me.

142
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,833
The two of you need to
leave the city--by tomorrow.

143
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,208
If you don't,
I'll arrest you myself.

144
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,625
Thanks, Sam.

145
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,375
So at what point did the police
turn into the bad guys?

146
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,958
You and Jo. If you stay here
and keep turning over stones,

147
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,416
something worse is
gonna happen to you.

148
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh, come on!

149
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,208
How can you call
yourself her father

150
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,500
when you sit around
and do nothing?!

151
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,291
Nothing?

152
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,208
That's what I said!

153
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,750
You're a stupid child.
You couldn't understand!

154
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,083
I don't do anything
because I'm her father!

155
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,125
I can't just fly by
the seats of my pants

156
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,666
twenty four-seven like you two!

157
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,458
You mean after all
of these murders,

158
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,125
you don't have any
desire to catch the killer?

159
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,500
That's just crazy!

160
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,833
The problem is, I know
who's behind it!

161
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,208
It's not as if I'd stood
silent this whole time.

162
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,416
I was active in my pursuit. 

163
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,708
Then I found out even the
Commissioner was being pressured

164
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,750
by his higher-ups because of the
influence this killer wields.

165
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,833
After that it just all
seemed so pointless to me.

166
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,208
I had to accept reality.
It was the only way

167
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,625
to keep living
peacefully with the kids.

168
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,000
I did all I could. Was it
wrong of me to even try?

169
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,625
I've been thinking. If we get
this guy, is it just gonna

170
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:33,250
make life even harder for
Shirley and the other kids?

171
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,833
Jo, what do you think?

172
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,666
I don't have any idea. But--

173
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
But what?

174
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,083
I do know this.
He is a coward.

175
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,916
He'll only prey on those
weaker than himself.

176
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,458
And you know me, I won't
put up with people like that.

177
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,750
Oh. Yeah, well, I'm with you!

178
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,125
I won't put up with
that crap either.

179
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,666
To hell with the cops.

180
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,041
We're not leavin' 'til
Shirley's been avenged!

181
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,375
Help or no help, we gotta
do what's right by her--

182
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,291
and make that bastard pay!

183
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,625
Guess we should prob'ly eat
something first. Tell ya what,

184
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,750
you wait here and I'll go
get us some bread. 'Kay?

185
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey.

186
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,666
Yo.

187
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,541
What the--?
What are you doing here?

188
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,500
What do you think you're doing?

189
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,875
Put him down now!

190
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,833
That bastard kidnapped Meg!
Now tell me where he is!

191
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,166
He did what? Oh, God.

192
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
I said...
Let go of him right now!

193
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,500
Ma'am, step away now!

194
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,708
This is your last warning.

195
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,875
Right, men. Move in.

196
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,666
Move outta my way! Get back!

197
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,791
Stop! Now!

198
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
Stay here. I'll be back.

199
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,166
Don't be stupid.
You don't go anywhere alone.

200
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,833
If you get yourself killed,

201
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,791
Shirley'd have no one
to watch over her.

202
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,125
You could've been
a little gentler!

203
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,541
Where are they?

204
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,250
How should I know?

205
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,375
I'd like to thank you two
brats for showing up together.

206
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,250
Saves us the trouble of
hunting you down separately!

207
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,791
Bye!

208
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,416
I take it this isn't
part of your rescue?

209
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,333
Are we safe yet?

210
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,083
Not a chance.

211
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,500
Move!

212
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,333
Ugh. Worst smell ever.

213
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,708
I'm gonna have to burn
these clothes and boil myself

214
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,041
just to get the stench offa me.

215
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,458
Jo, why'd you stop?

216
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,666
Smell getting to you, too?

217
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,083
Jo, wait! Why are we running?

218
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
Look behind you and find out!

219
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,708
Okay...

220
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,291
Don't stop or it'll catch us!

221
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,708
Uh, yeah, you think?

222
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,458
Whatever happens,
don't leave my side.

223
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,166
Meg, keep, moving!

224
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,750
He'll be up and
on us any second!

225
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,583
Hurry!

226
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,583
Where the hell are we?

227
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,083
Jo!

228
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,875
Jo!

229
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,791
Oh God, no.

230
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:51,791
Perfect. Now, her world is truly
a pit of terror and despair.

231
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,250
What's your next move,

232
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,541
now that your weak,
useless partner is no more?

233
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,583
Suicide. Now that
certainly is an option.

234
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:09,708
Assuming you can actually
muster up the courage to jump.

235
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,458
This is it.

236
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,583
I-- I'm gonna die.

237
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,541
Meg!

238
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,083
The fight's not over
'til we avenge Shirley!

239
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,541
We cannot give up!

240
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
Jo.

241
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,291
Now, Meg! Finish the bastard!

242
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:54,041
Yesterday's incident has
been spun as a VTOL accident.

243
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,416
We've also discreetly
recovered the mech.

244
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,625
The one you provided him.

245
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,625
Have you identified
the two who destroyed

246
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,125
the guerilla combat cybot?

247
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,083
The commissioner's job
hinges on finding that answer.

248
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,250
I just can't believe Fred
lost his life over nothing.

249
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,458
My deepest condolences for
you on the loss of your son.

250
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:18,250
Condolences? My son is
still, very much alive.

251
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,791
This city is my son.

252
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,458
Well. That's the ship
Sam booked us out on.

253
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,375
Man, I hate saying
goodbye to this country.

254
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,375
But then, I bet I'd be
fine no matter where I go,

255
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,583
long as I'm with you.

256
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,500
Think so?

257
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,291
Here.

258
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,000
With your new short haircut,
you're gonna catch a chill.

259
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,125
Go on, Shirley. Open it up.

260
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,958
I take it you like it?

261
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,833
I'm glad. But you should know,
it's not actually from me.

262
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:21,750
In fact, somebody out there was
very worried about you, Shirley.

263
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,500
She's a bit of an angel herself,

264
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,541
and she brought
that just for you.
