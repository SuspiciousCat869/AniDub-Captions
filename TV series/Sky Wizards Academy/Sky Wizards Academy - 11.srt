1
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,208
[FREON] As the Sky
Wizards Division lead,

2
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,333
I'd expected Fireteam E601

3
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,291
to be beaten within seconds
of starting their first match.

4
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,875
I may have underestimated
that band of misfits.

5
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,458
Or, more likely, their
success was a fluke.

6
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,666
Surely, there's no way they'll
win their second match.

7
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,666
[LECTY, MISORA]
We won match two!

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,125
[ANNOUNCER A]
In a shocking upset,

9
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,875
Fireteam E601 is
advancing in the tournament!

10
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,708
[FREON] They'll definitely
lose the next one.

11

[LECTY]
Yay!

14
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,208
[ANNOUNCER A]
E601 is on fire!

15
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,041
With this win over
a C-Ranked team,

16
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,708
they'll now advance
to the semi-finals.

17
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,083
[FREON]
That was an accident.

18
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,708
They've just had a
series of lucky breaks!

19
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,125
[ANNOUNCER A]
Uh! This is truly unexpected!

20
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:28,000
E601 has beaten B936 and is now
moving on to the final match!

00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:28,541
[FREON growling]

Uh?

00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,625
[MISORA] We did it!
I can't believe we won!

My victory was always assured.

You may say that,
but you're crying too!

[RICO]
Uh! That's just a coincidence!

27

[KANATA]
Now, then...

00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,708
[KANATA] Time for the
real battle to begin.

of the Monthly Mistgun!

32

What's this headline?

33
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,250
Huh?

34
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,125
[COELA] If the Effed-Up
fireteam doesn't win.

35
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,250
[BEACH] Then they're
gonna be disbanded!

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,250
[AMIE]
Seriously?!

37
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,333
[CHLOE]
It's a clever move.

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,791
Now that Freon's made
their agreement public,

39
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,208
Kanata can't fight

40
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,708
if his team loses
and is dismissed.

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,125
Yeah, that's true.
But it also means Freon

42
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,125
has to hold up her end of
the bargain if they win.

43
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,541
[LECTY]
I always wished I was stronger

44
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,083
so I could protect
the people of Mistgun.

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,625
To make them feel safe
and have happy lives.

46
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,250
[LECTY] Even though training
was sometimes weird,

47
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,291
I really do think I'm becoming
a better Sky Wizard.

48
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,500
Slowly but surely I'm starting
to believe in myself.

49
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,333
And it's all thanks to Kanata.

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,541
[RICO]
When I first met him,

51
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
I thought he was
nothing but a pervert.

52
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,583
Now I know he's more than that.

53
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,083
He's a pervert and an
extraordinary teacher.

54
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,833
[MISORA]
I was always so frustrated

55
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,041
and disappointed with myself

56
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,625
for not being a better
fighter or leader.

57
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,375
[MISORA]
But thanks to Kanata,

58
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,166
I've come so close to
achieving my dream.

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,583
To make my mom proud

60
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,458
and become a powerful Sky
Wizard just like she was.

61
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,166
Let's do this!

62
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,208

Hey, Misora!

00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,541
What are you doing
out here so late?

65
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,875
Well I was kinda starting to go
crazy being stuck in my room

66
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,708
and thinking
about the match.

67
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,333
[RICO] It's going to be
a big day for all of us.

68
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,208
Tomorrow the world
will see the full extent

of my divine powers and
they will bow in worship.

a goddess feel restless.

freaking out about tomorrow.

[LLOYD] So far I haven't
seen anyone suspicious.

sick to my stomach.

[CHLOE sighs]

159
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,541
I wanted to see the match
but I'm stuck out here.

160
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,791
[LLOYD] You know we
can hear you, Chloe.

161
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,041
[CHLOE laughs nervously]

162
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,000
Moving on.

163
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,000
Can you do me a favor and
check out the back gate?

164
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,625
Our contacts there haven't
checked in with me.

165
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,250
Sure thing! But Lloyd.

166
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,375
I don't think our attacker is
gonna show up at the tournament.

167
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,250
I mean, pretty much every
Sky Wizard in Mistgun

168
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,875
is in the audience.

169
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,416
Would you stop running away

170
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,916
like some scared
little kid and fight?!

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,125
[MISORA] I hate to admit
it, but she's amazing.

172
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,833
I don't think I could beat
her if we went head-to-head!

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,083
[MISORA grunts]

174
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,833
[LILY grunts]
Her flying is too erratic.

175
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,708
I can't predict her movements!

176
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,416
Your aim sucks! I thought
you said I was slow.

177
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,708
[LILY] Go ahead, keep making
jokes and trying to evade me.

178
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,250
You're fast now, but eventually
you're gonna tire yourself out.

179
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,541
You may think I'm
running scared,

180
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,583
but really you've
fallen into my trap.

181
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,208
[LILY]
Uh...? Uh!

182
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,666
[LILY gasping]

183
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,541
[MISORA]
Hmph. Now I've got you!

184
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,625
[LILY laughs]

185

[MISORA gasps]

186
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,666
Sorry, but our instructor
taught us well,

187
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,416
and warned us you'd try to
pull something like that.

188
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,958
[BOY STUDENT A]
What gives?

189
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,208
They're just flying around
and chasing each other.

190
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,166
[BOY STUDENT B]
Jeez, what a boring match.

191
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,666
[GIRL STUDENT A]
Let's see some fighting!

192
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,166
I don't get it. Why isn't
E601 kicking butt?

193
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,500
They seemed a lot
more coordinated

194
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,708
when they fought our team.

195
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,041
Come on! Show those
A-Rankers your power!

196
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,500
[YURI]
Look at them, Kanata.

197
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,125
We both know that my fireteam

198
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,958
is more powerful on
a fundamental level.

199
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,666
That said, even the weak
can overcome the strong.

200
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,708
But since we've fought together,
I know your tricks.

201
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,666
And I've trained my
team to expect them.

202
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,083
I knew you'd do this.

203
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,916
That you'd try to throw us
off guard and take the win.

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,166
It won't work.

205
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,750
When this is over, I'll
take the trophy home.

206
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,333
And I'll be happy to
finally be rid of you.

207
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,375
You almost have 'em!
Work together!

208
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,500
Finish off those losers!

209
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,583
[SASHA]
Ah!

210
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,375
[LECTY whimpers]

211
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,875
You heard her!

212
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,666
Let's wrap things up. 'Kay?

213
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,166
Victory's ours. Let's go!

214
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,958
In a few minutes,
this'll all be over.

215
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,208
I can't argue with that, Yuri.

216
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,208
But things might not go
as you've planned them.

217
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,041
Come on, Kanata,
this is getting sad.

218
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:54,333
I've seen through your schemes.
My team's got this locked down.

219
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,750
Oh yeah? I wouldn't be so sure.

220
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,000
[LECTY whimpers]

221
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,333
[YURI] You've instructed
your team to run around

222
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,791
and look scared so that
we'll underestimate them.

223
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,375
And when they think we least
expect it, they'll strike.

224
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,208
[MISORA grunts]

225
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,875
[MISORA]
This is it!

226
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,458
[LILY]
Uh... Uh.

227
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,833
Misora thinks she's
got Lily by surprise.

228
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,375
Too bad Lily sees
the attack coming.

229
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,791
My team is fully prepared
for this kind of tactic.

230
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,708
I won't let you fire!

231
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,625
[YURI] Lily can dodge
the Strike Blaster.

232
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,000
Then she'll close the distance
and defeat Misora easily.

233
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,375
That's some impressive
foresight.

234
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,583
However, you overlooked
one big detail.

235
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,708
[YURI]
Mm?

236
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,041
[LILY gasps]

237
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,625
That's... impossible!

238
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,916
She's not just aiming at Lily!

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,541
[LILY]
Greg! Sasha, watch out!

240
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,333
We're all in the
path of her blast!

241
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,125
Uh!

242
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,000
[MISORA yells]

243
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,250
[LILY gasps]

244
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,166
She didn't fire the
Strike Blaster!

245
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,625
It's a feint!

246
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,958
Seeing Misora's attacks
in the previous matches

247
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,625
caused Lily to overreact.

248
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,833
So now she's gonna
be off her game.

249
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,416
I can't believe you thought
you could trick me like that!

250
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,916
Lily, stay calm!

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Now she thinks Misora's going
to run around some more.

252
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,958
Just the way she did earlier.

253
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,833
But riled up like this,
Lily can be caught off guard.

254
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,333
What? No way.

255
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,541
You had this planned out from
the beginning, didn't you?

256
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,833
Oh. Didn't I mention that?

257
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,500
Everything that's
happened in this match

258
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,458
has gone exactly as
I wanted it to.

259
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
The dynamics on the
field have changed.

260
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,291
Unfortunately for you, failing
to realize that you've gone

261
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,875
from the hunter to the hunted
is the surest way to defeat.

262
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,250
Misora's become a
fearsome predator.

263
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,583
And Lily is a beast
blinded by anger,

264
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,833
which makes her
the perfect prey.

265
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,041
I'm taking you down!

266
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,916
Yeah? Just try it!

267
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,083
Heh! What, are you gonna try
and flee the stadium now?

268
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,791
Everyone can see you're
making a fool of yourself!

Uh!

271
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:36,041
[LILY] Not again. Is this
just another fake out, or...

272
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,875

Uh! Now you're mine!

[FREON growling]

279
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,791
Incredible.

280
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,083
They went head-to-head with
Yuri's A-Ranked fireteam...

281
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,458
...and won the
whole tournament!

282
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,041
What the heck happened?

283
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,208
If it weren't for the
Sorcerer Field's magic

284
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,250
we would all be dead right now.

285
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,041
There's no doubt about
it. They bested us.

Um. It looks like A227 has lost.

00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,416
[MISORA] He's got the same
kind of power signature

315
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,791
Kanata had during the raid.

316
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,750
Yuri. Yes!

317
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,791
After all this time,
I have come for you.

318
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,333
I didn't forget you, my love!

319
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,125
You're the only thing that's
been on my mind since we met!

320
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,458
[gasps]

321
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,875
All of this has been for you,
my dearest, every attack.

322
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,833
And now that I'm strong
enough to dominate you,

323
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,750
you have to accept me as
your lover, isn't that right?!

324
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,750
[YURI]
Huh.

325
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,416
Why do you look so sad?

326
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,208
Is it because of your fireteam
losing this silly tournament?

327
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,125
Don't worry, dear, I can help
you get over that pain!

328
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,458
Here, let me embrace you.

329
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,458
Just let me get my
hands on you, Yuri!

330
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,541
You're the hooded guy
I fought in the park.

331
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,250
That's right. Now move!

332
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,750
I won't let you come
between us again.

333
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,083
Yeah. Let's go!

334
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,916
[gasps]

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,166
[KANATA]
Run!

336
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,833
[REAL laughs]
Oh, no you don't!

337
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,541
Yuri! Come here!

338
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,208
Let me put my arms around you!

339
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,583
[KANATA grunting]

340
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,250
Get outta here now!

341
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,125
[YURI]
Uh! No way!

342
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,250
Don't argue!

343
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,208
[YURI growls]

344
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,416
If you want her you'll have
to go through me first!

345
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,875
[REAL]
Just you?

346
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,333
If that's all, then let's
get this over with now.

347
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,833
[REAL grunting]

348
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,958
[KANATA groaning]

349
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,958
[laughing]

350
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,166
You're not going anywhere!

351
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,833
[YURI panting, gasps]

352
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,166
Feel my love!

353
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,958
[REAL]
Weren't you listening earlier?

354
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:27,416
I've become stronger than
you. You must love me!

355
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,916
[YURI gasps]

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,458
[KANATA grunts]
Dammit.

357
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,208
What's with the
look of hesitation

358
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,750
in your eyes, my dear?

359
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,416
Aren't I the kind of man
you've always wanted?

360
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,708
We can finally be
together now!

361
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,416
The hell...?

362
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,750
[MISORA]
Crap, I actually hit him!

363
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,750
[LECTY whimpers]
That wasn't a warning shot.

364
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,250
A blast like that would've
killed a normal person!

365
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,666
I believe you've made
us his new targets.

366
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,875
[REAL growling]

367
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,291
[KANATA]
Wow, it's been a long time

368
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,666
since I've done one of these.

369
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,500
Uh... Anyway, next episode,
Misora, Lecty and Rico

370
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,000
are gonna put on a
big show for you.

371
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,875
They might even save Yuri and
the rest of Mistgun again.

372
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,083
[YURI]
They didn't save me!

373
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,500
I could've protected myself

374
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,416
without your idiot
students interfering.

375
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,416
[KANATA] I don't think you
should be calling them names.

376
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
[YURI]
Huh?

377
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,041
[KANATA]
After all, thanks to our bet,

378
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,583
you're one of my idiot students
now. Have some self-respect.

379
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,791
[YURI]
What? Oh, no!

380
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,958
[KANATA]
See you next time for

381
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,625
"Instructor of the
Sky Wizards Academy".
