Yeah, you just

[RICO] To Whom It May Concern: I
understand that normal students

35
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,958
of the Sky Wizards division
must follow certain rules

36
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,541
in order to maintain peace
and order around here.

[sighs]

39
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,208
[RICO] However, I'd like
to remind you that

40
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,875
I am no common student, but
rather a goddess in mortal form

41
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,541
gracing the floating
academic city of Mystogan

42
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,250
with my presence.

43
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,916
To demand that I submit a
written apology for

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,833
not doing homework is blasphemy,

45
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,916
no doubt fueled by envy
of my flawless beauty.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have absolutely nothing
to be sorry for.

47
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,333
Hang on.

48
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,333
She doesn't seriously think
she's some kind of goddess...

00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,791
...does she?

50
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,875
[FREON] How should I know
if the girl's crazy or not?

51
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,000
[CHLOE]
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,458
I just figured
you were related...

53
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,833
...'cause of the last name?

54
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,208
What's it matter?
Just keep reading.

55
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,666
[RICO] On a related note,
I'm currently classified

56
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,916
as an E-Class: the lowest rank
in the Sky Wizards division.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,166
In fact, due to the dismal
performance of my teammates,

58
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,458
people call us the
"Effed-Up Fireteam."

59
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,708
It's unfortunate that the
failures of the other girls

60
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,666
might cause people to question
my own superior talents.

61
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,125
As a goddess, I don't feel
I should be ranked

62
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:42,041
among plebeians.
Sincerely, Rico Flamel.

63
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,333
[CHLOE] Miss Flamel's
third attempt to make up

64
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,583
for her missing homework
is officially rejected

65
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,916
by the department.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,875
Some Feedback: Your directions
were to apologize

67
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,791
for ignoring your
class assignments.

68
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,750
Be advised that your second year
in the Preparatory Department

69
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,916
is a time that
requires intense focus,

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,791
not daydreams
of self-importance.

71
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,583
You are hereby assigned a
fourth revision of the apology.

72
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,666
Um, all right.

73
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,583
Why don't we just move on then?

74

Up next is Lecty Eisenach.

[LECTY]
I have one dream in my life:

76
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,500
I want to be a Sky Wizard
so I can protect the people

77
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,916
of the floating cities
from the Devil Beetles!

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,166
I shiver just thinking about
those horrible monsters.

79
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,916
Swarming the skies
and hunting us...

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,291
But I think protecting other
people might make me happy.

81
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,708
I want everybody to smile
and feel safe here.

82
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,250
It seems like she's got
a lot of spirit!

83
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,625
[FREON] Yeah, but unfortunately,
the enthusiastic kids

84
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,666
have a habit of
dying first in battle.

85
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,875
Bummer...

86
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,833
[LECTY]
Those without magical powers,

87
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,708
the ones we call the Naturals,

88
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,833
completely forget anyone
killed by the Devil Beetles.

89
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,041
But we Wizards remember them.

90
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,000
It's up to us to fight for those
who've lost not only loved ones,

91
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,875
but their memories as well.

92
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,875
No one should be
erased like that.

93
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,375
Let's see...

94
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,958
According to her file
she's always nervous.

95
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,875
Her exam scores were
less than stellar.

96
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,375
In fact, we almost
rejected her application.

97
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,541
But, in the end, we couldn't
overlook her positive attitude.

98
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,958
Of course, the fact that she's
from a well-known family helped.

99
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,083
We're hopeful she'll
have a bright future.

100
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean, she can only
get better from this point.

101
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,916
Right?

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,875
[FREON]
Let's hear about the last girl.

103
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,458
The fireteam's leader.

104
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,750
Her name's Misora Whitale.

105
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,083
She scored 57 losses on
her first practical exam,

106
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,250
ten on her follow up,
and 57 her second semester,

107
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,416
which has to be some kind
of record, if you ask me.

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,291
That totals 124 losses.

109
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,000
Summary: We're encouraging
her to drop out.

110
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,000
She... doesn't really seem
to be Sky Wizard material.

111
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,291
[FREON]
Wow...

112
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,041
That's quite a group
of girls we've assembled.

113
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,458
It's really no wonder they're
part of the weakest squad

114
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,250
in history. FireTeam E601.

115
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,916
It's high time something
was done about those three.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,833
And let me guess--"doing
something" will be up to me?

117
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,250
Miss Chloe Sevegny.

118
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,291
I'm giving you the task
of finding an instructor

119
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,833
strong enough to whip
these rejects into shape.

120
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,291
[CHLOE]
For a fireteam like this,

121
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,416
we might require some
unorthodox leadership.

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,583
Will that be a problem?

123
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,333
I can make sure
your candidate is approved

124

no matter who you choose.
Just don't make me regret it.

even though they're tiny.

160
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,666
You disgusting pig!

161
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,916
A girl can't even walk
down the street without--

162
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,833
[gasps]

163
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,291
Huh...?

164
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,875
You're gonna make me late and
you messed up my breakfast.

165
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,208
And of course it landed with the
strawberry jam side down, too.

166
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,375
I'm gonna make you pay
for ruining my morning!

167
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,000
Look, you owe me an apology.

168
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,958
If you'd kept your eyes open,
you wouldn't have fallen

169
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,375
on top of me and given me
this sticky crotch.

170
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,625
How dare you!

171
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,333
It's not my fault I was
exhausted this morning

172
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,791
and kept hitting snooze!

173
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,708
Which meant I had to try and
eat some strawberry toast

174
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,541
while running to school
so I wasn't late again.

175
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,708
I'm the victim here,
not you and your grabby hands!

176
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,750
I think you're blowing this
outta proportion.

[MISORA]
Someone help!

179
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,250
I've been molested
by a sticky perv!

180
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,958
Get him! He's right here.

Where'd he go?

That's just great...
This stuff won't come off.

[KANATA]
What the hell?

188
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,833
You must find this
goddess's beauty entrancing.

189
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,875
I would say that one of
us certainly seems

190
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
to be obsessed with it.

191
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,708
I knew it.

192
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,708
What do they call
someone like you...?

193
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,958
A "stalker," right?

194
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,500
Huh? You're weird,
you know that?

195
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,000
[RICO giggles]
It's not surprising that you

196
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,041
find yourself drawn
to me like this.

197
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,541
I'm a divine spirit
reincarnated.

198
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,208
Gorgeous, aren't I?

199
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,833
But a warning: I'm the
only person who's allowed

200
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,916
to fall in love
with this beauty.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
[KANATA] Maybe you should
spend less time admiring

202
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,791
your own reflection and
more time hitting the books.

203
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,250
Judging from your uniform,

204
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,208
you're a Preparatory
Student right?

205
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,291
Huh. I can't stand studying

206
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,333
and all of those
training exercises.

207
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,041
They're boring.
Sweating is for commoners.

You... You're a pervert!

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,875
I know my beauty
is irresistible,

211
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,083
but that doesn't mean
you get to take

212
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,541
your pants off in front of me.

213
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,125
Jeez. Chill out.

214
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,333
This has nothing
to do with you, lady.

215
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,291
How can you act so casual
when your junk is hanging out?!

216
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,750
So gross...

Somebody help!

00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,000
There's a half-naked boy
trying to seduce me!

Seriously! The goddess is--

00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
He vanished.

There's a pervert on the loose!

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,416
Whoa... Seriously?

00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,166
Ugh, what a terrible morning.

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,583
I'm avoiding girls
for the rest of the day.

Um... Sir?

Huh?

You can't be--!

[KANATA]
Note to self:

247
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,958
Never cut through the school's
preparatory department again.

Damn coward.

00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,833
Meanwhile, we're putting
our lives on the line.

253
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,333
[YURI] Fourth period
has already started.

254
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,166
[KANATA] I had a series
of unfortunate events

255
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,000
on the way here.

256
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,958
You're never on time
for anything.

257
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,250
I guess a traitor doesn't
have any integrity. Hmph.

258
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,458
C'mon, Yuri.

259
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,708
Are you still holding
a grudge against me?

260
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,250
No way. In fact, I don't
even think about you.

261
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,750
Now, why don't you run along
to class like a good boy,

262
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,291
and stop wasting my time.

263
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,166
[KANATA] So you are still
holding a grudge, then.

264
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,000
You jerk!

265
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,166
Calm down.

You know better than to
pick fights with Kanata.

267
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,958
Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

268
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,958
I wasn't picking a fight, I was
only being honest with him.

269
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,833
And I am not holding
a grudge, Chloe.

270
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,291
You know, this is the least
convincing performance

00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,833
You'll regret that.

273
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
And that's when it hit me--

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,125
[BOTH gasp]

275
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,416
Why are you always
pushing her buttons?

276
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,916
Next time I might not
be there to stop her.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,291
I wish she'd lash out
at me more often.

278
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,333
Huh? Have you lost your mind?

279
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,000
[KANATA] Yuri joined up
to be close to me,

280
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,583
but after everything
that's happened,

281
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,208
I know she's still hurting.

282
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,000
It's good for her
to vent sometimes.

283
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,708
She never was any good
at handling her emotions.

284
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,458
[sighs]

285
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,583
I see.

286
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,833
You're the one who's
putting on a show.

287
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,666
When you antagonize Yuri, you're
actually trying to look out

288
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,708
for her in your own weird way.

289
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,333
It's been six months
and she's still angry.

290
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,625
Give her more time.

291
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,750
Yuri was unconscious during the
whole thing,

292
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,416
so I don't think she
saw you get injured.

293
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,625
[KANATA] The only people who
get hurt on the battlefield

294
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,416
are those who don't have the
skill to make it out unscathed.

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
Isn't that what they teach us?

296
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,416
That may be...

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,083
But I still can't help feeling
like I'm responsible.

298
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,375
And so...

299
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,666
Yeah? What's up?

300
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,958

I'm going to make up for it

[KANATA] Whenever you get
that mischievous grin,

303
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,708
it usually means I'm about to
get in a whole lotta trouble.

If you don't take that back,

305
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,666
you'll never find out
about the sweet deal

306
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,166

in here, traitor.

00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,666
Ain't my fault. You think
I wanted to visit you?

Well, you've been summoned
here for a purpose,

00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,000
so let's get to it, shall we?

00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,500
Hold on, you really want
me to be an instructor?

318
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,375
You'll be leading the
misfits of Fireteam E601.

319
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,833
Transform them into a squad that
meets the high standards

320
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,333
of the Sky Wizards division.

321
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,875
We need skilled warriors.

322
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,916
You'll train the girls
to function as a unit.

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,875
And make them a force capable of
pushing back the Devil Beetles

324
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,083
on the battlefield. Otherwise,
they are of no use to us.

325
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,375
[KANATA]
But why me?

326
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,041
There must be
more qualified people

327
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,541
who could teach these girls.

328
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,916
Yeah, but verybody's already
booked up for the semester.

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,666
Besides, I want you to do this,

330
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,875
I think it'll be
rewarding for you.

331
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,791
Is this a prank?
Everybody hates me.

332
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,125
Yeah, but you work so hard.

333
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,250
Even when no one
else is watching.

334
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,166
Like doing inventory for the
Logistics division,

335
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,791
--and helping--
--[KANATA] Okay, okay.

336
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll read over the contract
if that's what you want.

337
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,500
What in the hell?

338
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,000
How's it possible to
get such horrible scores?

339
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,541
Hm? Hold on.

340
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,958
[MISORA] All right, how should
we train today, ladies?

341
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,208
[RICO] Hmph.
I'm ignoring that question.

342
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,375
I mean, a goddess like me
needs no training.

343
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,250
[MISORA]
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,291
You may think you're a goddess,

345
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,583
but I'm the fireteam
leader, not you!

346
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,125
Hah. You must be so proud.

347
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,125
You're just jealous that you
couldn't be our leader

348
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,625
because you're crazy!

349
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,208
Hey, you guys...?

350
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,583
Earlier...

351
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,166
--Is something wrong, Lecty?
--[LECTY] I, uh...

352
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,833
Well, I...

353
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,000
Tell us whatever's on your mind.
That's what we're here for.

354
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,958
Okay then! I will!

355
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,916
Something really weird
happened to me this morning.

356
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,083
Hey, look!

357
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,041
Whoa, isn't that Kanata Age?

358
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,958
[SHEILA] Ew, I don't want
his traitor germs on me.

359
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,416
[AMY]
Seriously!

360
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:18,875
Ladies.

361
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,791
[GROUP]
What do you want?!

362
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,958
So, Fireteam E601.
Where're they?

363
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,500
You're looking for E601?

364
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,125
The Effed-up Fireteam?

365
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,041
Those girls are the worst!

366
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,041
[LECTY] I bumped into a horrible
pervert this morning.

367
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,625
[gasps]
A pervert?!

368
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,416
That's really weird.
I met one today, too.

369
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
He was stalking me
without any pants on.

370
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,416
[MISORA gasps]
Me, too!

371
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,875
He knocked me down, fondled me,

372
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,666
then spread my strawberry
jam all over his boy parts.

373
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,958
It was sick... I hate that
filthy, disgusting perv monster!

374
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,458
[RICO] Hmph. Could you
repeat all of that?

375
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,541
Sorry, I can't
understand mortals

376
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,791
when they're overreacting.

377
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,208
--[MISORA] Excuse me?!
--[LECTY] Um, okay.

378
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,916
--What did you just say?
--Why don't you two calm down?

379
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,208
[RICO] I said
you're overreacting.

380
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,625
Take a deep breath?
I'll make some tea.

381
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,041
--Aw, c'mon. Be nice.
--[RICO] Like nails on a--

382
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,500
[gasping]

383
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,375
Hello, my name is Kanata Age.

384
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,625
Nice to meet you.

385
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,791
I'm 17 and a second year
in the regular division.

386
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,875
Oh, and I'm your new instructor.
So let's get started.

387
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,291
All right?

388
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,791
[MISORA]
Huh... Kanata Age?

389
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,500
[gasps] You're that guy
that everyone hates!

390
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,750
--[LECTY gasps]
--[RICO] You're right!

391
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,125
I knew I'd heard that name
somewhere before.

392
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,125
[gasps]
Wait. Who is this?

393
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,708
I've never heard of him...

394
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:40,125
He's a two-faced coward, and a
handsy pervert on top of that!

395
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,208
It's true.

396
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,666
This boy is a shameful
sexual deviant.

397
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,250
He is a disgrace
to the sky wizards.

398
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,333
Yeah, what kind
of creep hangs out

399
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,041
inside the girls' bathroom?

400
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,333
[LECTY, RICO, MISORA]
Die, pervert!

401
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,541
Well, this was a bad idea.

402
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,125
[KANATA] I'm Kanata Age
and I'll be using this part

403
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,125
of the episode to
tell you important info

404
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,083
about this world.

405
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,125
My home, Mystogan,
is a floating city

406
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,916
where Sky Wizards are trained.

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,416
It hovers almost 10,000
feet above the Earth,

408
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,958
and of its 6,000 people,
90% are Wizards like me.

409
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,750
Of course, some of them
are much more, uh,

410
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,250
filled out than others.

411
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,833
Whoa. Hello, there.

412
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,291
Uh, you can get a closer look at
my Fireteam in the next episode:

413
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,000
"The Strongest Traitor."

414
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,500
That's me, you know.
