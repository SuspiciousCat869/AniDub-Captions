[MISORA]
I can't believe he'd tell me

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,208
to give up the Magic
Cannon Sword!

3
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,791
How dare he?

4
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,166
I'm gonna train super hard and
master it like nobody else has!

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,083
Earnest, hard work
always pays off!

6
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,666
At least that's what
I read in a manga.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,875
[KANATA]
Let's be real,

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,458
manga heroes seem like
super hard workers,

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,416
but in the end you find
out they had some kind

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,583
of special talent or advantage.

11
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,958
[MISORA]
You ruin everything!

12
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,333
[SKY WIZARD A]
There are too many of them!

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,333
[SKY WIZARD B] We can't hold
them off for much longer!

You picked the
wrong Sky Wizard

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,583
to mess with today,
Devil Beetles!

[SOCIÉ grunting]

Oh, So you wanna
play like that?

21
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,166
[SOCIÉ]
Alright.

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,458
My magic power is fully charged!

00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,833

Awesome!

00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,875
I'm proud of you, Momma!

00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,208

You're switching from vanguard

Magic Cannon Sword to
middle guard Magic Cannon.

[LECTY] Um. Excuse me,
I'm here with your coffee.

[LLOYD] You're getting
pretty good at this.

[LECTY gasps]

42
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,208
[LLOYD] Thank you
for all your hard work.

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,666
[LLOYD] What do you say
we take a quick break?

44
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,083
Sounds good.

45
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,208
[sighs]
I'm so exhausted.

46
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,125
[FREON] The girl at
the door looked familiar.

47
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,708
She's one of the students from
fireteam E601, isn't she?

48
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,666
What kind of "training"
is waitressing at a café?

49
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,000
If you really want to know,

50
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,958
call Kanata in and
ask him about it.

51
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,708
I would but I doubt
that he'd give me

52
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,791
a straight answer.
You know how he is.

No, ma'am.

56
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,875
[LECTY]
Huh?

57
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,875
You know that I'm a goddess.
Why should I submit to nasty,

58
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,750
sweaty training
designed for humans?

59
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,125
Yeah, and I hate
to even ask you.

60
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,083
But Misora's been absent
from school for a few days.

61
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,666
I'm a total train wreck without
her here to back me up.

62
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
I'm the last person
you should ask.

63
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,583
"People" problems are
so far beneath me

64
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,541
that I can't even
begin to relate.

65
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,041
[LECTY]
I understand.

66
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,833
I guess I'll just have to
rely on Kanata to help.

67
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,666
[RICO gasps]

68
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm quite surprised
you would place

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,916
so much faith in
a traitor like him.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,083
Yeah, I know!

71
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,708
Well, I was kinda
worried about him, too.

72
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
Cuz' he made me wear
this silly maid outfit...

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,666
[RICO]
Well, well, Kanata Age.

74
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,416
[LECTY]...The effect
training's had on me...

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
[RICO] Looks like
you've won her over.

Yuri, my name's
Real Nua. Hi there.

00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,083
Thank you for drying
my pants the other day!

79
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
Yeah, that'll work.

00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,000
What could you possibly
want with me now, Yuri?

81
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,583
[REAL]
Huh?

82
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,000
[YURI] Don't play dumb, you know
exactly what I'm after, Kanata.

83
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,000
The girls from fireteam E601
haven't trained in days.

84
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,500
I demand to know what's up!

85
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,750
How would you know whether
they've been training or not?

86
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,375
[laughs] I checked the log
book and there's no record

87
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,458
of anyone from your
fireteam requesting

88
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,708
to use the training airspace.

89
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,791
That's public information,
you know.

90
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,375
Don't you have anything
better to do? Get a life.

91
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,750
[YURI gasps] There's no
need for you to be rude!

92
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,666
You're the only Special Duty
member who has any spare time!

93
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,791
I'm just looking out
for those girls, is all.

94
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,291
I wouldn't want
you to betray them

95
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,666
like you seem to do
to everybody else here.

96
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,750
[KANATA]
Whatever.

97
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,958
As much as I'd
love to stay and chat,

98
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,625
I've gotta go check
on one of my students.

99
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,500
Hey, wait!

100
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,125
I'm not finished talking to you!

101
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,208
[KANATA]
Always so serious.

102
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,583
You need to lighten up.

103
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,291
[YURI] Y-You're the one
who's in the wrong, not me!

104
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,458
[KANATA] You don't need to
"look out" for the girls, okay?

105
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,625
That's my job.

[gasps]

107
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,541
[YURI]
D-Don't just walk away, Kanata!

00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,958

Come back here!

Welcome, Sir.

00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,375
Excuse me.

00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm looking for
Miss Misora Whitale.

00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,500
[MISORA] What in the hell do
you think you're doing here?!

115
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,041
[KANATA] Oh, so you're not sick,
you're just playing hooky.

116
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,375
What does it matter
to you, jerk face?

117
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,791
Watch your tone, young lady.

118
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,958
That's no way to speak
to one of our guests.

119
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,750
[MISORA]
Shut up, Dad!

120
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,083
Just butt out of it, okay?

121
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,250
[GALE gasps]

122
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,833
Wait a sec, you mean
you're Misora's Dad?

123
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,416
She looks nothin' like you.

124
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,291
[laughs]

125
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,916
[GALE] Luckily, she takes
after her mother.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,583
Okay, That's it, I'm done
helping for the day.

127
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,625
I'm sorry. We're not
exactly the model family

128
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,708
when it comes to
relating to each other.

129
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,916
[KANATA]
Huh?

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,125
Wow, your wife is a
really beautiful woman.

131
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,833
And you're right, Misora does
look just like her.

132
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,291
[GALE]
Thank you.

133
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,208
I only wish I could
remember her.

134
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,583
[KANATA]
Huh?

135
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,958
That photo is the only
reason I'm sure she existed.

136
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,958
Eat up, kid, this one's
on the house.

137
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,083
It's our most popular entrée.

138
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,541
Well, I'm not here
as a customer, but...

139
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,375
[KANATA]
Whoa! This is delicious!

140
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,416
[laughs]

141
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,500
[GALE] They tell me steak
was my wife's favorite food.

142
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,750
I hear she'd eat
it for every meal.

143
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,583
You must be a Natural, huh?

144
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,083
Yeah, I am. And apparently
I was married

145
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,375
to one of the best
Sky Wizards on record.

146
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,458
But I have no
memory of her.

147
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,208
Seems heartless, I know.

148
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,083
But it's not like
I can control it.

149
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,083
The records are there.

150
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,625
She was real.

151
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,375
I know that, logically, but it
never feels like my memory.

152
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,083
[MISORA huffs]

153
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,916
It definitely puts a strain
on my relationship with Misora.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,291
She's been skipping
school the past few days,

155
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,291
but I can't even punish her.

156
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,500
Are you guys friends?

157
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
You know what's
going on with her?

158
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm grasping at straws, here.

159
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,000
[KANATA chuckles]
Friends? Guess we'll see.

160
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,958
But, before I get into that,
I've got a question for ya.

161
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,500
[GALE]
What is it?

162
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,416
[KANATA] Why is she so obsessed
with the Magic Cannon Sword?

163
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,875
[GALE] You're more than just
an acquaintance, aren't you?

164
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,458
I didn't mention it before?
I'm Misora's new instructor.

165
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,958
It's my job to help her become
stronger, but she's fighting me.

166
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,708
[GALE]
Hmm...

167
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,250
My wife was an amazing
Magic Cannon Swordsman.

168
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,375
Those who fought beside
her say that watching her

169
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,916
in battle was like nothing
they'd ever seen. But one day,

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,208
she left for a mission and
never made it back home.

171
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,291
[MISORA grunts]

172
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,416
Since that day,
it's like she never existed.

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,958
None of us Naturals
have any memory of her.

174
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,833
[GALE] I think Misora wants to
master the Magic Cannon Sword

175
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,875
as a way to always keep
her mother's legacy alive.

176
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,291
[MISORA shouts]

177
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,083
[MISORA grunts]

178
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,333
I'll never give up.
No matter what.

179
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,125
[MISORA gasps]
It's Momma! She's home!

180
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,541
Oh, my baby!

Momma!

Misora!

183
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,916
We watched you fly!

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,125
[SOCIÉ] I missed you
so much, my sweet girl!

185
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,666
Here ya go!

186
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,125
I know how you love it when
I swing you around like this!

187
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,416
Up, up, and away!

188
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,833
[MISORA screams]

189
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,916
Socié.

Oh, Gale!

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,125
I've been so worried about you

192
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,041
I haven't slept through
the night since you left.

193
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,291
I napped, though.

194
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,833
[SOCIÉ] Well, I was
so lonely without you

195
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,666
that I could only manage
to eat four meals a day!

196
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,416
[GALE] We're happy to
have you home, honey.

197
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,875
[SOCIÉ] I'm thrilled
to be back, my darling.

198
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,500
[MISORA screams]

199
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,000
[MISORA]
Momma! Why'd you do that?

200
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,416
[SOCIÉ giggling]
My baby is just the cutest ever!

201
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,833
Hey! Stop it! Momma!

202
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,000
[MALE RESIDENT A] I watched
the live feed, you were great!

203
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,541
[MALE RESIDENT B]
You didn't just defeat

204
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,708
those Devil Beetles,
you pulverized 'em!

205
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,375
[MALE RESIDENT C]
The city of Iris

206
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,166
can rest easy with
you protecting us!

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,666
[SOCIÉ chuckles]
No problem!

208
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,875
Just leave the dirty work
to me and I'll keep you safe!

209
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,916
[giggles]

210
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,708
Aw, steak for breakfast again?

211
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,416
Yep! Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day

212
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,250
so you gotta eat
something nice and heavy!

213
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,083
Aw... But, I want cereal.

214
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,458

216
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess I messed up the settings
on the washing machine again.

218
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,583
[MISORA] I didn't know the
machine had a flood setting!

[MISORA]
What happened, Momma?

222
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,750
It's funny.

223
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,458
I was cleaning the house and
it seemed like there would

224
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,333
never be an end to all the
trash, so I had an idea.

225
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,958
And I thought, "Why don't
I just use magic?"

226
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,708
You can't vaporize trash!

Don't be such a meanie, Misora!

--I'll be there shortly.

Did you miss me, Misora?

I missed you so much!

Wow!

00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,416
The town looks so
tiny from way up here!

That's right!

Daddy and all our neighbors are
down there safe in their beds.

[MISORA]
Really?

252
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,291
They're sleeping sound
because they know

253
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,041
I will protect them
if there's trouble.

254

I know it makes you sad when
I leave, but just remember that

do great out there Momma!

heard of a Sky Wizard

buy us time to regroup.

were just too many enemies.

00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,041
We'll suffer this
loss for a long time.

315
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,083
[gasps]

316
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,625
[SOCIÉ] I know it makes
you sad when I leave,

317
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,041
but just remember
that when I'm away

318
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,458
I'm busy keeping our city safe.

319
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,250
[MISORA gasps, whimpers]

320
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,083
[SOCIÉ] But I suppose
that I should protect

321
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,916
you and your daddy too, huh?

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,250
[gasps]

323
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,250
That's mine now. Please!

324
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,083
I wanna be a Sky Wizard!

325
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,166
[SKY WIZARDS gasp]

326
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,291
[MISORA]
I'm gonna be brave and strong

327
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,333
and protect everyone
like my momma!

328
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,416
[MISORA yells, pants]

329
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,000
Why can't I be
strong like she was?

330
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,541
All I want is to win,
so why can't I?

331
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,375
I'm so sick of losing!

332
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,416
[yelps]

333
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,291
I try.

334
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,166
I do.

335
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,916
I always give it my best shot.

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,208
But for some reason
it's just never enough.

337
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,750
[MISORA]
I can't give up, though.

338
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,083
I'm never going to stop
fighting for mom's memory.

339
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,833
[MISORA]
What are you doing here?

340
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,958
[KANATA]
The Hills of Hope.

341
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,041
The final resting place
of the Sky Wizards

342
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,333
who lost their lives in battle.

343
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,041
Word on the street is
you're here every day.

344
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
I'm sure my dad
told you that.

345
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,833
What makes you guys think
you can invade my privacy?

346
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,708
The two of you are
the absolute worst!

347
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,000
[KANATA] Don't be angry with
your dad, it's not his fault.

348
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,458
You won't tell him anything.

349
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,541
Can you blame him
for worrying about you?

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,625
[MISORA grunts]

351
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,750
[KANATA] I asked
him why you're fixated

352
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,416
on the Magic Cannon Sword.

353
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,666
I knew by his answer
that I'd find you here.

354
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,291
Misora.

355
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,375
Swear right now on
your mother's grave.

356
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,458
Give up on the
Magic Cannon Sword.

357
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,000
[MISORA gasps]

358
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,166
[KANATA]
You'll never get stronger

359
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,541
if you keep obsessing about it.

360
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,500
You don't know anything
about me, so butt out, okay!

361
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,416
[MISORA] When the Sky
Wizards gave me this sword,

362
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,666
I was handed my mother,
her will, everything about her

363
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,458
that the Naturals like my
dad can't even remember!

364
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,291
I guess a traitor like you
can't understand that!

365
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,333
Hey.

366
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,166
These are called the
"Hills of Hope".

367
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,583
What did the dead hope for?

368
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,916
They hoped to
protect the citizens

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,583
and to keep their cities safe.

370
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,708
[KANATA]
That's right.

371
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,958
None of them wanted to die

372
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,041
and be forgotten
by their loved ones,

373
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,875
but they took that
chance in order protect

374
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,666
innocent civilians
from the Devil Beetles.

375
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,833
It's what drove them to fight.

376
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,416
I'm sure your mother
felt that way, too.

377
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,083
Well, obviously.
Of course she did.

378
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,041
[KANATA]
Think about it.

379
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,125
[MISORA]
Huh?

380
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,250
Your mother's goal wasn't

381
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,083
to Master the
Magic Cannon Sword.

382
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,500
That was a means to an end.

383
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,291
As a Sky Wizard,
the weapon she chose

384
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,458
was never as important to
her as protecting her people.

385
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,875
But... It's her sword.

386
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,833
I didn't feel anything.

387
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,333
There was no grief
when Socié died.

388
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,458
I worry it'll be the
same with my daughter.

389
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,291
It scares me to think that I
could lose her feel nothing.

390
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,625
That little girl means
the world to me.

391
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,541
You need to stop
being so stubborn,

392
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,333
or you're gonna make a mistake
and get killed in battle.

393
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,375
[gasps]

394
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,666
[KANATA]
You'd be forgotten.

395
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,458
You'd never get to
make a real impact.

396
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,291
Duh. Yeah, I get that.

397
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,083
I know that the way I'm
behaving is totally selfish.

398
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,166
[KANATA]
Then stop!

399
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,458
But I'm still not
gonna give it up!

400
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,666
I want to protect the people,

401
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,041
but I only wanna do it
with my mom's sword!

402
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,958
If I master the
Magic Cannon Sword

403
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,791
and become as good as she was,

404
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,708
maybe people who see
me fighting with her weapon

405
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,541
will recover the memories
of her that they lost.

406
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,125
That's a tall order.

407
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,833
Naturals have never recovered
memories of lost Sky Wizards.

408
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,833
[MISORA]
So what?

409
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,416
That doesn't mean
it's impossible!

410
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,208
She deserves to be remembered!

411
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,958
We all do!

412
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,000
[KANATA gasps]

413
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,708
[chuckles]

414
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,250
[MISORA]
Huh?

415
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,583
[KANATA laighs] I could tell
from the start you were crazy,

416
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,000
but you're
officially certifiable!

417
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,125
[MISORA]
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up!

418
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,000
No worries.

419
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,083
The crazy ones are my favorites.

420
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,208
[gasps]

421
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,916
[KANATA] I'm gonna
teach you how to be

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,416
the best Magic Cannon
Swordsman ever.

423
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
You just have to listen, okay?

424
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,416
[MISORA]
Huh?

425
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,208
Thank you for showing
me how resolute you are.

426
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,083
Looks like I'm gonna have to
step up my game from now on.

427
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,375
So, this was a test then?

428
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,458
Misora.

429
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,500
I need to be sure
you understand.

430
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,458
The path you've chosen
is a fate worse than death.

431
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,416
You think you can take it?

432
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,166
I know I can!

433
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,333
[KANATA] Then swear on your
sword and your mother's grave,

434
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,708
so I know you're committed.

435
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,541
[gasps]

436
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,041
[KANATA] Vow that you'll
become an even better

437
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,875
Magic Cannon Swordsman
than your mom ever was.

438
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,000
Swear you'll be strong
enough to protect your people

439
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,666
and yourself, as well.

440
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,750
[MISORA gasps]
Right!

441
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,750
[MISORA]
I swear.

442
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,833
[KANATA]
I won't let her die.

443
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,750
Huh?

444
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,333
I promise you.

445
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,125
Why do you care?

446
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,458
'Cause if I didn't,
I'd be a lousy instructor.

447
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,958
[MISORA gasps]

448
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,458
[KANATA]
I'm here to help you carry

449
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,166
the weight of your burdens.
Our responsibility is heavy.

450
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,083
[gasps]

451
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,125
So we have to be strong.

452
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,416
You got it?

453
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,583
Yes!

454
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,000
[MISORA]
I'm sorry for worrying you.

455
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,458
No, it's alright!

456
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,875
I'm just so happy to have
you back to train with me.

457
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,875
I really missed you.

458
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,208
[KANATA]
Come on, ladies!

459
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,958
It's time to get the show
on the road! Hop to it

460
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,833
or I'll make you bikini
baristas for the next week!

461
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,500
[gasps]
Yes, sir!

462
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,625
Hey! Wait up, Lecty!

463
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,625

464
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,666
[KANATA]
Hm?

465
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,708
[MISORA]
Hey, Kanata.

466
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,041
Thank you!

467
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,666
[chuckles]

468
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,750
[RICO]
Well, Instructor.

469
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,791
You've finally
become interesting.

470
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,208
[MISORA]
Hey everybody, Misora here!

471
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,458
You know, Mystogan isn't
the only floating city.

472
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,750
We've got lots of 'em!

473
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,250
Let's see, there's Oakis,
Lyune, and Bevel.

474
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,500
Those are just some of
the more famous ones!

475
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,333
[LECTY] I used to live on Oakis
before I came to the academy!

476
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,666
[MISORA] Yeah, yeah,
that's nice, Lecty.

477
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,541
Now let's get back to what
really matters here: me!

478
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,875
Don't miss my awesome
performance in the next episode

479
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,208
of Sky Wizards Academy,
"The Key to Victory."

480
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,500
[LECTY gasps] I'll try my
best to help-- ouch!

481
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm sorry, I just bit my tongue.

482
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,333
[MISORA] I can't
take you anywhere.
