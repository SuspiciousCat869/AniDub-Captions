1
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,333
[RICO] Long ago, the human
race was forced to abandon

2
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,166
the surface of the Earth.

3
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,625
All the land they once
occupied was taken over

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,625
by monstrous creatures
known as Devil Beetles.

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,625
The humans had
no choice but to move

6
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,666
to giant cities floating
in the atmosphere.

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,208
Our epic saga takes
place on Mystogan,

8
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,083
a massive floating academy.

9
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,666
It stars the fiercest,
most beautiful of all

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,250
who fight the Devil Beetles.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,625
The exquisite goddess incarnate,
otherwise known as, Rico Flamel.

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,958
[MISORA]
Why're you lying to them?!

13
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,958
Hey! Did you hear me?!

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,041
[MISORA] I can't believe we're
stuck with a perv for a teacher.

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,958
What makes you think
you're even qualified?

16
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,083
[KANATA] The fact that they gave
me the job was my first clue.

17
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,166
All right ladies,
what dya say we get to it?

18
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,791
[MISORA] Get to what?
What're you talking about?

19
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,333
I bet you didn't even
look at the data on us.

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,291
The only reason you're here
is because you want us

21
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,083
to do dirty things with you.

22
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,291
[KANATA]
Oh, shut up.

23
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,500
[gasps]

24
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,500
[KANATA] I did my research,
Strawberry Jam.

25
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,416
Your name's Misora Whitale.

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,750
Sky Wizards prep,
second year. Age 14.

27
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,958
I looked over your report card
and you're currently

28
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
making Ds in all
of your classes.

29
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,166
Except for practical training
where you're making an E.

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,291
You're doing so poorly,
the reviewer recommends

31
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,000
you voluntarily drop out.

32
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,958
Well, that's just one opinion.

33
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,958
One's true abilities
can't be measured on paper!

34
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,416
Right...

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,333
You know I'm right!
Don't try to act like you don't!

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,333
Right...

37
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,333
[gasps]

38
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,458
[whimpers]

39
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,500
[sighs]

40
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,750
[MISORA]
C'mon, you guys!

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,666
Don't just sit there
looking at me like that!

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,375
Back me up!

43
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,458
[whines] You're no help!
Thanks for nothin'!

44
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,625
[scoffs] I've always
doubted her prowess.

45
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,333
It's nice to know
I'm correct yet again.

46
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,583
Oh, I suppose I should
introduce myself, I'm--

47
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,958
Rico Flamel.

48
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,583
Also a Sky Wizards
prep second year.

49
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,833
Your classroom grades aren't
bad, you're making all As.

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,416
Well, A minus for consistently
failing to turn in

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,791
your homework assignments.

52
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,041
Wait a second...

53
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,291
So what's with your
practical exam score?

54
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,125
I thought E was
the lowest grade.

55
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,541
How'd you score an F minus?

56
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,708
[RICO]
Hmph. Oh, you know.

57
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,208
I was having a bad hair day,
so I decided to stay home.

58
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,666
Ah... Well, whatever you say.

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,958
And, last but not least...

60
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,000
Uh, yeah, that's me!

61
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
[KANATA]
Lecty Eisenach.

62
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,958
Yet another Sky Wizards
prep, second year.

63
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,541
Your grades are awful
just like Misora's.

64
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,625
Your practical exams
are inconsistent.

65
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,500
You win and lose against the
same opponents

66
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,000
with wildly varying
scores in each match.

67
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:53,416
Yeah. I, um...
Uh, I know...

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,583
I-- Sorry!

69
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,541
[wails]

70
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, then.

71
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,166
Now that we've got the
introductions out of the way.

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's get--

73
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,083
[MISORA]
Stop right there!

74
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,291
I cannot stand to hear
another word about this.

75
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,083
I won't be taught by a traitor!

76
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,083
Um... 'Scuse me?

77
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
I know why we're
calling him a pervert,

78
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,250
but what makes him a traitor?

79
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,583
From what I heard,
about six months ago,

80
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,791
he fought some Devil Beetles.

81
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,333
He managed to come back alive,

82
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,333
but he's been a
coward ever since.

83
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,666
He's useless.

84
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,708
He avoids special missions
and seems to do nothing

85
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,166
but slack off.

86
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,791
[CROWD cheering]

87
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,500
[RICO] I heard that he skipped
out on a crucial match.

88
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,458
One that would have gotten
his team into the S rank.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,416
[MISORA] All he ever does is
disappoint the people

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
who rely on him.
And that is why...

91
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,833
...he's called a traitor!

92
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,708
[gasps]

93
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,916
[MISORA] We can't allow
such an irresponsible jerk

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,291
to be our instructor!

95
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,125
Go complain to the head
of the Sky Wizards division.

96
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,833
[KANATA]
Someone's gotta teach ya.

97
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,083
Why not me?

98
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,416
I mean, you haven't won
a single ranked match.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,416
Are you embarrassed?

100
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,750
[MISORA growls]
What do you think?

101
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,291
Of course I'm embarrassed!
It's humiliating.

102
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,166
All I've ever wanted is to be a
full-fledged Sky Wizard.

103
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,916
If that doesn't happen,
then I'm wasting my time.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,541
[RICO] Yes, Misora is
perpetually embarrassed.

105
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,666
But my skills are
more than adequate.

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,625
From a very young age, I've been
lauded as goddess incarnate.

107
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,000
How could you think
I don't have what it takes?

108
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,166
Um... Yeah!

109
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,500
I know I can do this!

110
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,333
And I'm willing to train
as hard as you need me to!

111
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you know what
they used to call me?

112
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,375
Hah. Back in the day...

113
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,500
...I was given the name
Black Swordmaster Chronos.

114
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, we've all heard.
What's it matter anyway?

115
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,666
[KANATA]
Well, that swordmaster's

116
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,875
gonna be instructing you.

117
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,708
If you do a good job, I think
you could be as strong as me.

118
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,250
Maybe.

119
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,666
Or even stronger, if you're
as good as you think you are.

Let me whip you into shape.

122

With my help, you could defeat
the top-ranked fire teams.

123
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,041
And you could help us fight
against the Devil Beetles.

Imagine how that would feel.

Well, since we don't have
any choice in the matter...

00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,083
I guess we'll have
to put up with you

That's fine for
"Misora the Ordinary".

137
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,125
However, as you know,
I'm a goddess.

138
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,500
Why should I sweat and toil

as if I were a lowly
human like them?

Seriously, Rico!

That ugly, superior attitude
is exactly why

you're not seeing
any improvement!

Hey, Rico. One thing.

150
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,041
Your test scores are no better
than the "lowly humans"

151
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,458

Yeah, well, why should I care?

153
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,583
Goddesses have no need
for stupid exams,

154
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,333
so I don't think my
scores should matter.

Sorry, but I've never
seen you in action,

so your scores are all I've got.

And judging by those, I'd say
your skills are no better

158
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,041

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,958
You cannot compare
the human incarnation

162
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
of a goddess to that!

163
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,333
Hey, you want a fat lip?!

164
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,708
Y'know...

165
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,333
Training would be the
perfect opportunity for you

166
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,000
to prove me wrong.

167
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,541
[RICO]
Hmm... I see how it is.

168
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,666
I'll comply, but once you see
my astounding ability,

169
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,750
you'll know who's better
without question.

170
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,375
By the way...

171
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,166
While you're being entranced by
the grace of my divine skills,

172
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,166
try not to fall in love with me.

173
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,500
Sure.

174
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,083
And what about you?

175
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,125
[gasps]

176
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,625
[KANATA]
You think you're up for it?

177
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,250
Um... I, uh...

178
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,000
Well...

179
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,208
[MISORA]
Lecty!

180
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,208
How many times do we
have to go over this?

181
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,666
When someone asks you
a question,

182
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,666
you look them in the eye
and answer with confidence.

183
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,125
I'm so sorry!

184
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,458
Why're you apologizing?

185
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,916
Are you saying that you
don't wanna train with me?

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,916
[whimpers]
No, I'm not.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,583
I was apologizing to Misora!

188
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,041
Sorry you thought
I was talking to you!

189
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,500
Come on.

190
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,791
I accept your offer.

191
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,375
I'd consider it an honor
to have you as my instructor!

192
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,583
[sighs]

193
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,791
Well, that's great.
Guess it's settled, then.

194
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,208
[YURI]
Okay, so...

195
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:25,375
My next assignment is
to assist with city security?

196
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,500
[CHLOE giggles]

197
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:30,000
--My god!
--She waved at us!

198
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,250
It wouldn't kill you
to wave back, you know.

199
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,833
Yeah, but I'm not used
to being treated like this.

200
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,458
I'm not a celebrity.

201
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,375
[sighs] Lemme guess,
you're drinking tea?

202
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,125
Uh, yeah. Is that a problem?

203
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,625
So you still find
coffee too bitter?

204
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,500
Kind of nice to see some
things'll never change.

205
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
[sighs]

206
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,458
[YURI]
Hey, so, I'm curious.

207
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Are the higher ups
still treating Kanata

208
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,458
like he's away on sick leave?

209
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,208
[CHLOE]
That makes six.

210
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,750
[YURI]
What?

211
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,333
[CHLOE] You've asked me that
question six times this week.

212
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,041
[gasps]

213
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,000
But, yes. Sick leave
is the official statement.

214
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,791
He's definitely not
ready to be sent

215
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,958
on any real assignments yet.

216
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,250
However, he's now the instructor
of an E-level fireteam.

217
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,500
[YURI]
An instructor?!

218
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,750
[CHLOE] Yes. I was
the one who requested it.

219
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,916
What?! That makes
no sense to me!

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,916
He's a traitor to his fireteam,

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,625
he'd rather spend time helping
Logistics than fighting,

222
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,375
now he's an instructor?!

223
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,708
I can't believe my ears!

224
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,500
How does he get away
with being such a jerk?!

225
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
Okay, calm down.

226
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,125
Insulting him isn't going
to help anything, Yuri.

227
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,333
[gasps]

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,250
[CHLOE]
Beautiful, isn't it?

229
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,291
As Sky Wizards, it's our duty
to keep the peace.

230
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,083
And, like it or not,
Kanata is one of us.

231
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,291
As badly as he
behaves sometimes,

232
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,500
I know he still cares.

233
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,041
[YURI sighs]

234
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,208
So, where do you think
Kanata is right now?

235
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,916
Hmm... Well, if I had to
take a wild guess...

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,208
I'd say up there!

237
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,583
[KANATA] Okay.
That's high enough for now.

238
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,625
I gotta ask. What the heck
are you riding that thing for?

239
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,208
[KANATA] Huh? Oh. I'm just
used to flying like this.

240
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,500
To be honest, I find it
rather insulting.

241
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,833
If you're going to challenge us,

242
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,000
then you should at least
use flight magic.

243
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,958
What?! Hold on a second.

244
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,625
Mister "Grand Master Swordsman"
thinks he's so great

245
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,208
that he doesn't even have to
fly properly to face us?

246
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,375
Well, since you girls
have a reputation

247
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,041
for not having any skill,
yeah, I'd say that's right.

248
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,916
[growls]
Fine! We'll see how this goes.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,208
So what kind of training
are we doing anyway?!

250
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,708
Today's exercise is--

251
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,833
[MISORA]
Out with it!

252
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,625
It's a game of tag!

253
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,166
Did you say "tag"?!

254
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,666
[MISORA] Playing tag is a
beginning exercise for amateurs

255
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,291
who are just learning
how to fly!

256
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,875
[RICO] I'm appalled that you
think a childish exercise

257
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,458
like this is an appropriate
test of my divine ability.

258
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:21,500
[LECTY] Um... Are you sure this
is the best way to train us?

259
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,625
[KANATA]
Oh. I forgot to mention.

260
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,875
[GIRLS]
Huh?

261
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,333
There's one caveat.

262
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,708
You are allowed to use your
arcana-alchemical weapons

263
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,291
to attack me.

264
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,375
If you can bring me down, then
the training exercise is over.

265
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,333
[gasping]

266
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,083
[KANATA]
Okay, enough talk.

267
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
Training starts now!

268
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,875
[LECTY]
Wow, he's fast!

269
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,083
[MISORA]
Ugh! Whatever! It's on!

270
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,291
Let's do what we can to knock
that traitor off his high horse!

271
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,875
Hold up, Misora! Wait for us!

272
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,250
I can't believe her.
So much for strategy.

273
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,250
Only a novice would blindly
chase their target.

274
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,541
[MISORA]
Come back here, you coward!

275
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,916
You're living up to
your scummy reputation!

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,333
Man, this is bad.

277
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,250
They don't seem to understand
the concept of teamwork.

278
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,333
[MISORA growls]

279
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,000
--Wow. Okay.
--[MISORA] This isn't fair!

280
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,791
--Her speed is impressive.
--You're totally cheating!

281
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,250
[KANATA]
I'll admit you're fast,

282
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,708
but do you really think you
can catch me on your own?

283
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,583
Of course I do, why else
would I be doing this?!

284
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,458
I'm gonna catch up to you,
and when I do,

285
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm gonna knock you out!

286
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,375
Yeah, I'd like to see you try.

287
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm not gonna let you
get close enough to me

288
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,875
to land a single blow.

289
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,208
[gasps, growls]

290
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,208
I'm gonna get you,
you stupid traitor!

291
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,458
Huh. She's got pretty
decent stamina, too.

292
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,125
[MISORA]
All right, I've had enough!

293
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,333
I'm done playing games.

294
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,708
I'm taking you down
once and for all!

295
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,083
My Magical Canon Sword,
Ragrid, will teach you a lesson!

296
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,458
[MISORA yells]

297
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,666
Stop that!

298
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,166
[KANATA]
C'mon, it's not a club!

299
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,541
If you don't swing it with
precision, you'll never hit me!

300
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,291
[MISORA]
I could if you'd stay still!

301
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,500
Do you have any idea
how to wield that thing?

302
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,416
Jeez. You're just
flailing like an idiot.

303
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,666
[panting]

304
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,625
You shut your mouth!
Why don't you just give up?

305
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,833
You're going down, traitor!

306
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,708
[sighs]
Let's give this a shot.

307
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,833
[MISORA]
Don't run away!

308
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,708
Come back here and fight me!

309
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,958
What's the matter?
You afraid of little ol' me?

310
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,208
[KANATA] Hmm. She's still
right behind me.

311
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,500
Her speed and stamina
are impressive.

312
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,916
Let's put her to the test!

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,083
This thing ends now!

314
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,541
[gasps]

315
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,583
No way. He's gone!

316
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,458
Where did you go, you jerk?!

317
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,166
[KANATA sighs]

318
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,041
[KANTA] I didn't expect
such a simple maneuver

319
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,916
to throw her off.

320
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,958
[gasps]

321
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,958
[KANATA]
She snuck up on me...

322
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,791
'Scuse me... Um,
Mister Kanata, sir?

323
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,416
Ahh... That's a nice weapon.
Do you have a name for it?

324
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,791
[LECTY]
Ah? Oh, uh, yeah...

325
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,541
Amano-habakiri.
That's what these are called.

326
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,000
[KANATA] She could've had
a hit if she'd gone for it.

327
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,375
I wonder why she didn't.

328
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,750
[KANATA]
What are you waiting for?

329
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,708
You shouldn't hesitate.

330
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,791
'Kay... Here goes nothing!

331
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:46,750
[LECTY yelling,
KANATA grunting]

332
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
[LECTY gasps]

333
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,875
[LECTY]
S-Stay away! I'm warning you!

334
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,291
Don't come any closer!

335
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,000
[KANATA]
How can she be so inconsistent?

336
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,041
Hey, Lecty. You're not
going easy on me, are ya?

337
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,916
[panting]

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,750
What do you mean?
Of course I'm not!

339
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,916
[LECTY, KANATA grunting]

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,958
[KANATA]
She's a natural.

341
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
Her moves are refined
and precise.

342
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,958
And her reflexes are fantastic,

343
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,333
but it seems like
she's trying too hard.

344
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,875
I get the sense that she
doesn't trust her own ability.

345
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,458
I've gotta ask you,
are your weapons

346
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,125
the famous Eisenach twin swords?

347
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,166
[gasps]

348
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
[LECTY]
I'm sorry, Kanata!

349
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,583
[KANATA]
Huh...?

350
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Please, accept my apology!

351
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,208
Please!

352
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,375
[RICO]
The Magic Gun Athena,

353
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,583
as exquisite as the goddess
who wields it, shall smite you!

354
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,333
[gasps]

355
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,791
[KANATA grunts]

356
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,291
[LECTY screams]

357
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,916
He just stopped my bullet.
How did he do that?

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,333
You saved me.

359
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,791
You all right?

360
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,125
[gasps]
Uh, yeah...

361
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,291
It looks like Rico
isn't all talk.

362
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,791
She's got killer aim.

363
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,208
But, when a shot
is too accurate,

364
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,375
it becomes a lot
easier to dodge.

365
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,791
How so?

366
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,458
It was your intent to kill.

367
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,125
You had me, but I sensed your
presence and blocked the shot.

368
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,250
By the way, you two,
that whole combination.

369
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,291
did you come up
with it on the fly?

370
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,166
Yes, we did, but I was
kinda scared to try.

371
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,500
Hah. When compared to Misora,
who flies about recklessly

372
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,916
waving her sword in the air,

373
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,083
Lecty's fighting style
seems almost elegant.

374
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,375
Therefore, it's only
natural that she and I

375
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,000
would be able to sync our
efforts and land a good shot.

376
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,125
I see. So, you can make a plan,
but you can't concern yourself

377
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,250
with the danger
of friendly fire?

378
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,708
As you know, I'm a goddess.

379
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,666
I place no real value
on any human life.

380
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,916
[KANATA]
What a sweetheart...

381
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
Okay.

382
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,916
I think I have a good sense
of what both of you can do.

383
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,041
[MISORA]
Come back, you stupid traitor!

384
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,083
Where the heck did you go?!

385
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,625
[panting]

386
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,833
How did he get away from me?!
This is ridiculous!

387
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,875
[MISORA growls]
This sucks!

388
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,833
There were three of us
and only one of him!

389
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,708
We should have been
able to catch him!

390
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,916
I'm sorry that my skills
were inadequate.

391
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,208
Truly!

392
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,458
Oh, do you need some help?

393
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,750
Uh, yeah, thanks a lot.

394
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,958
Don't worry, Lecty.

395
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,041
What happened up there
was my fault.

396
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,500
I wasn't looking out
for you today.

397
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,208
I should have been a leader
and given better instructions.

398
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,791
I guess I still have
a thing or two to learn.

399
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,833
Hum. Finally she says
something intelligent.

400
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,875
The fireteam leader
failed to adequately

401
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,291
assess the battlefield.

402
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,583
[MISORA growls]

403
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,416
Huh. But, my brains
and beauty saved the day.

404
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,625
Why you... I oughtta...

405
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,375
Please don't be jealous.

406
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,791
It's only natural that
my breasts are bigger.

407
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,500
And, of course, I'm taller
and much more beautiful.

408
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,250
That's what separates
commoners from goddesses.

409
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,541
Ugh! Like I would
ever be envious of you!

410
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,375
Giant boobs are so overrated!

411
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,625
And besides, my breasts are
still bigger than Lecty's!

412
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,416
What?

413
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,250
Um...

414
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't think so...

415
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,458
Huh...?

416
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,916
What's wrong, Misora?

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,250
Are you... all right?

418
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,041
It can't be...

419
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,458
This cannot be true!

420
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,791
I'm just dreaming...

421
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,958
[wails]

422
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
[MISORA] How could Lecty
have bigger boobs than me?!

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
It's not fair! [sobs]

424
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,916
[RICO] Don't let it
concern you too much.

425
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,166
There's no correlation
between bra size and success.

426
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,208
Not for a Sky Wizard.

427
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,250
Yeah?

428
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,333
You mean it?

429
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,833
[RICO] You may not be all
"boing-boing, va-va-voom"

430
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,000
like me and Lecty,

431
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,791
but that doesn't make you
less of a woman.

432
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,041
You're just more "womp-womp,
fizzle, zip, zilch, nada".

433
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,166
Isn't that right?

434
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,166
Uh...

435
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,791
Yeah, she's got a point!

436
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,916
Who cares if your boobs are
"womp-womp, fizzle,

437
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,041
zip, zilch, nada"? That doesn't
make you any less of a lady!

438
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,666
--At least, I don't think so.
--[MISORA whimpers]

439
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,125
Wait a sec!

440
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,333
Rico, how could you make me
say something like that?!

441
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,625
Um, Misora, listen,
I didn't mean it!

442
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,041
I didn't know what I was saying!

443
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,166
The last thing I want
is for you to be upset--

444
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,875
I have had it!

445
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,375
Rico!

446
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,916
Why do you go outta your way
to be such a hateful jerk?!

447
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,291
How dare you!

448
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,375
--That's no way to speak
--You guys are scaring me,

449

--to a goddess!
--you gotta calm down!

450
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,791
[KANATA] Misora's the
hot head of the group.

451
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,416
She lets her emotions
get the best of her.

452
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,750
[LECTY whines]

453
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,458
[KANATA] Lecty's low
self-esteem gets in her way.

454
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,166
She doesn't trust herself
against the enemy.

455
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
Rico has the exact
opposite problem.

456
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,375
She fights well, but her
arrogance undermines

457
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,166
her relationship
with her allies.

458
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,166
[KANATA]
One thing's for sure,

459
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,291
it's not gonna be easy
putting this puzzle together.

460
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,708
Not with these messed up pieces.

461
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,333
But I can do it, if I can get
them to trust each other.

462
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,375
[RICO] I'll never accept you as
the fireteam leader, Misora.

463
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,875
I am a goddess!

464
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,625
I shouldn't be expected to
submit to someone so inferior.

465
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,833
[MISORA] Let's not forget
I started this fireteam!

466
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,791
The founder's always
the one in charge!

467
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,083
That's the way it is so you're
just gonna have to get over it!

468
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,166
[LECTY]
Misora calm down!

469
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,291
[RICO]
Just because you're the founder

470
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,625
doesn't mean you've
earned my respect!

471
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,083
You can't tell me what to do!

472
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,458
[MISORA]
Don't hold me back, Lecty!

473

I'm gonna shut her
big mouth once and for all!

474
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,875
Okay, ladies, for
tomorrow's lesson--

475
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,708
--Out, you pervert!
--No, you don't, pervert!

476
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,000
[KANATA]
Not this again.

477
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,083
[RICO]
I am the goddess, Rico Flamel.

478
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,125
Today, I am giving
a special lesson.

479
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,208
Consider yourselves lucky
to learn from the best.

480
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,250
A Sky Wizard's role in battle is
determined by his or her weapon.

481
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,750
Lecty's Magic Twin Swords
allow her to perform

482
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,708
close combat in the vanguard.

483
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,500
I, on the other hand,
engage enemies at long range

484
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,125
--with my Magic Gun.
--[MISORA] Hey, what about me?

485
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,291
[RICO] Ah yes,
I almost forgot about you.

486
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,500
No surprise there.

487
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,000
The next episode is called:

488
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,625
"The Potentials of the Weakest."

489
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,666
[MISORA] Is the weakest
supposed to be me?!
