the other beetles will
continue to attack Mistgun.

162
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,000
[KANATA]
Yup. That's what it looks like.

163
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291
So, how do we find it?

164
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,916
[RICO]
Hm. Don't you worry.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,833
It's time you all got a
glimpse of my true power.

166
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,250
[LECTY]
Uh, Rico?

167
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,250
[RICO] Though it pains
me to wear anything

168
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,250
that obscures my
gorgeous features,

169
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,583
my eyesight suffers whenever
I activate my Clairvoyance.

170
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,958
It's truly the greatest
tragedy of our time.

171
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,250
I dunno, you look
pretty good in glasses.

172
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,250
[gasps]
Oh? You think so?

173
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,416
I guess it's
no surprise, really.

174
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,458
[gasps]

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,333
[RICO] I've spotted
an abnormally high

176
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,833
concentration of hostiles.

177
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,708
That must be where
the Chimera is.

178
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
We've got to
get to Block 68!

179
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,583
[YURI gasps]
Chloe! Lloyd!

180
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,250
Shouldn't we fall back?
There are too many of them!

181
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,750
It wouldn't make a
difference, even if we did.

182
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,875
And at this point,

183
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,875
I'm not sure we have a safe
spot to retreat to anymore.

184
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,041
Reports say that there are

185
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,250
multiple chimeras
attacking the city now!

186
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,333
We've got to go
down there and help!

187
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,875
[CHLOE]
It's going to be okay.

188
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,250
Kanata won't let anything
happen to Mistgun.

189
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,750
[YURI]
What are you talking about?

190
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,625
That traitor's probably already
run off and abandoned us!

191
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,833
Yuri.

192
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,000
Please, you have to
believe in Kanata.

193
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,875
But, Chloe!

194
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,541
[CHLOE] Regardless of
what you think about him,

195
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
I know he'll pull
through for us.

196
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,541
He's a good guy at heart.

197
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,791
[LLOYD]
She's right.

198
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,625
There's nothing Kanata
loves more than playing

199
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,083
the knight in shining armor.

200
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,125
[gasps]

201
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,250
All right. Let's go.

202

[LECTY gasps]

203
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,041
Go where?

204
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,958
You three are gonna take
down that Chimera.

205

[ALL gasp]

206
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,333
Um, I don't wanna.

207
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,375
This is our first time
in the field for real.

208
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,458
And you're gonna send
us after a Chimera?

209
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,208
Misora has a point for once.

210
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,375
We're not prepared
for a task like this.

211
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,541
[MISORA gasps]

212
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,541
[KANATA] So you girls
just wanna give up

213
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,750
now that the fight
is getting hard.

214

[RICO gasps]

215
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375
[gasps]

216
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,375
You've been training to protect
the people of this city.

217
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,041
Not so you can stand
around and watch it

218
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,375
get destroyed by some
nasty bugs, right?

219
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,875
The people here
are counting on you.

220
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,541
I believe you can do this.

221
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,625
You just have to have faith
in yourselves and each other.

222
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,291
Huh?

223
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,708
[grunts]

224
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,291
[MISORA]
Yeah. Right.

225
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,583
He might be a filthy pervert,

226
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,333
but he's also a
pretty good instructor.

227
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,125
If he thinks we can beat this
monster, we have to try.

228
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,291
Let's prove to this city

229
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,166
that we're not some
coward like he is.

230
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,958
So, what do you say?
Are you guys with me?

231
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,958
Yes! That's the reason I'm here.

232
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm training to be a Sky Wizard

233
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
in order to protect others
and make them feel safe!

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,541
So, I'm with you, Misora!

235
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,500
Let's go get that Chimera
before it can hurt anyone!

236
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,250
[RICO] Hm. This could
be a good opportunity.

237
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,000
If Freon sees how powerful I am,

238
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,916
maybe she'll finally
realize I'm superior to her.

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
[MISORA]
Wait, what was that?

240
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,625
Um. Shouldn't we be
getting to the Chimera?

241
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,291
[KANATA]
It sounds like you're all in.

242
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,333
[MISORA]
Hm?

243
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,416
Now, let's kill the bastards!

244
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,333
This is our city.

245
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
It's time to take back our sky!

246
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's go.

247
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:54,625
Okay!

248
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,916
Yeah!

249
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,750
[MALE OPERATOR]
It looks like most of the

250
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,791
Devil Beetles are
converging on Block 68.

251
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,041
Most of our forces are
fighting in other places.

252
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,333
What the hell's
happening out there?

253
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:20,791
[gasps]

254
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,791
[KANATA]
Remember the plan, everyone.

255
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,791
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

256
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,333
[KANATA]
Step one.

257
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,708
Lecty distracts the Archenars
by taking the fight to them.

258
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,958
I'm on it!

259
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,291
[LECTY] C'mon, there's no
reason to be nervous.

260
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,291
These are monsters, not people.

261
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,083
I can't hold back!

262
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,333
[LECTY grunting]

263
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,875
Wow, Lecty's doing great!

264
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,166
She' putting that
Eisenach Style to work.

265
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,708
I'm impressed.

266
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,041
[MISORA]
More beetles!

267
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,916
[KANATA]
Yep, just as I expected.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
[MISORA]
Huh?

269
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,083
[gasps]

270
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,291
[KANATA]
Step Two.

271
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,333
Rico uses long-range
sniping to cover Misora.

272
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,375
[RICO gunts]

Now it's your turn!

275
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,291
[MISORA]
Yeah, I know the plan, okay!

276
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,375
[KANATA]
Step Three.

277
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,375
Misora uses her
superior flying skills

278
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,083
to move into firing range,

279
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,875
then she blows the enemy
away with a Strike Blaster.

280
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,291
One shot and it's all over.

282

Bye! Huh?

284

289
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,583
We can do this!

290
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,666
I'll keep you covered
from down here!

291

A goddess who brings so
much beauty to the world

00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,416

to see such creatures!

This is for Rico and Lecty.

00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,708
For Mom. And her memory!

298
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,416
This ends now.

00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
Hey, are you okay?

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,041
[KANATA]
I'm fine.

324
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,750
You know, that was
a pretty good shot.

325
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,458
It didn't stop
them from coming!

326
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,250
Normally, the fight would've
been over already.

327
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,375
But there's something
weird about this Chimera.

328
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
[MISORA]
Save your energy!

329
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,208
I saw you during our training.

330
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,125
For some reason your magic
reserves are easily drained.

331
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
[KANATA] Yeah, but there's
no way around it.

332
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,500
Such a strong enemy deserves
some personal attention

333
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,875
from the teacher.

334
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,041
[gasps]

335
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,958
[KANATA grunts]

336
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,500
Listen, I know what
I'm about to do

337
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,541
is going to set a really
bad example for you.

338
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,916
[MISORA]
Huh

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,083
Just promise me that you'll
never be this stupid!

340
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,708
[MISORA yelps]

341
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,375
[KANATA] You're gonna
want to stand back for this.

342
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,833
[MISORA]
What are you doing?

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,208
[MISORA]
No way.

344
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,375
What the--?

345
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,083
How the heck is
he moving like that?

346
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,458
Nice try, but I'm way too
fast for such a lame attack.

347
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,458
[KANATA grunts]

348

[gasps]

349
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,250
[MISORA gasps]
That's not magic power.

350
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,750
It's like some
other force entirely.

351
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,750
That's it.

352
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,166
Time for you to say goodnight!

353
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,583
[KANATA] I can't keep going
like this for much longer.

354
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,125
The Chimera's gonna fire again!
You gotta get out of there!

355
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,500
[KANATA]
Didn't I tell you earlier?

356
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,708
[MISORA]
Huh?

357
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,875
This fight was over

358
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,458
the moment I stepped
on the battlefield.

359
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,333
The bastard never stood
a chance against me!

360

You forgot to mention that.

[LECTY gasps]
The Chimera?

364

[RICO gasps]
Misora, was that you?

365
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,666
[MISORA gasps]
Kanata!

366
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,000
Is he okay?

367
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:09,916
Catch him!

He's falling too fast!

[YURI]
What happened?

371
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
[LLOYD] Looks like he took
care of everything after all.

372
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,083
Wait, you're saying
the traitor saved us?

373
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,458
[CHLOE chuckles]
Isn't it obvious?

374
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,541
The man you love
protected our city.

[FEMALE OPERATOR] The Archenar
class Devil Beetles

378
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,416
are pulling out of
the city's airspace.

379
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,250
[MALE OPERATOR]
It appears to be a full retreat!

380
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,583
We're clear!

381
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,458
[FREON] The super-powered
Chimera was defeated.

382
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,958
But who did it?

[REAL gasps]

389

[MISORA] I refuse to
let you die on us now.

390
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,041
We're just starting
to get good at this!

391
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,416
Yeah, Please wake up, Kanata.

392
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,083
[KANATA]
I don't plan on dying just yet.

393

How dare you run off like that!

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,083
You scared us!

397
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,291
I think that means
you scare too easy.

398
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,958
But. Shut up!

399
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,958

Look at that.

[KANATA] You know what
that means, dontcha?

405
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,250
We're ready to go win a
few ranked matches now.

You bet we are!

Whoops, it looks like
I'm a little tardy.

409
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,333
[YURI]
Hello, Kanata.

410
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,916
Hey, what's up, Yuri?

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,333
I'm here to see
if your students

412
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,875
have actually
learned anything.

413
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
You'd better be
doing a good job.

414
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:18,583
[KANATA] Hmm. You seem to be
in a particularly pleasant mood.

415
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,541
Are you sure there's
nothing else going on?

416
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,875
[gasps] I don't know
what you're talking about.

417
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,583
And anyway, Kanata.
I thought all the E-Rank teams

418
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,208
were supposed to be helping
evacuees during the raid.

419
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,041
So how did you end
up hurting yourself?

420
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
I dunno.

421
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958
Maybe I tripped and
fell while running away.

422
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,625
You know, you have always
been a terrible liar.

Don't be surprised
whenever we win.

[AMIE]
We demolished them!

435
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,750
Yeah, and we
weren't even trying.

436
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,375
They're a disgrace
to the Sky Wizards.

437
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,083
Well. We're losers.

438
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,375
I can't believe it.

439
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,750
This must have been
your fault, I was perfect.

[YURI]
Hmph. So, Instructor.

What were you just saying about
how good your fireteam is?

Well, you know.

443
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,583
Uh, maybe they could use a
little more training, after all.

[laughs]

445

Thank you.

[CHLOE]
So, what happened?

448
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,208
Did the supervisor
sign off on your idea?

449
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,666
Yes.

450
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,250
We can now accelerate the
Sky Wizard training program

451
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,708
and more thoroughly
evaluate our students. So...

452
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,416
It's time. For the
tournament to begin.

[MISORA]
Hey Rico, exactly how much

454
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,083
are you able to see
with your Clairvoyance?

455
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,375
[RICO] Hmph. Well, I can see
that the panties you've got on

456
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,000
under your uniform have
ruffles and bows all over them.

457
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,708
[MISORA]
What? Hey! Stop looking!

458
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,083
Close your eyes or something!

[RICO chuckles]
Just joking.

460
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,958
I can see for extreme
distances in every direction,

461
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,625
but not through solid objects.

462
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,666
[MISORA] So, you were just
guessing about my underwear?

[RICO] Yes, but who
knows what'll happen

464
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,875
as my skills improve.

465
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,250
[MISORA]
Seriously?

is "Mistgun Tournament."
