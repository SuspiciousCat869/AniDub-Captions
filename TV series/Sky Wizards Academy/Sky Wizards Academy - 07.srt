[LLOYD]
Lloyd here.

00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,916
Last time, my team of S-Rankers
and I tried our best

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,250
to protect Mistgun from
a Devil Beetle invasion.

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,000
But when a strange
Chimera showed up,

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,166
someone else in the city
took the monster down.

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,625
I don't know what
happened exactly,

7
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,375
but I'd bet my buddy
Kanata's somehow involved.

[MISORA panting]

[yells]

11
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,500
[MISORA] Quit moving,
you stupid balloons!

12
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,208
Hey, Rico. Help me out here!

13
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,583
--What're you doing?!
--[RICO hums]

14
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,083
Maybe if you didn't fly
around so erratically

15
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,666
you would have better aim.

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,916
You should be able
to handle them.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,583
Rico! Quit gawking at
yourself and cover me!

18
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,750
[RICO] That's no way to
talk to a supreme being.

19
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,125
[LECTY]
Misora... Uh, uh!

20
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,458
I'd help but...

21
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,291
[screams]

22
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,583
[MISORA] I'm the leader and
I'm giving you an order!

23
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,958
[LECTY]
Please don't fight, you two!

24
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,791
We're supposed to be
working together...

25
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,666
[RICO] You need to
get up to my level!

26
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
[FREON]
Kanata Age's fireteam

27
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,416
hasn't made any progress
since he took over.

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,750
[CHLOE sighs]
I'm afraid that's true.

29
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,666
They still haven't been able
to break their losing streak.

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,458
[FREON] The reports indicate
the abnormal Chimera

31
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,458
was not destroyed by your team.

32
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,208
Are you certain that you
had nothing to do with it?

33
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,666
Definitely not, ma'am.

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,708
We could see the
resulting explosion,

35
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,250
but none of us were there.

36
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,541
We owe our lives to whoever
killed the beast. So naturally,

37
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,541
Kanata is now claiming that
his fireteam was responsible.

38
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,916
Like I'd believe that.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,666
Uh!

40
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,208
[FREON]
Because of this,

41
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,041
he says his fireteam shouldn't
be held accountable for the

42
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,000
considerable collateral
damage they caused

43
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,333
the day of the attack.

44
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,333
[CHLOE] So, what did you
say about these claims?

45
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,416
[FREON] The only thing I
could do was laugh at him.

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,791
He has no evidence or
eyewitnesses to the event.

47
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,875
But one thing's for certain.

48
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,791
They destroyed an entire city
block trying to fight the bugs.

49
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,625
Due to this and their
previous failures,

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:16,083
I've decided it may be best
to disband Fireteam E601.

51
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,041
[LECTY whimpers]
I'm starting to think

52
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,333
we're getting in a little
over our heads here.

53
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,541
Hey, Rico! You gotta cover me!

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,500
It's the only way we're gonna
get ourselves outta this mess.

55
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,625
[RICO]
Do you really think

56
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,166
I'm in the position
to snipe anything?

57
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,958
Though I could probably
put you out of your misery

58
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,541
if I tried hard enough.

59
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,958
[MISORA] Don't you even think
about firing that weapon at me!

60
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,875
[LECTY] I can't take any
more of this, you guys.

61
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm really getting worried here.

62
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,916
[MISORA]
Butt out, Lecty!

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,166
I guess it's about time for
me to end this exercise

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,333
so we can move on
to the next one.

65
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,125
[CHLOE] If his fireteam's
disbanded, what'll Kanata do?

66
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,166
Obviously, he'll be
relieved of duty.

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,125
Do you have a problem with that?

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,791
[YURI] You're making
the right decision.

69
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,625
[FREON]
Mm?

70
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,833
But, Yuri...

71
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,500
A traitor shouldn't be
leading Sky Wizards.

72
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,916
Who knows what lessons he's
actually teaching those girls.

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,708
[FREON]
Chloe.

74
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,750
I know this might be hard for
you since you recommended him,

75
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,041
but please bring Kanata to
my office this afternoon.

76
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,041
[CHLOE sighs]
Okay.

77
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,375
So is that it?

78
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,625
You called this meeting
just to talk about Kanata?

79
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,291
Because if I were
a guessing man,

80
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,333
I'd say you've got something
else on your mind.

81
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,666
[FREON] How adept of you.
Let's talk about this.

82
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,166
[MISORA]
Ow! What's goin' on back there?

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,291
Man, It hurts!

84
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,166
I'm bruised all over!

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,208
Huh? That's because your
movements lack grace.

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,541
Look at Lecty's skin.

87
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,791
[LECTY gasping]

88
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,750
Hey, stop. It tickles
when you do that.

89
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,750
[RICO] She doesn't
have a scratch on her.

90
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,041
Well, if you had just
covered me like I asked

91
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,000
this wouldn't be a problem.

92
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,500
But my pain aside,

93
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,791
the real issue is why no one
recognizes that we took down

94
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,833
that weird Chimera and
totally saved Mistgun!

95
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,791
They should be throwing
us a parade!

96
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,208
Misora has a point.

97
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,250
It's high time this city
started celebrating

98
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,041
its most divine citizen.

99
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,708
Huh? Think about it.

100
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,375
Nobody was around
to see you girls

101
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,958
fighting the Devil Beetles.

102
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,791
It's no surprise they
don't believe you.

103
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,791
What?! Who cares who saw it?

104
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,416
You used that weird power that
made you fall out of the sky--

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,375
[grumbling]

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,958
So, you're saying you
feel unfulfilled?

107
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,333
I guess...

108
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,750
What about you, Kanata?

109
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
Don't you want some credit
for what you did?

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,708
Nah. I don't care what other
people think about me.

111
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,666
Well, Anyway, check this out.

112
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,291
Doesn't it sound like it's
gonna be a good time?

113
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,416
[RICO]
The Mistgun...

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,416
[LECTY]
...Tournament?

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,958
[AMIE] All fireteams are
eligible to join the competition

116
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,416
except for those designated
as Special Teams.

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,375
Whoa, look at that
prize package!

118
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,125
The winning team moves
up two whole ranks!

119
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,541
And that's not all.

120
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,000
The last team standing
gets cutting-edge gear.

121
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,166
Unique weapons specially made
by the Alchemy division!

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,291
Plus a year of free food at all
the restaurants in Mistgun!

123
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,291
Ah! Think of all the desserts we
could eat if we come out on top!

124
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,250
[STUDENTS cheer]

125
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,250
You brought everyone in the
city joy. I'm proud of you.

126
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
I'll give my all to
win the tournament.

127

[STUDENTS cheering]

128
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,708
[GIRL A]
She's so superior!

129
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,750
It's only natural
that I should win.

130
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,333
[STUDENTS cheering]

131
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,541
You're a far better
Sky Wizard than I am.

132
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,250
There's never been a leader
as good as you, Misora!

133
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,708
You've done it.

134
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,708
The student has surpassed
the instructor.

135
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,916
We have to win this
thing no matter what.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,666
[GIRLS laughing]

137
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,583
So you're into it?

138
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,541
[GIRLS]
Huh?

139
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
Well, guys?

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,208
Um. I don't know if
it's possible for us

141
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,750
to beat all the other
fireteams in the academy.

142
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,291
We still have to try, though!

143
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,708
Yeah, she's right.

144
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,791
We have to at leasts
see how far we get.

145
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,083
Well, then. I suppose I'm in.

146
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,916
Without me watching your backs,

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,500
you mortals won't make
it past the first round.

148
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,375
[KANATA] All right, great.
That settles it, then.

149
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,583
I'll start filling out the
application right away.

150
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,541
So... You mean
you're firing me?

151
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,958
It's my only option.

152
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,916
Your fireteam has
shown no improvement,

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,791
and this morning's
training was a disaster.

154
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,250
Not only were they sloppy,

155
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,750
but the girls spent
most of the time

156
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,916
fighting amongst themselves.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,416
[KANATA] Hm. Sounds like you've
been watching us closely.

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,750
[FREON]
That's my job.

159
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,708
Disbanding fireteam E601

160
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,750
is simply the most
logical thing to do.

161
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,375
They don't seem very motivated
anyway, so what are they losing?

162
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,250
You're wrong.

163
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,541
Say what you want,
but I'm not going.

164
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,375
You see, I've still got
a lot to teach them.

165
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,541
[FREON]
What are you saying?

166
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,166
Exactly what it sounds like.

167
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,916
I signed on to make
them better Sky Wizards.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,500
And so, I'm not giving
up until those girls

169
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,916
are the best fighters
you have at this school.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,250
Oh, don't make me laugh.
You are a traitor.

171
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,375
What on earth could you possibly
have to offer our students?

172
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,708
You may have come with
Chloe's recommendation,

173
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,500
but I still have serious
doubts about your--

174
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,041
You can keep your doubts, Freon.

175
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,375
I don't need your approval.

176
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,625
I only care what three
people think of me.

177
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,791
And those three are
Misora, Lecty, and Rico.

178
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,458
That's nice and all, but
I don't really believe it.

179
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,791
Don't worry. No one really
expected much from any of you.

180
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,333
[KANATA] But if we
win the tournament,

181
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,666
everyone will have
to respect us, right?

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,541
That's the deal.

183
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,875
[laughs]

184
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,750
No chance in hell.

185
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,416
The best of the best will
be in this tournament

186
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,916
and your three girls
can't compete.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,958
They're all hopeless. They can't
even beat other E-Rankers.

188
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,583
Care to make a bet, then?

189
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,041
[FREON]
Uh?

190
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:42,625
[FREON laughs]

191
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,416
[RICO]
Report.

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
Yeah. What's she saying?

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,333
It's kinda hard
to hear. Be quiet.

194
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,291
[FREON] ...though I've decided
to disband your fireteam,

195
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,250
I'll reconsider if...

196
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,583
She wants to
disband our team!

197
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,666
She what?!

198
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,333
No! We can't let that happen!

199
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,958
Well, maybe there's something
we can do to stop this.

200
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,958
Let's keep listening.

201
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,666
[GIRLS gasping]

202
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,708
Hello, ladies.

203
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,208
[GIRLS laugh]

204
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,833
[RICO] Why was she talking
about disbanding our fireteam?

205
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,166
On what grounds?
We deserve to know!

206
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,333
[KANATA]
Listen, girls.

207
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,083
Eavesdropping's a
really annoying habit.

208
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,125
The best thing you can do now
is to forget what you heard.

209
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,541
Wait. Come back!

210
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,750
Yeah, tell us what's
going on, Kanata!

211
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,250
[RICO]
Hmph.

212
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,916
[KANATA] Wow, everyone
looks so depressed today.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,625
[LECTY]
Why aren't you more upset?

214
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,291
[MISORA] Seriously, if
what we heard is true

215
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,416
our team is doomed.
They'll kick us out.

216
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,791
[KANATA] All right, so what
are you gonna do about that?

217
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,583
We can't disband.

218
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,708
I want this fireteam to be
the strongest it can be!

219
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,291
Maybe Freon will reconsider

220
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,250
if we prove ourselves
in the opening match!

221
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,291
Yeah! She'd have to, right?

222
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,916
Being a divine goddess,

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,875
I don't really need
this silly fireteam.

224
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,125
But, if you two
insist on fighting,

225
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,625
I suppose I could play
along and help you out.

226
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,875
[KANATA] I'm glad to see we're
on the same page for once.

227
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,458
Try not to let yourselves get
freaked out by the stakes.

228
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,125
All you have to do to
continue your training

229
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,416
is show them you can win.

230
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,541
No pressure.

231
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,791
[MISORA] What do ya
mean no pressure?

232
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,875
You're kidding us, right?

233
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,625
[LECTY]
This is the worst.

234
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,250
I know how this looks.

235
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,916
We don't have any wins yet.

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,125
You're the lowest-ranked
team at school.

237
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,458
That's helpful.

238
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,291
You sure do know how to
bring down a room, Kanata.

239
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,416
This tournament is a gift to us.

240
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,541
Previous rankings don't matter
so we start with a clean slate.

241
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,375
This is your chance
to start from scratch

242
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,875
and prove yourselves.

243
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,333
[MISORA]
Sure. I guess.

244
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,791
[KANATA]
That's all for today.

245
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,666
Tomorrow we're starting
a new training regimen

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
so make sure you get
a good night's sleep.

247
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,541
I'm gonna put you girls
through the ringer.

248
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,833
You're gonna hate me
when I'm through with you.

249
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,000
[MISORA]
You're just leaving?!

250
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,041
[LECTY]
Shouldn't we train more today?

251
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,083
[KANATA]
Oh, by the way. Don't forget.

252
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,041
The opponents for the first
round are being chosen tomorrow.

253
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,791
Make sure you're there
to get matched up.

254
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,208
Later!

255
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,541
[FREON]
This is it.

256
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,416
[FREON] I'm sure you've
heard rumors about the labs

257
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,166
where we study Devil Beetles.
Hopefully this tour will give

258
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,916
you a better understanding of
our efforts to defeat the enemy.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,250
[LLOYD] Is it true they're
dissected down here?

260
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,416
[FREON]
Certainly.

261
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,041
You likely saw the results
of such research

262
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,541
in your Hostile
Organisms classes.

263
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,583
[YURI] Yeah, it was almost
more than I could swallow

264
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,541
when I was a prep student.

265
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,125
[CHLOE] But why are you
showing us all this now?

266
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
[FREON] You're still against the
idea of the Mistgun Tournament,

267
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,250
right Chloe?

268
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,333
[CHLOE] Well, yes.
I think it'll only serve

269
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,791
to agitate rivalries
between fireteams.

270
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,416
But what does that have
to do with anything?

271
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,708
[FREON]
Here we are.

272
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,083
[REAL]
Welcome to the lab, everyone!

273
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,125
We've been expecting you.

274
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,750
[REAL]
Ah...

275
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,000
Hosting the Sky Wizards
division lead is an honor.

276
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,666
All of us are thrilled.

277
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,083
Let me introduce the
others. Some of our best.

278
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,875
Oh, I already know who you are!

279
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,416
Special Duty team S-128.

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,875
The highest-ranked Sky Wizards
in the entire academy.

281
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,291
The powerful Chloe Sevigny.
Mr. Lloyd Alwyn.

282
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,291
Hello.

283
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,833
It's very nice to meet you.

284
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,083
[REAL]
And of course...

285
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,333
Nice to see you again,
Miss Yuri Flowstruh.

286
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,708
Uh!

287
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,250
Oh, please forgive me for
running into you that day.

288
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,583
I hope I didn't end up
ruining your pants.

289
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,833
Ah! I'm so delighted that you
remember talking to me!

290
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,833
Seriously! Ah. I have
something... uh... for you!

291
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
Uh. Please.

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,250
Just show us the sample.

293
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,000
Of course! Right this way.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,333
[LLOYD]
What is that?

295
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
[CHLOE]
A Chimera shard?

296
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,333
[FREON] I'm still not sure
who took this monster down.

297
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,791
It appears to be larger than
a normal Chimera Deneb.

298
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,458
We don't know much about it.

299
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,208
But we've given the species the
codename "Chimera Antares."

300
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,791
[FREON] It's not just bigger
than the typical Chimera.

301
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,875
Watch what happens when
trauma is inflicted on it.

302
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,583
[CHLOE, YURI, LLOYD gasp]

303
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,291
[REAL chuckles]

304
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,041
--[YURI, CHLOE] Mm?
--[LLOYD] Uh?

305
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,916
It regenerated itself.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,375
This specimen is truly
an amazing discovery!

307
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,833
The Chimera is
continuously rebuilding.

308
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,458
We've got infinite samples
now! Just think of it.

309
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,125
This could lead to cutting
edge breakthroughs

310
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,791
in regenerative medicine!

311
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,125
And not to mention--

312
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,166
That'll be enough.

Oh, yeah!

318
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,208
I saw your interviews in "The
Monthly Mistgun" the other day.

319
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,250
It got me wondering...

Tell me, Miss Yuri.

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,583
Is it true you're only
interested in dating men

Huh? Oh. Um, I guess.

Yeah. It does seem
to be the case.

325
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,958
Well, I'll keep
that in mind.

326
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,666
Maybe this means I should
start hitting the gym myself.

Do you understand now?

00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,041
Our enemy is evolving
at an alarming rate.

331
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,000
We need more Sky Wizards
who are strong enough

332
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,791
to stand against
the Devil Beetles.

333
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,791
So that's it. That's the reason
behind the tournament.

Yes.

awfully pale, Yuri.

Uh. Yeah, I'm all right.

337
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,916
I think I just need a little
fresh air after that.

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,250
I know. The stench in
that place was repulsive.

an informative field trip.

there is one more thing.

I need you to handle.

win this whole thing.
