1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,291
[CHLOE] Chloe here,
talking to Kanata about his,

2
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,208
uh, special fireteam.

3
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,083
Let's hear about Lecty's
"Eisenach Twin Swords"

4
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,000
[KANATA]
They're super powerful,

5
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,708
and her family's namesake.

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,166
[CHLOE]
Very interesting!

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,791
What can you tell us about
Misora's Magic Cannon Sword?

8
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,791
[KANATA] She can use it to
slash or shoot her enemies.

9
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,458
It's a hardcore,
multi-purpose wonder weapon.

10
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,416
[CHLOE]
Fascinating!

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,833
And what about Rico?

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,875
What can she do?

13
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,125
[KANATA]
Good question.

14
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,916
[FREON] How long to do
you plan on staying in bed?

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,583
At this rate you're
going to be tardy.

16
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,041
Again.

17
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,541
I don't know what
to do with you.

18
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,916
[yawns]

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,875
Time is a worry
for common mortals,

20
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,208
not a goddess like me.

21
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,000
How many times must I tell her?

22
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,666
I shouldn't have to abide by the
rules of her silly academy.

23
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,375
[chuckles]

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,375
[RICO humming]

25
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:23,916
[gasps]

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,250
[STUDENTS chattering]

27
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,291
[BOTH gasp]

28
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,125
Forget our normal table.

29
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,166
[BOY STUDENT B]
Yeah, I wouldn't want anyone

30
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
to think that we're
friends with a traitor.

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,166
I've gotta say,
you've impressed me, Kanata.

32
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,125
No one's said that
to me in a while.

33
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,708
Don't tell me you've actually
found someone who respects you.

34
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,291
What a joke.

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,750
After all, you're probably the
most hated person in Mystogan.

36
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,625
How does that feel, by the way?
It must be torture.

37
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,916
[KANATA] These are
the opponents my girls

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,208
are facing in their next match.

39
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,625
Fireteam E-571, huh?
They're fierce.

40
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,000
Everyone's expecting them to
shoot up the ranks in no time.

41
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,833
Hey, you can't
just ignore me!

42
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,250
Your fireteam is totally
screwed, you know.

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,875
Not only were they
crappy to begin with,

44
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,708
now they're being
taught by a traitor.

45
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,625
The whole school's laughing
about how pathetic they are.

46
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,041
Fine, let 'em laugh
all they want.

47
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,000
That way it'll be even sweeter
when my fireteam destroys them.

48
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,000
I hope you're not feeding
those lost causes this kinda BS.

49
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,541
They don't deserve
to be lied to.

50
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,958
Yeah, That would be cruel.

51
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,041
But, I really do
believe in them.

52
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,791
Maybe that's all they need.

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,833
[gasps]

54
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,166
[gasps]
Well. For their sakes,

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,916
I hope you actually know what
you're talking about for once.

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
Hey, just leave her to me.

57
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll go make sure she's okay.

58
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,500
[KANATA] Regardless of what I
say, we're not winning anything

59
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,833
without the missing
piece of the puzzle.

60
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,416
[RICO scoffs] I didn't realize
you were eating for two.

61
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,541
Oh hey, how's it going, Rico?

62
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,958
[RICO] I'm late to school due
to a celestial disturbance.

63
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,958
[KANATA]
Of course you are.

64
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,333
[RICO]
It couldn't be helped.

65
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,375
One moment I was showering,
and the next,

66
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,833
an ethereal beauty
appeared before my eyes.

67
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,583
A being of
otherworldly radiance.

68
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,625
[KANATA]
Huh?

69
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,750
Did you see a ghost
or something?

70
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,791
[chuckles]

71
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,541
[RICO] Actually, it turned
out I was just looking

72
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,958
at my own reflection
in the bathroom mirror.

73
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,375
[KANATA] I'm legitimately
concerned for you.

74
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,708
It shouldn't surprise you.

75
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,291
There's no one in
the world as beautiful

76
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,416
as I am so it makes
sense I'd be infatuated.

77
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,583
[laughs]

78
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,083
I finally figured it out!
You're trolling me, right?

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,500
[laughing conitnues]

80
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,041
[CROWD laughs]

81
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,375
[GUY] What kind of loser
calls herself a goddess?

82
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,958
[GIRL A]
I guess she's cute. Kinda.

83
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,000
[GIRL B] Maybe. But she's
nothing compared to her sister.

84
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,250
[gasps]
Jerk.

85
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,541
[RICO]
Who are they?

86
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,750
[KANATA]
These are your next opponents,

87
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,500
and they're not going
to go easy on you.

88
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,875
If Misora and Lecty can learn
something from their lessons

89
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,000
we might actually have
a fighting chance.

90
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,333
But not without you.

91
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,750
Before you go on,

92
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,625
know that I have no intention
of training with you.

93
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,541
All right. I can't
force you to, after all.

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,041
I'm glad you finally
got the point.

95
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,708
The beautiful and
divine were not made

96
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,916
to sweat and toil
alongside mortals.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,958
Hmph.

98
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,208
[LECTY whimpers]
No.

99
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
Please, I don't
think I can take it.

100
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,375
[MISORA] Just sit still.
It'll all be over soon.

101
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,375
[LECTY]
I'm really nervous! Yeah, okay.

102
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,833
But please, be gentle
with me, Misora.

103
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,541
[MISORA] I will.
All right here I come.

104
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,416
[whimpers]

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,583
I didn't realize
it'd be so cold!

106
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,333
[MISORA]
You're good.

107
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,208
Turn around.

108
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,541
It's your turn to do me, now.

109
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm on it!

110
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey. Have you noticed that
Kanata's training exercises

111
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,375
have gotten a lot
harder lately?

112
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,416
[MISORA gasps]

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,666
They've been tough.

114
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,666
But I can tell our work
is starting to pay off.

115
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,208
I can feel myself
getting stronger

116
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,208
and my skills are
improving each day.

117
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,541
You know what I think?

118
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,708
We might have a chance at
winning our next match!

119
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,333
I feel the same way, but Rico.

120
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,958
[BOTH sigh]

121
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,250
[knocking]

122
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,666
[BOTH]
Hm?

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,083
[KANATA] Knock, knock!
Cover up you two, I'm coming in.

124
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,208
[BOTH yelp]

125
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,166
You stay outta here,
you big creep!

126
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,416
[KANATA]
Don't flatter yourself.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,291
You're too young for me.
I was just thinking that

128
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,916
since you girls have
been working so hard,

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
I'd treat you to some
ice cream as a reward.

130
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,125
If you're interested.

131
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,583
[LECTY]
Ice cream!

132
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,375
[MISORA] Sorry, but we've
got important lady business

133
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,000
to take care of right now!

134
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,000
[LECTY gasps]

135
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,458
If we're gonna win
this next match,

136
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,625
we've gotta talk to Rico and
get her back in the game.

137
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,958
[LECTY]
But ice cream.

138
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,958
For crying out loud,

139
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,333
I'll get you some
ice cream later.

140
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,166
[LECTY giggles]

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,416
[RICO]
So, what do you want?

142
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,125
My time is far too precious.

143
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,458
It shouldn't be
wasted by plebeians.

144
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,375
Fine, then I'll get
straight to the point.

145
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,666
Rico, we want you to begin
training with Kanata.

146
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,041
Aren't you fed up with
always being called a loser?

147
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,291
We've got to start
winning matches!

148
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,958
In order for that to happen,

149
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,541
we need to work together
as a real fireteam.

150
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,750
[LECTY sighs]

151
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,708
[RICO] Lecty gave me
this same pitch earlier,

152
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,000
but I'm afraid the
answer is still "no."

153
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,333
Don't think this has
anything to do with you.

154
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,583
As a supreme being,

155
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,791
I simply have nothing
to gain from training.

156
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,791
But I don't think
that's true, Rico!

157
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,458
Kanata's helped us, and I bet he
can teach you something new too.

158
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,041
[MISORA] I honestly hate to
admit it, but Kanata may be

00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,625
The move you taught Misora.

375
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,750
Is it supposed to be
the "key to victory"

376
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,583
that you offered to her before?

377
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,666
Yup.

378
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,083
[RICO]
I understand that it's powerful,

379
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,958
and if Misora can
master that ability,

380
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,625
she'll be a formidable
opponent on the battlefield.

381
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,000
But that doesn't matter.

382
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,625
It's not going to help you
win the upcoming match.

Yeah?

384
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,166
You see, I noticed
a flaw in your plan.

385
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,583
That special move takes
a long time to charge up,

386
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,458
which means Misora is
wide open for an attack.

387
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,375
To use Strike Blaster,
you'd need a skilled Vanguard

388
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,166
and a Rear Guard to
protect Misora while--

389

That's correct.

Your analysis of the
plan is totally right.

command my divine powers?

Besides, what you told Misora.

402
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,958
She's supposed to hold the
power to win this, isn't she?

403
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,416
Oh, um. Did I not mention that?

404
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,833
There are actually
multiple keys to victory.

You, Misora, and Lecty
are my three keys.

The only way you'll
overcome your opponents

00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,250
[KANATA] Couldn't this
have happened after we'd

478
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,416
already won the match?
Damned beetles.

479
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,166
[YURI] Chloe, our enemies
are attacking the city!

480
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,166
[CHLOE] Look, those are
Archenar class drones,

481
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,250
the smallest Devil
Beetles we know of.

482
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,500
They attack in swarms,

483
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,916
so it's easy to be
overcome by their numbers.

484
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,791
Then there's the Procyon class
which is one step bigger.

485
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:52,958
[YURI]
That's great info at all,

486
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,208
but maybe we should
get out there and

487
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,875
start fighting before
they destroy everything!

488
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,458
[CHLOE]
You're right! Sorry!

489
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,541
Next time: "The Skies, Taken."
Be sure to watch as I take out

490
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,250
the enemy and save the
Sky Wizards of Mystogan!

491
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,625
[YURI] That's it, no more
episode previews for you!

492
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,250
[CHLOE]
Aw...
