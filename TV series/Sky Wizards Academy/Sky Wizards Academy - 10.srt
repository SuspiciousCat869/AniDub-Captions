1
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,166
[CHLOE]
You're living in the same house

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,291
as your three
super-cute students?

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,916
Oh, Kanata, you pervert!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,875
[KANATA] I'm actually not living
there. It's just the girls.

5
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,833
[CHLOE] And what's this I
hear about you showing up

6
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,125
with Yuri unconscious
in your arms?

7
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,750
[KANATA] Chloe, you know
I was just trying to help!

8
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,000
[CHLOE]
And I can only imagine

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,875
the kind of lessons
you're teaching!

10
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,333
[KANATA]
This is how rumors get started.

11
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,541
[MISORA] Out of all
the places in this city,

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,666
you had to bring
her to my room?!

13
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,250
Um. Technically this
is our room, Misora.

14
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,208
I see.

15
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,583
You've kidnapped the instructor

16
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,708
of our biggest
tournament rivals.

17
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,416
It's an interesting strategy.

18
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
[KANATA]
Hm?

19
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,208
She's here because I didn't want
to keep her alone in my room.

20
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,875
Hey, where.... am I...?

21
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,041
Where's that creep?!

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,000
[KANATA]
Oh, good, you're awake.

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,166
[MISORA screams]

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,916
[KANATA]
He-Hey, what are you doing?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,375
[MISORA] What the heck
is the matter with you?!

26
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,000
--Give her some dignity!
--[KANATA] Uh...?

27
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,500
[LECTY screams]

28
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,000
[YURI]
But! What?! How?

29
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,083
Why am I naked?!

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,416
Ah! You... didn't see
anything, did you?

31
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,625
[KANATA chuckles nervously]

32
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,208
--[YURI gasping]
--[MISORA growls]

33
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,958
[ALL gasp]

34
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,416
I'll murder you and
then shoot myself!

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,083
I can't live with
this embarrassment!

36
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,166
Just Calm down, Yuri! Dammit.

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,125
Why is there a gun in the
bed in the first place?!

38
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,416
As someone whose divine
beauty inspires mortals

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,666
to follow her, I keep the
gun close for self-defense.

40
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,541
That way I can keep stalkers
like Misora from molesting me.

41
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,500
I am not a stalker!

42
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,916
I was only following you that
day 'cause Kanata told me to!

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,625
Hey, why do you look
so scared of me, Lecty?

44
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,333
[KANATA]
Relax. I wasn't even in the room

45
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,833
when the girls took
your uniform off.

46
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,083
[YURI]
Really? You promise?

47
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,291
[GIRLS]
Mm-hm.

48
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,000
Trust me, you needed
them to clean you up.

49
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,166
What you were wearing
couldn't be saved.

50
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,416
[YURI]
Mm... Thanks, then.

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,958
Do you swear on your life
that you didn't peek?

52
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,541
[MISORA]
Uh!

53
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,666
[KANATA]
Uh.... [chuckles]

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,541
[MISORA]
You're a disgusting pig!

55
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,041
He saw everything, didn't he?

56
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,541
--[KANATA] Hey, stop hitting me!
--[MIORA] ...scumbag!

57
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,541
[LECTY whimpers]

58
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,625
[KANATA] Uh. I'm gonna pop
out for a bit. Be right back.

59
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,666
[GIRLS]
Uh!

60
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:00,541
[ALL]
Hold on!

61
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,416
[LECTY]
Wait!

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,625
--[YURI cries]
--[ALL gasp]

63
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,125
[MISORA]
Um, by the way, Miss Yuri.

64
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,916
Thanks for saving Kanata.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,583
[RICO] He told us
about how you protected

66
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,125
him from the phantom attacker.

67
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,291
That man sounds like
quite an opponent.

68
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,750
Ha! You're an S-Ranker who
lives up to her reputation.

69
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,833
[YURI]
Well... That's kind of you.

70
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,791
Um, here are some clothes
for you to borrow.

71
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,375
They're mine so I hope
that they fit you all right.

72
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,625
They might be kinda
baggy up top, huh?

73
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,333
Thanks for
taking care of me.

74
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,250
Sorry for being such a nuisance
and ruining your night.

75
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,791
So, I take it that all three
of you live here, then?

76
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,333
The whole team?

77
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,333
[MISORA] Well, yeah,
but only starting today.

78
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,083
[LECTY]
It was Kanata's idea!

79
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,291
What?! He's making
you live together?

80
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,875
That's our instructor for you.

81
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,250
His training exercises

82
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,500
and demands have become
especially grueling.

83
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,375
Uh! Hey, You can't complain!

84
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,500
You didn't lift a finger to help
us clean up this nasty place!

85
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,041
Uh! The two of you mortals

86
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,500
should consider
yourselves fortunate

87
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,166
to have served as handmaidens
to a goddess such as me.

88
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,291
I'll accept your gratitude
whenever you're ready.

89
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,541
[MISORA, LECTY gasp]

90
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,958
Oh, right! Thanks for
letting us serve you!

91
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,416
Do not bow to this lunatic!

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,458
[LECTY] Uh! I'm sorry!
Now I'm confused!

93
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,666
--[YURI laughs]
--[MISORA gasps]

94
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,166
I'm not laughing at you.

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,625
Kanata used to make
me do weird stuff, too.

96
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,333
Sometimes I was
sure he was crazy.

97
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,625
[MISORA]
Seriously?

98
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,875
So he's always been
a nut job instructor.

99
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,000
Miss Yuri, what kinda
stuff did he make you do?

100
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,250
Uh! Oh! That was
a long time ago.

101
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,250
There's no need to talk
about all that right now.

102
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,875
[RICO] So did you two
have a relationship?

103
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,291
[ALL gasp]

104
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,958
[YURI] No! It wasn't like
that. Can we just drop it?

105
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,791
You don't have to
tell us, Miss Yuri!

106
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,666
[RICO]
You're not very convincing.

107
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,541
[KANATA] Seems like you're
all getting along just fine.

108
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,958
Never mind that, just
where did you run off to

109
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,333
in the middle of the night,
leaving us here by ourselves?

110
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,875
I had to go pick
something up real fast.

111
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,333
You'll have to forgive me. Here.

112
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,625
For you, Yuri.

113
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,666
[YURI]
Uh?

114
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,750
[YURI]
What am I looking at, here?

115
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,291
[KANATA]
It's a good luck charm I got

116
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,375
from that cream puff vendor we
used to go to all the time.

117
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,625
If you're ever in trouble,

118
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,833
you just have to hold
on to it really tightly.

119
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,083
[YURI] Huh? I'm not gonna put
much faith in a random trinket

120
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
you bought from
some street vendor.

121
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,416
Why would you go out of your way
to get me something like this?

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
'Cause I like you,
I thought that was obvious.

123
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,291
[BOTH]
Huh?!

124
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,875
How can you even say that
while keeping a straight face?

125
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,708
You're the worst!

126
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,125
'Kay.

127
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,166
But whenever you're in a pinch,
just look at that cow.

128
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,416
Maybe it'll help you remember
what I taught you.

129
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
[gasps]

130
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,500
[MISORA]
Uh!

131
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,750
[MISORA]
Forget Yuri.

132
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,583
You still haven't explained
what we're doing here!

133
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,500
What are you talking
about, Misora?

134
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,166
You haven't told us
why you forced us

135
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,500
to move in together.

136
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,625
How is this supposed
to make us stronger?

137
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,875
[KANATA]
Oh, didn't I mention--?

138
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,500
No, of course you didn't!

139
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,875
[KANATA chuckles]

140
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,416
[KANATA]
Uh-oh,

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,541
now you're gonna find out what
happens to naughty students

142
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,125
who interrupt their instructors.

143
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,166
Ah! Get your dirty hands
off of me, Kanata!

144
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,416
[KANATA]
Whoa, you should really start

145
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,541
using some conditioner
or something. [laughs]

146

[ALL laughing]

147

[MISORA]
I've been too busy!

148
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,916
[KANATA]
These split ends are terrible.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,875
[MISORA] Since when
are you a hairstylist?!

150
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,750
[KANATA]
Uh?

151
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,500
Hey, you okay, Yuri?

152
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,916
Yeah. Of course I am.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,208
I'm just done playing.
That's all.

154
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,333
--[LECTY, MISORA] Huh?
--[KANATA] Mm?

155
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,666
[YURI] Thank you for
taking care of me,

156
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,875
that was kind.

157
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,666
But this doesn't mean

158
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,250
that my team will take it easy
on you in the tournament.

159
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,333
We will defeat you. I'll
make sure of that personally.

160
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:25,958
[gasps]

161
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,041
[whimpers]

162
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,916
--[YURI] Excuse me.
--[door closes]

163
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,750
Yuri seems so sure
they'll beat us.

164
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,666
Is it possible for us to keep
the team from disbanding?

165
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,333
I didn't put
E601 together

166
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,125
just so a stuck-up
S-Ranker could end it,

167
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,000
I won't let that happen,
no matter what!

168
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,583
[RICO]
This is all very interesting,

169
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,541
but more importantly,
I'm starving.

170
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,125
[BOTH gasp]

171
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,416
[MISORA] Could you please take
our future seriously for once?!

172
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,916
You know, if they
get rid of our team

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,666
you get kicked out
of school, too.

174
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,333
I can't care about anything
on an empty stomach.

175
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,375
[MISORA] Uh! You have got
to stop being so selfish!

176
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,958
Actually, I'd be happy to cook
us some food if you want.

177
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,750
What?

178
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,208
[laughs]

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,541
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

180
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,500
[LECTY] I learned a few
things at the café.

181
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,416
Unlike a certain scantily clad
bunny I could point out.

182
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,625
[MISORA]
Uh!

183
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,541
I'm just throwing something
easy together.

184
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,958
So I hope you're both
okay with noodles!

185
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,541
[MISORA]
Are you sure those are done?

186
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,000
The package says they should
cook for a little while longer.

187
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,625
You're not the
chef, so shut up.

188
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,083
Lecty, I trust your judgment.

189
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,458
Thanks!

190
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,208
When the noodles are
slightly undercooked,

191
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,500
it means that they're
served "al dente."

192
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,333
[LECTY giggles]

193
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,083
[MISORA gasping]

194
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
[RICO, LECTY, MISORA]
Thank you for this food!

195
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,875
Holy crap!

196
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,166
You really do know how to cook,
Lecty, this is delicious!

197
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,375
[LECTY] Thank you!
I'm so glad you like it!

198
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,250
In fact, you can
cook for me any time

199
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,708
you want to, okay?

200
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,500
A bold demand coming from
someone who didn't help out.

201
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,250
You know, you just stood
by and watched her

202
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,958
do the work, too,
"your majesty."

203
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,750
Huh. Then I'll do my part.

204
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,541
Observe as I show you
a culinary secret weapon.

205
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,541
Are we about to get in a fight?

206
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,083
This is a heavenly ingredient

207
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,750
that will dramatically
improve any plate of food.

208
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,000
Though some people just call
it Worcestershire sauce.

209
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,083
Wait! No, don't!

210
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,208
You went and ruined
all my yummy noodles!

211
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,666
--Here, let me have a taste!
--[MISORA] Uh?!

212
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,166
Mm! Wow, it's wonderful!

213
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,666
[MISORA]
Huh?

214
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,125
[LECTY] I had no idea that sauce
would be so good on pasta!

215
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,375
How did you know?

216
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,125
Well, I'm a goddess,

217
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,625
so, I possess a highly
sophisticated palette.

218
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,916
I know which ingredients

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,541
can assist a dish in
achieving maximum flavor.

220
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,250
I admit that it's good.

221
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,458
But how could you just blindly
shove it in your mouth

222
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,833
without any hesitation?

223
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,500
Rico can seem kinda strange

224
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,666
because of the way she
talks on occasion,

225
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,583
but I have faith that
she's always thinking

226
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,208
of our best interests.

227
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,291
[MISORA]
Uh...

228
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,875
Really? You think
I speak strangely?

229
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,125
[LECTY] Oh, no, that
was just, um, a joke!

230
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,041
Heh, heh, heh.

231
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,166
You're not much
of a comedienne.

232
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,125
[LECTY giggles] Yeah, I
guess I'm not very funny.

233
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,125
[RICO]
You haven't thanked me

234
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,625
for sharing my
secret ingredient.

235
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,291
[LECTY]
Thanks!

236
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,208
You must use this...

237
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,375
[MISORA]
I don't believe it.

238
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,916
Is it possible that I'm the one
who's holding the team back?

239
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,166
Strike-y-strike... Blaster.

240
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
[LECTY grunting]

241
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,416
[MISORA grunting]

242
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,458
[gasps]

243
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,625
[MISORA sighs]

244
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,416
[MISORA]
Ow!

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,166
Oh no, did you cut yourself,
Misora? Are you okay?

246
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,125
[yawns] Oh, come on.

247
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,833
I mean, It's obvious that
attacking in the third formation

248
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,541
would improve our odds
by fifteen percent.

249
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,208
I just don't understand it.

250
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,000
[RICO sighs]

251
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,541
Hey guys, dinner's ready!

252
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,250
'Kay!

253
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,750
The threat of the Devil
Beetles is increasing

254
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,625
with each passing day.
That's why we're here.

255
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,208
I'm holding this competition
to forge stronger warriors.

256
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,625
Wizards. I declare that
the Mistgun Tournament

257
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,958
has officially begun!

258
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,208
[CROWD cheers]

259
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,041
[ANNOUNCER A] The competition's
rules are simple.

260
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,333
If a fireteam's leader is
knocked out during a match,

261
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,000
that team loses.

262
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,125
Winners will advance
to the next round.

263
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,333
Good luck, and may the
best fireteam win!

264
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[KANATA] Our first match
isn't until tomorrow,

265
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,583
so you've got some downtime.

266
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,916
Welp.

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,500
You girls make sure to get
plenty of rest tonight.

268
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,708
[LECTY laughs]

269
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,875
Kanata doesn't appear
to be too concerned

270
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,083
about tomorrow's match.

271
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,208
He's not someone who
loses his cool easily.

272
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,000
[MISORA] You two are acting
pretty calm yourselves!

273
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,625
Don't forget if we
mess up tomorrow,

274
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,791
we're totally finished!

275
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,500
--[LECTY whimpers]
--[RICO exhales]

276
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,375
You simply can't
comprehend it.

277
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,500
Maybe it's time we give
up on this and move on.

278
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,916
[MISORA gasps]

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,791
Why not focus on getting
a good night's sleep instead?

280
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,916
[MISORA]
Shut up! I can do this!

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,333
[LECTY] Rico! Misora! I think I
might have broken the bathroom!

282
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,333
I was just trying
to run a hot bath.

283
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,208
[RICO] You've broken the
generator for the water heater.

284
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,208
[MISORA] Wait a sec! I can fix
this hunk-a-junk, no problem!

285
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,875
You really think so, Misora?

286
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,000
Sure! We had the same
model back at my house.

287
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,500
--[MISORA grunts]
--[LECTY] Ah!

288
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,833
Just watch and learn, ladies.

289
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,958
[RICO, LECTY gasping]

290
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,916
[LECTY screaming]

291
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,625
Told ya I'd fix it, huh?

292
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,416
Perhaps you should've
thought this through.

293
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,541
Using your magic on the machine.

294
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,250
You just don't have
the finesse for it.

295
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,583
[MISORA]
Huh?!

296
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
But she did get
it to work again!

297
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,125
No. She managed to make
the problem even worse.

298
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,625
[LECTY, MISORA gasp]

299
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,375
[RICO] That jumpstart completely
fried the generator's core.

300
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,000
There's no way any of us
are taking baths now.

301
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,541
[MISORA]
Aw...

302
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,625
Well if that's the case,
then I've got an idea!

303
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,416
[sighs]

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,416
[LECTY] Uh! Rico!
Your body is so perfect.

305
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,666
I can't believe it!

306
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
The word you're looking
for is heavenly.

307
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,791
I hope Misora's not too jealous
of my voluptuous curves.

308
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,708
[growls]

309
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,083
[LECTY gasps]

310
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,333
Um, so.

311
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,291
It turns out living together
is kind of fun, isn't it?

312
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,500
Wouldn't you both agree?

313
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,291
Yes. I suppose
it could be worse.

314
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,750
And thanks to Misora,

315
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,000
the three of us get to have
a nice long bath to relax

316
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,375
before tomorrow's big match!

317
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,041
Misora's brute strength does
have a few advantages.

318
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,041
[LECTY]
Uh. Yeah, it is a skill...

319
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,291
Now you're just
mocking me!

320
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,750
I can tell that you both
think I'm the weak link.

321
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,083
But I'll prove to you this team
would be nothing without me.

322
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,666
So you both passed his test.

323
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,000
Well good for you,

324
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,333
let's throw you a freakin'
parade or something.

325
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,625
--What are you saying?!
--Misora stop!

326
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,000
What? I bet you don't even
care if we get disbanded.

327
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,541
Do you have any
idea how it feels

328
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,458
to have teammates who don't
take things seriously?

329
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,458
[LECTY] But Misora, of
course we care about you.

330
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,333
[MISORA]
I need to go.

331
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,583
[RICO, LECTY]
Uh!

332
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,000
[LECTY]
Do you think she's okay, Rico?

333
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,833
[MISORA]
I'm the worst leader.

334
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,791
Lashing out at the
rest of my team.

335
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,833
All because I'm scared that
I won't be good enough

336
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,791
for us to win.

337
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,958
[KANATA] I guess there's
not much of an audience

338
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,875
for matches between
two E-Ranked teams.

339
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,875
So, how has it been living
with the other girls?

340
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,041
All it's really done is made
me feel like a failure.

341
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,125
I'm dragging them down.
I'm a bad leader.

342
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,041
They'd probably win if they had
someone else on their team.

343
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,958
But Rico and Lecty both seem
to know something that I don't!

344
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,416
All I want is to make
sure that I get stronger!

345
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,833
[KANATA] Are you sure you're
not being too hasty?

346
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,000
Keep your eyes open.

347
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,708
[MISORA]
Huh?

348
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:01,916
Maybe there's
something within you

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
that you just haven't seen yet.

350
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,291
Wait, what does
that even mean?

351
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,083
[ANNOUNCER A] We'll begin the
second match in Block D shortly.

352
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,583
[KANATA]
Make me proud.

353
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,541
[MISORA gasps]

354
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,875
[LECTY gasps]

355
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,750
[AMIE] The losers of the
Effed-Up Fireteam again?

356
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,125
Lucky us.

357
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,375
This'll barely even be a
warm up for the next match.

358
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,875
We might as well
start celebrating

359
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,416
our victory right now.

360
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,958
[ALL gasp]

361
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,666
Just a few minutes
and it'll all be over.

362
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,166
The traitor and his
misfits are finished.

363
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,000
Traitor or not, remember this
is Kanata you're talking about.

364
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,458
Chronos has abilities you
shouldn't underestimate.

365
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,750
He's got a knack for
defying the odds.

366
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,500
Lloyd's right, Ma'am.
Kanata never gives up.

367
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,083
Even when defeat seems certain.

368
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,750
[whistle blows]

369
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,166
[ANNOUNCER A] The tournament
match has now begun!

370
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,416
First strike's mine!

371
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,666
Misora!

372
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,958
[MISORA] I have to prove
that I'm strong enough

373
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,916
to protect my teammates
and win this!

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,416
[MISORA]
Taste my Strike Blaster!

375
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,708
[MISORA]
They dodged it?!

376
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,916
If you wanna score a hit,

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,250
you'll have to be a
little less predictable.

378
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,208
Now, Coela!

379
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,166
[COELA]
Roger that!

380
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,875
[COELA grunting]

381
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,708
These are light attacks,
but she's overwhelming me!

382
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,500
[BEACH] Watch your
back pathetic weakling!

383
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,416
Ha! It is not over
yet, you loser!

384
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,291
Silly little girl, thinking
she could attack

385
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,750
three real Sky Wizards all
alone and stand a chance.

386
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,916
[MISORA]
I'm a real Sky Wizard, too!

387
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,041
[gasps]

388
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,833
Rico? Lecty? [gasps]

389
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,458
You stay back here, Misora!

390
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,333
This is our job.
Let us handle it, okay?

391
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,625
[gasps]

392
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,333
[LECTY]
All right, Rico, I'm going in!

393
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,000
[RICO]
I've got you covered!

394
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,833
[groaning]

395
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,708
[MISORA]
I knew it.

396
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,166
I'm just getting in the way and
holding my teammates back.

397
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,375
Are you sure you're
not being too hasty?

398
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,625
Just keep your eyes open.

399
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,916
Maybe there's
something within you

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
that you just haven't seen yet.

401
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,333
[gasps]

402
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,833
Twin Sword Style!

403
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,250
She's way too fast!

404
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,375
You left yourself
wide open. Idiot!

405
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
You're mine! [grunting]

406
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,500
Hate to break it to you,

407
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,375
but that Wizard is
protected by a goddess!

408
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,208
No way. When did
these morons learn

409
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,333
to coordinate like
an actual fireteam?

410
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,208
This isn't over yet!

411
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,583
If we can take out their
leader, the match is ours!

412
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,041
All we have to do
is get by these two!

413
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,541
[LECTY]
Not gonna happen!

414
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,041
[yells]

415
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,958
[RICO]
They're on the defensive.

416
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,666
If we continue with
these steady attacks,

417
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,208
eventually we'll wear
them down enough to win!

418
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,708
[MISORA] When did they get so
good at fighting together?

419
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,375
It's almost as if they're
anticipating each other's moves!

420
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750
Uh!

421
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:14,000
You're not the chef, so shut up.
Lecty, I trust your judgment.

422
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,541
Thanks!

423
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,625
Wait! Don't!

424
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,958
[RICO]
This is a heavenly ingredient

425
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,708
that will dramatically
improve any plate of food.

426
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,125
Wow, it's wonderful!

427
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,416
I trust Lecty.

428
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
I have faith in her!

429
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,625
[MISORA]
Uh...

430
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,333
[MISORA] I kept thinking
that I had to get stronger

431
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,125
so I could protect the others
and defeat our enemies myself.

432
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,333
But my friends are
powerful and brave.

433
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,208
I should've been
learning to trust them.

434
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,166
To rely on my teammates
when I needed help.

435
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,041
[KANATA] Switching positions
on the battlefield,

436
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,666
living together, even
following each other around.

437
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,416
All of these things were meant
to bond you girls as a team.

438
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,125
[MISORA] Right. I know what
I need to do to help us win.

439
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,250
Misora's brute strength does
have a few advantages.

440
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,250
Yeah, it's a skill that the
two of us sure don't have!

441
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,208
[MISORA]
They're right!

442
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,625
[AMIE grunting] Where is that
huge swell of magic power

443
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,208
in the arena coming from?

444
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
Amie! Look below us!

445
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,416
Huh? Uh?

446
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,333
[AMIE]
What the hell is that?!

447
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,583
[COELA]
Whatever it is,

448
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,291
it's way more powerful
than her last shot!

449
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,625
Misora's got it!

450
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,500
[AMIE]
Oh crap, run away!

451
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,708
[LECTY]
There's no retreating!

452
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,208
It took that stubborn
peasant long enough

453
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,416
to figure out her role
on our fireteam.

454
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,458
Now you're dead.

455
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
[COELA groaning]

456
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:38,833
This is it. All of my magic
power channeled into one shot.

457
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,583
I could never beat
them on my own.

458
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,500
But luckily for me,
I don't have to.

459
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:50,666
This is what happens when
our fireteam works together!

460
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,958
You did a great job Misora.
You passed this test.

461
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,333
[MISORA gasping]

462
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,041
[ANNOUNCER A]
And that's the match!

463
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Fireteam E601 is the winner!

464
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,166
[MISORA]
We did it!

465
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,375
It's our victory?

466
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,041
The first of many!

467
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,916
I couldn't have done
it without you!

468
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,708
We finally won, we're
not losers anymore!

469
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,375
It seems my perfection

470
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,583
has finally rubbed
off on you two.

471
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,958
We won. We won!

472
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,583
We've still got many
victories ahead of us.

473
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,125
[KANATA]
So, what'd you think?

474
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:56,416
[CHIMERA A]
Do it, Real. Use me more.

475
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,375
[REAL]
Yes! Give me your power!

476
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,583
[REAL]
I'm almost there. So close.

477
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,666
Soon I'll be strong enough for
your love. Watch, you'll see.

478
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,166
I'm coming for you, Yuri!

479
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,708
[REAL screams]

480
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,125
[MISORA] Misora here to tell
you about the Artemia dorm.

481
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,125
This residence hall is
divided up by gender,

482
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,083
and while the girls' rooms
have smaller kitchens,

483
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,000
they're actually a little bigger
overall. It's not so bad!

484
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,250
[RICO]
Yeah right,

485
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,958
maybe when there's only
one girl living there.

486
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,000
[MISORA]
Uh!

487
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:52,958
[RICO]
Poor Lecty's stuck with you

488
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,375
'cause you blew up your house.

489
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,041
How long before you reduce
the entire dorm to rubble?

490
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,333
[MISORA]
Uh! Uh...

491
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,875
Um, let's talk about the
next episode instead!

492
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,708
[RICO] It's called,
"The Finals, And..."

493
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,458
[MISORA] Couldn't you at
least let me say the title?

494
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,375
It's been a hard
day for me, Rico!
