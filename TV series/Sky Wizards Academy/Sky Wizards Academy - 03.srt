00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,083
[LECTY]
Oh, uh, hello!

2
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,958
This is Lecty Eisenach and...

3
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,833
I guess I should
tell you that, um,

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:37,291
my Fireteam got a new
instructor. And also...

5
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,083
Oh my gosh, I'm out
of time already?!

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,750
But I didn't even mention the
fact that he's a total pervert!

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,666
[KANATA]
I think they've caught on.

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,791
[KANATA] Today we start your
individual training regimens.

9
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,166
I want to warn you up front:

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,000
these aren't gonna
be easy assignments.

11
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,666
You've all got a lot of work
to do if you want to improve.

12
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,583
[RICO]
Heh. Sorry to disappoint you,

13
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,583
but I'll be sitting
this one out.

14
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,583
I don't train.

15
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,875
Uh?

16
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,416
[LECTY whimpers]

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,083
You kids have fun,
I'll see you later.

18
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,541
Hey, You can't just
walk out of class, Rico!

19
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,208
[KANATA] Well, we can't
force her to stay.

20
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,833
[MISORA]
Why not?!

21
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,166
Ignore her.

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,291
The real question is will
you be able to complete

23
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,875
your own special training?

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,708
I'm ready for any challenge!

25
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,791
Just tell us what to do!

26
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,208
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,875
[LECTY]
Um, are you still there Kanata?

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:22,166
I put on the costume
you picked out for me.

29
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,125
[LECTY]
Ah! Stop!

30
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,208
Don't stare at me with that
dirty look in your eyes!

31
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,958
Whoa, Lecty. You look amazing.

32
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,958
Thanks, but I don't
feel comfortable

33
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,625
showing this much skin.

34
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,583
Plus, our fireteam doesn't
have a big budget.

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,500
I don't think we should be
wasting money on this.

36
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,958
[KANATA] Ah. Let your instructor
worry about the finances.

37
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,166
This is an important
part of your training.

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,375
If you say so...

39
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,750
[KANATA]
Here. Catch.

40
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,250
[yelps]

41
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,916
[KANATA] Your mission is
to hand out all the fliers

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in the bag while
wearing that outfit.

43
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,625
[LECTY]
What?!

44
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,041
[KANATA]
Hm? I thought I told you that.

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,208
Um, no, you definitely
did not tell me!

46
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,916
Where should we
go for lunch today?

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,375
Oh, I dunno, what
do you feel like?

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,166
[LECTY]
Um, hi...

49
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,833
[LECTY whimpers]

50
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,250
Uh. Excuse me.

51
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,458
What did you say?

52
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,625
--[LECTY] Um. Well, I...
--Do we know her?

53
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,791
[GIRL STUDENT A]
I don't think so.

54
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,208
[GIRL STUDENT A]
She looks kinda familiar.

55
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,666
[GIRL STUDENT B] If by familiar,
you mean super weird.

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,083
I think she was crying.

57
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,208
[GIRL STUDENT A]
Let's go.

58
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,375
What should we do now?

59
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
I'm thirsty.

60
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,000
That's because of all
the short skirts out.

61
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,500
[BOYS laugh]

62
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a maid outfit.

63
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,166
I must be dreaming.

64
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,291
Man, she's got a big ol' bow!

65
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,041
[LECTY gasping]

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:55,583
[BOYS chattering]

67
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,791
What'd she just drop?

68
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,500
Oh... Would... Would
you please take one?

69
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,958
What is it for?

70
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,166
[LECTY] Please, just
take the fliers and go!

71
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,666
[ALL]
Huh?

72
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,416
[BOY STUDENT B] Uh! We can get
some free food with these!

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,833
[BOY STUDENT A]
Whoa, this hottie just made me

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,666
the happiest boy in Mystogan!

75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,500
Thanks a lot. See you around.

76
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,333
I did it. That was easy!

77
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,125
[KANATA] Your task is
to find Rico's weakness.

78
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,708
Huh?!

79
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,125
Everyone's got a dirty little
secret or two that can be used

80
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,625
against them by their enemies.

81
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,750
Rico acts like she doesn't
care about anything,

82
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,625
but I bet you can figure out
what makes the girl tick.

83
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,375
[MISORA]
You've got to be kidding!

84
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,083
Rico might not be my favorite,
but I'm not gonna be

85
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,166
--a total creep and--
--Shh!

86

--[MISORA muffled shouting]
--[RICO humming]

87
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,250
[KANATA] Your target
almost identified you.

88
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,333
[MISORA]
Kanata, you're groping me!

89
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,583
[KANATA]
Hm?

90
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,083
Sorry, didn't realize
I was touching you.

91
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:20,375
Uh?! Ah! 'Scuse me?!

92
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,458
What are you insinuating?!
That my boobs are so small

93
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,000
you didn't even notice
you were touching them?

94
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,208
Well?! Is that it?!

95
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,666
Rico's getting away.

96
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,875
Better go after her.

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,583
[gasps, growls]

98
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,416
Why are you following me around?

99
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,625
[MISORA]
How'd you notice me?!

100
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,708
I was being super sneaky

101
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,458
and moved like a
ninja the whole time!

102
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,666
[RICO]
Ahem.

103
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,375
Don't tell me you've
fallen under the spell

104
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,416
of my divine beauty.

105
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,916
[MISORA]
Um, actually, I was, uh--

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
[RICO]
Oh, spare me your life story.

107
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,833
Commoners do the strangest
things when they're bored.

108
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,666
[MISORA] Uh, yeah, you're
right, it was totally boredom!

109
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,458
Of course.

110
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, if you'll excuse me.

111
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,166
I'll be spending the rest of
the day shopping till I drop.

112
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,750
[MISORA]
Oh, well if that's the case.

113
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,416
Maybe I could go
shopping with you

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,125
as some kind of team
bonding thing?

115
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,833
Hey, what did you
do that for, Rico?!

116
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,583
To make sure you
weren't an imposter

117
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,625
or some creep using
an illusion spell.

118
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,500
Since when are you interested in
what I do outside of school?

119
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,541
Uh...

120
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,333
[RICO sighs] Whatever,
mortal. You can come along.

121

them all out already?

Yeah! I'm finished!

126
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,875
At first I was super
nervous, but, you know,

127
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,458
the more fliers I passed out,

128
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,333
the easier it was
to talk to people.

129

[KANATA] All right, then it's
time for your next task.

I can work at a busy café!

Based on what we've
encountered in the field,

it looks like the Archenar

[REAL] Really, I'm fine.
It was my fault, too.

160
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,000
Go ahead. Your
friends are waiting.

161
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,666
[YURI] Thank you very much.
Again, I'm so sorry!

162
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,000
Yuri, is it?

163
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,500
Oh.

164
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,291
[CLERK] Can I get anything
else for you today?

165
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,291
No, that's all.

166
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,291
Okay!

167
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,125
You read philosophy books?!

168
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,583
How are you not bored to tears
every time you open one up?

169
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a shame you can't see

170
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,958
the beauty in pursuing
truth and knowledge.

171
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,791
Maybe one day you
won't be so childish.

172
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,083
Yeah, I'm the childish one...

173
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,875
[RICO] Come along. There's
still more shopping to do.

174
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,583
[gasps] But we've hit
almost every store!

175
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,958
[gasps]

176
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,708
Aw! They're so cute!

177
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,958
I wanna take 'em all home!

178
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,875
Whoa, I didn't peg
you as the kind of girl

179
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,375
who geeks out over cute things.

180
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,625
Uh! Uh, I'm not. I'll take
those bags from you, now!

181
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,958
I just remembered that I have
somewhere else I need to be.

182
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,291
Time is precious, you know.

183
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,333
We have to make the most
of it before it runs out.

184
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,166
[exhales] I wonder if
liking stuffed animals

185
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,250
can be considered a weakness?

186
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,041
[LECTY]
Um. I'm sorry.

187
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,125
Could you please, uh,
repeat your order?

188
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,333
[CUSTOMER D]
Huh? What'd you say?

189
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,916
You, uh, said
you want, uh...

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,375
Oh, I think we both
know what I want.

191
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,833
[BOYS laugh]

192
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,625
[CUSTOMER D] How much would
you say to get her on the menu?

193
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,000
--[BOYS chatting, laughing]
--[LECTY whimpers]

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,291
[LLOYD] She's one of the girls
from Kanata's fire team.

195
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,541
I'm not cut out for this
kinda stuff. I'm just not.

196
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,958
[MISORA]
Hey, Lecty?

197
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,250
[LECTY gasps, whimpers]

198
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,166
What are you doing
sitting out here?

199
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,333
[whimpering]

200
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,250
[MISORA]
Uh? What's wrong?

201
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,166
[LECTY]
Misora, help me!

202
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,000
--[MISORA yelps]
--[LECTY cries]

203
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,208
[MISORA]
Are you feeling better now?

204
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,000
[LECTY]
I think so.

205
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,416
[MISORA] How is this supposed
to make you a better Sky Wizard?

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,583
You mean you didn't have
to wear anything weird

207
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,500
for your special training?

208
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,666
Uh? Well, no, but it was
strange in a different way.

209
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,958
[laughs]

210
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,666
[LECTY]
Oh, I see.

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,083
If there's anything I
can do to help you out

212
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,333
with this, don't hesitate
to let me know, okay?

213
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,416
D'ya really mean it?

214
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,000
[STUDENTS chattering]

215
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,166
[MISORA] This isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

216
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,500
[LECTY]
We can switch,

217
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,458
but these are the only two
costumes Kanata bought.

218
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,958
Ugh! This is why that perv

219
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,875
shouldn't be in
charge of our money!

220
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,250
Excuse me, could you
take our order now?

221
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,083
Oh! Coming!

222
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,125
[LECTY gasps]

223
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,500
[MISORA]
Welcome to the café!

224
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
I think I'm just gonna
start out with an iced tea.

225
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,916
One iced tea coming up!

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,916
What do you want?

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,708
I'll take the iced
coffee, please.

228
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,750
[MISORA] And one
iced coffee. Sure thing!

229
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,375
[STUDENTS laughing]

230
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,125
[LECTY whimpering]

231
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,083
[LLOYD] Excuse me. Could I get
a little more water over here?

232
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,333
Yes! Of course!

233
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,083
[LLOYD] It can be tough
talking to people, huh?

234
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,958
[gasps]

235
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,791
[LECTY]
Oh, I'm so sorry about that!

236
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,958
The things that
you're afraid of,

237
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,125
they can hold you back,
but you can overcome them.

238
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,166
Uh!

239
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,750
[LLOYD]
Try not to worry so much.

240
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,458
And trust your instructor.

241
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,333
My... instructor?

242
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,791
Just look at your friend.

243
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,625
Maybe you can find some of
her confidence in yourself.

244
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,125
[LECTY]
Uh...

245
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,541
[MISORA] Okay, so that's an
iced tea and hot dog combo.

246
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,750
Can I have the bunny, too?

247
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,583
Sorry, we don't serve rabbit.

248
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,041
[STUDENTS laugh]

249
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,791
[MISORA] Two orders of
curry, comin' in hot!

250
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,625
I've got waters all around!

251
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,041
[CUSTOMER J]
Hey, little cotton tail!

252
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,000
[MISORA] One sec!
I'll be right with you!

253
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,500
[CHEF]
Take this to table seven.

254
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,000
[MISORA]
Not a problem!

255
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,958
Here you go, boys! I hope
you enjoy your meal.

256
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,958
Oh, yeah. Can I get
a coffee, please?

257
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,125
Of course! I'll be
back in a jiff!

258
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:52,875
[LECTY] Wow. She's working
so hard to help me.

259
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,125
You're right, Mister, thanks for
the pep talk! I think I'll...

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,708
[CUSTOMER AA] Excuse me, Miss?
Could I get a refill over here?

261
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:09,041
[LECTY]
Uh? Oh, well, I, um... Uh.

262
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,208
[LECTY]
C'mon, you can do this, Lecty.

263
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,000
Just be confident like Misora.

264
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay! Coming! [laughs]

265
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,916
The academy's head supervisor
is coming tomorrow.

266
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,500
Oh. Hello, ma'am.
Nice to see you.

267
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,000
What's this crowd doing here?

268
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,625
[LECTY]
Uh. Welcome to the café!

269
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,916
Um. Have you had enough time
to look over today's specials?

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,666
Okay, here's your
hot lunch combo!

271
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,958
[CUSTOMER L]
Excuse me, Miss?

272
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,166
I'm on my way!

--[MISORA laughs]
--[CUSTOMER H sighs]

274
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,375
[CUSTOMER M] I'd like the
pasta and the pudding.

275
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,041
You got it! That'll
be out super-fast!

276
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,458
I've got one iced tea
and one iced coffee.

277
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,125
[CUSTOMER M]
Can I get some service here?

278
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,666
Uh! Yeah, I'll be with
you in one second!

279
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,208
I'm just gonna leave these
dishes up here, okay?

280
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,958
And I need one more lunch combo.

281
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,083
Comin' right up!

282
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,458
[LECTY laughs]

283
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,083
Here's your spaghetti
special and an iced coffee.

284
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,791
All right, I've got
a beef stroganoff!

285
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,208
Hot and ready for
table number eight!

286
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,541
What's up with you, Lecty?
You're so into this, now.

287
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,416
I've got you to thank for that.

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,250
What'd I do?

289
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,500
Well, whatever it is, keep
up the good work, okay?

290
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,000
[LECTY]
I will!

291
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,083
Hey, isn't that the maid-girl

292
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,875
who was passing out
fliers earlier?

293
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,375
[FREON]
Interesting.

294
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,416
I wonder what else that traitor
has hidden up his sleeve.

295
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:37,166
[MISORA] What kind of messed-up
lesson was that supposed to be?

296
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,458
Come on, Lecty.

297
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,625
Tell him about how
uncomfortable that made you.

298
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,791
[LECTY]
Mm... Well, I don't...

299
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,291
Kanata.

300
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,750
Did you know that I have a
problem talking to strangers?

301
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,833
Like, social anxiety.

302
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,833
Listen up, Lecty. You've
got a long road ahead.

303
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,750
Training in the art of the
Magic Twin Sword is difficult.

304
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,500
Especially if you plan on
mastering the Eisenach style.

305
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,708
[gasps] But my family's
known for it.

306
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,583
[MISORA gasps]

307
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,166
[LECTY sighs]

308
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,625
[KANATA] Only those
who've devoted themselves

309
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,333
to their craft and have
proven themselves

310
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,875
in battle can live up
to the Eisenach name.

311
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,333
When we played tag yesterday.

312
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,208
I could tell that you had
skills, but you didn't have

313
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,625
the self-confidence to
put up a real fight.

314
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,625
You couldn't even
look me in the eyes.

315
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,708
If you wanna become a
successful Sky Wizard,

316
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,666
you're gonna have to
overcome that kind of doubt.

317
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,416
[LECTY]
Uh... Well, I...

318
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,208
I've never been able
to look someone

319
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,583
I didn't know in the eyes,

320
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,208
or do things that put me at
the center of attention.

321
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,875
I just get so nervous that
I'll do something stupid

322
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,833
and embarrass myself
or my teammates.

323
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:38,916
[MISORA]
Uh!

324
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,583
[LECTY] I hate myself
for feeling that way,

325
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,916
but I can't help it.

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,125
And thinking about it just
makes everything worse.

327
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,708
That's why I'm here.

328
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,916
To teach you that it's perfectly
normal to feel anxious.

329
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,291
Now you know what you need to
do. Learn to trust yourself.

330
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,125
You have to realize that
all of us make mistakes.

331
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,583
The trick is to learn from them.

332
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
[gasps] Got it!

333
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,791
You know, you make a
pretty good waitress.

334
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,416
It tickles whenever
you pet me, Misora.

335
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,833
By the way, thank
you for helping me.

336
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,916
[MISORA] Huh? All I
did was run food.

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,750
You inspired me to be like
you and try my hardest.

338
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,875
Even though I was scared
that I'd mess up.

339
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, yeah. Misora. How'd
your special training go?

340
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,541
[gasps] To be honest,
I totally bombed.

341
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,916
I was with her for hours
but didn't find a weakness.

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,291
It was kind of
surprising, though.

343
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,291
I found out that she reads
books about philosophy.

344
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,208
And that she likes
cute things, too.

345
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,708
[KANATA]
Good, you made progress.

346
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,125
[gasps]

347
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,791
[LITTLE BOY A]
Thank you.

348
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,250
[MISORA] Hey, weren't you
listening to a word I said?!

349
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,875
I totally blew my
secret mission!

350
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,125
[BOTH]
Huh?!

351
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,166
Here's your reward for
working so hard today.

352
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,583
You earned it.

353
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,500
[LECTY gasps]
Ice cream's my favorite!

354
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,958
[MISORA]
Is this a trick?!

355
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,375
Wow, It's really good!
Hey, wait a minute!

356
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,416
Before today, I hardly
knew anything about Rico,

357
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,583
much less her weaknesses.

358
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:22,083
And I didn't know Lecty freaked
out about crowds and strangers.

359
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:26,375
I suck. I'm a total failure
as a team leader.

360
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,666
But now you know what areas
you need to improve upon.

361
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,875
I'd call that success.

362
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,708
[gasps]

363
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,458
[KANATA] Lecty, I expect
you to keep training

364
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,583
as hard as you did today.

365
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,375
Yes! Definitely!

366
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,916
And I'll do my job by
continuing to stalk Rico.

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,958
[KANATA]
Huh?

368
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,250
Or not...?

369
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,291
[KANATA] The point of your
training today was to discover

370
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,833
what your own weaknesses
were, not Rico's.

371
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,000
Now that you know your
shortcomings as a leader,

372
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,833
we can focus on fixing them.

373
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,541
[gasps, growling]

374
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,791
Didn't I explain that?

375
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,625
[MISORA] Uh! No, you
most certainly did not!

376
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,666
[LECTY gasping]

377
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:17,375
[MISORA cries]

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,208
You know, Chloe.

379
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,458
You can't just float in here
whenever you want.

380
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,833
This is the guy's
dorm, after all.

381
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,166
Come on, Kanata.

382
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,500
You know this reminds you
of the good old days.

383
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Huh? Is that the girl who was
dressed in the bunny suit?

384
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,291
[KANATA]
Yeah, her magic power reserves

385
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,416
are higher than those
of most A-Rankers,

386
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,708
but her potential is
totally wasted because

387
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,416
she has no talent with a sword.

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
Well. You're the master
instructor now,

389
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,416
so how are you gonna whip
this wizard into shape?

390
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,958
[KANATA]
Mm...

391
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,916
[MISORA]
What did you just say to me?

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,625
[KANATA] You're switching from
vanguard Magic Cannon Sword

393
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,041
to middle guard Magic Cannon.

394
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,833
Your magic power reserves and
flying abilities are impressive,

395
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,291
but they're going to waste.

396
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,375
This is the best way to
make use of your talents

397
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,875
and allow you to
reach your full potential.

398
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,708
In the end, this change
will make both you

399
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,666
and our fireteam much stronger.

400
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,125
[MISORA]
There's no way I can do that!

401
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,291
I don't care if you
think it's best for me.

402
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,708
I am not switching
to another weapon!

403
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,708
[KANATA]
Stop being such a selfish brat.

404
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,791
The Magic Cannon Sword
is too unbalanced

405
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,250
and difficult for a beginner.

406
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041
Not to mention it's obsolete
as a weapon against the--

407
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,958
I am not being selfish!
I'll train harder if I have to.

408
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,875
But I'm telling you right now
that I'm sticking with my sword!

409
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,083
I understand that you might not
be happy about my decision.

410
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,000
But at this point, no
amount of extra training

411
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,125
is going to help you improve.

412
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,000
You know, I feel so stupid.

413
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,291
What are you getting at?

414
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,416
For one second
there I was happy!

415
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,833
I thought you might actually
be a decent instructor!

416
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,666
You... You think
you're so smart,

417
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,500
but you don't know the
first thing about me!

418
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,541
I'm outta of here!

419
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,750
[LECTY]
Misora, wait!

420
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,583
[LECTY] Oh, uh, hello, this
is Lecty the maid again!

421
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,083
I'm in charge of this part
of the show today so. Uh.

422
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,416
Um... Oh! This is Freon Flamel.

423
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,708
She's the leader of the
Sky Wizards division.

424
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,125
She's super important here,

425
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,125
and never looks like
she's having any fun.

426
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,750
Also, I don't think she
likes Kanata very much.

427
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,250
Wait, now that I think about it,

428
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,833
isn't her last name
the same as...

429
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,916
[RICO] More importantly,
the next episode is

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,416
"The Unforgettable Past."

431
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,041
I'll be gracing you with my
divine presence once again.

432
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,958
[LECTY]
Hey, Rico, that was my line!
