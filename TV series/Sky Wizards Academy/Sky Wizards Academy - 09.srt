1
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,500
[MISORA] How am I supposed
to focus on training

2
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,208
when Kanata is out
spending time with Yuri?

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,583
Not that I care.

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,083
[LECTY]
Um, I guess it is kinda weird

5
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,000
that he was out with
a rival instructor.

6
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,916
But I did get cake out
of us following them,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,291
so is it really such a bad thing
that they were on a date?

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,083
[MISORA]
A date?! Stop saying that!

9
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,250
We don't know it was a date!

10
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,500
[RICO]
If you two don't stop

11
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,208
thinking about our pervy
teacher and desserts,

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,750
we're never going to
win the Tournament.

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,541
[MISORA, LECTY]
You're right...

14
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,791
Stop right there.
Strike Blaster.

15
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,291
[gasps]

16
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,208
Uh...

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
[MISORA]
We won the tournament.

18
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,875
[LECTY yawns]

19
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,708
[KANATA]
Hey, nice pace, there, Lecty!

20
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,750
Kanata! I didn't know
you ran here, too!

21
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,958
Usually this path is pretty
empty in the mornings,

22
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,416
why are you up so early?

23
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
I try to get a good
jog in every day.

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,958
That's what I call discipline.

25
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,250
Good for you, I was afraid
Misora had woken you

26
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,375
with her snoring
or something.

27
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,708
Actually she talks in her sleep.

28
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,416
At least she's not sleep-
casting Strike Blasters.

29
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,541
That girl's already
destroyed one home

30
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,583
because she wasn't
paying attention

31
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,333
to where her attacks were aimed.

32
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,291
That's a sore subject.

33
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,625
[LECTY]
Um, since we're both out here,

34
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,375
there's something I
wanted to ask you.

35
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,333
Have some.
You gotta stay hydrated.

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,083
Uh. Sure...

37
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,041
[KANATA] So you're
wondering how, exactly,

38
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,708
the current training regimen
is helping out the team.

39
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,458
Yeah.

40
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,458
[LECTY] I guess I understand
what you're trying to do

41
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,416
by switching up our roles.
You think we might work better

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,083
as a team if we've trained
in each other's positions.

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,291
But...

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I just don't think
this plan will work!

45
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,875
Misora's a really
great Sky Wizard,

46
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,583
but her skills don't make
her a very good vanguard.

47
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,666
And since my melee weapons
don't have much range,

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,250
I feel like I can't
help at all when

49
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm stuck as the rear guard!

50
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,125
I don't wanna fail.

51
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,083
[gasps]

52
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,375
You're paying attention.

53
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,875
Excellent work.

54
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,875
Um, Kanata, you do realize
that you're petting me, right?

55
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,708
You've got a good
point about Misora.

56
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,083
She's not exactly great
in that position.

57
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,500
Does that mean you're
gonna rethink

58
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,958
the training and we can--

59
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,000
[KANATA] I don't think so.
But you're on to something.

60
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,458
In fact, you're close to
understanding my plan.

61
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,041
Honestly, I'm kinda impressed.

62
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
[LECTY] So there is a
point to all of this?!

63
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,583
Yeah, of course there is.
Do you want a hint?

64
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,458
[LECTY]
Huh...?

65
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,625
Ah!

66
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,000
Aw! Why does this
keep happening?!

67
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,250
You're sure you don't mind
taking her on again?

68
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,666
[laughing] Not at all.

69
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,375
I don't think anyone in
the Logistics division

70
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,583
would turn down a request
from you, Kanata.

71
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,375
[MALE WORKER B] The workflow
changes you suggested

72
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,750
have made us super-efficient!

73
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,958
[FEMALE WORKER A]
And thanks again for clearing up

74
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,500
that dispute with our supplier.

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,166
We're fully stocked now!

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,166
[MALE WORKER B]
Heh.

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,458
[KANATA]
Later!

78
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,125
[KANATA] Hey, you'd better keep
your head in the game, Lecty.

79
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,125
The lunchtime rush
here can be a warzone.

80
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,708
[LECTY whimpers]

81
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,291
[BOY STUDENT A] Hey, can I get
some service over here, please?

82
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,666
Do you have any new
specials today?

83
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,333
Can I get the lunch combo
with a side salad?

84
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,791
Um. Let me just write
that down, okay?

85
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,041
[LECTY panting]

86
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,583
Sorry to bother you,

87
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,125
but can I please get another
order of the soup of the day?

88
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,541
[CHEF A] Hot bowl a' stew,
comin' right up!

89
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,958
[exhales]

90
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,125
[STUDENTS chattering]

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,583
Oh, wow.

92
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,375
The wait staff works together
like one big machine.

93
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,541
[GIRL STUDENT C]
Excuse me! I'm ready!

94
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,000
Thanks for waiting, miss.
And what can I get for you?

95
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,333
I'm bulking up for
the tournament,

96
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,708
so I'll take a steak.

97
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,291
[GIRL STUDENT D] That's always
what you order here.

98
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,083
Just the usual, then.

99

[gasps]

100
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey, this beef stew's
ready to go out.

101
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,500
Right! Thanks!

102
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,083
Oh, I can drop that off for
you on my way to the front.

103
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,291
Could you handle the customers
who just sat down?

104
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,583
[LECTY gasping]

105
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,250
Sure! No problem.

106
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,875
[gasping]

107
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,458
[LECTY]
Uh! Sorry, that was my fault.

108
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,750
Oh, no worries. Just
keep your eyes open.

109
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,916
And pay attention to
your surroundings.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,458
My surroundings? Okay.

111
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,000
Uh! Your glass is empty,
can I get you some water?

112
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,666
You can take this table right
here, it just opened up!

113
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,000
[CUSTOMER A]
Waitress?

114
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,166
[LECTY] Oh, hi! Are you
ready to put in an order?

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,083
All the employees are working
towards the same outcome.

116
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,500
They move in tandem.

117
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,041
Paying attention to
your surroundings

118
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,375
and what your
teammates are doing,

119
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,708
that's how you
achieve your goals.

120
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,375
[grunts] Why am I not hitting

121
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,333
any of these stupid
training beetles at all?

122
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,750
[MISORA yells]

123
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,666
You've got to draw them
in closer and then aim.

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,166
Firing recklessly is
what blew up your house.

125
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,958
Yeah, well, I'm new
at this position,

126
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,375
and I bet you're not any more
comfortable as a midfielder!

127
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,875
That was my fifth
consecutive kill.

128
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,125
[MISORA]
Rico, watch it!

129
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,166
There's an enemy coming
in low at your twelve!

130
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,291
[RICO] I'm doing more
than my share of the work.

131
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,708
You handle that one.

132
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,833
[MISORA]
You jerk!

133
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,125
[LECTY]
Please, don't fight!

134
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
We're supposed to be
working together, right?

135
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,375
[sighs]

136
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,916
[LECTY whimpers]

137
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,916
Is there something wrong?

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,458
No, it's just...

139
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,333
I didn't realize rear guard
was such... a lonely position.

140
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,958
It can be.

141
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,666
You're stuck hanging
back on your own

142
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,458
as our final line of defense
if something goes wrong.

143
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,083
It's easy to feel not just
lonely, but helpless.

144
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,875
That is, if you don't
trust your teammates.

145
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,666
Poor Rico. She always
served as our rear guard.

146
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,250
I wonder if she ever
felt this anxious.

147
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,833
[gasps]

148
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:30,000
We... have to pay close
attention to our surroundings.

149
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,000
Whenever I was the vanguard,

150
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,083
I only ever looked at
what was in front of me.

151
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,958
Hey, Misora!

152
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,416
Kinda busy here.

153
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,708
[LECTY] The primary job of
a vanguard is to cut through

154
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,125
the enemy's formations
and thin out their ranks.

155
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,750
Uh. I'm aware of that.

156
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,666
Why else do you think
I'm flying so quickly?

157
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,875
Yeah!

158
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,708
I'm really impressed
that you can keep firing

159
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,291
while moving around like that.

160
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,666
Seriously!

161
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,750
There's no way I could keep
up that kind of pacing.

162
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,166
You're amazing!

163
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,875
[gasps] Oh, uh, thanks!

164
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,791
And I think you can
do even better!

165
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,916
Your flying skills and
magic power reserves

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,166
are off the charts,

167
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,541
but you gotta make sure
to focus on each attack.

168
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,666
[MISORA] Well, if you really
think that'll make a difference.

169
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,916
It will! Take the time
to make every shot count.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,458
Don't waste your energy
on any extra movements.

171
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,250
Then I'm sure your score
will fly as high as you!

172
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,916
All right. I'll give it a try.

173
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,791
[LECTY]
And, um, hey, Rico?

174
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,875
[RICO]
Huh?

175
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,375
I never knew how much
pressure you had

176
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,333
on your shoulders
as our rear guard.

177
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,708
Now I understand just how
hard it can be to keep track

178
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,500
of everything happening
on the battlefield

179
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,083
when you're so far away.

180
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,791
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

181
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:44,291
At least one of you is smart
enough to see how talented I am.

182
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,375
So I'll at least
entertain the idea

183
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,083
that I might be able
to do better as well.

184
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,541
Ah! Thank you, Rico!

185
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,416
[MISORA grunts]

186
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,750
[LECTY] With Misora
firing more accurately,

187
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,750
it's easier for Rico
to provide cover

188
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,291
and keep an eye
on our enemies.

189
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,541
Since they're working together,

190
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,166
I can focus on any targets
that slip by them.

191
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,750
We all improve.

192
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,791
[MISORA grunts]

193
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,375
[MISORA gasps]
Oh, no!

194
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't worry, I've got
your backs covered,

195
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
those targets are toast!

196
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,500
[LECTY yells]

197
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,500
[LECTY]
So this is what it's like

198
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,833
to grow as a team and
truly work together!

199
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,083
[KANATA]
That's enough.

200
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,166
[LECTY gasps]

201
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,625
Great job, Lecty.
You passed the test.

202
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,166
Uh, thanks Kanata,

203
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,541
but you know you're
petting my head again!

204
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:09,208
Good morning Kanata.
Up early as usual, I see.

205
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,000
Hey, Chloe, have a
good day, all right?

206
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
I gotta clean up.

207
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,458
Uh! What happened to you?!

208
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,791
You've got huge bags
under your eyes.

209
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,958
[CHLOE groans] Please try to
ignore these dark circles.

210
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,541
We've been on night
patrol recently,

211
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,166
and I haven't had
any time to sleep.

212
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, right. You're investigating
those attacks.

213
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,500
So, I take it you don't
have any leads yet?

214
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,625
[CHLOE] Not really.
But we did figure out

215
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,375
he's targeting people
who use melee weapons.

216
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,333
But I shouldn't be discussing
this stuff with you.

217
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,500
Say. Is Yuri on night duty, too?

218
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,625
No, she's lucky. She only
patrols during the day.

219
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,666
That way she still has plenty of
time to instruct her students.

220
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,583
Well, good luck
with everything.

221
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,208
We need evidence more
than we need luck.

222
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,416
Kanata! [gasps]

223
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Mm... There you are!

224
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,791
I think it's about
time we stopped

225
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,541
this weird training of yours!

226
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,625
We should be doing more
advanced exercises,

227
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,416
like what the S-Rankers do!

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,833
Not a chance.

229
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,250
I don't think you'd even
survive that type of training.

230
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,958
It'd of be of no use to you.

231
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,375
[MISORA] Then can you
at least tell me why

232
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,625
we're taking
different positions?

233
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,666
Lecty and Rico seem to
know something I don't,

234
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,083
and if I can't catch up
to them, I'm finished!

235
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,750
All I want is to make
sure that I get stronger!

236
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,375
[KANATA] She wants to
become more powerful

237
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,916
and rise to the level
of her teammates.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,958
It sounds selfish on the
surface, but there's more to it.

239
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,333
What are you thinking?!

240
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,416
Why're you so quiet
all of a sudden?!

241
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,750
[KANATA]
Okay, let's meet

242
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,625
in the fireteam room today
instead of the skies.

243
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,250
Tell the others and wait
for me there, will ya?

244
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,375
Hurry up. And don't be late!

245
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,958
[MISORA]
I'm going, I'm going!

246
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,375
[MISORA grunts]

247
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,958
You enjoy teaching, don't you?

248
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,208
It's not so bad.

249
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,208
Wow.

250
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,541
You're acting like you did

251
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,375
back when you were
teaching Yuri.

252
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,208
Remember? When you
two used to get along.

253
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,291
[door opens]

254
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,375
[coughing]

255
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,958
[MISORA] Why did you
bring us to this dump?

256
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,541
[KANATA] From now until
the day of the next match,

257
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,958
the three of you are
gonna be living here

258
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,583
together as roommates.

259
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,125
[RICO, MISORA, LECTY gasp]

260
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,708
[KANATA] I want you to spend
every waking hour together.

261
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,666
And I guess the sleeping
ones, too, really.

262
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,375
Wait, he can't make
us move in here!

263
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,875
How could this possibly help
make us a better fireteam?!

264
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,958
I trust whatever Kanata says.

265
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,500
[MISORA groans]

266
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,791
[MISORA] We should probably
start by cleaning this place up.

267
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,541
There's, like, an inch
of dust on everything.

268
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,875
[LECTY]
So gross.

269
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,208
Make sure you're thorough.

270
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,875
Otherwise, my immaculate body

271
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,208
will never be able
to step foot inside.

272
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,750
You have to help, you know!

273
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,000
I refuse. Training is one thing,

274
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,541
but scrubbing this
filthy apartment

275
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,916
is an activity best
left to servants.

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,541
I'm gonna hurt you!

277
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,750
[LECTY] Wait a second.
Don't freak out, Misora.

278
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,041
I'll work twice as hard
and it'll be okay!

279
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,708
[KANATA]
Hey, think fast!

280
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,708
[YURI]
Uh! [grunting]

281
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,791
A cream puff?

282
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,500
Nice reflexes.

283
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,166
[YURI]
What the hell, Kanata?

284
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,666
Why did you just throw
a pastry at me?

285
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,250
It's a little gift from
one instructor to another.

286
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,291
Hopefully it'll make our
victory easier to handle.

287
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,125
You can't seriously think
your team is gonna win.

288
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,000
C'mon, Even you
aren't that idiotic.

289
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't see what's idiotic about
having faith in my fireteam.

290
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,916
You can stand there and pretend
to be noble if you want to,

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,125
but I don't accept
gifts from traitors!

292
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,791
Remember that food
stand in the park

293
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,125
we used to go to after
training together?

294
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,041
Well, I stopped by there to pick
up a few rewards for the girls.

295
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,791
That's when I noticed
their special today

296
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,208
was the super-deluxe
cream puff that you love.

297
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,916
[growling]

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,750
Well, on second thought,
I shouldn't waste food.

299
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,000
[KANATA laughs]

300
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,416
[YURI] Don't you dare
laugh at me like that!

301
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,583
It's just not fair for me
to take my hatred of you

302
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,583
out on this innocent dessert!

303
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,625
[KANATA laughs]

304
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,375
[FREON] The newest victim is an
A-Ranker, just like you guessed.

305
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,833
The attacker's sticking
to his pattern.

306
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,416
[LLOYD] We're going to need to
be extra careful on our patrols.

307
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,833
The assailant's next target
will likely be one of us.

308
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,375
Yes, an S-ranker.

309
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,750
[laughs]

310
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,083
Do you want another one?

311
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,541
Uh! That's for me, too?

312
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,541
U-Uh... I mean, no thanks.

313
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
Why are you being
so nice, anyway?

314
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,750
Just what are you after?

315
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,208
There's something I didn't get
to ask you about the other day.

316
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,125
Well, go ahead.

317
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,000
The reason you decided not
to use a spear anymore.

318
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,333
Is it because I'm the one who

319
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,708
told you to use it
instead of a sword?

320
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,583
[KANATA sighs]
I was afraid that was why.

321
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,875
Butt out, okay!

322
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,666
You don't have any
right to lecture me.

323
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,291
Oh, I'm well aware of that.

324
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,416
You're no longer my student.

325
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,583
But do you remember why I
had you switch to the spear?

326
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,250
[KANATA]
You had a habit of backing away

327
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,916
when your blade locked
with an enemy's.

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,875
That's a fatal flaw
for a sword fighter.

329
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,458
I used a sword during the
recent Devil Beetle attack,

330
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,333
and I didn't run
into any problems.

331
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't worry about me.

332
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,875
You're the most stubborn girl
I've ever met in my life.

333
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,250
But then...

334
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
It's that same stubbornness
that helps you succeed.

335
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,833
You never would've gotten
so good without it.

336
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,916
[YURI]
Uh!

337
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,416
Y'know, you were impressive
from the very start, Yuri.

338
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,958
If I'm being honest here,

339
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,291
I don't think there was really
much I needed to teach you.

340
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,791
[YURI]
That look on his face.

341
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,125
How can he be so at peace

342
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,500
knowing that he betrayed
us and became a coward?

343
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,916
Actually, there was one thing.

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,916
A concept we always talked
about in your lessons.

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,083
Something more important
than your weapon.

346
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,333
[YURI] To never give up,
no matter what the odds are.

347
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,208
Yeah. Good to know that
one stuck with you.

348
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,500
As long as you have that,
I know you'll be fine,

349
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,291
with or without me. I have
no doubt your name'll

350
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,333
go down in the record
books someday.

351
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,375
[YURI] Why are you saying all
this now? What brought this on?

352
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,250
[KANATA] Nothing in particular.
I just felt like telling you.

353
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,625
That's not a real answer!
Reminiscing about the past...

354
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
What are you trying to
achieve by bringing up

355
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,583
all these old lessons
and memories?

356
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,458
I dunno. You just make
me feel kinda...

357
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,041
[gasps]

358
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,875
You feel... what, exactly?

359
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,666
Well, I feel...

360
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,708
Ah, Yuri. Sorry to
keep you waiting.

361
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,291
But I had to make sure I'd
grown strong enough for you.

362
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,541
You know, you should really

363
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,708
choose your friends
more carefully.

364
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,083
Funny, I figured he
was one of your cronies.

365
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,125
So, finally. We've come face
to face with the assailant.

366
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,375
Whoa, wait a sec.

367
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,500
Stay out of this, Kanata.

368
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,458
[YURI] What an amateur.
I can take him. [grunts]

369
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,958
This'll be easy!

370
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,500
[YURI]
He's fast!

371
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:20,166
Oh, you're so slow, Yuri.
So slow I almost fell asleep.

372
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,666
Watch out! Don't back away!

373
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,833
[KANATA]
Every time she does that

374
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,875
she's opening herself
up to an attack.

375
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,791
[REAL chuckles]
Don't you wanna be close to me?

376
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,041
[YURI gasping]

377
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,750
[YURI] There's no use
trying to run from him.

378
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,250
[REAL] Please. It's time
for you to accept my love.

379
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,416
[screams]

380
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,041
[REAL laughs]
Oh, Yuri!

381
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,458
Yuri!

382
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,666
[YURI groaning]

383
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,041
[REAL] You can't give
up yet, my darling.

384
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,500
Not until I've proven

385
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,541
that I'm the only one who's
worthy of your affection!

386
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,416
[YURI]
You're asking for it.

387
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,750
I don't know who you are,
but you're dead!

388
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,791
[YURI gasps]

389
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,958
[YURI]
Where will he attack from?

390
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:00,750
The right?

391
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,708
The left?

392
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,458
Above?

393
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,625
No...

394
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,708
[YURI]
Behind!

395
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,791
Very good, Yuri.

396
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,791
But let's see how you
hold up against this.

397
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,833
[YURI gasps]

398
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,916
A Wind Slash?

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,916
Flight magic that's channeled
into a lethal attack!

400
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,041
Have some more. And Tell
me how you like 'em!

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,125
[YURI]
Stop it!

402
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,791
That's it, my love.

403
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,916
You can feel my desire
now, can't you?!

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,958
[YURI gasps]

405
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,916
I told you to stay
out of this fight!

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,291
[KANATA] Yeah, and if
I'd listened to you,

407
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,541
you'd be dead right now.

408
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,208
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you get hurt.

409
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,458
I was getting so close that my
love had almost reached her!

410
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,875
Kanata Age!

411
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,166
[REAL grunts]
Even though you're a traitor,

412
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,375
you're still the
famed "Chronos."

413
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,583
But you can't dodge
what you can't see!

414
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,750
[REAL whimpering]

415
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,291
Yeah, you're able to move
at incredible speeds.

416
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,041
But who cares? I'm faster!

417
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,791
[REAL groaning]

418
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,083
We Sky Wizards put
our lives on the line

419
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,916
to hone our skills
to the maximum.

420
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
And you're nothing
but an amateur

421
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,041
who's highly
overestimated himself.

422
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,833
Yuri is mine. You'll see!

423
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,541
That's enough for today.

424
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,250
But I'll be back for my
darling soon, you bastard.

425
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,333
[gasps] You're not getting away!

426
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,791
[YURI grunts]

427
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,958
This is just a taste,
my love, Yuri.

428
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,291
There's so much more
for me to give you.

429
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,416
[YURI groaning]

430
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,375
[KANATA]
Yuri! Hey, are you all right?

431
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,750
Yuri!

432
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,500
[YURI]
Kanata, help me.

433
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,750
[REAL]
Kanata Age.

434
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,750
Why is he always in my way?

435
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,875
[growling]

436
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,833
[CHIMERA A]
I can help you, Real.

437
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,416
I can give you whatever
your heart desires.

438
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,708
Huh?

439
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,666
[groaning]

440
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,041
It feels like someone's
shouting directly into my head!

441
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,583
[ALL gasp]

442
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,500
[RICO] Yuri's unconscious
and all bruised up.

443
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,125
[LECTY] Her clothes have
been ripped to shreds.

444
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,250
[ALL] What did you do
to her, you pervert?!

445
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,791
[sighs]

446
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,041
[LECTY whimpers]
Hi, this is Lecty.

447
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,500
Did you know that the
Special Duty fireteam members

448
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,041
all have nicknames?
Chloe is Nirvana,

449
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,916
Yuri is Brionac, and when
Kanata was on the team,

450
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,333
he was called the Black
Sword Saint Chronos!

451
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,875
Um, I think that's everyone.

452
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,208
[LLOYD clears throat]
Hi, this is Lloyd,

453
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,791
and apparently I'm
completely forgettable.

454
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,000
[LECTY]
Oh, sorry!

455
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,708
[LLOYD] Hey, you're that
maid from the café!

456
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,666
[LECTY] Wait, is that how
everyone remembers me?

457
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,083
[LLOYD]
I'm told the next episode is

458
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,333
"Potentials of the Zero."

459
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,416
[LECTY gasping]

460
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
[LLOYD]
Is something wrong?

461
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,958
[LECTY]
Why am I naked in the preview?
