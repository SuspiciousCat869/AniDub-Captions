...suffer a crushing defeat

against Fireteam

7
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,333
[YURI]
Kanata, that didn't happen!

8
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,958
The tournament hasn't
even started yet!

9
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,291
Quit making things up for
the opening narration.

10
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,291
[KANATA] Didn't I mention
that my fantasy voiceovers

11
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,583
almost always come true?

12

[YURI] That D-ranked wizard
needs to just give up

23
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,583
and end this match already.

24
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,041
He's fighting A-Rankers.

25
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,958
They're gonna beat the
crap out of that guy.

Heh.

Huh?

00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,291
That was close!

00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,250
So, are you okay?

[YURI]
Uh, Yeah.

38
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,375
Excellent. I think it's about
time I claim my victory.

I can't believe he won.

00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,083
Sup? You must be a new student.

45
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,500
[YURI] Yeah, thanks so much for
protecting me from that arrow.

46
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,833
I totally froze up!

47
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,625
[KANATA laughs] You were
never in any real danger.

48

Uh.

00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,583
[LLOYD]
Hey, Kanata!

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,958
Yeah?

51
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,041
[LLOYD] Chloe's nagging for
you to get back up here!

52
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,916
We've got another
match to prepare for.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,875
I'm on my way.

54
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,083
All right, new kid.
I'll see you around.

55
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,291
Wait. Hold on a sec!

56
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,583
I've got to thank you
properly for saving my life

57
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,541
or else I'm gonna feel terrible.

58
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,666
[KANATA] Hm... I guess you
could show your gratitude

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,333
by joining me in the skies.

60
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,041
We're always in need of
dependable Sky Wizards.

61
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,291
People who'll put the lives
and wellbeing of others

62
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,500
in front of their own.

63
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,875
I can see all of that
in you. I'll see ya!

64
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,583
[YURI]
U-Uh...

65
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,250
Join you... in the skies?

66
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,291
[CHLOE]
So, like I was saying.

67
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,875
The new victim,

68
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,416
he didn't get a solid look at
his assailant's face, either.

69
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,625
[LLOYD]
Just like the others.

70
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,625
Do you have any
thoughts on this?

71
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,416
[LLOYD]
Mm... Uh?

72
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,916
[CHLOE]
Uh. Yuri?

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,875
[YURI gasps]
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,708
We're talking about the
assault cases, right?

75
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,833
Due to the severity
of these attacks,

76
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,625
they want us on patrol duty.

77
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,583
We'll be working with
The Raven's Nest.

78
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,708
No problem. You
can count on me!

79
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,083
[KANATA]
The S-Rankers are teaming up

80
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,666
with the public order forces?

81
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,375
Must be bad.

82
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,875
[YURI gasps]

[YURI]
Uh... Uh. [growls]

85
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,666
So, you've stooped
to eavesdropping?

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,791
[KANATA]
Huh?

87
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,166
Wow, you have really
reached a new low!

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,208
No, I was just gettin'
some shut-eye...

89
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,958
up in the tree.

90
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,708
Is it, like, your
sole mission in life

91
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,416
to start fights with me, Kanata?

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,583
[KANATA]
I do like you better

93
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,375
when you're all
riled up like this.

94
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,291
[YURI]
Huh?

95
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,333
[KANATA laughs]

96
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,541
[CHLOE]
It's adorable.

97
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,333
[LLOYD chuckles]
You're definitely more alert

98
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,291
than you were earlier.

99
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,333
[YURI gasps]

100
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,666
If you'll excuse me, some
of us have students

101
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,333
we're supposed to
be instructing.

102
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,541
See you guys later.

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,791
[KANATA]
Uh?

104
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,833
[CHLOE]
You know, Kanata.

105
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,958
When she agreed to
head up a fireteam,

106
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,958
Yuri asked one request
from Freon in return.

107
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,500
Let me guess, she wanted
to take on a certain band

108
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,125
of E-Ranked misfits?

109
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,041
[CHLOE, LLOYD]
Uh!

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,166
How did you know?

111
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,000
[KANATA]
Just my intuition.

112
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,416
I guess, over the years,
I got good at reading her.

113
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,333
She is a spitfire.
A ball of emotions.

114
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,791
And I've never met
someone so determined.

115
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,833
[LLOYD, CHLOE]
Uh.

116
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,666
[KANATA] In a way I think
she still sees herself

117
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,166
as the new girl who has to prove

118
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,541
to us that she's our equal.

119
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,041
That's why she wants to
best me in a fair fight.

120
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,333
Of course I'm the last person

121
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,833
she'd want to talk to
about any of this stuff.

122
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,125
You push her buttons
and then we console her.

123
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,208
I can't help but think that

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,125
you've got the better
end of the deal.

125
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,791
I don't know about that.
Are you scared of her?

126
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,958
Not at all.

127
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,250
You're the one all
that passionate anger

128
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,083
is directed towards,
I'm in the clear.

129
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,125
[KANATA]
Heh.

130
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,125
[RICO]
Hm...

131
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,333
[LECTY]
Um, hey, Rico?

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,166
Would you please give
us some cover fire

133
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,666
--so we don't end up dead?
--I need to concentrate.

134
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,583
[MISORA]
Hey, you supreme idiot!

135
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,000
You can't just float
there all day!

136
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,958
Shoot down some
enemies or something!

137
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,291
[RICO]
Watching the front lines

138
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,833
and keeping an eye on my
rear at the same time.

139
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,916
Middlefield is truly exhausting.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,333
This was obviously designed to
test the limits of my patience.

141
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,000
[KANATA hums]

142
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,083
[MISORA]
What do you mean "at random"?

143
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,166
[LECTY, MISORA gasp]

144
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,500
[KANATA]
You heard me.

145
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,958
I'm gonna start mixing up
your roles as forward,

146
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,125
midfielder, and rear guard.

147
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,875
[MISORA] But we've been
training in the same positions

148
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,791
this whole time! Why would you--

149
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,083
[LECTY]
Um. I'd like to give it a try.

150
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,291
[MISORA gasps]

151
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,541
Kanata's training has
been working for us.

152
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,541
If he thinks this is
a good idea, well...

153
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,250
[RICO] Shaking things up might
make training more interesting.

154
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,625
[LECTY, MISORA gasp]

155
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,458
But if it doesn't
work, it's only fair

156
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,125
that our instructor takes
responsibility for our loss.

157
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,333
You're all crazy!

158
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,875
Responsibility, huh?

159
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,208
I suppose my reputation
couldn't get any worse.

160
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,916
Well, then? Are you in, Misora?

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,750
[MISORA gasps]

162
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,750
Uh...

163
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,333
If everyone else is doing it,

164
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,625
then my only choice
is to join them!

165
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,208
[MISORA] Come on, Rico,
do something! Anything!

166
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,916
Look at me, I'm dyin' over here!

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,791
Hang in there, Misora.

168
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,125
Oh, no!

169
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
Now I see.

170
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:26,583
[RICO]
Misora.

171
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,125
Finally.

172
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,250
[RICO] I want you to hold off
the enemy group on the left.

173
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,000
Lecty and I will
handle the right flank

174
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,166
while you complete your task.

175
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,750
[MISORA gasps]

176
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,375
[MISORA] But they're
too far away from me!

177
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,458
This is a job only you can do.

178
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,000
Lecty's not skilled
enough to handle this.

179
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,708
[LECTY]
Hey...

180
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,583
[gasps]

181
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,166
[RICO]
Can I count on you?

182
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,583
[MISORA] Hmph. Well if I'm the
only one who's strong enough,

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,666
I'll make sure to
get the job done!

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
[LECTY whimpers]

185
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,625
[RICO]
Lecty!

186
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,875
Yes?!

187
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,125
[RICO]
While Misora is busy

188
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,708
fighting off the
Beetles over there,

189
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,750
we're going to destroy
this group together.

190
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,666
It shouldn't be too difficult.

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,333
Um. Rico. I'm sorry.

192
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,541
[RICO]
Uh?

193
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,166
[LECTY] I didn't realize
I was a bad teammate

194
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,916
whose skills weren't
good enough.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,458
Ridiculous. You're more than
capable as a Sky Wizard.

196
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,333
Uh. But what you just said...

197
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,208
[RICO]
Oh, that?

198
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
I lied to get Misora on board.

199
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,166
Huh?!

200
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,791
Enough chit chat.
We've got enemies inbound.

201
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Take care of them while
I focus on my aim, okay?

202
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,625
[LECTY]
Yeah! On it!

203
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,041
[KANATA]
Hm?

204
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,166
[MISORA grunting]

205
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,208
[LECTY yelps]

206
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,416
[KANATA]
Huh.

207
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,541
Drawing the enemy deep
into friendly territory

208
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,375
and then eradicating them.

209
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,000
It's definitely not something
Misora would've come up with,

210
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,875
but the plan is working.

211
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,583
[MISORA gasps]

212
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,375
[LECTY]
Uh!

213
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,125
[RICO]
Uh.

214
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,750
So this is what our biggest
competition looks like, huh?

215
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,333
[YURI grunts]

216
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,958
Ready for this, Sasha?

217
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,583
Let's show 'em how it's done.

218

--Yeah, Lily. Born ready.

Okay everyone, let's
hit 'em fast and hard.

Keep it up, we're doing great!

222
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,000
[LILY] I think that was
the last one, you guys!

223
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,958
Go Team!
Shabadoobee High Five!

224
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,583
[ALL]
Yeah!

225
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:10,041
That's what victory looks like,
Kanata. Just so you know...

226
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,333
[KANATA]
Huh?

227
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,833
Hmph.

228
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,125
[MISORA]
Uh. They were amazing.

229
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,666
Do you really think we stand
a chance against them?

230
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,250
[KANATA] You're gonna have to
answer that question yourselves.

231
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,125
Think about how far you've come
since we've started training.

232
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,875
You're not the same
wizards you were before.

233
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,416
[RICO, MISORA, LECTY gasp]

234
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,833
The only way you'll defeat
a rock star team like that

235
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,458
is if you learn to fight and act
as a single unit. Together.

236
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,416
[ALL]
Mm-hm.

Is this the spot?

[RICO]
Yes, please don't stop.

241
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,208
[KANATA]
You're so tight.

242
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,875
This is your reward for
a hard day of training.

243
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,958
[gasping]

244
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,875
[KANATA] Your performance earned
you some special attention.

245
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,750
That's right. Tell me
that I was superior

246
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,083
to the other girls on
the battlefield today.

247
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:09,500
[panting]

248
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,500
[KANATA]
I saved the best for last.

249
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,291
I just hope your
teammates can still walk

250
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,541
after what I did to them.

251
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,708
[RICO] We usually don't get
this sort of pampering.

252
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,625
[KANATA]
But today is a special day.

253
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,958
You showed me some real
ingenuity during your training.

254
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,208
[RICO] You're the one who put
me in the position to do so.

255
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,416
[KANATA]
Hm?

256
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,833
[RICO]
Mm? What's wrong?

257
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,083
Please don't tell me your
hands are tired already.

258
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,291
[KANATA] No, I just realized
that you might be the wizard

259
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,125
who cares the most
about her teammates.

260
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,208
Uh! That's completely
preposterous.

261
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,250
You always keep a close
eye on the others,

262
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,125
and today your instructions
were aggressive,

263
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,375
but also kept the girls'
safety in mind.

264
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,291
Do you know the best
way to describe a girl

265
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,250
who's so considerate?

266
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,166
A poor Sky Wizard?

267
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,916
No, I think I'd say
that she's divine.

268
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,416
[RICO]
Uh...

269
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,166
[RICO]
Hmph. Stating the obvious

270
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,791
is not going to make me fall
in love with you, sir.

271
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,750
[KANATA laughs] Believe me when
I say that wasn't my intention.

272
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,166
Well, I'm glad you finally
see me for what I really am.

273
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,791
[KANATA] Now if I could
only get the others

274
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,083
to see there's a good person

275
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,791
beneath all this
"goddess" nonsense.

276
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,333
[KANATA yawns]

277
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,458
[YURI]
Over here, Kanata.

278
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,708
There are some things
I want to discuss.

279
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,000
You know, as instructors.

280
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,458
[KANATA]
Oh, perfect.

281
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,666
[YURI]
Uh?!

282
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,041
I wanna talk to you, too.

283
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,333
[YURI]
Uh! You do?

284
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,041
Very well then, let's talk.

285
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,541
Okay.

286
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,083
[YURI]
Uh...!

287
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,791
[MISORA gasps]

288
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,791
[MISORA] What are those two
doing hanging out together?

289
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,916
[RICO] Huh. I assumed he went
straight home after training,

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,875
but it seems he's got
a girl on the side.

291
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,125
[MISORA gasps]

292
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,416
[LECTY] Misora, are we
done spying on Kanata?

293
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
No! We're gonna
keep watching them.

294
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,833
I wanna know why they're
spending time together.

295
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
[KANATA]
Coffee. Black, please.

296
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,500
[YURI gasps]
That's what you're ordering?

297
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,125
[KANATA]
And you?

298
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,416
[gasps]

299
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,958
I'll have the same thing!

300
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,208
[WAITER A]
Right away, Miss.

301
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,375
[KANATA] Since when do
you drink black coffee?

302
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,916
You've always had
more of a sweet tooth.

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,666
Well, I guess you can
say that may my tastes

304
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,791
have changed over time.

305
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,208
Can you make out
what they're saying?

306
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,708
No, we're too far away
from their table.

307
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,958
It does seem like
they're close, though.

308
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,916
[MISORA]
Say what?!

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,250
[WAITER A]
Here you go! Enjoy.

310
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,416
[YURI]
Uh! Mm...

311
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,875
[KANATA]
See? I knew you didn't want it.

312
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,666
Don't force it down.

313
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,333
Let's get you an ice cream cone.

314
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,791
Maybe there's a kids' menu.

315
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,083
Don't treat me like
I'm some kind of baby!

316
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,458
This coffee is exactly
what I wanted.

317
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,166
I'll just add a few things
and it'll be perfect.

318
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,166
[gasps]

319
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,791
[sighs]

320
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,791
[YURI] Oh, wow. That's the most
delicious drink I've ever had.

321
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,125
[KANATA]
As a coffee drinker,

322
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,708
I feel personally insulted
by what you just did.

323
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,250
[YURI]
Well no one asked you!

324
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,875
Plenty of people drink
their coffee this way!

325
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,750
[KANATA]
Right.

326
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,916
Hey, guys?

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,875
I heard some rumors that Yuri's
been acting kinda weird lately.

328
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,458
Have you heard
anything like that?

329
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,625
Yes, they say she's
stopped using her spear

330
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,958
even though it's her favorite.

331
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,000
[LECTY gasps]

332
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,708
I'm not using a spear anymore.

333
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,583
It didn't seem like
the right fit for me.

334
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,458
[LECTY gasping]
Wait, I see what's going on!

335
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,666
[MISORA]
Huh?

336
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,083
[LECTY] He's cheering
her up with a date!

337
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,666
Date...? No... way!

338
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,916
Makes sense.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,791
That suave devil is
putting the moves

340
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,916
on his girlfriend slash
former teammate.

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
[MISORA] Wait! She's
his girlfriend now?!

342
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,166
[MISORA groaning]

343
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,000
[LECTY] Uh, Misora, you've
hardly even touched your cake.

344
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
[MISORA]
I think I've lost my appetite.

345
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,541
You can go ahead and eat
the whole thing if you want.

346
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,333
[LECTY gasps]
Seriously?!

347
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,875
Thanks Misora,

348
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,375
I really need the carbs after
today's training exercises.

349
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,791
Plus, it looks super yummy!

350
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,875
She's not his girlfriend,
she's not his girlfriend,

351
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,708
she's not his girlfriend!

352
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,458
[YURI growling]

353
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,375
[KANATA] So, what'd you
want to talk about?

354
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,541
[gasps]

355
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,416
But you had something
on your mind, too.

356
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,958
You can go first.

357
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,250
[KANATA]
All right, if you insist.

358
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,791
I read your in-depth interview

359
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,125
in the new issue of
"The Monthly Mistgun."

360
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,416
[YURI gasps]

361
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,541
So, is it true?

362
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,166
Are you only interested
in dating people

363
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,166
stronger than you are?

364
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,208
[YURI]
Uh...

365
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,791
Well, Yuri?

366
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,250
Uh! Yeah! Why? Do you
have a problem with that?

367
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,375
No, I think it's great how
open you're being about it.

368
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,833
You could really
be an inspiration

369
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,375
to a lot of girls, you know.

370
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,583
But I am surprised you
went public that way.

371
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,500
Uh.

372
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,208
I might be a private person,

373
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,291
but that doesn't mean I've
got anything to hide.

374
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,500
Besides, my dating preference
shouldn't matter to you.

375
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,333
[KANATA] Hey, I'm just
tryin' to look out for you.

376
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,416
Some people aren't as
open-minded as I am.

377
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,541
So be honest with me.

378
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,583
Huh?

379
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,208
[KANATA] Hm... I know the
person you're crushing on

380
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,833
pretty well, don't I, Yuri?

381
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,083
It's gotta be...

382
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,750
Chloe you're in love with.

383
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,625
[gasps]

384
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
It took me a while
to realize it.

385
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,458
But then it was
really easy to see.

386
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,083
So even though you didn't say

387
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,875
her name outright
in the interview,

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,333
I was able to put two
and two together.

389
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,250
[YURI]
That's enough.

390
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,291
[KANATA]
Huh?

391
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,750
[MISORA]
Uh!

392
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,708
Hey, I told you,
I'm okay with this.

393
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,500
[YURI] Would you just
shut up, Kanata?

394
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,750
[KANATA]
Uh.

395
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,541
Is that really what you
wanted to talk about?

396
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,250
You dragged me all
the way to this café

397
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,541
to accuse me of being
in love with Chloe?

398
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,875
[KANATA]
Huh? Well, technically

399
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,708
you were the one who picked
the café, remember?

400
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,500
I know that!

401
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,166
Look, I'm just gonna be
blunt with you, okay?

402
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,500
[MISORA]
Uh!

403
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,750
[YURI] Kanata. You need to
resign as an instructor.

404
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,000
[gasps]

405
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,958
[YURI] Even if you are
a traitor and a coward,

406
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,958
you know you've got
amazingly powerful skills

407
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,583
that no other Sky Wizard
can hope to match.

408
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,833
Quit wasting your time

409
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,666
on those hopeless losers
and rejoin the fight.

410
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,916
You've got a real problem

411
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,083
with the girls of
Fireteam E601, don't you?

412
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,750
Yeah, and you should, too!

413
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,958
Those epic failures shouldn't
be allowed to set foot

414
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,791
on academy grounds,
much less enroll.

415
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,958
[KANATA]
If that's true,

416
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,708
then Chloe and I shouldn't
be here, either.

417
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,750
[YURI gasps]

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,583
Ask her yourself.

419
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,250
You know, she used to crash

420
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,333
seconds after getting
off the ground.

421
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,083
Everyone called her
a failure then, too.

422
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,208
But... she was different.

423
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,000
[KANATA] Misora, Lecty, and Rico
have incredible potential.

424
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,041
[YURI gasps]

425
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,666
I wouldn't still be instructing
them if I didn't believe that.

426
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,708
[MISORA gasps]

427
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,583
[YURI] I swear, you're
hopeless. We're done here.

428
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,166
[KANATA] Hey, let me
pay for that at least.

429
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,708
I'm the one who said we
should come here, remember?

430
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,333
[KANATA]
Okay, I won't fight you.

431
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,166
I'll pick up the tab for
the other table, then,

432
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,333
and pay it forward.

433
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,875
[MISORA yelps]

434
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,333
They've been following us since
before we even left the academy.

435
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,416
Oh, didn't I mention that?

436
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,958
You suck!

437
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,250
He knew we were here?!

438
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,250
He's not as blind
as I thought he was.

439
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,791
Misora, this is the best
cake I've ever had!

440
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,083
You've found a link?

441
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,916
[CHLOE] Yes. Lloyd
realized all the victims

442
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,041
have been male Sky Wizard
students in Mistgun.

443
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,041
[LLOYD] And, they all
used melee weapons.

444
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,166
[FREON]
That describes many students.

445
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,250
This could just be
a coincidence.

446
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,125
[LLOYD]
One more thing.

447
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,458
[FREON]
Mm?

448
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,000
The first boy attacked.
He was an E-ranked wizard.

449
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,166
The next belonged
to a D-ranked team.

450
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,541
[gasps]

451
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,875
[LLOYD] And then last night,
a C-Ranker was attacked.

452
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,416
[FREON] So we know who
the next target might be.

453
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,125
[GENIUS panting, gasps]

454
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,125
[MAN]
How pathetic.

455
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,958
Is that really the best
a B-Ranker can do?

456
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,250
[GENIUS gasps]
Don't touch me!

457
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:41,791
[GENIUS yells]

458
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,166
[GENIUS groans]

459
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,500
--[MAN laughing]
--[GENIUS groaning]

460
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,250
[MAN laughing]

461
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:01,625
[MAN] Oh, my darling.
I love you so much.

462
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,583
Once I'm finished I'll
be powerful enough

463
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,083
to deserve your
affection. Just wait.

464
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,958
I'm getting stronger, and then
I'm coming for you, Miss Yuri.

465
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,958
[laughing]

466
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,916
[CHLOE] Hey, how's your fancy
A-Ranked fireteam doing, Yuri?

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,958
I hear they're awesome.

468
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,750
[YURI]
Totally. Lily's the leader.

469
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,333
She's a third-year student
and an expert Magic Gunner.

470
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,125
Then there's Sasha,
the Magic Fencer,

471
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,833
and Greg, who's an
unstoppable Magic Archer.

472
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,791
They'll teach Kanata's losers
what real Sky Wizards are like,

473
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,250
