1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,875
[AMIE] What's going on at
the Mistgun Tournament?

2
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,125
E601 was winning and then
everything turned into chaos!

3
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,250
[BEACH] I thought we were
under attack by Devil Beetles

4
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
because the air raid
sirens went off!

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,708
[COELA] I'm pretty sure
the alarm was just

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,166
to freak everyone out. We're not
under attack by enemy bugs,

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
just some weird guy

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,000
with glasses who
laughs like a lunatic.

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,541
[AMIE]
I totally saw that dude!

10
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,666
He has the creepiest
smile I've ever seen.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,458
[BEACH] Yeah, he was
heading towards the arena

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,083
while everyone else
was running away.

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,458
I think E601 might
be fighting him now.

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,666
[AMIE]
I hope they're okay.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,000
I wouldn't want to face
that creep-o dude.

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,833
[COELA] How tough can
one nerdy psychopath be?

17
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,958
[BEACH] You idiot, questions
like that always backfire!

18
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,958
Why are you still here?
This is too dangerous.

19
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,750
[MISORA] There's no reason
for you to fight him alone!

20
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,916
Don't you girls know? I still
have a few friends left.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,333
[RICO, MISORA, LECTY]
Huh?

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,208
[REAL] You're going to regret
what you've done, worm.

23
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll obliterate anyone who tries
to come between me and Yuri.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,666
Kanata! Yuri!

25
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,125
Everyone all right?

26
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,041
See what I mean?

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,083
[RICO, MISORA, LECTY gasp]

28
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,541
"A" for effort, though.

29
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,041
You even managed to
mangle one of my hands.

30
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,416
This is your chance
to surrender!

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,041
Listen to what Yuri's saying.

32
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,500
We won't have to kill you
if you turn yourself in.

33
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,958
[laughs] Kill me?

34
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,208
Don't you know I'm unstoppable?!

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm the chosen one,
the incarnation of power.

36
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,791
You really think
you could harm me?!

37
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,041
Look at his body.

38
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,208
Disgusting. It looks
like a Devil Beetle's.

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,750
[REAL]
Shall we begin?

40
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,041
It's impenetrable!

41
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,458
It looks like they might have
to do this on their own.

42
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:27,791
[REAL laughs] There! No more
interruptions, now. Just us.

43
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,125
It's time to make
love to one another.

44
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:34,916
Are you ready to feel me? Yuri!

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,166
[YURI groaning]

46
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,791
[REAL]
Don't fight your urges.

47
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,583
I finally have you
where I want you.

48
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,416
[KANATA groaning]

49
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,708
[MISORA]
Hey, what are you doing?

50
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,750
[LECTY]
Kanata, you're hurt!

51
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:57,541
Oh? It appears we still have
an audience... for now!

52
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,000
[MISORA screams]

53
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,416
[RICO groaning]

54
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,083
[LECTY screams]

55
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,208
Don't be so arrogant,
you bastard.

56
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,166
That's it. That strange power!

57
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,541
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,541
You've seen this before?

59
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,416
Uh, yeah, just once!

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,750
This is what happens to people
who lash out at my students.

61
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,625
They get a taste of
my real strength.

62
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,583
Well. Not bad, for a human,

63
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,833
but I'm afraid you're just
wasting your energy.

64
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,333
[growls]

65
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,875
Leave me, Kanata!

66
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,750
[KANATA] Just hold on Yuri,
this is almost over!

67
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,125
I'll take care of her.
But you're dead.

68
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,583
Heh. I'm tired of
seeing your face!

69
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,916
[KANATA grunts, yells]

70
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,000
Ah. What an unexpected feeling.

71
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,333
I get it now. You've been chosen
by the Devil Beetles as well,

72
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,083
haven't you, Kanata Age?

73
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,000
What a weak man you are.

74
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,166
You've let our enemies possess
your mind and body.

75
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,333
What's this?

76
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,000
You disdain your newfound power

77
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,291
just because it came
from the Devil Beetles?

78
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,041
[REAL]
Now I understand.

79
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,666
No wonder you've gone rogue
and given up your position

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,583
on an S-Ranked team.

81
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,500
If the public knew that
one of their heroes

82
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,041
was blessed with power by
their greatest enemies,

83
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,250
there'd be no more trust in the
pathetic Sky Wizards division.

84
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,041
[YURI]
Uh?

85
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,166
You know nothing about me.

86
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,833
[KANATA grunting]

87
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,875
Not so fast!

88
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,291
[screams]

89
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,416
At least you can say you tried.

90
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,958
Why don't we go ahead
and end this charade?

91
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,875
[KANATA gasping]

92
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,458
No, don't! Please,
I'll do anything!

93
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,333
[REAL chuckles]

94
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,791
It's going to be such a pleasure
to watch you bleed out, Kanata!

95
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,958
Didn't I mention that? Huh?

96
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,708
My students... are totally
capable of kicking your ass.

97
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,750
We've got you!

98
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,750
Perfect timing, Lecty.

99
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,833
[LECTY grunts]

100
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,041
[YURI gasps]

101
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,208
[YURI gasping]

102
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,458
Get back, Yuri!

103
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,791
Right!

104
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,708
You didn't really think you
could get away from me.

105
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:08,083
There is no escaping. Yuri!

106
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,583
[YURI gasps]

107
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,833
[KANATA groaning]

108
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:30,500
[laughs] Thanks for taking the
initiative and killing yourself!

109
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,958
No, He can't be dead!

110
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,541
Stay back...!

111
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,666
[YURI whimpers]

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,875
Take my students and run, Yuri.

113
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,125
[coughs]

114
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,625
Hm. You're a real tough
guy, aren't you, fool?

115
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,583
Still giving orders even when
there's a hole in your stomach.

116
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,416
Why don't I put you
out of your misery?

117
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,791
[YURI whimpers]

118
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
I can't watch this!

119
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,083
[MISORA]
It's not over yet!

120
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,583
What do we do?

121
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,333
Attack?

122
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,208
We save him. Got it? We
remember our training.

123
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,541
We have to keep fighting.

124
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,833
Sky Wizards never leave an
injured teammate behind!

125
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,833
[YURI gasps]

126
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,250
Actually. There was one thing.

127
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,666
A concept we always talked
about in your lessons.

128
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,708
To never give up,
no matter the odds.

129
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
So long!

130
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,125
[REAL]
I was going to let you live.

131
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,250
But you just couldn't stay
out of this fight, could you?

132
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,791
It looks like you girls
need to be punished!

133
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,208
[LECTY gasps]
Stop!

134
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,916
Or you'll taste the
Eisenach Twin Sword style!

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,958
[REAL] So you're first,
little blonde pest.

136
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,875
Misora! Go!

137
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,916
[MISORA]
Mm.

138
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,208
Well done!

139
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,500
Yes!

140
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,041
[gasps]

141
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,875
Oh, no, my blade broke!

142
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,875
That's enough, Lecty.
Retreat now!

143
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,916
[LECTY]
Uh!

144
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,291
[LECTY groans]

145
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,208
[KANATA] Good. If he
thinks you're weak,

146
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,708
he'll be more likely
to lower his guard.

147
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,125
Now make your instructor proud
and destroy this monster!

148
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,416
You stupid girls.

149
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,250
If it's death you long for,

150
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,833
I'll be happy to make
your wishes come true!

151
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,750
[KANATA]
He must not realize

152
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,958
my students are even better
against airborne foes.

153
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,000
[REAL] You may as well
lay down your weapons

154
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,666
and accept your fate.

155
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,500
Hm? Wait. Where did Yuri go?

156
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,708
Huh?

157
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,625
If you tell me where my
beloved ran off to,

158
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,416
I'll make your last
moments peaceful

159
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,000
with a bone-crushing
embrace. Sound good?

160
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,291
Well?!

161
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,416

Move out!

163
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,833
Take him down!

164
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,458
Don't hold back!

165
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,958
[REAL laughs]

166
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,958
Time to feel my power!

167
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,083
[REAL]
Oh! My beloved. That's it.

168
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,875
You're finally submitting to
your feelings, aren't you?

169
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,750
[YURI] Kanata, just for the
moment, I'll forgive you.

170
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,416
Not for you, or for me, but
for the sake of Mistgun.

171
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,291
I'll wield the power of this
spear, just as you taught me.

172
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,750
[REAL laughs] Don't worry
your pretty head, darling.

173
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
This doesn't hurt.

174
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,958
You couldn't hope to injure me
with such a primitive weapon.

175
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,916
Wait, what's that?

176
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,958
[REAL] My body! It feels
like I'm falling apart!

177
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,166
How are you doing this?!

178
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,708
[YURI] It seems you're not as
powerful as you think you are.

179
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,791
This spear is named Trishula.

180
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,250
It's equipped with a
high-frequency oscillation

181
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,125
mechanism that destroys
matter on a molecular level.

182
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,250
It's specially designed
to destroy Chimera.

183
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:26,041
[REAL groaning]
Impossible!

184

[CHLOE, LLOYD gasp]

185
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,125
Give me a reason.

186
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,041
Wait! Hold on!
What's going on here?

187
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,125
[YURI] You need to
accept that you've lost.

188
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,291
[REAL]
Uh?!

189
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,208
I can tell exactly what
you're thinking.

190
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:08,208
If you hurt him, I swear I will
never be able to forgive you.

191
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,958
But why? Don't you see?

192
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,416
[cries]

193
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,125
Yuri! I love you!

194
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,583
[REAL] All I need to do is
get him out of the way!

195
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,458
I tried to warn you. But you
had to do this the hard way.

196
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,833
Just remember. You brought
this on yourself, Real!

197
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,000
[yells]

198
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,541
Oh, did I forget to mention?

199
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,916
You've been playing into
my hand this whole time,

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
you overgrown
cockroach from hell.

201
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,166
What a day.

202
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,916
I guess your big investigations
been solved, at least.

203
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,166
It's because of you.

204
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,416
We couldn't have beaten
him without your help.

205
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,750
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,041
You were the one who
finished him off, Yuri.

207
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,000
I was stuck bleeding all over
the ground most of the fight.

208
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:42,875
Pretty useless.

209
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,625
Uh. Speaking of your injuries.

210
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,583
Are you sure you're okay?

211
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,541
[KANATA] Uh. Don't worry
'bout me. I'll be fine.

212
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,333
Oh. Please, Kanata.
Just try and take it easy.

213
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,250
Look.

214
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,791
--[CHLOE] Huh?
--[YURI gasps]

215
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,791
[FREON] S-Rankers! I want a
full report of what happened!

216
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,875
[LLOYD] So who wants to explain
all this to the Division Lead?

217
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,250
Ya know, I'm feeling really
tired all of a sudden,

218
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,833
I think I need to get to bed.

219
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,875
[MISORA]
Where are you going?!

220
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,291
[LECTY]
Don't just leave us here!

221
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,333
[RICO] He can face death,
but not my sister?

222
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,833
[YURI gasps]

223
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,416
Kanata really hasn't
changed a bit, has he?

224
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,666
[YURI]
Huh?

225
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,708
You know, how he always
does everything himself.

226
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,208
Then he refuses to take credit

227
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,291
and disappears before
we can stop him?

228
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,833
Yeah. That's him.

229
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,625
I never have any idea what's
going through that guy's head.

230
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,333
[BOTH laugh]

231
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,833
[YURI]
Uh... Thank you, Kanata.

232
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,000
[AMIE]
It says the attacker

233
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,833
was a student from
the Medicine Division.

234
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,208
[BEACH] Apparently, he was
driven insane by stress,

235
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,750
and that led to him planting
a bomb in the stadium.

236
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,041
Why do I think we're not
getting the full picture?

237
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,916
[AMIE, BEACH]
Hm...

238
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,583
[CHRIS]
Most of it is fabricated,

239
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,458
but the story works as
an official explanation.

240
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,541
So what's going to happen
to fireteam E601 now?

241
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,041
You're not disbanding them.

242
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,041
However, because they're
the tournament champions.

243
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,750
Shouldn't they be promoted
to C-Ranker as agreed?

244
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,541
No, I've got a better plan.

245
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,750
[LECTY, MISORA, RICO]
What?!

246
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,916
[KANATA] I tried to argue,
but it's no use.

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,875
Freon said winning
just cancels our debts

248
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,125
for destroying
part of the city

249
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,750
during the Devil
Beetle invasion.

250
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,833
So I'm afraid we won't be
getting a promotion this time.

251
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,041
[MISORA]
That's... totally unfair.

252
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,791
[RICO] Hmph. She's
disappointing, as usual.

253
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,333
[LECTY] But we still get
the other prizes, right?

254
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,500
Like all those special weapons?

255
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,041
[KANATA] Of course.
I've got them right here.

256
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,666
[LECTY, RICO, MISORA]
Huh?!

257
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,250
[KANATA]
Ta-da.

258
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,583
--[MISORA] Um. What?
--[LECTY] Uh...

259
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,916
[RICO]
What's that?

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,708
[KANATA] Unfortunately the
weapons got destroyed

261
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,250
by one of the explosions
while you guys were fighting.

262
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,375
So we won but don't
get a single prize?

263
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,500
At least we didn't break up.

264
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,208
I guess nothing changes, then.

265
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,500
[KANATA]
There is one more thing.

266
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,625
[ALL]
Uh?!

267
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,875
We did all that
work for nothing.

268
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,291
Just a tacky little trophy.

269
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,291
Boo.

270
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,708
Aw, c'mon girls,
don't look so down!

271
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,500
You should be proud
of yourselves!

272
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:18,083
You worked hard and became a
team. That counts for something.

273
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,416
Miora. Lecty. Rico.

274
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm proud to call myself your
friend and your instructor.

275
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:30,125
Congratulations on
winning the tournament.

276
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,583
[MISORA] As team leader, I want
to thank both of you, too!

277
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,708
I couldn't ask for
better teammates!

278
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,708
Thank you!

279
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,500
I suppose we all
played our parts.

280
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,125
Though obviously the
role of "goddess"

281
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,416
is the most important
one on the team.

282
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,583
We need to have a
serious talk, Rico.

283
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,375
[KANATA] Oh, and there is one
more thing I forgot to mention.

284
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,041
Fireteam E601 is
getting a new member.

285
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,625
I think she's really gonna
round out our group dynamic.

286
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,875
[LECTY, RICO, MISORA]
What?!

287
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,208
[KANATA]
That's your cue. Come in!

288
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,625
What?

289
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,666
Our new member is Yuri?

290
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,666
[KANATA] Everyone please
welcome Yuri Flostre,

291
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,291
the defeated commander.

292
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,416
Please don't rub in how
we destroyed her team.

293
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,750
[YURI] Hey! You said you weren't
gonna bring any of that up!

294
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,833
[KANATA]
Hey, look.

295
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,791
All I'm doing is stating
the facts, Yuri.

296
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,416
All right, Disgraced Leader.

297
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,625
Why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself

298
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,166
as an introduction?

299
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,666
Kanata has invited me to join
you as your new team member.

300
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,833
In fact, you might even say he
has me here against my will.

301
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,583
But a deal is a deal.

302
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll be staying on the
Special Duty team,

303
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,500
but I'll still give
this my best.

304
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,250
Can I go sit in the back now?

305
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,041
Don't just stand there gawking.

306
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,083
Make your new team member
feel like she's at home.

307

[YURI growls]

308
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,833
[ALL]
Welcome to E601!

309
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,458
Thanks. She needed that.

310
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
You have no idea what I need!

311
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,833
[KANATA]
Hm? Hey, what's in that box?

312
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,291
Oh, uh, this?

313
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,875
It's nothing much, just a
little cake that I brought.

314
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,416
Oh, that's really thoughtful!

315
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
And a great way to
make friends, Newbie.

00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,708
All right, everyone,

317
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,666
let's celebrate our new
member with dessert!

318
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,583
No, you can't do
that now, not here!

319
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,875
If you'll just let me have
that back, I'll cut it up.

320
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,458
Or I'll get us a
nicer one, even!

321
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
Yeah, that's a better idea!

322
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,125
Come on, this isn't
funny, Kanata.

323
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,750
I asked you to give it back.

324
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,041
No, don't you dare
open it! Kanata! Ah!

325
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
[KANATA]
We'll do small pieces.

326
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,583
[ALL gasp]

327
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,541
[MISORA, RICO, LECTY]
Ah...

328
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,791
I see. We talked
about this Yuri.

329
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,250
I know where your tastes lie

330
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,416
based on that magazine
interview you did.

331
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,416
So tell me, is it Misora?

332
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,833
Lecty?

333
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,125
Or Rico that you love?

334
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,125
[YURI growling]

335
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:57,000
[YURI]
Kanata, you idiot. I hate you!

336
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,208
[KANATA]
Huh?

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,791
[sighs]

338
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,791
Hey, Misora, what's the matter?

339
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,583
Oh, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

340
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,125
[MISORA laughs]

341
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,083
Yes! I'll have your
order right out, sir!

342
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,333
Come on, everyone!

343
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,583
[LECTY]
Let's do our best!

344
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,291
[RICO]
What a divine fireteam.

345
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,625
Here we go!

346
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,125
[KANATA laughs]

347
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,916
[KANATA]
Good job, girls.
