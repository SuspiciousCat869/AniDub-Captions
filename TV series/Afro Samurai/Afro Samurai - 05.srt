1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,666
What it is, what it is,
what it is! Shed no tears!

2
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Come on Afro, cheer up!

3
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:34,041
I know how you feel, baby.
Lotsa your peeps died.

4
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,250
But hey! At least
you got me now!

5
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,833
I'll be your road dog!

6
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,500
Like I told you...

7
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,875
You might not make
it this time, baby.

8
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,166
Didn't I say to be careful?

9
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,000
Come on, man! Get that
damn look off your face.

10
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,833
Ain't no use in regrettin' now.

11
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,083
You came to be what you are

12
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,166
because you stuck to
your convictions, dog.

13
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,125
So go on out there 'n
take care o business.

14
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,500
Whack that motherfucker...

15
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,958
Even if he is your old pal.

16
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,041
You, of all people,
should understand that.

17
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,875
Don't forget your goal...

18
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,500
If your opponent's
dual-sworded,

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:39,333
you gots to make twice as
many moves in order to win.

20
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,583
The force of the blow

21
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,375
is twice as powerful for
the double-handed grip.

22
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:49,041
Huh, okay... if you say so.

23
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,916
You just don't listen
to people, do you?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,416
Alright dog...
You're on your own from here.

25
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,416
I guess this is goodbye.

26
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:09,208
Oh man, it was the bomb
hangin' out with you...

27
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,041
...Afro Samurai.

28
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,625
Yes... what you say
may indeed be true...

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,333
Against any normal foe
with two single-hand blades,

30
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,125
the raw power of your
style would be greater...

31
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,583
But I'm no ordinary foe.

32
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,166
I have speed, grace...

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,458
And power far beyond yours.

34
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,458
Watch as I strike with both
hands holding a single blade...

35
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:52,375
And end this game once
and for all... Afro Samurai.

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,416
See you in... Hell!

37
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:43,416
Wonderful KUMA...
You are my greatest creation!

38
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,666
Your anger has
increased your power

39
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,125
beyond that of
the Afro Samurai!

40
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,458
Strike now!
Defeat our hated enemy!

41
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,458
Tear the No. 2 warrior
limb from limb!

42
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:15,041
Ugh... this is terrible...

43
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,875
Severe injuries to the neck
and the back of the head.

44
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,250
And oh!

45
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:32,458
This, this deep gouged
cut on the ribs is quite...

46
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,250
Ah...

47
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,791
He's got deep
lacerations from a blade

48
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,500
and badly broken bones
from falling off a cliff!

49
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,708
And look at his limbs!

50
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,208
With this degree of
damage, they're useless!

51
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,958
Can we revive his tortured soul?

52
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:53,416
I'll need at least 450
micro-mini actuators,

53
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,041
a hundred
super-slim control CPUs,

54
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,208
some sensors and
fuel cells... hm...

55
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,208
Understood, brother.

56
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,416
Why are you granting
me this honor?

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Because you have the
perfect technical expertise--

58
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,583
and you have no morals.

59
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,583
Oh, but you are
smearing my good name!

60
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:23,750
My twisted brother... Create a
samurai of extreme power...

61
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,750
But I sense his
rage... his grief.

62
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,333
Should we not just
let him die, brother?

63
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:23,666
Quit playing you fool! Finish
off that Afro-headed idiot!

64
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,666
Do you hear me,
my dearest teddybear?

65
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,958
I sweat with
anticipation for your kill!

66
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,333
Can you smell me?

67
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,333
What do we have here?

68
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,041
Wait at the main
gate of Mt. Shumi.

69
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:46,416
The Afro Samurai will
come to you in time.

70
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,916
[heavy breathing]
You killed our MASTER!

71
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,333
You killed...
Sasuke!

72
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,083
You killed...
Jiro, Seikichi!

73
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,958
They're all dead! Agh! Agh!

74
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,000
And little Otsuru...!

75
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,500
...you killed her too!

76
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,750
Sasuke...

77
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,875
Jiro...

78
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,291
Master...

79
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,583
Otsuru...

80
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,416
Otsuru...

81
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,833
Now KUMA! Now!

82
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,000
Your life-support circuit
has been damaged!

83
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,416
You don't have much
time left! Strike! Strike!

84
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,541
Life has made you a killer...

85
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,125
So kill me or die!
There's no going back!

86
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,625
Impossible... Never mind...

87
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,958
At least, injured as you are,

88
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,791
you'll die at the
hands of the No. 1!

89
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,250
What took you so long, kid?

90
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,208
I got tired of waiting, so I
was just thinkin' of calling

91
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,083
and leaving you a voice mail.

92
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,791
I've watched you.

93
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,333
I saw you kill your
childhood sword buddy.

94
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:27,875
I even chuckled when you shed
that imaginary friend of yours.

95
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,500
You've grown
into a fine killer...

96
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,041
...but you're still vulnerable.

97
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:51,625
Like your daddy,
you're soft on the inside.

98
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,291
He couldn't handle all
the blood on his hands

99
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,916
from the constant
headband wars.

100
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,875
He actually wanted to just
hide the No. 1 band--

101
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,791
conceal that legend
from the world.

102
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,625
But all he did was
stir up a hornet's nest

103
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,916
of lust for power. People
just kept killin' each other.

104
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,041
Death raged on.

105
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:20,041
Those headbands can
make a man crazy.

106
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,291
Not a single loser who
put that dumb-ass

107
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:26,083
No. 2 cloth on his head
reached the No. 1.

108
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,125
They just kept dying
over each other.

109
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,166
With no one taking the
world by the reigns--

110
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,458
a tornado of chaos and
killin' spun out of control.

111
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:50,875
Don't you know that absolute
power leads to ultimate peace?

112
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,500
Power ain't nuthin'
if you don't use it.

113
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,083
I call it a sin NOT
to rule the world

114
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,625
if you've been blessed
with the strength.

115
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:20,458
The world is lost.
All is chaos and pain.

116
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,666
It's time for someone
to take control.

117
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,000
It's time for a man to
use absolute power

118
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,875
for the cause of
ultimate peace!

119
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,833
It's time for a man to rid
the world of conflict

120
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,458
and allow all men and women,

121
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,291
young and old,
to live in tranquility!

122
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:45,500
It is time for man to become
God where God has failed.

123
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,750
First... I took the head

124
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,750
of the most powerful
samurai in the world.

125
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,250
A man feared and respected
for his sublime skills.

126
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,416
Your daddy!

127
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,416
Then... when fate led
me to this sacred place--

128
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,958
a great ancient secret
was revealed to me.

129
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,916
Obtaining the No. 1 headband...

130
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,666
...just ain't enough, boy.

131
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,166
You think it's mere coincidence
you don't have a father,

132
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,000
friend, or master?

133
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,500
All of 'em were sacrificed.

134
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,583
You stand before me now
for the same reason.

135
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:31,083
Destiny designed me to
possess all of the headbands.

136
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,791
Now you get it... You don't
gotta just have the one--

137
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,375
you gotta have 'em all!

138
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,750
Then, and only then,
will ultimate power

139
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:45,166
be bestowed from a mystery
beyond human understanding.

140
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,708
I think your daddy knew.

141
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,625
I think the only reason
he accepted my challenge

142
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,541
was to prevent me
from learnin' this truth.

143
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:59,625
Now, here, secluded
in this holy place...

144
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:04,083
I will defeat you and take both
headbands into my possession.

145
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,416
You're here to hand me the
No. 2 headband, Afro Samurai!

146
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,791
So that I may rule the world!

147
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,791
I will be God!

148
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,083
You ready to die
like your pappy?!

149
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,750
This is it, kiddo;
here's where you go down.

150
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,750
Finished.

151
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
[sarcastic] Is that it?

152
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:52,000
And I thought you loved
your pappy! I thought

153
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:57,583
all those souls you sent to
heaven behind you mattered!

154
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,333
But only now you see.

155
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,208
Your little anger is just
a sea spray of blood

156
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:09,625
in the endless ocean
of this world's killing!

157
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,291
It's got no end
and no beginning--

158
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,958
Just the strong and the dead!

159
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:23,333
Only cursed ones like you
and I can stomach this truth!

160
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,625
But just like your daddy,
you could never finish me!

161
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,500
Afro Samurai.

162
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,958
I finally got all
of them headbands!

163
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,916
I'm finally becoming god!

164
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,041
[chuckle to loud laughter]

165
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,541
Damn!

166
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,333
Aww, hell...

167
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,041
Namu...

168
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,291
Jinno...

169
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,625
It's been a long time,
eh, Afro Samurai?

170
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,708
You will only die again,
my friend.

171
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:09,625
Perhaps. Or maybe we'll
finally just tie this up.

172
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,625
Alright, let's do this.

173
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,208
And so...

174
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,000
... the never-ending
battle continues...

175
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:43,708
On and on and on and on...
