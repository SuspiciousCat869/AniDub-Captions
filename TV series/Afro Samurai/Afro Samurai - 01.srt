1
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,416
Wait here, son.

2
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,250
It'll soon be over.

3
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:29,375
Remember me, No. 1?

4
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,041
I've been waiting a very
long time for this.

5
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,583
I know.

6
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,916
But, it all ends here.

7
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,458
Come on, man.

8
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,208
Gimme whatcha got!

9
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:23,541
Finally... I've got the
title of No. 1 in my hand.

10
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,583
Do... not... avenge... me.

11
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,250
With this band
across my forehead...

12
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,375
I will rule this world
as God himself!

13
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:05,250
It's unfortunate that you
had to see this, boy.

14
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,208
This moment will
always haunt you.

15
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,333
You will be consumed
by hatred for me.

16
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:31,833
Challenge me when you're
ready to duel a god. Heh heh...

17
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:41,083
Ha, ha, ha...

18
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,833
Yeehaw!

19
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,666
This is the end of the road...

20
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,333
Afro Samurai!

21
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,583
We got 20 guys here--

22
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,916
all armed to the teeth,
We got you surrounded.

23
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We never said we
were gonna play fair!

24
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,083
I got no idea why,

25
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,583
but some pretty rich folk wanna
pay top dollar for that cloth.

26
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,666
Why don't you give it up, kid...

27
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:03,541
Everybody's a tough guy...
Okay, have it your way.

28
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,166
Gear up, boys!

29
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,708
Look at this, boys! Tough guy
here's gonna take us out

30
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,250
with only one hand
on his sword!

31
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,750
Cut him up!

32
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,708
What the fu--
That's impossible!

33
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,708
You son of a...
Fuckin' fucker!

34
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,458
I cut you! I cut you!

35
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,458
Hmm...

36
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,333
[breathing]

37
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,708
I took this job because...

38
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,333
I thought you were
just a legend...

39
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:58,583
Just a story... A story
to scare little kids.

40
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
But you're the real deal--

41
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,625
the Demon who dares
to challenge God.

42
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,125
So what the hell do you want?!

43
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
Don't seem to me

44
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,541
like you out to make this
stinkin' world a better place.

45
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:19,166
Why you gotta kill all my men?
Why you gotta kill me?

46
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:30,333
Nothing personal,
it's just revenge.

47
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,250
Yo yo yo yo yo, Afro!

48
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:09,541
That was off the chain! Cold-
blooded! Damn, motherfucker!

49
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,833
Excuse me for probing, but
what you just did back there,

50
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,958
was it absolutely necessary?

51
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,458
I'm beginning to wonder

52
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,583
if you got any feeling for
human life left in you at all.

53
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:31,708
[coughs]

54
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,250
Hey, hey, hey. If you
don't stop dissin' me,

55
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,041
I'm gonna stop followin'
your brutal ass around.

56
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,375
Then whose gonna
watch your back?

57
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,916
Anyway,

58
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,041
I did check some monk-looking
bald motherfucker in a tree

59
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,583
chattin' on a celly while
watchin' your killin' spree.

60
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,916
Don't that bother you?
Sure as hell bother me.

61
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,833
Yo! Yo!

62
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,875
Hold up! Hold up!

63
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,041
Afro!

64
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,333
Yo! Yo! Yo!

65
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,625
Breaking news just in!

66
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,666
What the...?

67
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,625
Jeez...

68
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,041
Easy, kid.

69
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,041
What's the problem?

70
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,875
It's HIM! He's here! He's here!

71
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,041
--[murmuring]
--No way!

72
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,958
What the hell are you
talking about, punk?

73
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,708
[heavy breathing]

74
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,041
Ain't no doubt
about it, man. He...

75
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,875
[heavy breathing]

76
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,041
Here. Drink up.

77
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,791
He had this Afro hairdo...
you know what I'm sayin'?

78
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,000
With kind of a
greenish tint to it

79
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,666
if you looked real close...

80
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,958
And he was wearing
this freakin' headband,

81
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,083
with the No. 2 stamped high
across his freakin' forehead...

82
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,208
Did you say Afro-hairdo?
Greenish tint?

83
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,333
The headband... With No. 2
written across it?

84
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,375
Make no mistake...

85
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,125
That's him, that's the No. 2!

86
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,458
The AFRO SAMURAI!

87
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,083
The Afro Samurai...!

88
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,125
The one who cut down the
assassins of the western guild?

89
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:33,708
Th-The No. 2 swordsman...
of the world?

90
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,416
He's cold-blooded!

91
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,125
He killed the brothers of
Asura in only five moves!

92
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:46,416
So don't think twice about
crossing swords with that guy...

93
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
What a bunch of sissies!
Screw that, cowards!

94
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,708
You guys just watch while I
take that No. 2 headband!

95
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,458
That's all bullshit!
You assholes just watch!

96
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,125
I'm gonna take him out!

97
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,208
It's gonna be me!

98
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,125
Let me take him, baby!
He's all mine.

99
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,125
Nah, I'm gonna be the No. 2!

100
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
All y'all just shut up!

101
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,791
Cause while you talk
and talk and talk,

102
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,875
my spear will be splitting
his head in half!

103
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,875
Just like this!

104
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,250
Hey, man!

105
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,500
Get that rusty piece of
junk outta my face, man...

106
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,750
[grunts]

107
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,750
Ma'am...

108
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,833
Yeah?

109
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:26,458
Why is everyone
after this Afro Samurai?

110
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,958
You don't know? You really
must be from out of town.

111
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,291
We got ourselves a
legend around here.

112
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,250
A legend?

113
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,833
Look. Two ancient headbands.

114
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,833
No. 1 and No. 2.

115
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,833
If you have the No. 1--
you're like a god--

116
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,541
NOBODY can touch you...

117
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,125
Except he who wears... No. 2.

118
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,250
The trouble with THAT is--

119
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,208
The trouble with THAT is,

120
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,875
that anyone in the world
can challenge you.

121
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,333
Clever boy!
You're interested?

122
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,125
The life of No. 2:
constant combat.

123
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,041
But ultimately, the path
a warrior should take

124
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,333
and the reward is
to become a god.

125
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Yep. They say the No. 1
waits at the top of Mt. Shumi.

126
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,208
You can't miss it.

127
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,958
It's got like two huge
hand-like things...

128
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Get outta my way!

129
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,125
Take it easy, Mac!

130
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,375
You ain't the only one here
who thinks he can take him.

131
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,416
Ugh!

132
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,666
Agh!

133
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,583
You caved my eyes in!

134
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,250
Fucking son of a bitch!

135
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,291
You warmed up yet?

136
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,500
Hm...

137
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,750
Hey hey, you wanna fight?
Take it outside!

138
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,166
Mmm...

139
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Lemonade... ice cold.

140
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,625
Coming right up! 250, please.

141
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,166
Lemonade...
Heh, heh, heh...

142
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,125
Hey man, shut the hell up!

143
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,291
Now look who we
got ourselves here...

144
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,791
Here you are... lemonade.

145
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,500
Huh! Drink that, boy!

146
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,083
Uh, another one?

147
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,916
On his tab?

148
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,041
Holy...

149
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,541
Here you are... lemonade.

150
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,000
That's gonna cost
you more than 250.

151
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,083
And I think that guy's
tab has run out.

152
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,291
That's very cool.

153
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,708
Oi-shi... Refreshing...

154
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,916
Good, you'll need it.

155
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,833
You've still got a long
way to go, No. 2!

156
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,791
Cross the mountains by way of
the "Low Down East" path.

157
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,083
Beware the cliffs, and know
that they're waiting for you.

158
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,583
Thanks.

159
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,791
Hey Afro! Yo, Fro-boy.

160
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,583
Your sure this is the
right way to go?

161
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,250
These cliffs don't
look so safe, man.

162
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
And one other thing.

163
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:04,083
Don't look now, but I
think you got a stalker.

164
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,375
A crazy fan boy
from the tea house

165
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,083
and he don't want
your autograph--

166
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,791
more like your epitaph.

167
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,708
Now, I suggest you keep
steppin', cause this one...

168
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,500
...is a stone killer, for real.

169
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,416
Yo, didn't you hear me? 
Get going!

170
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,541
I'm trying to pull your coat.

171
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,500
All you gonna do is ignore me?

172
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
Alright, alright, you wanna
blow it for me and you, huh?

173
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,875
Shut up...

174
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,166
Well fine, go on, get
your lanky ass killed, then.

175
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,041
But don't say
I didn't warn ya! Later!

176
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,875
I am called Shosun.

177
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,125
I come from the land

178
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,958
of the great weapon
masters of the west.

179
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,291
I see you wear one of
the head bands of legend

180
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,541
that leads to godhood.

181
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,583
So, shall we?

182
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,583
Afro, don't fight this fucker.

183
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,500
He got arrows and 
grenades and shit.

184
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
You ain't got no chance, dude!

185
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh, lord, no no no!

186
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,333
Agh! Is you dead?
Don't tell me you dead!

187
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,750
Is you dead?
I asked you a question!

188
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,416
Your jumping
has only put you

189
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,166
directly in the line of
my fire, samurai fool!

190
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,875
Where will you go now,
great No. 2 warrior?!

191
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,250
My aim is only to move forward!

192
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,583
Whoa! Brother,
you did your thang!

193
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,708
I thought you
was dead for sure!

194
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,833
Yo, my man, I gots to tell ya,

195
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,291
I don't know if it's
your natural pheromones

196
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,708
or you need a shower,

197
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,541
but assassins are comin'
at us like flies on hot shit.

198
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:47,625
I gots to say, there's something
strange still out there.

199
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,625
Hm... Yes...

200
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,416
It's me! Brother 2.

201
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,791
Yes... uh-huh, I see...
Carry on then.

202
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,291
And remember you are
among the righteous few

203
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,083
and we have placed great faith
in your ability to track him.

204
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,375
Because the No. 2 warrior has
now begun to move in earnest,

205
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,916
it seems our cherished brother's
work is now truly beginning.

206
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:41,125
The No. 2 walks the
path Low Down East...

207
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,166
In the great
ancestral direction...

208
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,291
Our No. 2 warrior's
journey will no doubt end

209
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,166
at the great valley before
the high slopes of Mt. Shumi.

210
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,958
We're getting almost
all the data we need.

211
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,000
The mandate of heaven has
spoken and agreed with us,

212
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,125
the righteous, the EMPTY SEVEN!

213
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,291
Wash over us, the supreme power!

214
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,208
Let us pay homage
to the Holy Way!

215
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:23,791
Ahyee a Nonon-Bow...

216
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:30,375
Ahyee a Nonon-Bow...

217
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,166
Let us close our eyes
and feel the power.

218
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,625
Let the Divine roll within you.
Let the Holy Way call you.

219
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:45,833
As the Divine Will has ordained,
we have risen from the ashes.

220
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,833
From this condition
of oppression,

221
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,458
we have borne the cross,
but we will seize the crown...

222
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:58,541
and the prophecy shall
be fulfilled--eye for an eye--

223
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:05,125
No. 2 shall know no mercy at
the hands of the EMPTY SEVEN!

224
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:09,583
Prepare for the final struggle!

225
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:15,125
Freedom is in our reach!

226
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:22,208
The supreme power
of God shall be ours!

227
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,875
Amen!

228
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,500
Have you heard, my brothers?

229
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,666
--Yeah!
--Oh, yes!

230
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,250
Do you hear the word?

231
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,916
--Right!
--Woo!

232
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:38,791
Man, all these killin's are
really starting to depress me.

233
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,541
You know what I mean, Afro?

234
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,375
Oh, mo' cold shoulder, huh?

235
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,458
Yo, Holmes, you're
walkin' a little funny.

236
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,791
What's up? Whoa, wassup?

237
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,416
Was it something
in the lemonade?

238
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,916
Oh, snap, you
fucked up, Holmes!

239
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,916
Oh look, oh shit, it was
those damn arrows!

240
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,750
Come on, Afro, snap out
of it, man! Snap out of it!

241
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,791
He's injured, I can take him.

242
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,875
What?

243
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,458
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!
It's too early!

244
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,666
Whoa!

245
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:35,708
Hey, hey, hey, can't you
give a brother a break, yo?

246
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,416
Can't you see the man is down?

247
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,750
What about honor
and fairness and shit?

248
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:55,750
Hey, that a motherfuckin' RPG?!
You got a motherfuckin' RPG?!

249
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,000
A RPG in a
motherfuckin' backpack?!

250
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,458
Wait, wait wait, can
we talk about this?

251
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,625
You ain't got a monologue?

252
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,916
You're not gonna give
a bad guy speech?

253
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,166
Oh my god!
Oh my god, oh my god...

254
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,166
That fool!

255
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,166
He may have destroyed the
sacred No. 2 headband as well!
