1
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:04,416
You have the basic skills,
but your eyes give you away.

2
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:09,791
Become unpredictable... Strike
from your subconscious mind.

3
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:14,458
Let your moves flow out
from your individual essence.

4
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:34,666
I do not like the
looks of that thing.

5
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,333
See that smoke oozing
out? It ain't natural.

6
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,958
What I'm sayin is "this bitch--
just one thunder from her

7
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,208
'n she can blow!"

8
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,125
And that's the
end of your 'fro, bro!

9
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,250
Bam! Ha hah!

10
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,125
Oh, uh, by the way...

11
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,250
I'm tryin' to imagine
you without a 'fro...

12
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,416
I think you'd look
cute with lil' braids!

13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,958
[giggles]

14
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,500
Woa! Hey, hey hey hey...

15
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,083
Shut up.

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,125
Hey, hey hey hey... Don't tell
me you're stupid enough

17
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,125
to just waltz through
that red gate, is you?

18
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,000
Cause...You KNOW
it's a trap, right?

19
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,416
And you ain't
that stupid, right?

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,875
...right? RIGHT?

21
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:34,458
Hey! Hey hey hey...
Hey! Come on!

22
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,000
You don't believe me?
Well, fine.

23
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:47,166
Go ahead and die for that
stupid No. 1 headband!

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,125
Damn.

25
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,041
You stubborn, man!

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,083
You really ain't gonna
let nothing stop you

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,208
until you get to the top of this
mountain and kill No. 1 is you?

28
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,833
Well, he did, he did cut
your Dad's head off.

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,916
I get that. I'd be pissed too!

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But this road ain't
the safe way, man!

31
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,916
I'm more than willing to
watch your pig head roll...

32
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,875
This is Brother 2...

33
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,875
The No. 2 has
crossed Terror Pass.

34
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:19,041
Excellent. Continue
to monitor his movement.

35
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,541
Dear Brothers!

36
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:27,541
It seems that our long
awaited day has arrived!

37
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,583
Our prayers,
like paved stones,

38
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,916
have led us to the
door of the No. 1!

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,625
But to do this, we must
first seize the No. 2!

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,416
By destroying the Afro Samurai!

41
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,166
Shall we commence
dear brothers?

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,625
I say we send the Great
Russian warrior Ivanov!

43
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,458
He has a unique
style not of Japan.

44
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,125
It will unbalance Afro.

45
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,458
Rubbish! The one to defeat
No. 2 can only be Foo,

46
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,750
the trickster
assassin from China.

47
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,000
Ivanov and Foo are
both great warriors,

48
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,416
but we cannot place our fate
in the hands of foreigners.

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,208
Especially ones who may covet
the headband for themselves.

50
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,791
Now, I have been
blessed with a vision.

51
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,458
It has led me to
design a weapon

52
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,541
more deadly than even
the Afro demon himself.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,583
[rumbling and booing]

54
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,625
Brothers, let me introduce
our latest weapon.

55
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,333
It possesses a
physical strength

56
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,208
20% greater then
the current No. 2.

57
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,875
I originally intended to apply
this weapon against No. 1.

58
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,083
But since we encountered
certain miscalculations,

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,625
we will first use it
to defeat the No. 2.

60
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,666
A battle that will surely
provide superb entertainment...

61
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,291
There exists a man on this
Earth with the skills of No. 2?

62
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,416
Where could you
find such a man?

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,791
Not a man, rather a thing.

64
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,875
Explain more, Brother 1...

65
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,833
I have accessed our
finest scientific resources

66
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,125
to build a thing
that is more than man!

67
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,250
He is a demon machine with a
special surprise on the inside!

68
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,375
The skill stored
deep inside of him

69
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,666
was extracted from
Afro's dreams by Okiku!

70
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,666
May God rest her troubled soul.

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,541
Has the data been tested yet?

72
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,750
Do you question me, Brother 6?!

73
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,583
Does one question faith?!

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,958
Observe and I will
MAKE you a believer!

75
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:45,541
Brethren, I am proud to welcome
a new disciple into our fold.

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,166
Rise to greet our
most deadly weapon--

77
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,291
Afrodroid!

78
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,416
Damn!

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,666
Afrodroid, ain't he lovely...

80
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,000
It took millions of man
hours just to build his head.

81
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,791
This thing ain't nothing...

82
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,958
Many more technological
breakthroughs

83
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:29,833
to manufacture his full body.

84
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,458
What say you now,
Ivanov from Russia,

85
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,250
and Foo from the
Hunan province of China?

86
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,958
I am second to no man.

87
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,583
I am first among
men, and machine.

88
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,250
I just forgot
to include the machine.

89
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,583
It will be I who
defeats this Afro!

90
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,833
I have traveled long and far,
no time for games.

91
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,875
So the way I see it is,
I cut you, I get job!

92
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,250
Hm... this is
rather interesting.

93
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,791
What shall we do now?

94
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,416
I suggest we choose
the assassin of Afro

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,958
based solely on credentials.

96
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,958
I suggest we send
in the Afrodroid first.

97
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,583
If he fails, then...

98
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,625
Nonsense!
Why rely on a machine

99
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:20,583
when we have hired two of
the world's best assassins?

100
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,875
Yes. I agree.

101
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,291
To rely on a machine with
no credentials is risky.

102
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,333
You all make good points,
my brothers.

103
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:36,500
But why not just let skill
alone decide for us?

104
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,833
Huh?

105
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,958
A Battle Royale!

106
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,625
Let bloody death pave
our way to eternal life!

107
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,583
A "Battle... Royale"?

108
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,166
Now are you certain?

109
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,500
There's only ONE RULE:
when it's over, the last man...

110
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,000
or machine standing
will battle No. 2.

111
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,416
Twisted!

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,291
Splendid!

113
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,791
Can you dig it?!

114
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,291
--Yeah!
--Then let's get busy!

115
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,166
[assassins cheer]

116
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,833
Yo! Come on, Afro.

117
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,416
I got a bad feeling
'bout what's up ahead

118
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,250
and you know I'm right.

119
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,208
You better start listening
to me, man. You know?

120
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,791
I really do know

121
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,541
what the hell is goin' on
around here, but you won't...

122
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:49,291
Hey, alright! You FINALLY
stoppin' to listen to me!

123
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:53,083
Now, we can start talkin'
man-to-man! So...

124
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:58,250
See, it's a simple thing.
The point is...

125
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,875
What?

126
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,208
What the hell is this...?

127
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,750
Aw, hell no...

128
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,041
Hey, Afro, wait! Wait!
This shit ain't even natural!

129
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:26,000
I say we take the long way home,
we can circle back around--

130
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,625
You know, so what we lose
a few days? Come on!

131
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,000
AFRO: I'll see you, then.

132
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,541
Shit, man!

133
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,416
Look... He's like a fucking
clone an' shit! Come on, man!

134
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,208
Okay now, my ninja gut's
tellin' me he's a mean one.

135
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,166
So don't go any nearer.

136
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,666
Hey, you listenin' to me?

137
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
Oh, my god. Oh, my god...

138
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,458
Hey! He's trying to copy you!

139
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,791
Hold up.
That is you. Wait a minute.

140
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,875
W-W-Which one is you?

141
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,625
Oh, no! Which one is you?

142
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,583
That's you, ain't it?
You're bleedin' bro!

143
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,916
Wait a minute! Hold on, hold on!
Prove to me that you're you!

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,291
Say something
to let me know it's you.

145
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,041
Shut up.

146
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,625
Oh! It IS you!

147
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,041
Listen, don't go
back in there, man!

148
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,541
Oh, Afro!

149
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
Damn, Afro, I hate
to say this, man,

150
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,125
but you're losin', man... Bad!

151
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,833
Hey! Maybe we better back off...

152
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,125
Or you're gonna
lose that headband.

153
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,500
Damn! This motherfucker
knows your next move

154
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,250
before you make it!

155
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,958
It's like me watching Afro

156
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,500
watching Afro fighting
Afro... or something.

157
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,333
What happens
when your reflection

158
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,708
moves faster than you?

159
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,875
Something AMAZING!
That's what happens!

160
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,500
We shall finally see the
wrath of Hell's fire

161
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,750
turned upon itself!

162
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,958
That ain't gonna work
either, man! Don't do it!

163
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,250
Yo! Yo! Stop thinking!
Afro, he's reading your mind!

164
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,125
Ahhh! Help!

165
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,166
Now, Afrodroid!
Go in for the kill!

166
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,041
Become unpredictable...

167
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,666
Strike from your
subconscious mind.

168
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,291
Let your moves flow out from
your individual essence.

169
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,333
Even the most masterful
opponent will fall

170
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,541
from a strike that has
no history or reference.

171
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,416
The moves created from your
own individual unique essence,

172
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,625
may surprise even you...

173
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,750
Whoa! Atta boy!

174
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,000
Ya did it, Afro!

175
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,541
Now, come help me up!

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,958
Hey, yo!
You're forgettin' me! Wait up!

177
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,208
My hand's getting numb!

178
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,625
This is what we get for
relying on Okiku's data!

179
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,125
Aaahhh!

180
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,875
Dammit, Brother 6!

181
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,625
This is the kind of shit
I will not tolerate!

182
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,166
Where am I?

183
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,500
So we made it, huh?
We made it! We made it!

184
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:16,125
Yo Afro! You tried
to ditch me, dincha?

185
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,041
I really thought
I was gonna die!

186
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey, are you still going on?

187
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,875
Ain't you had enough
punishment for one day?

188
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,208
Afro, you gotta listen to me!

189
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,541
Man, you don't know
what these crazy monks

190
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
got under their skirts!

191
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,333
Wait, dammit!
Don't you ever plan nothin'?

192
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,125
Hachimaki-wo-kudasai!
["Please give me the headband"]

193
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,666
Hachimaki-wo-kudasai!
["Please give me the headband"]

194
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,041
Hachimaki-wo-kudasai!
["Please give me the headband"]

195
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,583
Even though you are wounded...

196
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,291
...expect no mercy from me.

197
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,833
Don't hold back, neither! This
dude's a mean one! Kick his ass!

198
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,833
Careful, man! You slip up with
this one and you're a dead man!

199
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,583
Yes..!

200
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,291
[stuttering]
He's psycho, man!

201
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:22,458
I will leave the rest
to you, my brothers...

202
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,833
What?

203
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,833
No way!

204
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,250
He's truly a warrior legend!

205
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,958
Almost too
magnificent to kill...

206
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,583
You won't have your
sword back that easily.

207
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,375
You're nothing without a blade!

208
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,833
Brother 5, you have
been too careless!

209
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,916
Get off Brother 5! Aghhh!!

210
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,833
Now what the hell is this?

211
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,500
Do we really gotta keep going?

212
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:22,000
I mean... this shit you leave
behind you is NASTY!

213
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,250
Do as you please.

214
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,791
Jesus! You crazy, man.

215
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,500
It's a pity I have to do this,

216
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,708
but the No. 2 warrior must die,
no matter what it takes.

217
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,375
Hmph?!

218
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,333
What the...

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeow! I know that dude!
I thought you iced him already!

220
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,500
He's a muthafuckin' machine?
That's some crazy shit, man!

221
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,958
He dead yet? You dead yet?

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,916
Danger! Danger! Danger!

223
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,833
Hey, man! Where you been?!

224
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,833
Stay down, muthafucka!
Stay down!

225
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,041
He ain't dead yet!

226
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,625
Come on, man!
That ain't even fair!

227
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,791
We gotta come this far

228
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,416
just to look down
the barrel of that shit?

229
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,916
That felt good...

230
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,041
I think he blew his load.

231
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,541
Man! I bet all that skill is
stored in this little chip!

232
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,750
It's such a cute
little chip, too...

233
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,625
Oh, shit, man!

234
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,791
I ain't going!

235
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,958
Listen, man, that's it for me.

236
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,041
I've seen some sights today
ain't no one supposed to see.

237
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,416
So that's it, I--

238
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,541
Shut up.

239
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,125
Hmph!

240
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,041
Whoa! If this thing
goes any faster,

241
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,916
my head's gonna sneak up
my body like a damn turtle!

242
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,208
Youth! Completely overrated...

243
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:05,416
Nothing will stop my mission of
obtaining the No. 1 headband!

244
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,250
Especially not
some damn samurai!

245
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:36,000
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any weirder...

246
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:41,583
What the hell is
that supposed to be?

247
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,500
Long time no see,
Afro Samurai...
