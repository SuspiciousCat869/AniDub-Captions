1
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,500
Add one more body
to the body toll.

2
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,958
May God rest this
poor bastard's soul.

3
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,791
Yo, Afro!

4
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,833
Ain't you gonna say nothin'?

5
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,416
I'm talking to you!

6
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,375
I said I'm talkin' to you!

7
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,000
Long time no see, Afro.

8
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:37,750
Hey correct me if I'm wrong,
but I don't think a teddy bear

9
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,291
is supposed to be
walking around in

10
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,166
a damn kimono
strapped with blades.

11
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,083
I got a baad feeling about this.

12
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:48,208
You don't want to be messin'
with this guy! Afro!

13
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm telling you man,
that shit ain't natural!

14
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,958
He might look cute an' all

15
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,208
but I got a suspicion this
one's a pro! He's for real!

16
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,125
Aw!

17
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,500
Look, I know you've
got mad skills and all.

18
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,958
And I ain't trying
to be pessimistic here,

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,333
but you headed
straight to a dirt nap!

20
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,666
Please, this time
you could really bite it.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,625
And I ain't going with you!

22
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,875
You sure about this?
Because if you is...

23
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,291
Suit yourself.

24
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:33,291
Aww, hey, hey hey hey yo-yo yo
yo, wait up wait up! Hold up!

25
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,833
Damn, you one stubborn samurai!

26
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,083
Come on man, chill.

27
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,500
Listen to what I've got
to say for once, please!

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,583
Aw...

29
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:59,083
Watch it! He's 'bout to bust
a two sword move on you!

30
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,750
Uh-oh.

31
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,083
Watch your left, man! No,
no no no no, watch your right!

32
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,500
Why do you not
draw out your sword?

33
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,875
If you want the No. 1...

34
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,666
You must first defeat me.

35
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:21,375
You HAVE come to defeat the
No. 1... Haven't you?

36
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,208
Agh! If you wear
the No. 2 band...

37
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,250
Then you must fight!

38
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,625
What the hell?

39
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,083
Perhaps the rumors of the
Afro Samurai are not true...

40
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,208
...that he cuts all
that stand in his path...

41
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,708
that his only
movement is forward...

42
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:05,291
But you just look like
an Afro-headed coward!

43
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,916
Come to think of it...

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,375
I can't even take a warrior
with such stupid hair seriously!

45
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,375
Afro!

46
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,541
What the dilly yo babe?
If you gonna run, run!

47
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,458
If you gonna fight,
then damn it, fight!

48
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,291
Such a fleeting moment in time.

49
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,583
Nothing remains.
Everything ends.

50
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,000
No!

51
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,791
One. There is no
such thing as killing

52
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,041
with strength or speed only.

53
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,458
Kill the enemy with one
calm powerful stroke.

54
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,041
Two. The only form is action.

55
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,416
Striking without thought is the
only way to kill the enemy.

56
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,750
Huh! Huh! Huh!
[sword swinging practice]

57
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,041
Stop!

58
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,083
Listen.

59
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,250
The point of dueling
is to kill your enemy.

60
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,083
Not twisting and turning,
demonstrating flowery form.

61
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,000
The only position
is no position.

62
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
Where you hold your sword

63
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,208
depends on your relationship
with your opponent,

64
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,916
on the terrain,
and the situation.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,958
Act as the sea when the
enemy is like the mountain.

66
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,125
Act as the mountain when
the enemy is like the sea.

67
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,291
Keep this in mind, all of you!

68
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
--Yes, Master!
--Yes, Master!

69
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,291
Real attacks are not static,
or with cooperative opponents.

70
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,416
Stick with the moves you learned
in class and you will die.

71
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,333
Even a glancing blow can
unbalance your opponent

72
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,041
and cripple his next offensive.

73
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,333
Hey, Jinno? I have a question.

74
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,666
Why do you use two
swords instead of one?

75
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,250
With two I can
be the best, Otsuru.

76
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,666
You see...
There are lots of reasons.

77
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,208
For example, it's great
if you ever have to fight

78
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,250
more than one
opponent at a time.

79
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,458
You see, with 2 smaller blades,
I can swing faster...

80
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,583
than a guy with both
hands on one big sword.

81
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,875
AND... I can attack and
defend at the same time!

82
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,000
I could even fight if one
of my arms got cut off,

83
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,541
cause I'll still have one left!

84
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
It's really the ultimate
fighting style.

85
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,166
Huh?

86
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,125
Oops... Sorry. I guess I
got a little carried away.

87
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,208
I'm done.

88
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,000
Was your meal yummy, Afro?

89
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,541
Jinno...

90
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,583
You're really serious about
sword-fighting, aren't you?

91
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,208
Of course.
I have to protect everyone.

92
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,291
You... Afro...
All the students here.

93
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,125
When Swordmaster
is too old to fight...

94
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,541
I'm gonna have to be strong
enough to look after this place.

95
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,041
I heard some pipsqueak's been
running loose killing assassins.

96
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,583
That pipsqueak wouldn't
happen to be a kid

97
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,916
like this one we've
got here, would it?

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,750
I think we got a match
here boys. Eh, pipsqueak?

99
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,333
I want to know where
I can find the No. 2.

100
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,416
Don't know nothin' about it.

101
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,375
So what are you
gonna do about that?

102
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,958
Cause you see, we're
on the same path, kid.

103
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,666
Rumors of the No. 2
led us to this dump.

104
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,916
And we can't have no
kid chasing our prize.

105
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,666
Afro!

106
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,625
Jinno.

107
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,833
What have you
gotten yourself into?

108
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:18,583
Okay. You and I are
gonna talk about this later.

109
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:23,125
But first I've got
to save your dumb ass.

110
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,166
You son of... Agh....

111
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,833
Afro!

112
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,333
Tell me what you know!
Where's the No. 2?

113
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:29,458
No. 2 is quite near...

114
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh, it's you again...

115
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,291
There you go, sonny.

116
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,416
You just can't get enough
lemonade, can you?

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,541
Afro...

118
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,458
Forget avenging your father.

119
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,291
Live your own life..

120
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,125
Otsuru cares about you.
I care about you.

121
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,666
We're your family now.

122
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,333
--Ah! Look at that!
--So beautiful!

123
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,916
Cool!

124
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,583
--Wow!
--Aw, man...

125
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,666
Say, you reckon I can
be as strong as Master?

126
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,791
With your skill, Sasuke,

127
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,208
I'd say it'll take
at least 50 years.

128
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,583
50 years?

129
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,458
[laughter]

130
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,166
--Look!
--Whoa...

131
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,625
--Check out that one!
--Beautiful...

132
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,250
To get as strong as
Master takes time.

133
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,583
His training must have been
100 times harder than ours.

134
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,916
Man... I could be
dead in 50 years...

135
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,250
...or even worse than that, old!

136
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,416
Dead?! Man, Sasuke,

137
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,041
why do you always have
to be so dang morbid?

138
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,041
He is right in a way, though.

139
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,291
I mean, we can't know for sure

140
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,791
if any of us will be around
50 years from now...

141
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,416
...or even 10 years from now...

142
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
So there's no use
in worrying about

143
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,916
being as good as
the Swordmaster...

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,541
That's why you
always have to live

145
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,166
and fight like
it's your last day.

146
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,333
Or eat like it's
your last meal...

147
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,750
--Cool!
--Nice!

148
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,750
Wow...

149
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,291
They're so bright!

150
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,125
Man, I hope that my last meal
has lots of mushrooms in it!

151
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,875
I want my last meal

152
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,333
to be absolutely
smothered in chili peppers.

153
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:33,333
Oh man, I could go
for a chicken cutlet.

154
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,875
Afro, what about you?
What do you want?

155
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,916
Afro wants lenemode. Right Afro?

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Otsuru, it's lemonade,
not lenemode.

157
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,208
[laughter]

158
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,250
That's not a meal, Otsuru!

159
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,291
--Huh?
--It's okay.

160
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,666
What would you like
on your last day?

161
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,125
I want those!

162
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,500
Those fireworks are
my favorite kind!

163
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,583
Good day, sir.

164
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,916
Well, hello there.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,333
Thank you always for
your kind business with us.

166
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,208
Say, that
Swordmaster of yours...

167
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,208
Is he alright?

168
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,041
Huh?

169
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,000
On the festival evening...

170
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,458
I heard that some rogue tried
to start up a fight with him.

171
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,458
There are some odd
talks around the town

172
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,583
that some sword dojo master

173
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,625
is the owner of the
No. 2 headband,

174
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,000
and they say
that his students

175
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,958
have been brainwashed
to be watchdogs...

176
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,166
What?!
Our Swordmaster wouldn't...

177
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,916
Sorry! Sorry!
I didn't mean to...

178
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,625
I mean, there are plenty of
other Swordmasters everywhere.

179
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,458
So it must be some other man.

180
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,125
Jinno. Did I wake you?

181
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,125
You should get some rest.

182
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,875
Master... I smell blood.

183
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,375
I was attacked. But that
fool lost his life instead.

184
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,458
Sasuke.

185
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,625
Jinno.

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,416
Afro.

187
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,708
On this day, we
commemorate your graduation.

188
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,083
You are now great warriors.

189
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,375
Use wisely the sword skills
you have acquired.

190
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,666
Master...

191
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,458
Yes, Afro.

192
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,958
There is something
I would like to know.

193
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,208
Afro.

194
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,958
Are you really No. 2?

195
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,208
Afro.

196
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,958
After the midnight...
before the bodhi tree...

197
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,000
I will be waiting.

198
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,041
I meant to take the
secret to the grave.

199
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,625
But I see I have no choice.

200
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,666
Choose, Afro Samurai.

201
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,583
Forget revenge,

202
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:23,583
or fight me to the death...
for the No. 2 headband.

203
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,625
But know you well this truth.

204
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:33,875
If you win, you will know
no friend, no joy, no love.

205
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,250
Only the murderous violence

206
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,333
the No. 2 headband
incites in the heart

207
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:43,166
of every man who desires
the power of the No. 1!

208
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,208
Truly, can you
handle that burden?

209
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,583
Afro!

210
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,500
Master?! What's going on?

211
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,041
Master! Please stop!

212
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,916
Afro! What are you doing?

213
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,250
Master?

214
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,791
There he is!

215
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,375
Quit wasting your
time with that kid!

216
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,541
--Jinno...
--Fight us!

217
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,958
That No. 2 headband is mine!

218
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,333
Master!

219
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,625
Jinno, take everyone and run!

220
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,041
Run and live.

221
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
Now you will see what it means

222
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,916
to wear the No. 2 headband...

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,125
Master!

224
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,458
Master!

225
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,666
Fool! Stay out of this!

226
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,500
Master!

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,250
Stay away from me!

228
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,833
Let's see whatcha got.

229
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,291
[crying]

230
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,041
Playtime's over, kiddies.

231
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,333
Sasuke! No!

232
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,083
Jiro! Matasaburo!

233
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,583
Otsuru!

234
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,250
Jinno!

235
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,333
Jinno!

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,375
Afro!

237
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,375
You have chosen your path.

238
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,833
Afro... No...

239
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,541
Don't...

240
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,916
Why?

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,208
Why did you kill our master?

242
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,041
What have you done?

243
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:32,333
He's dead! And you...
you chose revenge...

244
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:37,333
...over our master...
Over everyone!

245
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,041
We're your family...

246
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,041
Why?

247
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:46,416
For my true father...

248
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,125
What about us...

249
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,166
What about us?!

250
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,458
I...

251
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,625
...treated you
as my brother...

252
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
I will...

253
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,916
...never...

254
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,583
...forgive you!

255
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,125
Jinno!

256
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,916
Hey, Afro.

257
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,708
Who...?

258
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:45,166
Whatcha waitin' for? You really
sure that's the right decision?

259
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,833
I mean... if you don't
wanna wear it... it's ok, man.

260
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,875
Don't do it man...
seriously, don't do it...

261
00:22:53,958 --> 00:23:00,041
Damn... there goes the
neighborhood... Heh heh heh....

262
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,875
Good.

263
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:11,250
I'm glad you've lasted this
long. I want you to die slowly.

264
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:18,375
I want you to burn, bleed,
suffer as I have!

265
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:23,583
Kuma, what is taking so long?
Just finish him off!

266
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,958
I take orders from no one!

267
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:32,583
How dare you! You will obey
my orders and finish the Afro!

268
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,833
You must not fail as
the Empty Seven have.

269
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,666
Don't compare me to them.

270
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,875
I don't care about the
useless headband...

271
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:46,375
I just want Afro!
I want him hurt.

272
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,791
I want him crippled.

273
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,541
He'll bleed for all
the pain he's caused.

274
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,875
Do what you want, then...

275
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,291
You don't know how
long I've waited...

276
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:08,208
...to avenge the deaths of those
who loved and trusted you!

277
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:11,250
[mechanical breathing sound]

278
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:30,750
My tears have never stopped
falling since that day...

279
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,166
Jinno...

280
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,541
Arrgghhhh!
