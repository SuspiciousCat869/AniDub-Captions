1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:01:03,750
[Heavy breathing]

2
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,125
You can't get away, kid!

3
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,416
Don't make it hard on yourself.

4
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,750
Be a good boy and hand
that No. 2 headband

5
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,291
over nice and slow like.

6
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,416
Stop right there, kiddo!

7
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,208
You draw that sword
and you're dead.

8
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,375
What the hell is with you, kid?

9
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,166
You've got to learn
to respect your elders.

10
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,958
Lookie here.
Now I'm the No. 2 warrior.

11
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,541
I'm comin' for ya, No. 1!

12
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,000
What the hell is this?

13
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,083
This kid is really
some kinda freak!

14
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,500
He's carryin' a rotten head
around in his backpack!

15
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,000
Agh! Wait a minute,
I know that guy!

16
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:47,916
That's the old No. 1.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,291
Yeah, you're right.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,458
Here, give it to me.

19
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,750
[laughing]
Whoa!

20
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:01,333
Heh, heh, heh, you
want this back, kiddo?

21
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,041
Then catch!

22
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,458
Kids these days.

23
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,291
Yeah, they got no respect.

24
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,208
--Let's go.
--Yeah, heh, heh...

25
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,375
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

26
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,333
Oh, sleepy head!

27
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,250
Jinno! Jinno!

28
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow, check this out.

29
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,125
Some piece of work!

30
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,125
He won't wake up, Jinno!

31
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,750
What? Whoa!

32
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,875
Master, master!

33
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,708
The bandits must have got him!

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,833
This is bad!

35
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,708
Two guys yesterday
and now a kid.

36
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,125
He is not a morning person.

37
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,166
Oh my god, he's alive.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,541
Master! Master! He's alive!

39
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,541
[chuckles] He's just sleepy!

40
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,958
Don't get up yet.

41
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,291
You've been badly
wounded and poisoned.

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,041
It will take some
time for you to recover.

43
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,208
We discovered you
bleeding on the riverbank.

44
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,708
It's a miracle you didn't drown
with your arm so badly broken.

45
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,625
I am called Okiku.
I can take care of you.

46
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,666
Rest, mighty samurai.

47
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:34,333
Don't be alarmed, of course
we know you're a samurai.

48
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,541
For who else but a samurai
could clutch his sword

49
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,250
in a raging river
while poisoned,

50
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,083
unconscious, and
with a broken hand?

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,208
Sleep. When you awake,
I'll have a meal prepared.

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,041
Damn, you one lucky dog, Afro!

53
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,375
[chuckles]
You look like a mummy!

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,208
Cut it out, Otsuru!

55
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,958
Do not worry, young Afro.

56
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:11,250
In my dojo, we are all wounded
orphans. You are among friends.

57
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,916
Treat him well, my students.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,541
Yes, master.

59
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,250
Go! Go! Go!

60
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,458
Strike the ground
with yourself!

61
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,666
How can you wield a sword
if you can't dig a hole?

62
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,416
You're mad at the dirt, Jinno?

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,375
Your body is all stiff.
Think less... Relax.

64
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,458
I'll stay calm and flowing,
like a river, humph!

65
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,291
Cheer up, Afro.

66
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,458
Oh, I see we up!

67
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,333
Think I wasn't
going to find you?

68
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,666
I just took a little R&amp;R,
but look at you, boy!

69
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,333
All bright-eyed
and bushy tailed!

70
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,500
Fish, flowers, sunshine!

71
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:16,041
I see somebody's getting
their lil' resort on! Ha, ha!

72
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,666
Wooo, I betcha that babe,
wh-what's her name?

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,958
Okiku. I bet she tastes a hell
of a lot better than trout!

74
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,208
Don't think I didn't notice her
checking you out! Uh? Uh?

75
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,666
Don't tell me...

76
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,333
You ain't noticed?!

77
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:35,416
Sh... This place is bananas!

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,291
I'm thinking, shit...

79
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,291
I'll even go find me a little
hottie to kick it with...

80
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,708
Feed me some cold noodles....

81
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,333
...massage me,

82
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,666
...get all sweaty...

83
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,000
You know what I mean?

84
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,125
If she's got a friend,
maybe we can do an orgy,

85
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,375
you know? Huh? Huh?

86
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,458
Awight-awight, awight-awight...

87
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,916
So you ain't the
swingin' type... awight.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Still, I'm getting' my sex on.

89
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,375
You know, getting
your Jimmie waxed

90
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,208
just might help you recuperate.

91
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,125
Awight-awight, you relax!

92
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,375
You want to do your night
solo on the low low...

93
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,250
Cool.

94
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,708
Don't forget--my cellie is off.

95
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,041
You must not fight over food.

96
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,458
Come on, Afro.

97
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,083
We're all waitin' on you, dude.

98
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,208
We've got fishing duties down at
the river, don't you remember?

99
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,833
We're gonna be late.

100
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,750
Ah, you know how everyone gets

101
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,166
when there's not enough
fish to eat around here.

102
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,291
Look, I don't mean to push, but
you really oughta wolf it down,

103
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,208
we'll need all your strength.
Tricking fish ain't easy!

104
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,416
Tricking fish ain't easy..
Wolf 'em down! [chuckles]

105
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,708
Come on!

106
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,166
Let's get to it!

107
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,666
[laughter]

108
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,375
Look, they're escaping.
Let's grab 'em.

109
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,125
--Yeah!
--Let's grab 'em!

110
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,958
You ready for this, Otsuru?

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,625
Fishie!

112
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,541
Nice and fat, just like
the doctor ordered.

113
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,500
It's what the master
calls the single beat.

114
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, cook it up, then we
can have a quadruple treat.

115
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:52,000
But there's six of us... isn't
that a ... sextuplet... treat?

116
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,833
Huh?

117
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,583
I mean...

118
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:02,833
[laughter]

119
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,291
Oh, I must have disturbed
you in the middle of a dream.

120
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,958
Was it pleasant?

121
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,750
Forgive me, I'm being nosy.

122
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,541
It's time for your medicine.

123
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:36,083
Your wounds heal well,
master samurai.

124
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,083
So, tonight I will cook
my special fish for you.

125
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,583
You do like fish, don't you?

126
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:57,083
Huh! Huh! Huh!...

127
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,375
Fresh vegetables?
Fresh vegetables?

128
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,875
Not interested, kid. Beat it.

129
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,541
Ah, no luck today.
Let's go home, Afro.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,833
So, about
No. 2... Is it true?

131
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,291
That's what they say.
Apparently he's back in town.

132
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

133
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,208
Whatever.
Like you got what it takes

134
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,083
to be the No. 2
warrior of the world!

135
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,000
What the fuck?
What's this kid doing here?

136
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,125
Where is the No. 2?

137
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,291
Who?

138
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,791
The No. 2 headband.
Tell me who has it.

139
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,833
Umph, I don't know
what you're talking about!

140
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,291
Ugh!![scream]

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,041
Tell me where he is.

142
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,916
You little cocksucker!

143
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,500
[grunting sound]
You think you're a killer, boy?

144
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,625
Huh?!

145
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,291
I'll show you a killer!

146
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,791
When you fight to kill...
Finish the job.

147
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,166
Target is confirmed.
Yes... he's still injured...

148
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,750
An easy prey for my skills.

149
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,750
Yes, I understand your point.
But my master brother,

150
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,416
I would give my life to
work in your inner circle...

151
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,625
Can you do it?

152
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,916
Yes, please let me
slay the Afro Samurai.

153
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,791
Urghh....

154
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,916
Supper is ready.

155
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,791
What's the matter?

156
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,416
Thanks for everything.

157
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,375
You're leaving?

158
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,333
Tomorrow...

159
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,916
Please, keep it
for your travels.

160
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,666
<i>Katajikenai.</i>

161
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:23,916
Will you not stay with me?
For just one more day?

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
There'll be a summer festival

163
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,416
tomorrow night
at the village below.

164
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,166
If it's not too much to ask,

165
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,375
will you stay and watch
the fireworks with me?

166
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,291
Foolish boy.

167
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,625
Never speak to me
of such things again.

168
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,375
Games of power... revenge...
they lead to nothing!

169
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,708
Do you really know what
it means to be the No. 2?

170
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,833
It is a life of murder.

171
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,583
We are born MEN in order
to live, not to kill!

172
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,166
You must break the chain...

173
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,083
Only then can we be
free of this terrible cycle.

174
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,333
What is this?

175
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,791
Swamp water...

176
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,333
Just try it!

177
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,500
Will it put hair on my chest?

178
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,250
Ew, it tastes like crap!

179
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,416
Here, Afro, you try it.

180
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,166
[gulping]

181
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,583
Looks like this boy is the
only one with real taste.

182
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,708
Can I have some more?

183
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,083
Is he for real?

184
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,750
Afro, you don't
have to be polite.

185
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,500
It's like I always say, if
heaven could be bottled...

186
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:53,208
...it just might taste
like my lemonade.

187
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,750
Lenemode!

188
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,250
Lemonade...

189
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,500
Lemonade...?

190
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,458
Lemonade!

191
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,291
Lemonade.

192
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,750
Hey, kid... We know it was
you that killed our brother.

193
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,416
Too bad you have to pay for it!

194
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,125
You little son of a bitch!

195
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,250
What the... Huh?

196
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,791
Hey, that's my... knife.

197
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,208
How did you...?

198
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,916
You little...

199
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,916
Aghhh!

200
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,541
You ain't gonna
get away from me!

201
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,583
This can't be, ugh!

202
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,916
--I got him.
--Good!

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,416
Don't let him get away!

204
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,541
Now, let's see you spit
swamp water, brat!

205
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,041
He, heh, he...
you are dead now.

206
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,541
Hey, shorty!

207
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,916
What was that?

208
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,250
What did you just call me?!

209
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,208
Oh, shit!

210
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,583
Afro!

211
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,916
--Yahh!
--Leave him alone!

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,333
Behind you!

213
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,083
Afro!

214
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,333
Fucking brats!

215
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,416
What the--

216
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,333
Shit! It's stuck...

217
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,625
Dammit!

218
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,125
I'll kill you...

219
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,958
Holy smoke!

220
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,791
Killing some little kid

221
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,833
is normally against
my principles...

222
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,166
But, when you cut
my pal's brother...

223
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,666
...you entered the
world of killin', boy!

224
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,458
Before I kill you,
remember this!

225
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,666
If you're gonna swing a sword,

226
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,500
you better be ready
to get cut by one too!

227
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,750
Say your prayers... aghh!

228
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,916
Damn it!

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,291
You missed.

230
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,708
You piece of shit!

231
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,708
Freakin' kid.. I should have...

232
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
Do you know where No. 2 is?

233
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,916
[strained]
What was that?

234
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,833
I want to see No. 2!

235
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,875
What for?

236
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,500
To kill him! I'll kill him!

237
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,500
Stop laughin' and tell me!

238
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,875
He's already dead.

239
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,083
What?

240
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:46,416
There is a new No 2.
You'll never find him.

241
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,083
He's probably long gone.
Heh, heh...

242
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:16,250
Yes... yes... no...
I need more time.

243
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,791
I haven't acquired
that data yet.

244
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,833
What I do have has been
downloaded on to my cell phone.

245
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,750
Yes... yes. Understood.

246
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,416
Sorry.

247
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,125
OKIKU!

248
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,500
Are you there?

249
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,791
Yes...

250
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,333
What is the matter,
Disciple Okiku?

251
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,583
Nothing. Everything
will be taken care of.

252
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, hello. Brother 2 here.

253
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,583
Yo, yo, yo, Afro!

254
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,208
Can I ask you something?

255
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,541
Now I know you cast away
your feelings an' all, but...

256
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,333
Does that mean casting
away your manhood too?

257
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,458
Ooh... Mama-sans don't
get much better than ol' girl.

258
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,208
She's sweet. Pretty.

259
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,708
Knows her first aid, can
broil a mean fish dinner...

260
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,541
I'd call that practically
marriage material.

261
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,208
C'mon now, confess...

262
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,375
You want to hit that booty.

263
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,083
I just want to see my
boy happy, you know.

264
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,875
Seriously, man.
Now don't you think

265
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,750
there's something vaguely
familiar about that woman?

266
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:53,083
Look. If you ain't gonna
knock them boots, I will.

267
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,375
Go on, then...

268
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,083
Care for some?

269
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,541
It's lemonade. Do you like it?

270
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,250
I do.

271
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,166
Good.

272
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,916
Oh, they're beautiful.

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,958
This is my favorite
time of the year...

274
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,458
Fireworks and
the festivities...

275
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,541
The people coming and going...

276
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,458
Everyone just simply
having a good time...

277
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:37,333
So where are you traveling to,
if I may ask?

278
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,375
East.

279
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,833
East...

280
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,583
Oh, I love this kind.
They're my favorite.

281
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,583
It's all because of you!

282
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,916
Forgive me. I've become a
ninja of the Empty Seven clan.

283
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,666
I've been siphoning
your memories

284
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,541
to copy your sword skills!

285
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,125
But I can't...
I can't do it anymore...

286
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,750
To me, you're still
that same boy

287
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,708
from those wonderful
times so long ago.

288
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,833
Get out of my way...

289
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,083
Otsuru!

290
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,333
Lord Afro!

291
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,583
Run!

292
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,791
You fuckin' whore! This is the
price you pay for your betrayal!

293
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,458
The data...

294
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,666
We have obtained the data.

295
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,958
That's enough, Brother 6!
We are leaving!

296
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,958
Damn shame, ain't it?

297
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,500
Just when you start
getting your groove on,

298
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,625
shit's always gotta get killed,
burnt down, or whatever...

299
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,083
Hey, you know, your afro got a
little scorched there, Holmes...

300
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,250
You listenin' to me?

301
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:31,166
Man. You really are a
cold-blooded motherfucker.

302
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,416
Hey...

303
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,250
How about we keep this little
memento of your lady friend?

304
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,916
Ha, ha, ha!
