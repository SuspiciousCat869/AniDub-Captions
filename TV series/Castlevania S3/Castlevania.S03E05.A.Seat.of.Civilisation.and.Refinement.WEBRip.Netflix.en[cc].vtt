18
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

24
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because there wasn't

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

27
00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:26.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

30
00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what to think about it.

31
00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:34.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

34
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

sometimes.

35
00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty sure your nice little house
has a door on it.

37
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone can always
knock on my door.

40
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be able to see it properly.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're an actual Belmont.

42
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I grew up with stories
about your family.

43
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Scary bedtime stories?

44
00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mostly.

45
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They still tell them here,
you know.

46
00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:12.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they have a different ending now.

47
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

48
00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They end with "And the Belmonts
aren't here to save you anymore,

49
00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:20.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if you're not good,
the monster will come and eat you up."

50
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Christ.
-Yes.

51
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Lindenfelders are
a basic kind of people.

52
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honest to the point of brutality.

53
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not one of them?

54
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

55
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't be part of the town
and also rule it.

you will always be...

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
held apart from
the rest of your world.

58
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was born here, so I can claim
to be a Lindenfelder.

59
00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But my family and I left
when I was young.

60
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We moved to the capital,
you see.

61
00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

62
00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"I'll never see this place again."

63
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I remember thinking the same thing
as I left<i> my </i>old house.

64
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Places have a strange way
of catching back up with you.

65
00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh.
I suppose so.

66
00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:06.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like some roads are circular.

67
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I rose in the court at the capital,
and did just well enough...

68
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I was sent back here
to head the town.

69
00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:16.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In my experience,
no good deed goes unpunished.

70
00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you miss the capital?

71
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I only passed through it
a couple of times.

72
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, coming back here
to run the town

73
00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was an odd little revelation for me.

74
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The same stories happen in cities,

75
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:33.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but there are so many people in cities

76
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that the stories just rush by.

77
00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:39.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, every little story is a<i> huge </i>thing.

78
00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A farming accident. A sickness.

79
00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:45.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A lost child. A death.

80
00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have an importance
to the whole place.

81
00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:49.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't happen in cities.

82
00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:55.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So: how long have you and Sypha
been traveling together?

84
00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:57.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Couple of months.

85
00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were supposed to go
and rejoin her caravan, but...

86
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
things happened along the way.

87
00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:09.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And at some point, we decided
to just keep moving, I suppose.

88
00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Judge] Well, it doesn't sound like
you decided much of anything.

I suppose not.

90
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not really a man with a plan,
are you, Belmont?

91
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't especially trust
men with plans.

he's a man with a plan.

93
00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:26.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's what they're like.
-Fucking charlatan.

94
00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:28.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We used to see them in the capital,
his type.

95
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

98
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:38.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Judge] God knows.
Maybe he's finally hit bottom.

99
00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

fucking around with his first knife?

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:58.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's my job to pay attention to it.

[Trevor] I have to say, running a town
does not sound like it's fun.

108
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has its little pleasures.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's here.

115
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:23.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really here.

116
00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This way?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were told where to stay,
Saint Germain.

119
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I absolutely am.

120
00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:20.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Except that you appear
to be in front of me.

121
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:23.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, terribly embarrassing, really.

122
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was looking for somewhere discreet
to urinate.

123
00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:30.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go outside like everyone else.

124
00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:31.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

125
00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you think I would believe

126
00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:36.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you were looking for somewhere
to piss down here?

127
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I-I-I recently spent time
in the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt

128
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where public toilets
are often accessed by step.

129
00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:45.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And since Lindenfeld is so obviously

130
00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:48.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a seat of civilization and refinement,
I thought--

131
00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:49.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Outside.

132
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Outside. Indeed.

133
00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:57.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Public toilets.

134
00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:00.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does this really look
like a palace to you?

136
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

137
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:31.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello?

138
00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:33.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been watching the priory
for a while now.

139
00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:35.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you? That's nice.

140
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since you are a Speaker,
I imagine that distracted you

141
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from the usual Speaker pursuits
of memorizing limericks,

142
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
boiling vegetables,
and casually reproducing.

143
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:48.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] I<i> am </i>a Speaker.
Good eye.

144
00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have two, in fact.
-So do I.

145
00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:55.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see that only the monks enter or leave
the priory-- Except for you.

146
00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I am very special.

147
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're also a magician.

148
00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:04.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have two eyes, too.

149
00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd prefer not to speak of that.

150
00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? You've made no secret of it.

151
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little tricks for the townsfolk.

152
00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:13.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots of talk.

153
00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes. For good reason.
-What reason?

154
00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's just say I like it better
if people here believe

155
00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:22.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a traveling scholar
and an itinerant trickster.

156
00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you're saying is,
you'd like it to stay that way.

157
00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been unconscionably rude.

158
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also recognize a threat
when I hear it.

159
00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:40.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I imagine you're used to them.

160
00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:44.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've disrespected you,
and I apologize.

161
00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:48.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am Count Saint Germain.

162
00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:51.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm Sypha Belnades.
Speaker Magician.

163
00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:54.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you travel with
the Belmont boy.

164
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do.

165
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:59.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is bad magic being done
in that place, Saint Germain.

166
00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:01.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What exactly is it?

167
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] All right.

168
00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a thing I am in search of
inside the priory.

169
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is occult in nature.

170
00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:13.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is quite safe,
if operated wisely.

171
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I am quite sure something else
is going on in there.

172
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It stinks of night creature.

173
00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But my only interest
is in that one thing.

174
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I would respectfully ask

175
00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:27.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
- that you go forth and--
-Stop.

176
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. That's worrying.

177
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've seen
the armbands they wear.

178
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. And now I see this.

179
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The alchemical sign for Saturn.

180
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And lead, denoting transformation
and redemption.

181
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the scythe:
time and the harvest.

182
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How did they come by the sign
they wear on the armbands?

183
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They say their Visitor
gave it to them.

184
00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The night creature
that attacked the priory.

185
00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did it give them this one, too?

186
00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:01.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What in the name of God
is going on in there?

187
00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:06.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God? I understood you Speakers to have
quite the fractious relationship with God.

188
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On today's evidence,

189
00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:09.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if Christianity
hasn't gone out of fashion.

190
00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:13.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, God was terrible.
He was fierce and jealous.

191
00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:16.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We all know the old stories of God,
and we fear him.

192
00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Yeshua, the Christ?

193
00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:21.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His sacrifice was a lesson
in how to love unconditionally.

194
00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:24.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which only makes sense,
as my grandfather always said

195
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we want our children
to exceed us in every way.

196
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're an unusual woman.

197
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Trevor says that.
-Does he really?

198
00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:37.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, he says I'm crazy.
But what you said is what he<i> means.</i>

199
00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:40.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you did not answer my question.

200
00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:42.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm honestly not certain.

201
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am focused entirely
on my personal goal.

202
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're all quite mad.

203
00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this does seem...

204
00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:50.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
odd.

205
00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor]
"Odd" is seeing that mark...

206
00:12:54.292 --> 00:12:56.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
twice in one day.

207
00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:59.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, I'd like you to meet my new friend,
the Count Saint Germain.

208
00:13:00.417 --> 00:13:02.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We've met.
-Yes.

209
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:04.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should apologize to you, too.

210
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:08.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was simply trying to find out if
you were here for the same reason I was.

211
00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Given the nature
of your family business and all.

212
00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what reason is that?

213
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:15.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's personal.

214
00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:17.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need a drink.

215
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:19.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you need a drink,
Saint Germain?

216
00:13:19.792 --> 00:13:20.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not.

217
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, you do.

218
00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:26.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's all go to the tavern
and have a quiet little chat.

219
00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:30.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd prefer something more private.

220
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There won't be any monks
in the tavern,

221
00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:36.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's just public enough
to stop me slitting your throat,

222
00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:40.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or Sypha setting you on fire.
Move.

223
00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:41.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You-You wouldn't?

224
00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:44.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, he wouldn't really
slit your throat.

225
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I could kill you by looking at you.

226
00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:04.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come.
Show me how you attack.

227
00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:09.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would, but you wouldn't let me
have my bow.

229
00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:17.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Archers run out of arrows all the time.

230
00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:20.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to see how good you are
when it comes down to a blade.

231
00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:22.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah. [laughs]

232
00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:51.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is your sword so long?
I can't get close.

233
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want to get close?

235
00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:05.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never let a vampire in close.

236
00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:07.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm half-vampire.

237
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Half of me wants you
to step in close enough

238
00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:11.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for me to bite out your throat.

239
00:15:11.917 --> 00:15:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I have a bow and arrows!

240
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

-Get him, Sumi!

245
00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have both just been eaten
by vampires.

246
00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:44.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, we captured him
and made him our slave.

247
00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:45.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make lunch now.

248
00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I do like that you've remembered
how to still be human.

249
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:52.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This human could eat lunch, too.

250
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, fine.

251
00:15:57.042 --> 00:16:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After which you're going to show me
how you attack from a distance.

252
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:02.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to see what I have
to work with here.

253
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're working with hungry people.

254
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:09.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carry me to the castle
and make lunch, slave.

255
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And after that?
[chuckling]

256
00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:16.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After that we'll see what's in the armory
that might suit you better.

257
00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:20.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then, we may talk about
simple combat spell-casting.

258
00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:24.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But first, I will magic
you greedy children up some food.

259
00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:47.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugh. I'll be glad when I've finished that.

260
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you really
an ale drinker, young magician?

261
00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm developing a taste
for the rougher things in life.

262
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She means me.
-I mean him.

263
00:16:59.042 --> 00:17:01.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, a rounded education
is a good thing.

264
00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:05.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The stories I could tell you
about my days in the slums of Paris.

265
00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:10.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that one marvelous night
when I invented a drink.

266
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I made it from anise, fennel,
and the mystical wormwood root.

267
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:18.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But nobody remembers because we woke up
three weeks later somewhere in Latvia,

268
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
stark naked and utterly drenched in--

269
00:17:19.875 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saint Germain. The priory.
What's your interest?

270
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

271
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not trust people, generally.

272
00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:32.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Speakers are honorable...

273
00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:36.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the pedigree of the house of Belmont
speaks for itself.

274
00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:40.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you heard...

275
00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:44.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the Infinite Corridor?

276
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Yes.

277
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I suppose
this was the wrong company

278
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:54.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to unveil ancient occult secrets in
and expect to be impressive.

279
00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:56.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our remembered stories conflict.

280
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:59.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some say the Infinite Corridor
is a pathway to other worlds.

281
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Others say it's a portal to Hell.

282
00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only one of my family
ever encountered it.

283
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:07.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She said it was like a door
into<i> countless </i>levels of Hell.

284
00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:11.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was in a castle in Livonia.
She knocked the castle down.

285
00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:15.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm. Your family tends to be
destructively direct.

286
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you're both right.

287
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Infinite Corridor is a route
to many other worlds.

288
00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:24.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's certainly possible
that one of them is Hell.

289
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:30.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, in the experience of those
of my particular expertise,

290
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it is in fact a system of doors
to other lands,

291
00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:37.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
separated from our own
by space and time.

292
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A long time ago...

293
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lost someone very dear to me

294
00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in the Infinite Corridor.

295
00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:51.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have been looking
for a way back in ever since.

296
00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:54.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Portals to the Corridor
are few and far between,

297
00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:57.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and they drift in and out of existence.

298
00:18:58.042 --> 00:19:02.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a portal to the Infinite Corridor
under the priory.

299
00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:07.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They haven't let me go down there yet,
but I know it's there.

300
00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:09.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lithomancy.
-Indeed.

301
00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:12.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jewel has guided me here
to the portal.

302
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, if I'd known there was a portal
under a pile of stones in fucking Livonia,

303
00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:18.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't have had to traipse across

304
00:19:19.042 --> 00:19:21.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the entire gaping gray asshole
of Eastern Europe

305
00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:24.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to trick my way past
a gaggle of mad monks, would I?

306
00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ugh! Christ alive, do you people
shit on the grapes?

307
00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:32.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who did you lose?
-Does it matter?

308
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you know why I'm here
and what I'm about,

309
00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:36.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it has nothing to do with
random alchemical signs

310
00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:38.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or Sala's crazy horde.

311
00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:41.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, all right, calm down.

312
00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:43.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have no enemies at this table.

313
00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:46.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just stay out of my way.
That's all I ask.

314
00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:49.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want to see it,
do you?

315
00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:50.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See what?

316
00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:52.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A night creature landed on a priory

317
00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:55.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that has a portal
to other worlds under it.

318
00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:58.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
