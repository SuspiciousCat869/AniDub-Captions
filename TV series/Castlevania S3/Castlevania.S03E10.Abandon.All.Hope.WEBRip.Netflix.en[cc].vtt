He is bound to me
through the spell on these rings.

338
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When he makes a night creature,
they’re loyal to him,

339
00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:50.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he swore loyalty to me,
so they’re loyal to me, too.

340
00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:53.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All these rings are linked.

341
00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:58.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wear the ring, and his night creatures
will be loyal to you, too.

342
00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:03.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if Hector ever tries to harm us,
or take it off, or run away,

343
00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:05.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
his ring will cause him so much pain

344
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that he’ll think
he shat out his own heart.

345
00:22:09.042 --> 00:22:10.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Problem solved!

346
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bloody hell.

347
00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In return, we’re going to convert one of
the old outbuildings for him to live in.

348
00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:21.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re going to make it nice.

349
00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:25.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s going to live just as well as we do,

350
00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:27.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he’s going to have
freedom of the castle.

351
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don’t think so.

352
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do. He gets something back from this.

353
00:22:33.458 --> 00:22:37.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He gets a comfortable life.
He gets to feel safe.

354
00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:40.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

355
00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shush. [whispers]
The real people are talking.

356
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:45.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Morana will make the arrangements.

357
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Striga will organize the forging.

358
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla will agree to all this
and live with it.

I’m not a genius. She is.

361
00:22:56.917 --> 00:23:01.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The vampire sister
had her own scheme all along.

362
00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:03.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

363
00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:06.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You adopted him!

364

Carmilla.

All right. Fine.

366
00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:12.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore]
Oh, and the house

367
00:23:12.792 --> 00:23:14.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
will need a really big bed.

368
00:23:14.417 --> 00:23:16.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It turns out
he’s actually fairly good at sex,

369
00:23:16.708 --> 00:23:18.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I want to train him.

370
00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:20.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get away from me. Uck, seriously.

371
00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:21.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please leave now.

372
00:23:21.583 --> 00:23:23.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t think I needed that information?

373
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Bye-bye.

375
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You tricked me and made me your slave.

376
00:23:41.583 --> 00:23:42.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did no such thing.

377
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You made me a slave.

378
00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:49.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My life is over!

379
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your life is saved, Hector.

380
00:23:53.542 --> 00:23:56.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I gave you
what you always really needed.

381
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made you into my pet.

This could not have gone more wrong.

384
00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:33.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

385
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ve spent a couple of months

386
00:24:42.417 --> 00:24:44.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Adventures and victories.

387
00:24:45.292 --> 00:24:48.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now, we’re living<i> my </i>life.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well.

390
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose I could've
put up big signs all over the place.

391
00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:30.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do not enter. Danger of death.

392
00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:32.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

393
00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That sort of thing.

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:51.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this seemed to work well enough

396
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
