00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

227
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:38.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this is new.

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:51.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with a night creature pack

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:56.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:02.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

234
00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:09.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

247
00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:43.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

248
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:44.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this is a night creature
of Dracula's horde.

255
00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is.

256
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you kill it?

257
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

258
00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:23.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

259
00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The horde betrayed Dracula at Braila.

260
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:32.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Murder at the hands of vagabonds
and a long dragging behind a wagon

00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:35.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is no less than they deserve.

262
00:20:36.167 --> 00:20:37.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Betrayed him?

263
00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:40.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula is dead. Didn't you hear?

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We did not.

266
00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:46.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you know this?

268
00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:52.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Information still gets carried
between minsters.

269
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vampires were trapped at Braila,

270
00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:59.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they told of his castle
being flooded with holy water

271
00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and sent back to Hell.

272
00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:04.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They said they felt his death.

273
00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:09.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would very much like to know
who killed him, Speaker.

274
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

275
00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:14.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So my men can punish those responsible.

276
00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:20.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dracula sought to reunite us all in Hell
with his beloved wife.

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
OK, then. Nice to meet you.

278
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:27.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was a Speaker woman at Gresit.

279
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:30.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are Speakers everywhere.

281
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They would only have given aid and comfort
to those harmed by Dracula's hordes.

282
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

283
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is time for you and yours
to move along now, Prior.

284
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indeed. We shall give thanks.

286
00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:02.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We suffered an attack

287
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:04.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a difficult night for the priory.

288
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:07.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, though, when it was learned

289
00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:10.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the actions of the Church
were what unleashed it all,

290
00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it just sent Prior Sala
and his people quite mad.

291
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear. What a shame. Never mind.

292
00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:21.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's been taking in refugees
of a similar turn of mind.

293
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

296
00:22:29.792 --> 00:22:32.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not until I feel a little safer here.

00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:37.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

301
00:22:48.792 --> 00:22:51.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give you two coins for each tooth.

00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:55.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:00.542 --> 00:23:03.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you'll have to get them out yourself.

311
00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:16.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:20.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For food, and for somewhere to sleep
that<i> isn't </i>the back of the wagon.

314
00:23:24.292 --> 00:23:29.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I'm used to sleeping in wagons,
but it is nice when you stop.
