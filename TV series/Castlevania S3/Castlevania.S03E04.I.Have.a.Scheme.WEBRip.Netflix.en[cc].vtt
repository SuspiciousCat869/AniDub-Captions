00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:53.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But can it be done?
Militarily?

108
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ahh. Pfft!

109
00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In theory?

110
00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:02.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need more intelligence
from the territory.

111
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But in theory?
You said it'd be hard to police.

112
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, would we have to throw
a stockade around the corridor, or...?

113
00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

114
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The border would be entirely notional.

115
00:08:14.666 --> 00:08:18.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a question of putting
rotating sweeper patrols on the border,

116
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
building watchtowers,
taking towns,

117
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and forming fortified camps
to concentrate the humans in.

118
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you know you can do it.

119
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:29.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, maybe.

120
00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:30.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Possibly.

121
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:33.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it would be hard.

122
00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:36.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anything worth doing is hard.

123
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And just think: if we did this,

124
00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:43.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you would be commanding
the army of an empire.

125
00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

126
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:49.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We would own and control the land
from here to Braila.

127
00:08:49.416 --> 00:08:51.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost to the Black Sea.

128
00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not a country or a region, love.

129
00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:55.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's an empire!

130
00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:58.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An imperial army.

131
00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:02.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from empires of old.

132
00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:07.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you can win the war,
I can perfect the machinery of empire.

00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:13.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is how she does it.

135
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:19.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

her madness work.

00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:21.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:24.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

139
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:25.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Imagine.

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we have a scheme!

149
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I thank you again

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:51.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish you'd stop talking to me
like I'm insane,

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:58.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:01.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:14.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:54.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You can start here.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:58.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:00.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:05.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the grand scheme of things,

00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:07.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you persuaded me

171
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that there may yet be
something of worth in them.

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:13.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:25.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

your wall hanging is crooked?

174
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:29.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It got knocked askew

175
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not something we give
too much thought to.

176

Where the night creature came from.
Your "visitor."

179
00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:47.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do we call them
"night creatures,"

180
00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:48.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, because...

182
00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:55.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they only come at night, I suppose.

183
00:12:55.875 --> 00:13:00.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or it's a simple translation
of a very long Prussian word.

184
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:02.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they bring light.

185
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:06.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The very name Lucifer
means "light-bringer."

187
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not at all.

188
00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:16.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God created everything.

189
00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:19.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God created Hell.

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:21.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

191
00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:24.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then causing Lucifer
to go to Hell is his plan.

192
00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:29.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The wisdom of Hell
and its night creatures

193
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:32.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is God's wisdom.

194
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you see how it all
begins to make a terrible sense?

195
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:40.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is indeed fascinating.

196
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

197
00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how did you arrive at that symbol
to identify yourselves?

198
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This?

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:52.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those of us who bore witness
to the visitor wear it

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:55.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because he gave it to us.

201
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:57.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:23.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course. This hall only...
for the moment.

00:15:09.916 --> 00:15:11.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

225
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

226
00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:50.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Understanding the territory.

227
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

228
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a drifter, Sypha.

229
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't roll up in

231
00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:03.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

232
00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:05.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could just ask people
some questions.

234
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

235

237
00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:17.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gladly!

238
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:20.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just have
a few questions for you.

239
00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:24.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

240
00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:27.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

244
00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:43.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
OK... we are travelers,

245
00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:45.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
pausing here for a few days.

246
00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:48.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And my idiot servant here, and I,

247
00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:52.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
couldn't help but notice
your pretty priory...

248
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and...

249
00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:56.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
your armband.

250
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hadn't gotten
a close look at that before.

251
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:02.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Enough. Move away.

252
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prying eyes.

255
00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:10.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyone who tries to interfere.

256
00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:13.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyone who gets
in the way of the work.

257
00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:16.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

The Visitor gave it to us.

259
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the work?
What are you doing in there?

260
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more.

261
00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:27.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

262
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:29.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, in the interests of a quiet life,

263
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:32.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give you this one chance.

264
00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:35.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone here knows
not to approach the priory.

265
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone here knows
not to ask questions.

266
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You leave us alone.

267
00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:43.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have work to do.

268
00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:45.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

269
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:48.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you<i> very </i>much

270
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have your whip ready.

271
00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:55.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just one more thing.

272
00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Speakers tend to be
natural prey in towns,

273
00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because we don't carry weapons.

274
00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:04.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we all learn how to spot
when someone's concealing a knife.

275
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you think monks
wearing a magic sign for Hell

276
00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:12.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and hiding blades in their robes
is a little obvious...

277
00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:13.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even for a small town?

278
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see you.

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:31.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor] Are you sure
you didn't overplay it?

282
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:33.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, you do have a... habit of... uh--

283
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps.

284
00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:39.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But quietly confident people
are competent and careful.

285
00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:41.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nervous people make mistakes.

286
00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd rather they were nervous
than happy in their work.

287
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:55.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and annoying some mad monks
would do the trick...

289
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have done it
my fucking self.

290
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:00.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:20.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Fair. Did the apple
buy me another question?

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:41.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:44.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

What was Dracula
going to give you?

314
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were helping build an army
for Dracula.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:00.416 --> 00:21:02.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't understand that until later.

319
00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:05.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought it was gonna be a cull,

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:14.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is exactly<i> our </i>plan.

323
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So he lied to you?

00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:23.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He... He withheld.

326
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:26.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Well, never mind.

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:27.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was he going to give you

328
00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:30.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for doing this work
that he lied to you about?

329
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:34.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What was your reward for serving
a man who lied about his intents?

330
00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:36.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ach.

331
00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:39.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I-I assumed I would live outside
whatever enclosures

332
00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:42.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
were placed around
the remaining humans.

333
00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:44.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You "assumed."

334
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure there was ever
a conversation, as such.

335
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:50.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He would have continued
to need night creatures.

336
00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:52.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He seemed to value my advice,

337
00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:54.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so maybe I would have
kept a role in his court.

338
00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:58.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Assumed."
"Seemed to." "Maybe."

339
00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:00.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you not want a reward, Hector?

340
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:04.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or were you just expecting one
would be presented?

341
00:22:07.708 --> 00:22:11.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So... what do you want?

342
00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:14.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wasn't necessarily
looking for a reward.

343
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believed in his work.

344
00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:18.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But obviously
you expected something.

345
00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:21.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if that was only to be spared
from the slaughter.

346
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:25.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or to be kept in a cage.
[laughs]

347
00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:26.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that worked out well.

348
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckling]
-Seriously.

349
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:32.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Other than shoes.

350
00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:35.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, this isn't
a serious conversation.

351
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:37.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it is.

352
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:40.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because Carmilla
has commenced her plans

353
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:42.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to place the human population
under controls.

354
00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:45.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mercy kills,
and if you'll forgive the term,

355
00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
humane feeding.

356
00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:52.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the same plan that
Dracula presented to you, yes?

357
00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Much the same.

358
00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:55.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Only<i> he </i>was lying...

359
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and planned to exterminate
the human race, yes?

360
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:01.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

361
00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:03.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not lying.

362
00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:06.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we don't expect you
to work for free.

363
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or even for shoes.

364
00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:10.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're bribing me,
you mean.

365
00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:13.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, for God's sake.
We're paying you.

366
00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:15.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody here holds a grudge, Hector.

367
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not saying Carmilla pushed you here
on a wagon filled with feather down.

368
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:21.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was pissed off, yes.

369
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:26.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if she'd left you in Braila,
do you think you'd be alive today?

370
00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:28.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might still have my shoes.

371
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you would have died
with your boots on.

372
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:33.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm.

373
00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:37.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula would have protected me.

374
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:41.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know he would.
-Oh, I'm sure.

375
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though he'd decided to kill
every human being on Earth

376
00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:46.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because they murdered his wife.

377
00:23:46.541 --> 00:23:49.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure you would have been
the only survivor of the human race.

378
00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makes perfect sense.

379
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the bright side,
after everybody on Earth was dead,

380
00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:57.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you could have had your pick
of any house you wanted.

381
00:24:00.458 --> 00:24:02.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unless he was lying to you.

382
00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what if you're lying to me?

383
00:24:04.666 --> 00:24:07.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't have to lie to you.

384
00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:09.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no interest in faith.

385
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Faith makes for terrible diplomacy.

386
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is simply commerce.

387
00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:19.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In commerce, we don't have
to have faith in each other, do we?

388
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:20.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't have to guess.

389
00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:23.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's simple.
There are rules.

390
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I give you something,

391
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:27.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you give me something.

392
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:38.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You understand that when
I forge a night creature,

393
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:40.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they are bound to my command.

394
00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their loyalty is to me.

395
00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, maybe we'll talk
about that another time.

396
00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:47.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Until then... I'll get you some shoes.

397
00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:50.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what do I have
to give you in return?

398
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:52.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Talk to me some more.

399
00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

400
00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:56.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About?

401
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:58.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever you like.

402
00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:01.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the sound of your voice.

403
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're interesting.

404
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, look at you.
Beaten down a dozen different ways,

405
00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:07.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you don't give up on yourself.

406
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:10.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's... nice.

407
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[footsteps recede]

408
00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:22.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't promise a nice pair.

409
00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So long as
they don't have holes in them.

410
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:27.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, so now you're a fucking aristocrat?

411
00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:30.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hector laughs]

412
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:33.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have nothing to fear from me.
We're just leaving.

413
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sergeant] No.

414
00:26:36.666 --> 00:26:37.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No?

415
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:41.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. You will not enter Genoa.

416
00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:44.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get back on your ship,
with your monstrosities, and leave.

417
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:49.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems my ship has already left.

418
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has a shrewd captain.

419
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It took his wit to show me
that I'd stopped praying.

420
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you imagine that?

421
00:26:59.375 --> 00:27:03.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I stopped praying and devoting myself,
and I hadn't even noticed.

422
00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:07.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a monster I have become.

423
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want me to be a monster
right here in your nice port, do you?

424
00:27:13.916 --> 00:27:15.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let us pass.

425
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:17.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

426
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My ship is gone,
and I need to go north.

427
00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:24.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let us through.

428
00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:28.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll drive you and your filthy creatures
into the sea if we have to.

429
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know what's been
happening in Wallachia.

430
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will<i> not </i>happen here.

431
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Isaac] Ohh.

432
00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:39.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cannot believe
this is happening again.

433
00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absurd.

434
00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
