51
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

kill a lot of people at once?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

are so stacked against us.

wandering around the castle all night.

67
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not an obvious thing to find in a church.

Uh, Prior Sala?

111
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prior Sala!

112
00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:54.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, good. Saint Germain.

113
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A question, Prior.

114
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sala] We are quite busy
this morning, I'm afraid.

115
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Th-This book. Do you recognize it?

116
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. I don't.

117
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

118
00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:09.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's an unusual book
to find in a church.

119
00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Old priories are known to find themselves

120
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
storing old and unusual books.

121
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indeed so.

122
00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:18.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But someone recently <i>read </i>this book, Sala.

123
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After which they tore a section out.

124
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Many of these books are damaged.

125
00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:26.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't see why this should excite you so.

126
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because the tears haven't yellowed, Sala.

127
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The section was removed
within the last few months.

128
00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:35.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The soot on the edges is still loose.
And--

129
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I wonder...

130
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:41.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who selected this book
from your collection?

131
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:46.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I fail to see why this should interest me.

132
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:50.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the missing section
involves methods and processes

133
00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:52.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

134
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:55.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps someone simply pulled out
those pages

135
00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to wipe their backside with.

136
00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand they use paper for that
in the Orient.

[scoffs] This book was written by
a forgemaster some two hundred years ago,

138
00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:11.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
an <i>insane </i>forgemaster

139
00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:13.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there any mention of Dracula?

140
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. But you miss the point--

141
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you had better get back to work.

142
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

143
00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:27.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You told me not to treat you
as if you were mad.

144
00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

149
00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:44.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll find no fresh bodies
to kill and forge here.

153
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:56.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're alone here?

154
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Entirely.

It's not every day
you see a one-person village.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once upon a time,
you may have found it quite over-full.

157
00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:17.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:19.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was <i>teeming.</i>

159
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:25.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly?
Sometimes I like it a little better now.

160
00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you do this?

161
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

162
00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite outside my powers.

163
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:37.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a town thirty miles up the road.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:39.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:42.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

166
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since that is the direction I'm headed,

167
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
perhaps you'd give a traveler
and fellow practitioner

168
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a friendly warning?

169
00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:55.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can smell me, too?

170
00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:57.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see you.

171
00:11:58.958 --> 00:11:59.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

172
00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:04.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The town is run by a magician.

173
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has dreams of a city,

174
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a slave population to build it.

175
00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:13.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So he swept up the surrounding villages,

176
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cooked their souls down to ash...

177
00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:21.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
turned them into ants.

178
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make them eat shit

179
00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:27.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But... you're still here.

181
00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:32.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

182
00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:37.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you let this magician
take your neighbors.

183
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder why.

184
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:45.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unless, of course, you're not quite
what you pass yourself off as.

I'm just not as strong as I was.

189
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:17.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

190
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does.

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:26.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am Isaac.

193
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:33.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were able to protect yourself, but...

194
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:37.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was able to frighten them away from me.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the magic is thin now.

196
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't do a thing for anyone else.

197
00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had to just watch.

198
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The magician never came back for you?

199
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:56.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has no reason to.

200
00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can still defend myself,

201
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he wouldn't be able to turn me.

202
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:06.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And how much use would I be to him,
anyway?

203
00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:10.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has what he needs.

One day the Styrians will
punch through the cities that enclose them

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:22.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and swarm across the country.

208
00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:25.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to Styria.

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:27.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have people to kill there.

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:43.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Styria is still
a good two weeks' ride from here.

00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:46.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

214
00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:49.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could not do a thing.

215
00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:54.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
