00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31
00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose.

32

33
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleeping in a bed was nice.

34
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bed was actually pretty good.

36
00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm used to sleeping under trees.

37
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleeping in the wagon is nice, too.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Better than sleeping under trees.

39
00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:25.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See? So we should get in the wagon
and roll on out of here.

40
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm? Roll on out of here?

42
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:34.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what we do.
Belnades and Belmont.

43
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We roll out and hit the road
and fight nasty hovering death goats

44
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:46.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

47
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:49.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never liked goats.
Horrible eyes.

48
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know
that some people have sex with them?

49
00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:54.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I've heard.

50
00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall we buy some food for the road?

51
00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:58.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because we're having fun, right?

53
00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I admit it. I do. You and me.

54
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're doing good things,
and it's been pretty far from boring.

55
00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:12.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, also...

56
00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lindenfeld is starting
to give me the creeps.

57
00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:19.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think
they really worship Dracula?

58
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you both
please accompany me?

60
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

61
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, I like tea.

62
00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:36.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I... don't.

63
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:42.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

64
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

65
00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

67
00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could have told me that yesterday.

68
00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your local monks
made me think that perhaps

69
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
our names shouldn't be said out loud.

70
00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since they apparently love Dracula,

71
00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you're really the last Belmont?

78

His castle was attacked.

215
00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:46.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dracula threw me to the desert
through a magic mirror.

216
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To save my life.

217
00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That doesn't sound like someone who
wants to kill all the people of the Earth.

218
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was confused. He was grieving.

219
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were other vampires
conspiring against him.

220
00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:07.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they were aided
by the other human in the court.

221
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:14.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was certainly confused.
And also betrayed.

222
00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just can't get the staff any more.
Believe me, I know.

223
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:22.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should talk to
some of the freaks I have on my crew.

224
00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now you're sailing back to Europe
to find Dracula?

225
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe he is dead.

226
00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:32.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have other reasons to return.

227
00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was given this by a man in Tunis.

[Isaac]
It showed me

231
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:48.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the other human in the court
is being kept prisoner

232
00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:52.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by one of the vampires
who schemed against Dracula.

233
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a nice gift, though.

234
00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:55.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The man who gave it to me said

235
00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:59.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it was in exchange
for saving him from Hell when he died.

236
00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:05.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After which, the men-at-arms of Tunis
attempted to drive us out,

237
00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:10.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they were full of hatred and fear,
like all people.

238
00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:13.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he laugh when he said it?

239
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He did, actually.

240
00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then it<i> was </i>a gift.

241
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:22.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean,
can you save people from Hell?

242
00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:24.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a forgemaster.

243
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can take demons from Hell,
and install them in dead bodies on Earth.

244
00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:31.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Captain]
That's quite a trick.

245
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:35.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a skill, learned over many years.

246
00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:41.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vampires cannot do it.
It requires a human connection.

247
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why?
Vampires can learn magic.

249
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:52.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hell is populated by humans
who went against the will of God.

250
00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:57.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
says that one day Hell will be emptied

252
00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:02.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and its doors will rattle in the wind.

253
00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:08.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Through my hand, God lifts the damned
from Hell in his mercy

00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:13.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to enact their penance on the Earth
as my soldiers.

255
00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I'd heard every story,
but that's new to me.

259
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you learned how to do this.

260
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did.

261
00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Captain]
And other things, too, I'll mark.

262
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have some other skills.

00:16:36.042 --> 00:16:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now you sail to Europe,

264
00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:42.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to exact revenge
on the people who betrayed your Dracula?

00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:43.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I do.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

267
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Styria, home to Carmilla,
who rules that region.

268
00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:51.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then what?

269
00:16:52.042 --> 00:16:52.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

270
00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:56.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, after you've had your blood.
What will you do then?

271
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take up your Dracula's cause
and kill all the people in the world?

272
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might.

273
00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:06.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

274
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:09.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

you become part of someone else's."

277
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:20.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because I invented it.
You're welcome.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You saw that I have a knife, right?

280
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:37.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why live out a dead vampire's story
when you have your own story to tell?

282
00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:43.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dracula's "story," as you put it,
is right and good.

283
00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:46.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:48.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:53.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And yet yesterday,
a man gave you a gift and made a joke.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:59.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is the port authority trying to run
you and your beasties out of town.

00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

291
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:09.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

293
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe we do all deserve to die.

294
00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But maybe we could be better, too.

295
00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you kill us all,
you end human cruelty, yes.

296
00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:25.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you end human kindness, too.

297
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:31.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No more jokes. No more gifts.
No more surprises.

00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:36.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would a man
with all your fantastic knowledge

299
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:40.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not use it to teach people
how to be kind?

300
00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:41.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

301
00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Revenge is good.

00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:52.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you become a ruler of a place, Isaac.

00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:53.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

345
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:02.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

358
00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:06.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can call the guard and ask him
to get you some sprinkles.

That's quite the picnic you have in there.
I never think of vampires as eating food.

362
00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:19.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the blood that gives us
our essential nourishment, of course.

363

It'd be silly not to, wouldn't it?

to cause you any more harm.

371
00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:47.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
