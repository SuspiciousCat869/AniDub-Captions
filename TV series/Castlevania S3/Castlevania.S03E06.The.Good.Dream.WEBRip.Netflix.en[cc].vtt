Well, look at you. Almost human.

There. Upright on your hind legs
and everything.

Thank you.

-But?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing about moving right now

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that I think it'll feel nice
when I<i> stop </i>doing it.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. You didn't want
to go for a walk, then?

11
00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Well, I could hardly take you for a walk

12
00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with your bits flapping around
in the open air, could I?

13
00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bird might think your penis was a twig
and fly off with it.

14
00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Well.

15
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, come on.
A little smile won't kill you.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good boy.

17
00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now then,
would you like to go for a walk?

18
00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:18.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit of fresh air in the starlight?

19
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I would, yes.

20
00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:22.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sadly, there's a condition.

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not my idea. Striga insisted.

24
00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:37.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be quite comfortable.
She just wanted a little extra security.

25
00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're ten times stronger than I am,
Lenore.

26
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Striga pointed out that you're a magician.

27
00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you do want to go for a walk,
so...

28
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would you mind?

29
00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Fine.

30
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:54.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good boy.

31
00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. It's a lovely night, don't you think?

38
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bloody chilly night.
It was warmer in my cell.

39
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because we channel waste heat
around the castle with pipes.

40
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Even to the cells?

41
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:40.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I keep telling you.
We're not monsters.

42
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hector] Dracula's castle
moved heat around with pipes.

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Is that vampire magic?

44
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Lenore]
Actually, just science. Centuries old.

45
00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:56.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The thing is, Hector,
humans forget things and vampires don't.

46
00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a lot to learn.

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And will I get the chance to?

48
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So dramatic.

49
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:05.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Relax and enjoy the night.

00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Daylight can be nice, too.

53
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take your word for it.

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't remember daylight?

55
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:24.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never much cared for it.
I was always a night person.

56
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might be missing something, you know.
Only coming out at night.

57
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't think so. Just look.

58
00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't see how the sun
would improve<i> this </i>view.

61
00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:47.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. I admit it.

62
00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fantastic.

63
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See? It's not so bad here, is it?

64
00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:56.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could do without this.

65
00:03:58.375 --> 00:03:59.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it hurt?

66
00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. It just reminds me of the last time
someone put a collar on me.

67
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore]
In Braila?

68
00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hector] When Carmilla almost killed me.

69
00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, she does have a temper.

70
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:11.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she would never
have meant to kill you.

71
00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] No.

72
00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:15.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because she needs me
to be her forgemaster slave.

73
00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:19.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, because if she'd meant to kill you,
you would quite simply be dead.

74
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmph.
-And if she'd meant to torture you,

75
00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you would have arrived here

76
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:27.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
carrying your guts in both hands
with a spike up your arse.

77
00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:30.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hector chuckles]
I suppose that's true.

78
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I can see her doing it.
In nightmares and such.

79
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:37.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She does have a temper,
but she's logical.

80
00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:40.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She never lets it run away with her
to the point of, oh, I don't know,

81
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
condemning the entire human race
to death?

82
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a recent example

83
00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:48.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of what being genuinely insane
with murderous rage looks like.

84
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:49.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

85
00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:54.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You may not have been
treated like a boy king on your way here,

86
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you did show up alive.

87
00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:57.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Might have been nice, though.

88
00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:00.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
Have you considered that you're only alive

89
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you listened to Carmilla
back in Dracula's castle?

90
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:05.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hadn't. She tricked me.

91
00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore scoffs]
I don't think she did.

92
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she made complete sense to you,
and you felt guilty,

93
00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
understandably,
about how it all played out.

94
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She made me betray Dracula.

95
00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:20.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore]
No, she didn't.

96
00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:23.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She showed you the old man was insane,

97
00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and she saved you from the consequences.

98
00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:30.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody here wants to harm you.

99
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We just don't quite trust you yet.

100
00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:38.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You did try to hurt me, Hector.

101
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's she saying about me?

102
00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:51.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lenore is saying
you're a mean, nasty woman.

103
00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cheeky little tart. Is it working?

104
00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:57.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seems to be.

105
00:05:58.417 --> 00:05:59.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:24.917 --> 00:18:28.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:36.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:48.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of the nature of the divine

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
