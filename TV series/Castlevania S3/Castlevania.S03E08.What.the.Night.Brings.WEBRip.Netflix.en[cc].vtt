00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you still awake?
It's the middle of the day.

7
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm redrawing my plans.

8
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Carmilla's gotten inside your head.

9
00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If her scheme is going to work,
we need to move fast,

10
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before the humans regain control
over the region in question.

11
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, I don't think that's likely.

12
00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's been no intelligence
from the capital of Wallachia.

13
00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They could be preparing for a move.

14
00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or they're all dead.

15
00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't know.

16
00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I have to factor that in.

17
00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:12.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. You should sleep.

18
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:16.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can possibly push east
as far as Lake Balaton

19
00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:17.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before I run out of soldiers,

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that exposes our Western border.

21
00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:21.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleep.

22
00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't do it without Lenore
turning the forgemaster,

23
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she's just taking him out
for fucking walkies.

24
00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:29.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She will land him.

25
00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's going to have to be soon.

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come to bed.

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[inhales] And the weapons!
The supply lines!

28
00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:42.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ohh! I worked all that out earlier.

29
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-It's just money and time.

30
00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did the calculations.

31
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then calculate this.

32
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:52.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need dead bodies,
but we also need feeding stock.

33
00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:56.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hector can make every human from here
to Balaton into a night creature,

34
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that leaves us with nothing to eat.

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes,

36
00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but surely you know how the regions
surrounding Styria defend their borders

37
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
against the four terrible vampire women
in the castle.

38
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:11.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With soldiers.

39
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They don't have that many soldiers.

40
00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They hire mercenaries.

41
00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:18.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Soldiers, mercenaries,

42
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
local forces-- what's the difference?

43
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The difference is
that mercenaries can be rehired

44
00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by the opposing side for more money!

45
00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But...
there's no honor in that.

46
00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but there is money.

47
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we can deplete the forces
rallied against us

48
00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:41.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and deploy the men we buy,
as you wish.

49
00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can actually do this?

50
00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:48.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was an administrative problem,
and I solved it.

51
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carmilla]
Can you not keep it down?

52
00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:56.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can hear you through several walls
and three snoring boys.

53
00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:58.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Morana]
I do not want to know.

54
00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:01.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing in
the middle of the bloody day?

55
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Making your scheme work.

56
00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:08.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't have to "make" it work.
It was bloody genius.

57
00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:11.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good morning. I'm going to bed.

58
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we're all awake now,
we might as well have a drink.

59
00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you can tell me
how you helped with my scheme.

60
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:19.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

61
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You call it a scheme?

62
00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a scheme.

63
00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:26.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rude.

64
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:30.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if you insist... we can have a drink

65
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and tell you how
we'll be ruling an empire next year.

66
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Lenore can do her part.

67
00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, now I definitely need a drink.

68
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think she's fucking adopted him.

70
00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's holding things back from us,
you know.

71
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's lonely. He wants us to stay.

72
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he did kill his father.

73
00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the people who helped him left.

74
00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:11.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just him in a dead castle
guarding a ruined house.

75
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Taka]
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

76
00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:16.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He rid the world of Dracula,
and this is his reward.

77
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that he thinks he deserves it.

78
00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The loneliness?

79
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumi]
He killed his own father.

80
00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:27.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He wants to be punished for it.

81
00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Taka]
Even though he had no choice.

82
00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:32.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems that he probably killed Cho, too.

83
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the very least, Cho died
as a result of his attack on Dracula.

84
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumi]
Now home is more unprotected than ever.

85
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he has so many wonderful things.

86
00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can do so much for us.
Give us a future.

87
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Taka]
But he stays here

88
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's as close to death
as he can manage

89
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without killing himself.

90
00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should do something for him.

91
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give him a reward.

92
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can it be after I've had a nap?

93
00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:03.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've read so much, my brain hurts.

94
00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] So lazy.

95
00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:07.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not lazy.

96
00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I conserve my resources
for important efforts.

97
00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like eating?

98
00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, did we miss lunch?

99
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe Alucard can make lunch again.

100
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:19.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And dinner.
-One more dinner?

101
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:24.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, sooner or later, I'll have to
start preparing my own food again.

102
00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:29.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And meals taste better
when someone else makes them.

103
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:32.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Taka]
That's what I always say.

104
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:34.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Sumi]
I know.

105
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
All right, then.

106
00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:37.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lunch and dinner,

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:40.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Aah!

114
00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you wandering around again?

115
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, n-n-no, not at all.

116
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just stretching my legs

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:05.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The knees, you know.
Not what they used to be.

118
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:09.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I spent too much time
crouching down with your wonderful books.

119
00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:12.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] I see.

120
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
H-Honestly. Wonderful.

121
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've learned<i> so </i>much.

122
00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:20.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What... have you learned?

123
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I believe many of
the previous occupants of this place

124
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
had a real interest
in contacting Hell itself.

125
00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:33.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean we are not the-- I mean...

126
00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:35.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this has happened before?

127
00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:36.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the past.

128
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clear to me
that there<i> have </i>been attempts

129
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to open a door to Hell here.

130
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:47.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, this entire structure
could be contaminated.

131
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I worry for your health, Sala!

132
00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I myself may have developed
a nasty cough and a slight limp.

133
00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:54.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You shouldn't be here.

134
00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two of our number have gone missing.

135
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But our work is almost done here.

136
00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:04.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not soon enough, Sala!

137
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They may have expired
from the Satanic poison

138
00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:10.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

139
00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:12.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't leave right now.

140
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you must! You must flee, Sala!

141
00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:17.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flee?

142
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're absolutely right, Prior! Flee!

145
00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:32.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

146
00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:36.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why don't you tell me how many of you
there are in that priory?

147
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

148
00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:39.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a bit late.

149
00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not as many as there used to be,
but more than enough.

150
00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:48.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[snorts] What, have you been
eating each other in there or something?

151
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've been leaving-- for days!

152
00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:54.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a few of us, one a day.

153
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Walking to other towns,
spreading the word.

154
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like an infection.
-Like evangelists.

155
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Passing on the knowledge and the plan.

156
00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:08.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring Hell to this abandoned Earth.

157
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Judge]
This is Sala's plan?

158
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is our Visitor's plan.

159
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He spoke to us.

160
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:17.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We heard his voice in our heads.

161
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since that moment,

162
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything has been clear.

163
00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really did drive them insane.

164
00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:27.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The monks may actually
be the victims here.

165
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:31.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Night creatures have magical powers.
It may have distorted their minds.

167
00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:35.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got a night creature
under the priory.

168
00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:37.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Judge]
They didn't kill it, they hid it.

169
00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:39.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. One second.

170

171
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Carry on.

172
00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:48.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The priory is in ruins.

173
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suspect it's been deconsecrated.

174
00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a night creature
being held on a basement level,

175
00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:55.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
symbols drawn around it.

176
00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:58.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Corridor is in that same basement.

177
00:09:58.292 --> 00:09:59.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's alive down there?

178
00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:03.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yes! I didn't even get the sense
that it was in pain.

179
00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:06.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's proximity to the Corridor
is suspicious.

180
00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's waiting.

181
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:11.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sala and his men are enacting
some kind of plan

182
00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:14.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
involving these alchemical symbols.

The same symbols we've seen?

184
00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indeed! Combined!

185
00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:22.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are pages missing from volumes
in the priory's old library.

186
00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The application of alchemy
is honestly f-fascinating.

187
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They completely ignored the best part
of the books stored in the priory.

188
00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:32.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two persons who have gone through
death and rebirth

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
can be fused into The Rebis,

190
00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:37.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the ultimate alchemical goal,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and they didn't even think of it--
-Saint Germain. Focus.

192
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Y-Yes, yes, of course.

193
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just, the missed opportunity
to complete alchemy itself!

194
00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could save the very world!

195
00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:52.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's settle for saving this town.

196
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Indeed. I feel as if
I've been led here.

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To find the Infinite Corridor,

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to achieve the ultimate goal
of philosophy,

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:04.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to be... [stammers]
a hero.

200
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

distance.

into actual language for me.

204
00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:21.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have enough information yet.

205
00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:24.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All you need to know
is that the priory is desecrated

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:27.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they are somehow working
with a living night creature

207
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who has taught them magic.

208
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:32.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sadly, that is all entirely possible.

209
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can handle the night creature,

210
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:38.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'd rather not wade through
a small army of mad monks to get to it.

211
00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll summon my men-at-arms by stages.

212
00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:44.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to cause alarm
or give Sala warning.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:47.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when the townsfolk will be indoors.

will need to get under the priory with me.

215
00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your people shouldn't be
anywhere near that.

216
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make a hole for us,
and keep the monks off our backs.

217
00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:59.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do we really have time
to wait for sundown?

218
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:02.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my town. You do as I say.

219
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We must have strategy
and force of numbers.

220
00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:07.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This will be done properly.

221
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll begin the preparations.

222
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, uh, why would I
be going down there with you?

223
00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:18.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I seem to have missed that part
of your epic plan.

224
00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:19.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor]
Because from what you've said,

225
00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's a night creature
between you and the Infinite Corridor.

226
00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:23.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes...?

227
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we may only have one chance

228
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:28.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get you past it
so you can open the Corridor.

229
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm afraid I don't understa--

230
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Wait!

231
00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:34.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're-- You're actually...

232
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
helping me?

233
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're being... kind.

234
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:41.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, all right, no need
to make a production out of it.

235
00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:43.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well... [laughs]
I'm so sorry.

236
00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:47.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm-I'm-I'm simply not used to people
being kind to me for no reason.

237
00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:50.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's enough.
Keep it down.

238
00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:52.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't want anyone to hear.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

He saw a man try to kick a cat once,

240
00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he broke the man's leg
in three places!

241
00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:59.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor] Well, you don't
do that to cats, do you?

242
00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:01.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sypha]
Three places. I heard three cracks.

243
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor]
Poor bloody cat wasn't hurting anyone.

244
00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:06.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cats just want to get on with their lives.

You have shown us the truth.

246
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:16.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have listened. We have prepared.

247
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have restrained you, as you wished.

248
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have given you time to meditate,
as you asked.

249
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

250
00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:29.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God has abandoned the Earth.

251
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:32.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula must be brought back.

252
00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:34.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is what you want.

253
00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:38.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is what he who forged you would want.

254
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We do this in the name of our Visitor,

255
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and his forgemaster, Isaac.

256
00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When the sun goes down,

257
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we shall do what needs to be done.

[Taka]
The armory here is beautiful.

260
00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expected there to be
more magical weapons, though.

261
00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My father was an accomplished magician.

262
00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:19.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He held enough power within himself

263
00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:22.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that he felt magically enhanced weapons
to be unnecessary.

264
00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:24.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He preferred physical things
to be themselves.

265
00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you?

266
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have a strong opinion.

267
00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:32.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Magic and science
are two sides of the same coin to me.

268
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure the castle can't be moved?

269
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:37.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure.

270
00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:40.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's not something
you're not telling us?

271
00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:42.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

272
00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:46.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you tell us if there's something
you're not telling us?

273
00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me?

274
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just that...

275
00:14:50.417 --> 00:14:53.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there are parts of the castle
that you avoid showing us.

276
00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things you don't talk about.

277
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a big castle.

278
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Filled with centuries of material,
like the Hold.

279
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have plenty of time together,
don't we?

280
00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:06.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, we do.

281
00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:09.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, then.

282
00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:12.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's hungry?

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You didn't hear me enter.
-No.

286

287
00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:34.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like... jasmine and wine.

288
00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:36.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good book?

289
00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:41.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't notice that ring before.

290
00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:44.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? We all wear them.

291
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All?

292
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The four of us.

293
00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:49.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Carmilla, Morana, Striga and I.

294
00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:51.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm presuming there's
some disturbing reason for that

295
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I will regret asking.

296
00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:54.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] Silly.

297
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:57.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look. The black and the red.

298
00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The night and the blood.

299
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are the things
that bind us together.

300
00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rings are a sign
of loyalty to each other.

301
00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] That's actually... well,

302
00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"nice" seems like the wrong word.

303
00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:11.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It<i> is </i>nice.

304
00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a different facet of you all,
I suppose.

305
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like this book.

306
00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:18.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh?
-Yes.

307
00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:22.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a magical work, but it's also--

308
00:16:22.292 --> 00:16:23.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how to describe it?

309
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:27.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vampire philosophy. It's fascinating.

310
00:16:28.292 --> 00:16:30.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now we're not all monsters?

311
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:31.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I didn't say that.

312
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on, admit it.

313
00:16:35.042 --> 00:16:37.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I admit there seems to be more...

314
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
depth to...

315
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what would you call it?

316
00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:45.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vampire culture? Than I thought.

317
00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:49.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are ideas in here
about physical presence in the world,

318
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:52.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the importance of soil and landscape

319
00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and... being.

320
00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:58.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] I mean, actual philosophy.
Amazing.

321
00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:00.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
