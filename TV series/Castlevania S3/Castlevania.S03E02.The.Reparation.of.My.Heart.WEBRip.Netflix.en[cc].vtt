00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In peace.

I smell you, Forgemaster.

9
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:30.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Interesting.

10
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not many people can smell an education.

11
00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not an education.

12
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a curse.

13
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's easy to detect.

14
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just have to know
what Hell smells like.

15
00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you know the smell of Hell?

16
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:54.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smelled it, tasted it, seen it.

17
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are also a man of faith,
aren't you?

18
00:01:57.792 --> 00:02:01.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps a Sufi, I think?

19
00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of a sort.

20
00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:09.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My devotion has been a matter
of interrogation for some years,

21
00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the reparation of my heart
is far away.

22
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you have a God,

23
00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:20.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then you probably also have a Devil.

24
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And if God created everything,

25
00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then he also made Hell.

26
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him, once said,

27
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:35.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"One day there will be
no human beings left in Hell."

28
00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps I'm doing his work

29
00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:42.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there will come a time
when my devotion is perfected.

30
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can this humble collector

31
00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
be of service to you tonight,
Forgemaster?

32
00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In my travels, I have heard tell

33
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you possess
a large Carpathian transmission mirror.

34
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ohh.

35
00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:05.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am so sad to say that
that was some years ago.

36
00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:09.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

by a lovely couple from Kolkata

37
00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:13.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who did not go out during the day,

38
00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you take my meaning.

39
00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:17.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do.

40
00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:18.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn.

41
00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:26.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I have something else
that may be of interest.

43
00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A distance mirror.

44
00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:38.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clever, if somewhat prideful.

45
00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:44.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will read a thought
arranged in your mind's eye.

46
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I indicate,

47
00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
say your name and clap your hands.

49
00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it likes to be called "sir."

50
00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mirror wants to be called sir?

51
00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:04.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't make the rules.

52
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just run the shop.

53
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir! You will obey the wishes

54
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir Mirror, see my wish.

57
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:36.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ha!

There you are!
Are you breathing, betrayer?

59
00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

60
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

61
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

62
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

63
00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:59.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sir Mirror,
who owns this castle you show me?

66
00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was this a useful thing?

69
00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:20.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Extremely. You have my thanks.

70
00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:26.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Take the mirror. It's yours.

71
00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:30.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You would give me
such a valuable thing as a gift?

72
00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would.

73
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:37.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a feeling you haven't received
many gifts in your life,

74
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:40.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it pleases me
to improve that balance.

75
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, I fully expect
to go to hell one day,

76
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that would be a situation
where I would be glad

77
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to be owed a favor
by a forgemaster.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You will get out of this city right now,

86
00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:21.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

87
00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:25.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:50.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

by a single act of kindness in this city.

94
00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:56.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

honest and peaceful.

95
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

anything other than hate from you.

Even though we're sailing somewhere old
and visited often and boring...

111
00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
at least we'll be sailing somewhere.

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:03.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My friends and I
need a ship to take us to Genoa.

115
00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:07.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this is my ship right here.

116
00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then perhaps we'll take<i> this </i>one.

You could. You surely could.

118
00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:17.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to know what they are.

00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:22.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then why are you
still talking to me?

121
00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:25.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I'm interested.

122
00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:27.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I like to do business.

123
00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you tell me you need a ship.

124
00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:32.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I do. It seems suitable.

125
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe I will kill you and all your men

126
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:43.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

128
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who would be left to sail it?

129
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sailing a boat cannot be hard.

If it wasn't hard,
then why would sailors exist?

132
00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

133
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:09.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

offering them coins.

137
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

139
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:23.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and your word that your beasties
won't eat any of my crew.

141
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My word?

142
00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:29.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've just said you've been disappointed

143
00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:31.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

144
00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:34.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That leads me to believe
that you're a man of your word.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

151
00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:50.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

155
00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God knows. Forgot it long ago.

156
00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:03.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't matter.
I'm the Captain.

157
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all you need to know,

158
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:11.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:13.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

176
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:03.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You can't see it yet, so I suppose
it can't weigh very much.

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:51.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:17.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

207
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

208
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

209
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:39.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

you got him to betray his master,

00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:40.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:44.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:03.583 --> 00:20:07.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:07.417 --> 00:20:10.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

330
00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:13.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

331
00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:16.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

bury all of him.

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:23.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:42.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:57.208 --> 00:20:59.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

348
00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:01.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:09.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

are the only riches I desire.

352
00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:12.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

353
00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

354

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:26.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:32.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
