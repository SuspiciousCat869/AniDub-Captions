1
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:13,333
[MAKITA] Risa. This is
your home. Do you understand?

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,000
[RISA'S MOM gasps]
What happened to her?

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,833
[MAKITA] I saw her while I
was on my way home earlier

4
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,208
and said hello,
but she didn't respond.

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,958
She's been acting
really strange.

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,458
It's like she doesn't
remember who I am.

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,750
She didn't even know
where her house was.

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:33,000
[RISA'S MOM gasps]
Risa. What's the matter? Risa!

00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:13,166

[screams]

17
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,291
[RISA]
Makita. What's going on with me?

18
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,625
It feels like I'm
losing my mind.

19
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,625
Why am I having hallucinations?

20
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,833
[MAKITA]
Hm. A giant caterpillar, huh?

21
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,708
I don't know what could've
put something so weird

22
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,000
in your head.

23
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,666
[RISA] Me, neither.
It felt so real. I froze.

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,625
And when I think about the fact
that I might see it again...

25
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,125
Hey, Risa.

26
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,958
Why don't we go for a walk
outside and get some fresh air?

27
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,916
Being in this dark room
all day can't be good

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,083
for your mental health.
Whaddaya say, it might help.

29
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,000
I guess.

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,750
[MAKITA]
Listen.

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,458
There's something important I
don't want you to forget, okay?

32
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,500
[RISA]
Yeah? What is it?

33
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,333
[MAKITA]
I love you, Risa.

34
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,750
I've said that to
you here before.

35
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,208
Remember?

36
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,166
I don't.

37
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,583
[MAKITA]
I see.

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,000
[MAKITA] I can't imagine what it
must feel like to have amnesia.

39
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,458
The thought of losing
my own memories.

40
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,666
It's too horrifying to consider.

41
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,875
All those precious moments,
just gone.

42
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,250
Honestly, I don't think I'd be
able to stand it. I'd be lost.

43
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,125
Hey, I know. We should head
over to my house later.

44
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,166
My Dad'll be there,
but in bed, sick.

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,875
You probably won't see him.

46
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,333
Maybe it'll jog your memory.

47
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,416
[fence creaks]

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,791
[MAKITA]
This is it. Come on in.

49
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,416
[MAKITA]
Dad? You awake? I'm back home.

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,541
And Risa's here
for a little bit.

51
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,250
Guess he must be asleep.

52
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,916
Um, is your father sick
with something serious?

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,208
'Fraid so.

54
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,291
He used to be a
professional writer, you know.

55
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,000
Most of his books were
historical novels.

56
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,041
But since the illness, he hasn't
been able to work on anything.

57
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
[RISA]
And your mom?

58
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,375
I never really knew her,

59
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,708
she died pretty soon
after I was born.

60
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,000
[MAKITA]
Having trouble relaxing?

61
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,041
Oh. No, I'm fine, thanks.

62
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,458
[MAKITA]
I get it. As far as you know,

63
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,083
this is your first time
being here at my place.

64
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,375
Thing is, you've actually
come over many times.

65
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,458
--[shuffling]
--[RISA gasps]

66
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,375
Hey, what's that sound?

67
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,833
[MAKITA] Ah. That's dad.
I guess he woke up.

68
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:22,083
This'll be your second time
meeting him, by the way.

69
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,625
[door creaks]

70
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,458
Oh, Risa. I'm glad you
decided to pay us a visit.

71
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,916
You're too weak, Dad,

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
you shouldn't push yourself
so much. You'll get worse.

73
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,666
I can't stay in bed
for the rest of my life,

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,458
not when our lovely
Risa here is going to

75
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,708
marry you sometime soon.

76
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,583
Dad, why would you bring
any of that stuff up.

77
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,750
Remember, I told you she
lost all her memories.

78
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,666
Ah, yes, that's right.
It's such a shame, my dear.

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,250
But you'll get them back
in no time, I'm positive.

80
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,791
There's no need for you
to worry your pretty head.

81
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,500
Meanwhile, my own body is
just going to continue to

82
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,875
degrade as the days pass,

83
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,875
until there's nothing
left of me but dust,

84
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,125
I don't think I have
long left, you see.

85
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,416
[chuckles]

86
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,791
[MAKITA'S DAD]
Risa, when I'm gone,

87
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,166
please take care of my son.
Can you do that for me?

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,541
Will you be a dutiful wife to
him once you're married?

89
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:23,041
[MAKITA] Dad, don't say things
like that, you'll weird her out.

90
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,083
This is complicated enough
already without you.

91
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,416
She doesn't remember us
getting engaged or even dating.

92
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Please, just let us take
care of this ourselves.

93
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,875
I guess that makes sense.
You probably don't need

94
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,291
an old man like me getting
involved in things.

95
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,833
In that case, I'll retreat
back to my room.

96
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,583
I'm starting to
get tired anyway,

97
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,083
so I could use some more rest.

98
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,750
I hope you have a
good night, Risa,

99
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,083
it was really great
to see you again.

100
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,875
[MAKITA'S AUNT] Please do take
good care of our little darling,

101
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,458
you dear, sweet girl.
He's everything to us.

102
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,875
[RISA]
Huh?

103
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,125
[door creaks shut]

104
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,958
[RISA] I'm so anxious.
And I've been even more nervous

105
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,750
ever since I got back
from Makita's house.

106
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,458
I'm not sure what this
feeling is, exactly.

107
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,041
But I think I saw a horrible
sight at that place before.

108
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,416
Something absolutely terrifying,

109
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,750
and I lost my memories
because of it.

110
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
But what could possibly
be so scary that it

111
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,416
made me have total amnesia?

showed up at the door.

[gasps]

115
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,666
[RISA'S MOM] What are you doing
sitting in here in the dark?

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,375
Come on, get out of bed,
you shouldn't keep him waiting.

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,208
He seemed like he
was in a big hurry.

118
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,375
[RISA grunts]

119
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,166
Risa. I apologize for
dropping by like this,

120
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,291
but it's important.

121
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,750
[RISA]
Huh?

122
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,208
My dad's condition suddenly
took a turn for the worse.

123
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,125
He's been mumbling about
how he'd like to see you

124
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,375
just one last time.

125
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,458
Can you come over to
my house right now?

126
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,666
Well. I'm not really sure.

127
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,541
[MAKITA]
Please!

128
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,875
[RISA gasps]

129
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,666
[MAKITA] Dad? I brought Risa
with me! Everything'll be fine.

130
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,708
She's right here.

131
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,666
[breathes heavily]

132
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,083
[RISA gasps]

133
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,041
[MAKITA] Don't be scared.
What you're looking at

134
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,166
are the collective
heads of my ancestors.

135
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,875
You see the one on top of Dad's?
It belonged to my aunt.

136
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,791
Then there's my grandmother's.

137
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,083
And then my great-uncle's
after that.

138
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
Followed by my great-grandmother

139
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,583
and my great-grandfather
and his siblings.

140
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,666
And so on, and so on.

141
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,916
They're connected together
in an unbroken chain

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,291
that goes back generations.

143
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,083
nd by linking his own brain
along with the others,

144
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,583
my Dad is able to share
all their memories.

145
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,250
[MAKITA'S DAD]
This is it.

146
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
I can feel my life
slipping away from me,

147
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,958
I won't last longer
than a few more hours.

148
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,500
You must hurry and do what needs
to be done, our family needs

149
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,875
an heir, that's the most
important thing, a successor!

150
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,333
I understand, Dad. I won't fail.

151
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm going to be a part
of this collection one day.

152
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,916
I'll add my head to
the group as well.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,291
I remember it all.
Everything's coming back to me.

154
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,000
[MAKITA] That's great!
Your memories returned?

155
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,291
So, you must remember
how much I love you

156
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,708
and how I proposed
to you, right?

157
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,458
And you said "yes" when I asked
if you'd be with me forever.

158
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,333
You said you'd marry me,
remember, Risa?

159
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
Yeah, but...

160
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,250
[MAKITA] There's nothing you
need to be worried about.

161
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,833
The only thing you have to do is
give birth to a child who can

162
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,375
inherit my wisdom
after I've passed.

163
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,666
When my father dies,

164
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250
I'll be all that's left of
my family's family.

165
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,833
So, you see, I have
to have an heir.

166
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,125
Otherwise our line will die out.
It'll be like we never existed.

167
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,791
The countless memories
we've accumulated

168
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,041
over these generations will
have been for nothing.

169
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,375
They'll disappear.

170
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,708
It can't happen. I won't
allow it, dammit!

171
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,208
I can't. I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

[MAKITA] Risa. You tripped
over the chain of

179
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,750
my ancestors' heads.
They go so far back.

180
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,583
There's so much knowledge.

181
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,875
I don't have any time left.
I won't let you run from me.

No! Stay away!

Hurry up and catch that girl.

[MAKITA'S MALE FAMILY A]
That's right! Hurry!

197
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,916
If you let her leave, it's going
to be that much harder for you

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,291
to find a wife and get an heir.

199

[MAKITA'S MALE FAMILY B]
Go now!

Before she has
the chance to flee!

I get it. I hear you.

Just give me a second
to get myself together.

203

If I'd have known Dad was
going to die so quickly,

204

I would've acted sooner and this
would have been much easier.

But, don't worry Auntie
and Great-Uncle.

[MAKITA'S MALE FAMILY D]
Oh, what a relief!

Now our family's

like this, but here they are!

been travelling with the circus.

was right after the troupe

take my eyes off her.

00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,041
I wouldn't blink if I were you!

310
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,916
Well, well, what's this?
Joe's lying down on the ground.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,166
Hm, what's he going
to do, I wonder.

312
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,166
I'm on the edge of my
seat, too, my friends.

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,416
[RINGMASTER]
Remarkable!

314
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,916
The knife Joe threw in the air
missed his head by a hair!

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,250
Joe himself is the target now!

316
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,208
I wonder what Newton would say
about the gravity of this trick.

317
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,208
First the apples came
falling through the air,

318
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,833
now these blades! Will Joe
end up being peeled tonight?

319
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,833
Or will he make it out of this
trick with his skin intact?

320
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:21,875

321

[imitates drum roll]
And, moving on.

322
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,916
Next up is our very own
fire-breathing muscleman.

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,750
Please welcome, Dragon Thunder!

[RINGMASTER]
The human rocket!

[imitates drum roll]
Now then, everyone,

331
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,166
it's time for our final
act of the night.

332
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,125
A team-up between a stunning
maiden and Papyrus's most

333
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,416
handsome young man.

334
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,708
It's Mario and Lady
Lelia's trapeze act!

335
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,666
[LELIA]
Don't do it!

336
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,291
[RINGMASTER]
Huh?

337
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,666
[LELIA] Mario. Don't swing
on the trapeze!

338
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,250
It's a trick by the ringmaster!
Listen, he's not human.

339
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,791
He's a demon! Death itself!

340
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,625
He's killing people
to collect their souls

341
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,541
and passing it off to the
audience as sick entertainment.

342
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,541
And he's using me to do it!

343
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,583
Mario. If you swing
on that trapeze,

344
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:46,166
I promise you will die!
Get down from there, now. Hurry!

345
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,041
Please, Mario, I love you!

346
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,500
Don't worry. I won't
make a mistake.

347
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,500
Everything'll be
just fine, Lelia.

348
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,125
I'll make sure this show
goes off without a hitch.

349
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,541
I'm going to become the
star of this damn circus,

350
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,250
and then you and I will finally
be able to marry each other.

351
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,708
[LELIA]
Mario...

352
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,791
Here I come, my darling!

353
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,708
Mario!

354
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,291
[LELIA screams]

355

[RINGMASTER sobs]

356
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, my word. What pain.

357
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,583
What an unfounded
tragedy this is!

358
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,458
The Papyrus Grand Circus
is now in dire straits

359
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,833
due to the loss of our
wondrous performers.

360
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,000
So many brilliant artists have
died in terrible accidents

361
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,125
tonight that we can't continue!

362
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,250
All that remain are the
witless clowns and myself,

363
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,958
an aging ringmaster,
and of course...

364
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,291
...the beautiful, but absolutely
helpless young girl, Lady Lelia!

365
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,625
Please. Please, won't any of
you in in the crowd help her?

366
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,000
Would any of you join us,

367
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,000
and, with the help of
your youthful talents,

368
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,541
revitalize the great
Papyrus Circus?

369
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,500
Only then will we be able
to continue bringing joy

370
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,500
to people across this land!

371
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,750
If you have the talent,

372
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,500
you can become our
marquee performer, a star!

373
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,083
And once you are, you'll be able
to marry the angelic Lady Lelia!

374
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,583
I guarantee her hand is yours!

375
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
Wait. What'd he just say?

376
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,083
I could really have a
chance of marrying her?

377
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,666
Yeah, I think I might join up.

378
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,041
[GUY H]
Me, too!

379
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,541
[RINGMASTER sniffs]
I beg of you.

380
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,333
Aren't there any among you
who would be able to help us?

381
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,000
[LELIA sobs]

382

[MALE CLOWN C]
Lelia! Lelia!

383
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,125
Hurry, get down
from there, quick!

384
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,375
While the ringmaster's
distracted,

385
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,583
we can sneak on out of
the tent and escape!

386
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
What?

387
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,375
[MALE CLOWN C] Don't just look
at me. This is our chance.

388
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,625
There's no future here for us!

389
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,083
You said yourself
he's a demon, right?

390
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,791
Then let's run away together.

391
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,125
[groans]

392
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,833
[LELIA] Please. Someone save
me from this place.

[YOSHIYUKI chuckles]

394
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:11,208
What do you say?
Wouldn't you like to join us?
