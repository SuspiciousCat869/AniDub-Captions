Dad, your eye. Is it okay?

for real this time.

There are many problems here,

is the main issue.

What do you mean,
"lack of privacy"?

Well, you see,

all houses in this town are
opened up to public traffic.

227

That means people's homes
aren't private anymore,

00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,291
anyone can walk through them.
It's absolutely horrible.

[HUSBAND A] And you?
What brings you out this way?

230
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,166
I wanted to visit my Aunt Tamae.
She lives at 3-Chome.

231
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,750
How can I get there?

232
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,125
[HUSBAND A] If you follow the
street, you'll come to a river.

233
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,500
Cross the bridge and
you'll be in Oonishi.

234
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,541
But it's a dangerous walk.
That's the center of town.

235
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,916
And if rumors are
to be believed,

236

call that place home.

[HUSBAND A] There's also a
lot of crime in the area,

239

is on the loose.

I'm amazed you came here alone.

I don't know if I would've
had the guts at your age.

260
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,541
Well, it wasn't exactly
the easiest journey.

261
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,625
But I was worried about you,

262
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
so I knew I had to get
to you somehow.

263
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,958
Why would you be worried?

264
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,375
How could I not be with
you living in a crazy place

265
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,875
like this by yourself.

266
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,875
[laughs]

267
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,333
What's so funny about that?

268
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,208
And why are you sitting
there without clothes on?

269
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,291
Go get dressed.

270
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,541
[TAMAE giggles]
I know you mean well,

271
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,750
but just hear me out
before you judge, okay?

272
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,416
I wasn't sure about any
of this at first, either.

273
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,708
In fact, when everything started
to change, I tried to fight it.

274
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,000
I'd lock the house down and
hide on the second floor,

275
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,291
wrapped in blankets.

276
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,375
But people would just
smash in the front door

277
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
or climb up to the roof to
peer through the windows

278
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,333
into the upper levels.
Just look around.

279
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,416
There are holes everywhere,
from the floor to the ceiling.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,083
People were constantly
finding ways to peep in.

281
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,291
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised
if someone was looking

282
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,875
through them even now.

283
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,333
As you can imagine, trying to
maintain my privacy through this

284
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,291
madness is impossible, so I
gave up on it all together.

285
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,958
I accepted the new normal.

286
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,041
You can do the same,
it's not too late.

287
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,333
Come on, Saiko,
throw away that mask

288
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,416
and take off
your clothes, darling.

289
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,125
It's like shedding your skin.

290
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,833
You don't talk like the
same person I remember.

291
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,541
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

292
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,916
You are looking at a new woman!

293
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,208
That's insane.

294
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,083
No, you're the insane one.
Hey, how's it going?

295
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,291
[MAN E]
Hey.

296
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,458
[TAMAE] Oh, never mind.
How 'bout an apple?

297
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,083
Their skin slips
off easily, too.

298
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,250
Aunt Tamae, you're
acting really weird.

299
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,375
I don't think living
here is good for you.

300
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,708
Your brain is all messed up.

301
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,041
And I heard there's a serial
killer around here, too.

302
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,333
You can say you don't
need your privacy,

303
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,166
but I think living without it
has made you lose your mind.

304
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,916
[TAMAE] You don't understand
anything, you little brat.

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,125
You're just a child,

306
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,416
so stop yapping and
take off your clothes!

307
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,250
If you won't, I'll slice
them off you myself.

308
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll cut you to pieces!

309
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,041
Aunt Tamae, stop!

310
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,750
[TAMAE]
Hold it!

311
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,000
Hurry, somebody catch
that little bitch!

312
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:40,041
[SAIKO pants]

313
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,708
[SAIKO screams]

314
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:55,458
[panting continues]

315
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,458
[gasps]

316
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,000
[SAIKO gasps]
What the hell?

317
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,750
[MEN murmuring]

318
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,583
[screams]

319
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,083
[MASKED MAN] Oh! It's the
young lady from before.

320
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,625
I was worried you
might've gotten lost

321
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,875
in the streets again.

322
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,625
Help! You've gotta get
me out of this place!

323
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,833
Please, all I want is to
be at home in my room.

324
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,958
Sure, alright, then. Come on,
you can follow me out of here.

325
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,500
We're back to
the water. Look there.

326
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,333
The illegal constructions were
built over the river, too.

327
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,875
Isn't it wild?

328
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,458
[gasps] Hey. I know that ring.

329
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,250
[MASKED MAN] Is there something
about it that interests you?

330
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,458
Here. Allow me to give
it to you as a gift.

331
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,000
Well isn't that odd.
The ring fits you perfectly.

332
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,541
I have to admit, I feel like
I've met you before somewhere.

333
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,875
Tell me, miss, do you
happen to remember me?

334
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,000
Jack the Ripper!

335
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,750
You murdered Kishimoto,
didn't you?

336
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,208
That's right.

337
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,250
Why did you kill him?

338
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,458
You should be grateful to
your boyfriend, you know,

339
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,666
if he hadn't been there, I would
have sliced you open instead.

340
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,791
[MASKED MAN chuckles]
But we can still play now.

341
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,541
[gasps]

342
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,583
[JACK chuckles]

343
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,666
[JACK groans]

344
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,083
[SAIKO]
Aunt Tamae, where did--?

345
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,875
Follow the river upstream.

346
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,916
You'll be out of
here soon, dear.

347
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,750
[SAIKO] Come with me!
We can go together!

348
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,791
Aunt Tamae!

349
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,916
[SAIKO gasps]
