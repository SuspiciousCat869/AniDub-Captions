00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,791
[IWASAKI] I've got a
bad feeling about today,

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,291
and my hunches
are usually right.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,791
I have no idea what's
going to go wrong,

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,416
but I know something
horrible's gonna happen.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,291
[grunts]

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,625
[IWASAKI]
That's not it.

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,875
This little accident
was too simple.

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,250
[IWASAKI grunts]

00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:35,041
[PATRONS chatter]

10
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,083
[IWASAKI] I wish there was
some way to avoid fate.

11
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,708
But the last time I had this
kind of premonition and tried

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,416
to keep something awful from
happening, it didn't help.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,416
Bad luck found me anyway.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,333
And the feeling's even
worse today. Overpowering, even.

15
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,750
[gasps]

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,916
[IWASAKI]
That face is terrifying!

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,125
Is she seriously a model?

18
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,666
[groans]

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,458
[gasps]

20
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,000
Damnit.

21
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,166
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that weird model's face.

22
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,291
I never should have opened
that magazine earlier.

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,875
Listen, are you sure you're not
just remembering that model's

24
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,541
face the wrong way?

25
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,458
Maybe it was an unflattering
picture is all. You know?

26
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,875
Otherwise why would they use
someone so creepy looking?

27
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,125
That's stupid.

28
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,708
I dunno, Oda.

29
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,083
By this point, the memory is so
messed up in my brain that all

30
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,125
I can see is a monster
every time I think of her.

31
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,250
[ODA] Forget about her, Iwasaki.
How's the script coming along?

32
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,750
It's not.

33
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,875
How are we gonna film this
movie without a script?

34
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,875
You can't slack off
on our club stuff.

35
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,625
[IWASAKI] I've been
trying to work, okay?

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,625
Don't tell me this dumb
model has you freaked out

37
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,041
that much, dude.

38
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,083
If you don't wanna do it,
I'll get someone else to.

39
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,666
The submission deadline for
the contest is coming up.

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,625
[IWASAKI]
I know, I know.

[gasps]

43
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,250
[IWASAKI] I never saw the photo
of that fashion model again.

44
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,208
But, still. I couldn't shake
the warped image of her

45
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,875
that I had in my head.

46
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,041
Thankfully, as time passed,
that memory started to fade.

47
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,708
[ODA]
The script clenched it.

48
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,041
Nah, it was your camera
work that they loved.

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,916
Oh, don't go getting
modest on me now.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,416
Don't forget about
my incredible lights.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,166
[ALL laugh]

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,666
I gotta admit,

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,541
I never dreamed we'd win the
grand prize with this film.

54
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,333
"Dream" is definitely the word.

55
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,000
This is big. We may just
be amateur filmmakers,

56
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,791
but thanks to this, people are
actually gonna know our names.

57
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,333
Which is why I have a
proposal for you guys.

58
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,666
We should use this momentum

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,708
and hold open auditions
for our next film.

60
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,416
[MIYAKE] Why? Can't we
just find someone at school?

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,833
No, I can't think of any girl
here who's pretty enough

62
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,458
to star as our heroine. Y'know?

63
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,916
If we open it up to the public,

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,041
we can find someone
with the right look.

65
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,458
After all, we've got
a reputation now.

66
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,250
[MIYAKE] So, we only
got three submissions.

67
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:49,666
I guess our reputation isn't
as good as we thought.

68
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,291
Eh, she's not right.

69
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,791
[MIYAKE]
Whoa! Look at this girl.

70
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,208
[ODA gasps]
She's the one. She's perfect.

71
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,791
I'd pick her out of a
million actresses.

72
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,291
Something wrong, Miyake?

73
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,375
I'm just wondering if my meeting
this cute girl is destiny.

74
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,500
[ODA]
Might as well open this one.

75
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,958
What the hell?

76
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,291
Is this some kind of joke
or something? Look at her.

77
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,125

78
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,500
Whoa, what's the matter?

79
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,416
That's her! That's the
fashion model!

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,250
[ODA grunts]
Wait, seriously?

81
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,916
Maybe it just looks
like the same girl.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,458
I'm telling you, it's her.

83
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,416
There's no way I could
forget that face.

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Why would a professional
model audition

85
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,666
for a part in an
amateur student film?

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,958
[IWASAKI] Look at those eyes.
Even the picture freaks me out.

87
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,958
Okay, how's this
for a proposition?

88
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,041
We cast this girl in the movie
alongside our new beauty.

89
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,500
Are you crazy?

90
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,875
Dude, you're not actually
serious about this, right. 

91
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,916
Or is it gonna be
a horror movie now?

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Come on, hear me out.

93
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,583
She's definitely kind
of creepy, for sure.

94
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,875
But I don't think I've ever seen
someone with such a unique

95
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,083
look before.

96
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,250
[ODA] So, Tamae, you're a
first-year high school student?

97
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,125
Wow. You're even more
beautiful in person.

You're gonna be a big time star.

Our heroine is a stellar role.

Try not to overthink things.
Just act natural.

Okay.

103

found someone who's this cute.

Oh, right, Fuchi.
Join us over here.

107

Fuchi is a professional
fashion model.

108

Let me introduce you to Iwasaki.
He's a really big fan of yours.

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm a what?

[IWASAKI] Dammit. Why would
you say that crap about me?

113
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,208
It was just a joke.

114
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,458
But at least now I know why
she weirded you out so much.

115
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,500
Also, I had no idea
she was gonna end up

116
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,083
being so freakishly tall.

117
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,125
Kinda worried she won't
fit in the frame.

118
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,916
[IWASAKI grunts]
Come on.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,375
Can't we tell her
we're writing her part

120
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,291
out of the project or something?

121
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,000
What are you so worried about?

122
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,916
She was probably nervous
meeting us for the first time.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,708
She could turn out to be a real
asset in front of the camera.

124
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,916
With that much screen presence,

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,875
she might just eat
our little star up.

126
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't like this.
I've got a bad feeling.

127
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,166
Are we at least
getting close?

128
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,833
We've been riding
in this car forever.

129

Almost there.

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,875
Can't you go any faster, I feel
like I'm suffocating in here.

131
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,583
You'll have all the
fresh mountain air

you can handle soon.

133
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,875
Trust me, this location
is absolutely perfect

134
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,333
for the script. Completely out
in the middle of nowhere.

135
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,041
Isolated deep in the mountains,
and far away from people?

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,541
So it really is a horror movie.

touched a nerve. Ha.

inside of her mouth?

00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,375
Yeah. Is she even a human being?

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,583
Those weren't teeth.
They were... more like fangs.

Well, what do you think,
it's beautiful, right?

I love being in remote
places like this.

152

[ODA] You wanna react as
if the noise is coming

153

from this direction,
and then you turn.

to be facing this way,

second and then step forward.

00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,416
That's not funny.
Don't be such a dumbass.

159
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,666
[FRIEND]
Hey. Where are you going, man?

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,500
I'm gonna go wash my
face in the river.

161
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,625
I'm starting to feel
kind of nauseous.

There you are, we were
starting to worry.

170
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,875
You're playing opposite
our star in this scene,

171
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,250
so you can't just--

172
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,416
[ODA] Hey, are you okay?
And where's Fuchi?

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,166
I don't care about that freak,
let's just leave.

174
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,333
Hurry. Before she gets back.
Start packing up our stuff. Now!

175
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,791
Why? What's wrong?

176
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,916
[IWASAKI] I don't want to be
around that creepy woman!

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,375
[ODA] What, you wanna leave
her out her by herself?

178
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,083
Yeah, I do! Come on,
don't you guys agree with me?

179
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,833
[ODA] But we're on
the side of a mountain.

180
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,833
In the middle of nowhere.

181

[IWASAKI]
Tsh!

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,916
[ODA]
And cut!

183
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,541
[ODA] Nice shot, Tamae. You were
great in that scene. Perfect!

184
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,625
Wow, thank you.

185
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,208
Excuse me.

186
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,875
You've been filming only her
scenes for a while now.

187
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,291
When will you be putting
me in front of the camera?

188
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
I'm eager to begin.

189
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,375
[ODA] Uh, right, and your
role is a very critical one.

190
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,416
Why don't we take a break first?

191
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,291
I'm afraid that if we
leave her out here,

192
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,750
she'll just come after us
wanting revenge or something.

193
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,500
We should just film
whatever and then tell her

194
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,125
we're done with
all her scenes.

195
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,666
[IWASAKI]
No, I can't do this anymore,

196
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,416
we should run while
she's not around.

197
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,791
[ODA]
We can't go right now,

198
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,416
Tamae's out there
taking a break, too.

199
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,958

And Miyake's still gone.

It's terrible.

Hey, man, calm down.
Try to catch your breath first.

204
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,708
What's the matter, dude?

205
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,958
just saw Tamae
out in the forest.

206
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,125
Fuchi was eating her!

207

Huh?

208

I'm serious.

209

The fashion model is literally
chewing Tamae up right now!

Please believe me!

213

We were fawning over
Tamae this whole time,

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
so that creepy freak
killed and ate her.

215

dark sense of humor.

you guys the truth, okay?

supposed to find them

221

us where they are?

222

[IWASAKI] I believe
everything he's saying.

223
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,250
I absolutely believe
she'd devour someone.

224
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,416
You aren't really buying
into any of this, are you?

225
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,416
They were right over
there by that tree.

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,583
[ODA] Yeah, well,
I don't see anyone now.

[IWASAKI gasps]
Look!

00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
There's blood on the rocks.

00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,416
And here,
bloodstains everywhere.

And my hunches
are usually right.

Even if I try to stop it,
something horrible will happen.

[FUCHI] Finally. You and
I are alone together.

247
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:41,583
[MAMI] I don't want to die.
But I know I'm going to soon.

248
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:46,833
I'll be dead. Nothing.
I'll completely cease to exist.

[MAMI cries]
I'm scared! I'm scared.

[MAMI] Doctor! I don't

256
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't want to become dust!

257
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,625
[KURODA] Mami, we're fighting
your disease

258
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,166
to the best of our abilities,
I promise. But we need you to

259
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,708
hold on to hope if you're
going to beat this.

260
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,041
[MAMI]
Why bother? It's pointless!

261
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,958
I've seen the Grim Reaper!

262
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,083
That is not the Grim Reaper.

263
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,958
He's just a patient from
another ward in the hospital.

264
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,208
You're lying! No human being
could look like that.

265
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,958
I dream of him, too.

266
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,583
He's some kind of creature
from the dark beyond!

267
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,500
[KURODA] A creature from
the dark beyond, huh?

268
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,166
She's quite an intuitive girl,
I'll give her that much.

269
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,666
[DOCTOR A]
That intuition may be how

270
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,125
she realized she was ill.
And also why she fears death.

271
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,583
A bit more than most patients,
it would seem.

272
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,166
If our "Reaper" has started
wandering the hospital halls

273
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,291
at night, it's going to
turn into a real problem.

274
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,083
He's likely doing it because
he's afraid to go to sleep.

275
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,416
Actually, sir, could you tell
me a little more about this

276
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,708
special patient of yours?

277
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,958
I imagine he'll be
waking up sometime soon.

278
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,583
Why don't we go by
and pay him a visit?

279
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
[DOCTOR A] I don't really know
much about his case at all.

280
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,166
Mostly just hospital rumors.

281
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,500
Could you fill me
in on his condition?

282
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,250
I hear his dreams are unusual.

283
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,125
I suppose you haven't
been here long enough

284
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,125
to hear the entire story.
Tetsurou Mukouda is his name.

285
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,458
It was two months ago when he
first came to the hospital.

286
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,500
He complained he was suffering
from what he called

287
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,208
"long dreams."

288
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,916
Long dreams, huh?

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,041
Could you be a little
more specific, please?

290
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,875
[TETSURO]
They're getting worse.

291
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,125
I don't know when they started,

292
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,458
but it was a month ago
when I first noticed.

293
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,791
I would go to sleep normally,
and a single night's dream

294
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,958
would feel like it lasted two,
maybe three full days.

295
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,291
[KURODA]
Hm... So...

296
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,916
What you mean is that they felt
lengthy after you'd woken up.

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,333
No, it's the dreams
themselves that feel long,

298
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,083
like I'm living every
second of them.

299
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,875
At first I thought I was just
imagining it, but with each day

300
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
they became increasingly longer.

301
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,500
Which might be fine if they
were all good dreams,

302
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,375
but there are plenty
of nightmares, too,

303
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,000
so it's like being trapped
in hell sometimes.

304
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,666
[KURODA]
Hm. And how long do your dreams

305
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,125
feel like they're lasting now?

306
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,000
[TETSURO] Well, Last night's
dream was one whole year.

307
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,375
An entire year?

308
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,375
[TETSURO]
Doctor. I'm serious.

309
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,500
[TETSURO] It's getting harder
to tell when I'm dreaming

310
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,708
and when I'm really awake,

311
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,333
and it's starting to
ruin my everyday life.

312
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,666
Think about it. For me,
yesterday was a year ago.

313
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,250
A year I lived.

314
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,500
[KURODA] I decided to admit him
and monitor his sleep cycles.

315
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,041
It was fairly
standard procedure,

316
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:43,416
all things considered.
And, then, on that first night.

317
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,958
[KURODA gasps]

318
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,916
[KURODA] He experienced
full-body convulsions

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,083
and rapid eye movement.

320
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,125
But those both ended as
quickly as they had begun.

321
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,958
His brain activity indicated
he was in the deepest phase

322
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,208
of the sleep cycle
at that moment.

323
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,333
[KURODA]
Hey! Listen to me. Wake up!

324
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,333
[TETSURO grunts]

325
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,208
Tell me, were you
dreaming just now?

326
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,958
[TETSURO grunts]
Wait, where am I?

327
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,375
You're in the hospital,
you admitted yourself yesterday,

328
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,666
do you have any
memory of that at all?

329
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,583
[TETSURO grunts]
Wait, what?

330
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,916
Oh. I remember now.

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,833
That's right, I talked to you in
your office. I was dreaming.

332
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:34,083
It was a nightmare. And it
lasted for a year and a half.

333
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,958
[KURODA] My instincts
told me that this man

334
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,000
was not lying to me.
I believed that he truly was

335
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,791
suffering from
these long dreams.

336
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,333
[TETSURO]
Doctor. When will I be cured?

337
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,958
I want my life back.

338
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,125
I have a few potential
treatments in mind,

339
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,916
but I need you
to be patient.

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,916
The dream I had last night
went on for ten years.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,666
They just keep getting longer.

342
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,250
They're only illusions.
Your actual dreams

343
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,916
are no more than a few
moments long at the most.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,791
There's no reason for you
to be afraid of them.

345
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,083
[TETSURO] No offense, but you're
only saying that because

346
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,250
you've never had a dream
like mine, Doctor.

347
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,416
You don't know how
realistic they feel to me.

348
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,333
How disturbing and
terribly lonely they are.

349
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,666
How frightening they can be.

350
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,500
Yes, but you must understand
it's all in your mind.

351
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,333
In the meantime, we're working
diligently to find the cause

352
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,416
of these dreams.

353
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,000
[TETSURO]
Please, you have to hurry.

354
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,541
Otherwise, I'm concerned that
my dreams will eventually last

355
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,541
a hundred years,
maybe even more than that.

356
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,250
If that does happen,
I think I'll lose my mind.

357
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,625
[KURODA] And, just as
he predicted, the length

358
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,333
of his dreams seemed to increase
exponentially over time.

359
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,541
Eventually this became
obvious to his doctors.

360
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,958
It was like we were watching
some kind of evolution

361
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,375
of the mind unfold before us.

362
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,833
Good morning, Tetsuro,
are you awake?

363
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,625
What am I doing in this place?
And who are you people?

364
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm Dr. Kuroda, your physician.
Try to remember.

365
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,208
[TETSURO groans]

366
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,791
No!

367
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,666
Lately, he's started having
bizarre reactions and delusions

368
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,166
when he first wakes up.

369
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,125
[DOCTOR A] Do you suppose
he thinks he's still dreaming,

370
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,875
living some other life?

371
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,833
Where did my Mami go?
Why isn't my wife Mami here?

372
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,583
That's right, this is
the hospital where

373
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,458
I first met her,
isn't it? Where?

374
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,291
Where's my precious Mami?

375
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,791
[NURSE] Mami. You have
to eat something.

376
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:36,083
[MAMI] I don't feel like it.
The idea of dying is so--

377
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,083
[TETSURO gasps]
Mami!

378
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,083
No!

379
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,166
Mami!

380
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,958
I knew the Grim Reaper
would come for me again!

381
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,208
That's enough, you need
to go back to your room.

382
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,208
The Reaper? That's what
she called me.

383
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,875
I remember now.
It was all a dream.

384
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,083
[TETSURO] Doctor, I'm scared.
How is this going to end?

385
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,291
If my dreams continue to get
longer, then what happens?

386
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,750
What if they become infinite
nightmares I can't wake from.

387
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,958
If I start dreaming
endless dreams,

388
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:12,958
then what will become of me?
Will I disappear completely?

389
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,583
[yells] I'm so scared!

390
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,666
I don't want to die, please,
someone fix me.

391
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,250
[NURSE]
It's okay! Calm down.

392
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,125
[KURODA] It's unfortunate.
I've never seen a patient

393
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,250
who has such an intense
fear of death before.

394
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,625
And what about
Tetsurou Mukouda?

395
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,458
I can't imagine how far into
the future he's dreamed now,

396
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,708
or if he's capable of
coming back to reality.

397
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,583
[KURODA gasps]

398
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,833
[KURODA] As I watched the husk
of his remains blow away,

399
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:35,083
I wondered if his mind had
vanished into an unending dream.

400
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,416
[KURODA] Later, I discovered
an unidentified,

401
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,333
crystallized material within
what was left of his brain.

402
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,833
I suspected it had something
to do with his unusual dreams.

403
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,000
It was the only explanation
I could think of,

404
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,916
but I had no proof.

405
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,875
[KURODA] How are you
feeling today, Mami?

406
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,416
[MAMI grunts]
Dr. Kuroda.

407
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,458
I'm feeling
pretty good, actually.

408
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,583
Wonderful.

409
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,000
It's strange, though, Doctor.
There is one odd thing.

410
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,583
Lately, it seems like
I dream for so long.

411
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,250
[KURODA softly gasps]

412
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,333
[DOCTOR A] Sir. Have you
noticed the differences

413
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,541
in Mami Takeshima's condition?

414
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,500
Her appearance is starting
to change, too, drastically.

415
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,791
She's looking like he did.

416
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,416
What do you think
is to blame?

417
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,666
[KURODA] I've been administering
the crystals I retrieved from

418
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,833
Testurou Mukouda's
brain to her.

419
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,708
They appear to be
affecting her similarly.

420
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,166
[gasps]
Wait, you did what?

421
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,375
[KURODA] Her fear of dying
and the end of her existence

422
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,500
in this world consumed her.
Even if I knew another approach,

423
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,750
that mindset would
negate any treatment.

424
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,416
But what if she could dream
an eternal dream instead?

425
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,083
It would amount to her
life never ending,

426
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,583
at least not in her mind.

427
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,666
Even if, in reality, it was
all just an illusion.

428
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,250
[gasps]

429
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,625
[KURODA] If humanity actually
had the means to lose themselves

430
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,958
in endless dreams,

431
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,625
think of what that would
mean for us as a species.

432
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,875
We would be able to
permanently rid ourselves

433
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,500
of the fear of death.

434
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,875
Just as Mami has.
