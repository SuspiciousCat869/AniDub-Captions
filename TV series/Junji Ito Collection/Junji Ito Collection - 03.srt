Um, excuse me?

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,541
I don't want to bother
you if you're busy,

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,833
but could you tell
me my fortune?

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,416
I especially want to hear
about my romantic future.

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:54,541
[GIRL A] Please, tell me,
will my love be realized?

8
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,875
[PRETTY BOY] Your love...
will never be realized.

[TEACHER]
Ahem. Allow me to introduce you

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,666
to your new classmate.
This is Ryuusuke Fukada.

12
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,041
He used to live here in
town when he was younger.

13
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,916
It's possible that some
of you might have been

14
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,083
in school with him then.

[school bell chimes]

16
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,000
[MIDORI] Hey. Do you
remember me, by chance?

17
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,583
[RYUUSUKE]
Huh?

18
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,416
I'm pretty sure that we were in
the same kindergarten class.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,666
Oh! Wait, wait, don't tell me,
your name's Midori, right?

20
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,625
Yeah! Wow, I can't believe
that you remember me.

21
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,416
[chuckles]

22
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,541
[MIDORI] So, Ryuusuke. I wanna
introduce you to my best friend.

23
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,708
This is Suzue Tanaka
from Class B.

24
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,375
[SUZUE]
Nice to meet you.

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,750
[RYUUSUKE]
Likewise.

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,250
[SUZUE] You know, the
girls in our class were all

27
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,916
talking about you, Ryuusuke,
you're gonna be so popular.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,458
They think you're super cute.

29
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,750
Of course, they all know none of
them stands a chance against

30
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,416
Midori if she goes after you.

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Suzue, shut up, what
are you talking about?

32
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,916
You should know.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,708
Midori is super popular
with guys at school.

34
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,083
It's safe to say all of
them want to date her.

35
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,041
Every one of them wishes
they were lucky enough

36
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,416
to be her boyfriend.
They basically clog the streets

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,458
looking for fortune tellers to
see if they have any chance

38
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,708
of winning her affections.
Right, Midori?

39
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,833
Will you please cut it out
before he thinks you're serious?

40
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,166
Besides, it's not like
crossroads fortune-telling

41
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,291
is real. It's a kids' fantasy.

42
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,500
[SUZUE] I dunno. I think
there's something to it.

43
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,833
You really think some random
person on the street could have

44
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,125
any insight into your life or
what the future holds for you?

45
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,791
[SUZUE] Well, when you
put it that way...

46
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,500
What do you think, Ryuusuke?

47
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,125
Do you think that
fortune-telling stuff is real?

48
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,500
[RYUUSUKE] You shouldn't mess
around with things like that.

49
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,041
[MIDORI, SUZUE gasp]

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,333
[RYUUSUKE]
On a gloomy day like this,

51
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,333
I bet tons of people are heading
to different crossroads at dusk,

52
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,041
asking for their
fortunes to be told.

53
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,750
And every single one of them
is asking the same thing.

54
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,166
"Will my love be realized?"

55
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,541
[GIRL B] I heard a first-year
girl died yesterday.

56
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,125
They found her lying in the
middle of an intersection.

57
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,041
She'd sliced her own neck
open with a box cutter.

58
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,625
There was an ocean
of blood on the street.

59
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,333
That's so sad, why would
she kill herself?

60
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,625
No idea. There was no note
found and the fog was so thick,

61
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,083
no one saw her do it.
There are some people who think

62
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,083
she was after a
crossroads fortune.

63
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,583
But how would they know that?

64
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,791
[GIRL B] Well, apparently
there was a suicide case

65
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,916
just like this seven
or eight years ago.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,458
A girl was trying to get her
fortune read at a crossroads

67
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,125
and ended up committing suicide.

68
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,625
[GIRL C]
Seriously? That's really scary.

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,791
[RYUUSUKE]
Out of every place in the world,

70
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,916
how did I end up back
in this damn town?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,250
This is karma. I'm being
punished for what I did.

72
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,208
[WOMAN]
Little boy. Hey, stop running.

73
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,875
[RYUUSUKE pants]

74
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,666
[WOMAN] Little boy.
Please, will you come here?

75
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,250
[RYUUSUKE]
Huh?

76
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,083
All I want for you
to do is listen.

77
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,333
I have a question to ask of you.

78
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,250
There's a man who I have
strong feelings for right now.

79
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,333
I love him with my whole being.

80
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,791
However, he has a wife
and a child already.

81
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,333
[WOMAN]
But you see,

82
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,958
another one of his babies is
growing inside of me. Our baby.

83
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,666
Do you understand me?

84
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,416
I want to be the mother
to one of his children, too.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,125
Only, he's being so cold lately
and says I should get rid of it.

86
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,625
Isn't that horrible?

87
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,750
Still, it hasn't changed
my feelings. I want him.

88
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,583
So much. I'm so deeply
in love with this man

89
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,458
that sometimes I feel like
I could just die for him.

90
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,916
So, what do you say?

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
What do you think I
should do, little boy?

92
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,625
Um, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

93
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,291
What I'm really asking,

94
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,625
is probably the most important
question in the world.

95
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,458
Will my love be realized?

96
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,083
Of course it won't,
crazy lady. Weirdo!

97
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,166
[RYUUSUKE]
That night I couldn't sleep.

98
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,125
I got so curious about
who this woman was.

99
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,541
And I wondered what happened
to her after I ran away.

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,791
So the next day. I went back
to the spot where I'd met her.

101
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,583
[RYUUSUKE] I was the one who
caused her to take her life.

102
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,500
It's my fault she and her
unborn baby are dead.

103
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,583
[MIDORI]
Ryuusuke?

104
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,958
[RYUUSUKE gasps]

105
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,625
Is something wrong?
You've been acting weird today.

106
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,875
[RYUUSUKE]
I'm fine, Midori.

107
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,625
You don't have to lie to me.

108
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,458
I'm here for you if
you need anything.

109
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,916
Thank you.
But it's nothing, really.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,750
[MIDORI]
If you say so.

111
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,250
[MIDORI] Y'know, I was
kind of wanting to ask you

112
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,541
if you'd had a bad experience
with crossroads fortunes

113
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,416
or something after
how you reacted.

114
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
You're totally
overthinking things.

115
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,000
Why would they bother me?

116
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,500
I mean, if they do,
I'd understand.

117
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,000
I have pretty bad memories
associated with them, too.

118
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,250
You heard the girls in class
talking about that death

119
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,083
that happened a while back.

120
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,625
There was another woman who
killed herself eight years ago.

121
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,708
The thing is, she was
actually my aunt.

122
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:56,625
[RYUUSUKE gasps]

123
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,541
[RYUUSUKE]
It can't be. Dammit!

124
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,916
[SUZUE]
Midori! Wait up!

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
Hey, Suzue.

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,583
You've been walking home
alone a lot lately.

127
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,875
Yeah.

128
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,250
[SUZUE] Is something wrong?
Where's Ryuusuke?

129
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,208
Are things not going
well with him?

130
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,083
[MIDORI] I don't know,
that's the problem.

131
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,958
I get the feeling
he's avoiding me lately.

132
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,166
And I honestly can't
figure out what I did.

133
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,541
If you want me to,
I'd be happy to ask him.

134
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,916
I'm sure there's a simple
explanation behind it.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,791
[SUZUE] So tell me the truth,
why are you avoiding Midori?

136
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,208
Did she do something
to upset you?

137
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,416
Hey, are you okay?

138
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,000
I could never be
upset with Midori.

139
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,541
But I don't deserve to like her.

140
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,000
Or even talk to her.
It's all my fault.

141
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,416
That's why I can't be with her.

142
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,708
Ryuusuke. What on Earth
are you talking about?

143
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,791
You're scaring me.
Just explain what's going on.

144
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,583
I'm sure I can figure some way
to help you get through this.

145
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,875
Just be honest and tell
me what happened.

146
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,500
That's enough! Don't ask
me anything else, okay?

147
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,125
She'll suffer less if
we let things die here

148
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,458
and stop talking at all.

149
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,583
[SUZUE] Come on, Midori is
so worried about you.

150
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,208
Don't do this.

151
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Oh, fine. All right.
I'll let it go.

152
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,750
Sorry for cornering
you like this.

153
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,250
Goodbye.

154
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,875
That's it!

155
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,791
[SUZUE] U-Um, hello?
Excuse me, sir.

156
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,458
I was hoping to get
a crossroads fortune.

157
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,458
Could you, maybe help me out?

158
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,750
It's, um... It's about a
really good friend of mine.

159
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,875
She's been worried about
how distant her boyfriend

160
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,916
has been lately and
needs some help.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,750
And I'm pretty sure he's
upset because of something

162
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,291
he won't talk to me about.

163
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,500
What do you think I should
do to get them back together

164
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,000
and make things good
like they were before?

165
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,333
That's the wrong question.

166
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,125
You should worry more
about your own love life.

167
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,416
[footsteps echo]

168
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,583
[MIDORI]
So, I was wondering.

169
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,750
Did Ryuusuke have
anything to say?

170
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah, he did. I talked to him
a little while and he said

171
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,125
he thinks it would be best
if the two of you break up.

172
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,333
I see.

173
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,791
I tried to get a fortune
for the two of you.

174
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,166
I wanted to get you
guys back together,

175
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,666
even if it meant tapping
into the mystical.

176
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,125
Seriously, you went
that far for us?

177
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,416
Yeah. Just the other night.
I actually think I ran into that

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,875
pretty boy at the crossroads
everyone talks about.

179
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,041
I wasn't looking for him.
He just appeared out of nowhere.

180
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,708
He was really tall and
dressed head-to-toe in black.

181
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,333
His features were
so sharp looking.

182
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,041
There was such a cold beauty
to him that it gave me chills.

183
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,791
But none of that really matters.
The important thing,

184
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,458
which shook me to my core,
was what he said to me.

185
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,291
It made me realize that
I've been lying to myself.

186
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,000
That everything I was doing was
actually the opposite of what I

187
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,750
truly wanted deep down in
the depths of my heart.

188
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,000
So now, I'm going to start
living far more honestly.

189
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,416
Midori, you have to listen.

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,958
I'm gonna be Ryuusuke's
new girlfriend!

191
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,875
I've known this ever
since he transferred.

192
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,708
I'm sorry, Midori, but I
love Ryuusuke so much,

193
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,333
more than anything.
I'd die for him!

194
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,500
So it's kind of really lucky
for me that the two of you

195
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,625
are splitting up.
The timing is perfect!

196
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,375
I can't wait! I'm gonna go tell
Ryuusuke how I feel about him!

197
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,875
[RYUUSUKE] Suzue Tanaka started
to pursue me aggressively.

198
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,166
I tried my best to
turn her down nicely,

199
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,875
but she didn't take the hint.

200
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,083
If anything, things started
to get even worse.

201
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,916
[SUZUE]
Here. Your lunch.

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,041
Will you please stop
stalking me already?

203
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,750
If you keep following
me around like this,

204
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,250
I'm gonna call the police.

205
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,041
But, I just wanted to
make sure you had

206
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,333
a lunch to eat today, my love.

207
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,833
[RYUUSUKE]
I brought my own food!

208
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,791
Just eat this one instead!

209
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,333
I'll get rid of the one
in your bag, give it to me!

210
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,375
[RYUUSUKE grunts]
What are doing? Stop it!

211
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,208
You have got to give this up!

212
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,458
Look, I'll be blunt. I don't
like you that way, okay?

213
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,000
Midori's the one I want!

214
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,875
I have no place in my
life for you, so get lost.

215
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,500
You can't say that.

216
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,875
What about all of this
love that I feel for you?

217
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,333
[RYUUSUKE]
I don't care!

218
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,291
But I'm just doing what the
fortune teller told me to.

219
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,916
The pretty boy who I met at the
crossroads said I should worry

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,125
about my own love life,

221
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,750
so that's the thing
I'm focusing on now.

222
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,916
And yet, it's no good.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,500
My love for you is never
going to be realized, is it?

224
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,250
I love you so much, Ryuusuke.
Do you hear me?

225
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,625
You've stolen my heart!

226
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,166
I heard they found another
girl dead at an intersection.

227
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,208
[RYUUSUKE]
Hm?

228
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
Yeah, that makes
four of 'em in all.

229
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,291
It seems she wanted
her fortune read.

230
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,333
I heard she ran into
that pretty boy.

231
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,166
You know, the one from
those crazy rumors.

232
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,541
I bet he's not even human.

233
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,000
Maybe he's the angel of death.

234
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,500
The pretty boy at
the crossroads.

235
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,625
An angel, huh?

236
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,583
Yeah. Uh, speaking of
fallen angels,

237
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,000
it looks like one from our
school has her eyes set on you.

238
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:32,083
[school bells chime]

239
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,416
So, I know that I went a
little too far this morning.

240
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,583
It's not that I dislike
you as a person, Suzue.

241
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,541
But I just can't forget about
my feelings for Midori.

242
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,083
There's no way that I can go out
with someone else right now.

243
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,791
[SUZUE whimpers]

244
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,125
Listen. I should have
told you before.

245
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,708
There's a good reason why I've
been avoiding Midori lately.

246
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,583
Eight years ago, the first
time I lived in this town,

247
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,500
it happened.

248
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,125
One night....

249
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,333
[gasps]

250
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,166
Suzue, no!

251
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,708
[RYUUSUKE] The pretty boy
at the crossroads.

252
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,541
I couldn't just sit around doing
nothing while people were dying

253
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,833
in the street.
I had to find him.

254
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,416
So, I started going out
to the crossroads myself

255
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,000
every night at dusk.

256
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,916
People asked me to
read their fortunes,

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,625
and I tried to figure out a way
to give them some hope.

258
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,416
I did everything I
could to be sincere,

259
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,333
to show them that the
future was worth living.

260
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,625
I did the opposite of what it
sounded like he was doing.

261
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,041
[RYUUSUKE] I thought maybe that
was the only way I could keep

262
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
more people from
killing themselves.

263
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,250
I guess it was pretty obvious
that I was doing this because

264
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,666
of the guilt I still felt
about driving that woman

265
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,250
to suicide eight years before.

266
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,500
Eventually, things went wrong.

267
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,375
Oh, hey. Would you
like a fortune?

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,166
Whoa. Are you okay?

269
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,958
[GIRL D] Excuse me, but, will my
love ever be realized?

270
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,583
[RYUUSUKE] Yes! Yes it will!
I'm sure of it.

271
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,875
[RYUUSUKE] This can't
be real. These figures.

272
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,000
They look like different girls
who've killed themselves

273
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
at the crossroads.

274
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,666
And if that's true, then...

275
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:52,291
I love you! I love you
so much I could die!

276
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,916
[RYUUSUKE] Despite what I saw,
I had to keep going

277
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,166
and telling people
their fortunes.

278
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,541
[MIDORI]
Ryuusuke?

279
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,416
Oh, hi, Midori.

280
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,875
Are you going to walk
around town again tonight?

281
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,041
I know that you've been going
around trying to help people

282
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,375
wanting their fortunes
told at intersections.

283
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,916
It's almost as though you
can't help but go out.

284
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Will you tell me why?
What's driving you?

285
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,291
It's just. I don't think
I can stop until I've finally

286
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,958
caught that pretty boy
at the crossroads.

287
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:29,125
[MIDORI] No! Ryuusuke.
Don't go, please! Ryuusuke!

It's no use. I don't even
know where I am.

307
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,583
[footsteps]

308
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,958
[MIDORI gasps]

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,916
[MIDORI] That's him.
It's... It's the pretty boy.

310
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,208
It's okay, I'll be fine.

311
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,166
After all, I'm not here
to get my fortune told.

312
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm not. I'm all right.

313
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,666
Go away!

314
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,083
[shouts]

315
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,250
Oh, there you are.
How'd you find me?

316
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,375
I think someone back there
pointed me in your direction.

317
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,583
It looked like you were
hiding from someone.

318
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,583
It was him! The boy! The one
who wanders the crossroads.

319
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,750
What? Where is he?

320
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,750
Right here. Look!

321
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,541
[RYUUSUKE] But this eerie
boy I was looking for

322
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,458
was nowhere to be found.

323
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,125
And the fog that had
been so thick was gone.

324
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,291
As though it had never existed.

325
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,166
[RIE] My friend Yuuko is known
for talking all the time.

326
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,708
But recently she's
been almost silent.

327
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,583
And when she does speak...

328
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,000
[heavy lisp]
I don't know.

329
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:59,458
Lately I've been having trouble
saying things correctly.

330
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,666
Are you sure you shouldn't
go to the hospital?

331
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,208
[YUUKO] Mm. I know it's weird,
but I don't feel sick at all,

332
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sure this'll pass.

333
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,708
[RIE]
Despite what she said,

334
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,083
she stopped coming to
class soon after that.

335
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,208
Her seat was empty.

336
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,875
[doorbell rings]

337
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,250
Is no one home?

338
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,458
[YUUKO'S DAD grunts]

339
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,416
[RIE]
What's that?

340
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,458
[thudding]

341
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,916
[YUUKO'S DAD, MOM grunting]

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,333
[YUUKO'S DAD] No matter how many
we kill, they keep coming back.

343
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,750
[YUUKO'S MOM]
It's because of this humidity

344
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,291
and all of these clouds.

345
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,166
Whatever, hand me
more of that salt.

346
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh! It's so nice
to see you, Rie.

347
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,125
It's been a while.

348
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,291
Way too long.

349
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,458
[YUUKO'S MOM]
Let me guess,

350
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,916
you're here to check
up on Yuuko, right?

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,458
She's up in her room.

352
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,125
[YUUKO'S MOM] Yuuko? Rie dropped
by to see how you're doing.

353
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:56,916
Yuuko?

354
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,916
[YUUKO whimpers]

355
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,750
[YUUKO'S MOM] Honey? Why are you
covering your mouth like that?

356
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,458
[YUUKO grunts]
Just leave me alone, please!

357
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,250
What's wrong?

358
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,958
[YUUKO'S MOM]
It's okay. Let me see.

359
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:22,541
[YUUKO groans]

360
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,250
What?!

361
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,750
[groaning continues]

362
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,541
[BOTH gasp]

363
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:35,541
[YUUKO shouts]

364
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,166
[YUUKO'S DAD]
It might be the only way.

365
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,458
[YUUKO'S MOM]
Do you think it will work?

366
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,000
[YUUKO'S DAD]
Yeah. Stay strong.

367
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,958
Let's fill the bathtub with
salt and put her in it.

368
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,583
We'll stop this thing.

369
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,416
[YUUKO'S DAD]
There. That should be enough.

370
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,166
Go ahead and help her
get in. It'll be fine.

371
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,250
I want you to open your
mouth as wide as you can

372
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,208
once you're submerged,
all right?

373
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,375
[YUUKO'S MOM] I'm starting
to get worried.

374
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,083
Hasn't she been in
there long enough?

375
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,500
[YUUKO'S DAD]
Yuuko? You okay?

376
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,083
Oh, no. I think she's
fainted in there! Help me!

377
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,791
Huh? What? These are Yuuko's
pajamas, but they're empty!

378
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,875
Where could she have gone?

379
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:19,958
[YUUKO'S MOM]
Yuuko?!

380
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,625
[YUUKO'S DAD]
Where are you, Yuuko?

381
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,708
Wait, what's this?

382
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,458
[YUUKO'S DAD shouts] No, no,
what happened to the rest of

383
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,625
my daughter?

384
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,041
Look at the base of
her neck, oh my god,

385
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,125
there's a little body
hanging back there.

386
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,416
The salt must have
caused her to shrink.

387
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,083
[BOTH gasp]

388
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,833
[RIE] Apparently, the creature
still lives out in their garden.

389
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,708
Like an ordinary snail
carrying around a pretty shell.

390
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:01,000
And just like a slug, it leaves
a trail of slime behind it.

391
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,041
As for Yuuko. They say whenever
someone gets too close,

392
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,500
the shell will stare
in their direction,

393
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,333
and that the look in its
eyes is filled with grief.
