[MALE PROMOTER A]
There you are, Mori.

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:17,125
Your new exhibition is turning
out to be a huge success.

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,791
Between your
popularity and talent,

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,833
you're now the standard all
artists will be held to.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,916
I've been very lucky
to make it this far.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,875
If I'm being honest, I owe much
of this success to my muse.

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,291
Nana has been an incredible
source of inspiration

9
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,291
in my recent endeavors.

[MORI gasps]

15
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,125
I suppose. The painting
itself is well done.

16
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,500
But the model is a bit...

17
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,708
She's certainly pretty
at first glance.

18
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,041
But if you look closely,
she's got a really goofy face.

19
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,791
[TOMIE giggles]

20
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,291

I guess that's true.

[MORI chuckles]

22
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:23,833
[TOMIE giggles] I'm sorry.
But there's an easy fix.

23
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,833
You need to change your model.

24
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:29,333
I bet your paintings would
be even better, then.

25
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
[NANA] You're stopping?
Hey, what's the matter?

26
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,458
[MORI gasps]
Nothing. Trust me.

27
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,083
You're looking even
prettier than usual, Nana.

28
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,708
I'm positive the next
exhibition will be stellar.

29
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,000
[NANA giggles]
You are such a flatterer.

[TOMIE laughs]

31
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,416
Seriously?

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,916
I can't believe you're still
using this same girl.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,416
[MORI gasps]
It's you.

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,833
And who exactly are
you supposed to be?

35
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,541
[TOMIE]
You remember what you said.

36
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,791
You told me you were ready
to end things with her.

37
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,125
And that after she was gone,

38
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,666
I'd be your new muse and
model in her place, right?

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,833
[NANA] What did you say?
Mori. Is that true?

40
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,458
O-Of course not!

41
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,541
Oh, come now. Are you
calling me a liar?

42
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,583
Allow me to refresh
your memory, then.

43
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,791
You said you were tired
of the Nana series,

44
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,500
that when you really
look at her face,

45
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,875
it's so silly that you can't
get motivated to paint. Hm.

46
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,375
[NANA] You. I had no idea
you felt that way about me.

47
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,916
You could have told me yourself.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,583
[MORI] Nana, wait, no,
you've got it all wrong.

I can't believe you.

51
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,500
What the hell was that?

52
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,791
Don't you realize what an
invaluable partner she's been?

53
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,000
Well. If you need a new model,

54
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,041
why don't you just use
me instead of her?

55
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,291
Doesn't that sound nice?

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,541
What was your name again?
I didn't catch it.

57
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh, that? I suppose
you can call me Tomie.

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,791
[MORI] And how did you
find out where I live?

59
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,833
Please, with this giant house,
it wasn't much of a challenge.

60
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
[MORI] I wonder if that means
I'm going to have to deal

61
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,000
with uninvited visitors
like you in the future.

62
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,541
Disrupting my work.

63
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,833
Possibly. But you will never
meet another girl like me again,

64
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,083
I can promise you that.

65
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,208
You seem very sure of yourself.

66
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,625
[TOMIE]
Yes. Because, understand,

67
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,833
there's no other girl in the
world quite as perfect as me.

68
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,291
[MORI]
I can't say you lack confidence.

69
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,041
I hope you don't either.

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
You're a good painter,
I'll give you that.

71
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,750
But will you really be able to
capture my image on your canvas?

72
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,333
We'll see.

73
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,125
I've had plenty of fine artists
try their hands at my portrait.

74
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,541
But in the end, none of them
were able to complete it

75
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,333
in a satisfactory way.

76
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,083
That's my dream.

77
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,375
To have my beauty recorded so
that it will live on forever.

78
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,833
I want it to
be permanent. Eternal.

79
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,208
[MORI sighs]
There. I think it's finished.

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,750
[TOMIE] Wow, done already?
Great, let me see.

81
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,125
I'd say it turned
out wonderfully.

82
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,875
[TOMIE giggles]
This is a joke, right?

83
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,250
You can't actually believe
that this is a masterpiece.

Hey, what are you laughing at?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,083
There's nothing funny
about this painting!

87

[TOMIE]
What are you, blind?

88
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,583
This thing doesn't convey
even a fraction of my beauty.

89
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,583
Oh... What a disappointment.
I obviously overestimated you.

[MORI] Hold on!
Don't leave yet. Please!

use for talentless artists.

like about the portrait I did?

Tsk! One more time.

paint Tomie again.

I should be painting her now!

[MORI] Huh? Masuda.
I guess it's been a while.

106
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,000
I heard your next big exhibition
got postponed for some reason.

107
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,291
I hope you haven't
been sick or anything.

108
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,125
Yeah, something like that.

109
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,916
[MASUDA] Oh, did you hear?
Iwata's career has been

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,291
seriously blowing
up lately, it's crazy.

111
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,000
Iwata? Are we thinking
about the same sculptor?

112
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,708
Yeah. He's been unveiling
amazing new works

113
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,666
on a regular basis these days.

114
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,125
I'm trying to remember
the title of the series.

115
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,291
It's the model's name, I think?

116
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,666
And you should see
this girl, she's gorgeous.

117
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,541
Huh, I wonder where he
found her. The only pieces

118
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,666
I ever saw Iwata do were
really depressing figurines.

119
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,125
I guess this model's
changed the way he sculpts.

120
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,458
I snapped a photo of them
in town the other day,

121

of what I'm talking about.

Here you go.

I know it's far from
being my greatest shot.

The girl in question's face is
all blurry. Still hot, though.

It can't be! That's Tomie!

name of the series!

been making some really

groundbreaking works
of art lately.

I was wondering if
I could see a few.

I'm not doing any public
viewings of them from now on.

rid of me that easily.

Tomie's beauty and capture the

thing that makes
her so intoxicating?

I won't leave until I see
it with my own eyes,

I'll force my way
in if I have to.

Is that what you want me to do?

00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
Iwata just started smashing
all of his works out of rage

157
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,458
for some reason.

158
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,250
And after he managed to create
the perfect sculpture of me.

159
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,666
I was so excited,

160
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,166
thinking there'd be a
permanent record of my beauty.

161
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,041
But then he started
destroying them,

162
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,333
and I don't understand
why he'd do that!

163
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:59,208
Tomie. I promise that I'm gonna
make your wish come true.

164
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,291
Let me paint you again,
and this time I swear

165
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,500
that I'll capture you
perfectly on my canvas.

166
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,375
You mean it? For real?
Don't toy with me.

167
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,458
Of course I do.

168
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,083
[TOMIE gasps]
Oh, Mori. I'm so glad!

169
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:24,000
[MORI chuckles]
Tomie. You are gorgeous.

170
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,750
I don't even know
how you can be real.

171
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,291
You know, today?

172
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,291
Well, it's not the first time
this sorta thing's happened.

173
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,791
[MORI]
What do you mean?

174
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,791
[TOMIE] I've almost been
killed by many men before.

175
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,666
For some reason, it seems
like every one who

176
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,625
falls in love with me
eventually wants to kill me.

177
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,625
To tear me apart.
Isn't that strange?

178
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,583
[MORI gasps]
It's finished. I've done it.

179
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,208
It looks exactly like you.

180
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,375
A perfect recreation
of your beauty!

181
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,916
Here, what do you think?

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,708
It's the greatest
painting I've ever done!

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,333
How dare you... bastard.

184
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,625
What is that?! You're the
worst artist I've ever met!

185
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,000
You don't mean that. It's you.
An undeniable masterpiece.

186
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,833
I won't let you mock me.
I'm not some kind of monster!

187
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,833
No, please. I beg of you.
Just take a better look.

188
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,666
[TOMIE]
I don't need to!

189
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,250
You're mistaken. What could
be wrong with the portrait?

190

[TOMIE giggles]

191

Tomie? What are you laughing at?

[TOMIE laughs]

201
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,458
[MORI] Each dismembered
piece of her body

202
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,291
began to come to life.
To grow anew.

203
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,208
Her cells reproduced.

204
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,125
Creating more and
more flesh and bone.

205
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,375
What a horrible ability for
a woman like her to have.

206
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,708
I am certain that with time,

207
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:33,750
each piece I hacked apart will
grow to look exactly like her.

Sorry, it's no use.

Someone's gonna have
to come fix it.

213

But these mountains
are so remote.

214
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,500
How are we supposed to
find help out here?

[ANZAI]
Nah. Don't worry.

218
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,625
[KANA] But we've been walking
for more than an hour now.

219
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,250
Look over there.
I think I see a shed.

220
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,083
That means there must be some
kind of town nearby, I bet.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,916
A bunch of kids.
They'll have parents.

Sure, but what are they doing?

Hey, guys, what's up?
Can you help us out?

Where do you kids live, huh?

00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,458
Does anyone have
a phone I can use?

We don't have any phones.

I think it's those children.

I don't hear anything.

my blood after they attacked.

00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,666
Was it really that her blood
wanted to escape from her?

311
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,833
It was hard for me to believe,
because the blood that grew

312
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
from my love's neck
was still a part of her.

313
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,833
It produced the most
beautiful fruits,

314
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,666
allowing her to live on forever.

315
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,166
[grunts]

316
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,375
Man, why am I so dizzy?

317
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,625
Kana?

318
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:35,708
[footsteps]

319
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,583
[ANZAI] Wait, are those
bloodstains? Where's Kana?

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,416
[gasps]

321
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,041
[gasps]

322
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,583
[MAN] Ah, yes. This is what's
become of the woman I loved.

323
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,875
[ANZAI gasps]

324
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,791
[MAN]
They're so warm.

325
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,666
She's still alive
in here, you see.

326
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,708
[ANZAI] Where is Kana, dammit?
What have you done to her?

327
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,291
What are you talking about?
As far as I know,

328
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,250
Kana should still be in the
room she's sharing with you.

329
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,833
You must have had a bad dream.

330
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,166
[ANZAI grunts]

331
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,416
[MAN]
You're obviously exhausted.

332
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
You should go back and
sleep until morning.

333
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,333
[MALE VILLAGER A]
Run...! Run, boy!

334
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,833
Who said that?

335
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,708
[MALE VILLAGER A] Quickly.
Get out of here. Save yourself.

336
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,750
[ANZAI gasps]
Who are you?

337
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,541
[MALE VILLAGER A]
I live here.

338
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,500
[ANZAI] A villager? But I
thought this place was deserted.

339
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,791
What are you doing
in this creepy room?

340
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:58,916
[MALE VILLAGER A] I was planted
here. Planted by that man.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,333
He appeared a few years ago and
used some sort of devilish power

342
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,000
to turn our villagers into
plants that bear bloody fruit.

343
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,833
He... He destroyed our families.
Men and women. Children.

344
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,833
Everyone. What you see
around you are the remains

345
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,583
of the other villagers,
all that's left.

346
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,791
This room is a living
field that he created

347
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,416
to farm blood from us.

348
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,416
What the hell is happening?

349
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,416
[MALE VILLAGER A] There isn't
any time. Get out of here. Go.

350
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,416
Otherwise you'll end up
a crop. Just like me.

351
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,083
Nothing but a husk.

352
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,500
[ANZAI gasps]

353
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:48,166
[ANZAI pants]
Kana...! Kana...! Kana!

354
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,958
You're here. Thank God. Get up,
we have to leave right now.

355
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,166
Okay.

356
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,083
[MAN] I'm afraid that
there is no escape.

357
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,583
[ANZAI gasps]
You're wrong.

358
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,041
You two will inevitably return
to this place. Just look.

359
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,416
Her neck is sprouting.
Beautifully.

360
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,250
She's going to be reborn as a
fertile gem of darkness for me.

361
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,958
[ANZAI] Shut up!
Let's go, Kana. Can you stand?

362
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,000
[KANA]
Yeah.

363
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:19,083
[KANA, ANZAI pant]

364
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,250
[KANA] I can't keep going,
Anzai. Let's take a quick break.

365
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,875
[ANZAI] Sure. Good idea.
We're far enough away.

366
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,291
[ANZAI gasps]

367
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,375
[KANA]
Do you think we're safe now?

368
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,458
[KANA]
What is it?

369
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,458
[ANZAI]
Well...

370
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,500
[ANZAI gasps]

371
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,916
[ANZAI] Isn't there anything
we can do to stop this?

372
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,083
[MALE VILLAGER A]
There is only one way.

373
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,666
You must swallow the fruit that
grows from your own body.

374
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,583
But beware, if you do so,

375
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,291
you will develop an endless
thirst for the blood of others.

376
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,625
It is a desire that
will never be sated.

377
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,708
[KANA slurps]

378
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,166
