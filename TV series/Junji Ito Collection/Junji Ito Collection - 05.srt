00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:14,208
[MIO breathes heavily]

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,208
[MIO whimpers]

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,166
[MIO screams]

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,333
It's okay.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,041
[MIO]
Someone help!

6
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,791
Don't run! Just hold on!

7
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,333
[MIO grunts]
Let go. I wanna leave.

8
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,375
Wait, aren't you Mio
Fujii from my class?

9
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,708
What are you doing
in my house?

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,375
Oshikiri, please.
I just want to go home.

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,958
Don't hurt me or do
anything terrible.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,416
[MIO gasps]

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,833
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,500
[MIO, OKASHIRI gasp]

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,208
[OSHIKIRI gasps]

16
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,083
[STUDENTS chatter]

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,416
[OSHIKIRI]
There she is.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,875
Sitting in class like
nothing ever happened.

19
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,000
Her usual, cheery self.

20
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,250
A different person
from last night.

21
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,125
That's right. It must have
been a different person.

22
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,333
It couldn't be the same
girl I'm looking at now.

23
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,666
Maybe it was just the other
world's version of Mio.

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,208
[MIO]
Huh?

25
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,375
[OSHIKIRI] She wandered into
this realm for just a moment.

26
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,041
Long enough to meet me.

27
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,500
Then she passed back
to her own reality.

28
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,833
My house is full of doors that
seem to lead into another world.

29
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,458
One that looks
identical to mine.

30
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,666
[OSHIKIRI] Maybe that girl was
from the other side, lost.

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,416
But then, what was she
doing in my house, I wonder.

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,041
[MIO]
Hi, Oshikiri.

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,625
Uh? Oh, hey, good morning Mio.
Did you need something?

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,291
It's your turn. Remember?

35
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,958
You're up for class
journal duty.

36
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,416
[OSHIKIRI]
Oh, right. Thanks.

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,375
Are you sure that's all
you have to say to me?

38
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,416
Nothing else on your
mind this morning?

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,791
[OSHIKIRI gasps] No. Look.
I wasn't checking you out.

40
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,375
Liar. You totally were.

41
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:49,041
[MIO giggles] Fine, whatever.
Don't lose that journal, okay?

42
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,041
[AOYAMA] Well, well.
Got a thing for Mio, huh?

43
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,416
That's so cute.
The shrimp's in love.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,416
You're such a tiny
little dude, though.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,333
Look, man, if you
made a move on her,

46
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
I think it'd just be an
embarrassing mistake.

47
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,041
She'd tower over you,
imagine how dumb you'd look.

48
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,750
Oh, shut up, Aoyama.

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,541
You're starting to
get on my nerves.

50
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,958
[AOYAMA]
Huh?

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,916
You've got real big mouth
for being such a weakling.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,458
What's the matter?
Come on, bitch boy!

53
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,625
At least put up
some kind of fight.

54
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,708
Runt! Runt!

55
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,041
--[OSHIKIRI] Bastard!
--Here we go!

56
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:28,083
[AOYAMA, OKASHIRI grunt]

57
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,625
[MIO]
Get off him! Enough already.

58
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,208
[AOYAMA]
Remember that.

59
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,958
[MIO]
Hey, are you okay?

60
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,666
I'm fine...

61
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,541
[OSHIKIRI] Damn it.
I can't stand that idiot.

62
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,041
[OSHIKIRI gasps]

63
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,916
[AOYAMA]
Oshikiri... Oshikiri...

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,500
[OSHIKIRI gasps]

65
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,916
[AOYAMA]
Oshikiri!

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,958
Show yourself,
you little pissant.

67
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,541
[OSHIKIRI]
That sounds like...

68
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,875
[AOYAMA]
Oshikiri. Where are you?

69
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,416
[OSHIKIRI]
Aoyama?

70
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,208
Oshikiri.

71
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,875
[gasps]

72
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,375
I finally found you!

73
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,791
[OSHIKIRI shouts]
You're... a monster!

74
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:18,333
You... I'll murder you.
Tear you apart!

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,625
[OSHIKIRI gasps]

76
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,791
[OSHIKIRI]
What's happening?

77
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,708
[MIO] So. I heard you live
in a gigantic mansion.

78
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,166
Like something out of
a movie. Is that true?

79
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,375
Well...

80
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,916
[MIO] I'd love come over
and see it sometime!

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,541
[OSHIKIRI]
I wouldn't if I were you.

82
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,125
Aw, why not?

83
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,000
[OSHIKIRI] And I wouldn't
ask about it, either.

84
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,791
Why are you being
so secretive?

85
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,125
Oh, I get it.
You must be a shy one.

86
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,666
That's not the reason.

87
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,291
I never see you talking
to other people, Oshikiri.

88
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't think that's a
good thing for anybody.

89
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,166
You need to make some friends

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,500
or else you'll turn
into a real weirdo.

91
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,333
[OSHIKIRI grunts]

92
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,833
[crows caw]

93
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,041
[MIO]
Wow, is this it?

94
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,916
I had no idea our town
had any houses this big.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,791
This is your last
chance to turn back.

96
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,916
Are you still trying
to be mysterious?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,625
Believe me, it's for
your own good.

98
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,166
This house has passages
to another world.

99
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,000
[MIO]
Is that some kind of joke?

100
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,541
[OSHIKIRI] It's the truth.
There are places inside

101
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,208
that allow people to travel
between two worlds.

102
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,083
The other one looks a lot like
ours from what I can tell.

103
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,500
I even saw someone who
looked exactly like me once,

104
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,333
just a for second.

105
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,291
[OSHIKIRI sighs] You shouldn't
poke around supernatural places

106
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,625
like this just because
you're bored or curious.

107
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,958
[MIO]
I'm not worried,

108
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,333
I don't believe in any of
that kinda stuff anyway.

109
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,333
Are you sure you're not dreaming
about this doppelganger?

110
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,208
Believe me, I wish I was
hallucinating everything.

111
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,125
If you're serious, then maybe
I can help you somehow.

112
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,000
[OSHIKIRI] Yeah, maybe.
You can come in.

113
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,500
Just keep an eye open
for anything off.

114
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,166
[OSHIKIRI]
Mio? Where'd you go?

115
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,916
[OSHIKIRI]
It's been three days.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,083
But Mio hasn't come to school,
and she's been reported missing.

117
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,041
Maybe back in the courtyard,

118
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,416
she accidentally wandered
into the other world.

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,041
[shuffling]

120
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,708
[OSHIKIRI gasps] Oh, no.
What's in the hallway now?

121
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,333
[MIO]
Hm? There you are, Oshikiri.

122
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,333
I've been searching
for you. Turn me back.

123
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,166
Make my body normal again,
I beg of you!

124
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,541
Oh my God, is that
really you, Mio?

125
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,083
[MIO groans] Oshikiri! I can't
believe you did this to me!

126
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,875
I'll curse you! You won't
get away with this!

127
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:01,916
[MIO screams]

128
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:19,083
[OSHIKIRI] That voice.
She sounded exactly like Mio.

129
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,958
But wait. Which one was it?
The Mio from the other side?

130
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,333
[OSHIKIRI] Either way,
it seems like something

131
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,666
really horrifying is going on
in the parallel world.

132
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,708
Wait a sec.

133
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,583
This is the first floor,
but I was upstairs just now.

134
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,291
How'd I get down here?

135
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,583
[MIO]
Stop it, please!

136
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,916
[OSHIKIRI gasps]

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,458
[OSHIKIRI]
Was that--?

138
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:50,875
[MIO] Please, just untie me.
Don't do this! Oshikiri, stop!

139
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,125
[OSHIKIRI]
That's... the other me!

140
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,416
[MIO]
Let me go!

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,291
[OSHIKIRI]
And he's got Mio!

142
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm afraid it's far
too late to stop.

143
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,083
I still have so much
important research to do.

144
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,166
Aoyama was the first person
I tried the treatment on.

145
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,500
But it was no good,
he grew too large.

146
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,291
Then I experimented on you.

147
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,125
Or, I guess I should say it was
the Mio Fujii from this world,

148
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
your counterpart of sorts.

149
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,666
But she turned into nothing
more than a pile of flesh,

150
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,875
so I banished both of those
failures to your side.

151
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,416
And then you showed up, which
was excellent timing, really.

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,291
Now I can test my adjusted
formula without having to find

153
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,250
a new specimen from my world.

154
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,208
If it works, it will
increase my height

155
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,291
without unpleasant
side effects.

156
