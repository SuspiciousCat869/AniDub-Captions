1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,000
[YUI] You could see Mt. Fuji
from the town where I was born.

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,625
Massive and majestic.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,916
It was forever looming
in the background.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,916
Looking at it always
helped to clear my head

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,708
if I was having a bad day.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,958
Sometimes I'd spend hours
staring at the mountain.

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,041
And afterwards, I wouldn't
want to go back home again.

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,500
[sighs]

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,750
[YUI] My father ran a
hole-in-the-wall <i>yakiniku</i>

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,416
restaurant on the ground
floor of our little house.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,791
It was always dark at home,
and the air was thick with oil.

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,291
The mats, the walls,
even our furniture.

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,875
Everything was covered in
a film of yellow grease.

14
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,750
After our mom was gone,
no one took over the cleaning.

15
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,916
It got so bad that there was a
slick layer of fat on the spare

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,833
mattresses in the closet.

17
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,333
No matter how many times
I tried washing things,

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,000
the grease would
always come back.

19
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,541
To make matters worse, my dad
was incredibly oily himself.

20
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,750
He always had a pungent,
fatty smell to him.

21
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,375
My brother was two years older
than me, and a real monster.

22
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:14,375
Whenever Dad wasn't around,
he'd bully me. Often violently.

23
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,250
I never knew what
would set him off.

24
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,083
He also had a bizarre,
secret habit.

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,458
Every now and then he'd sneak
into the kitchen and drink

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,208
vegetable oil. It seemed
like he enjoyed it.

27
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,416
[YUI gasps]

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,416
[gasps]

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,250
You're watching me,
aren't you, Yui?

30
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,166
You better not tell dad,
or I'll make you regret it.

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,750
You know what'll
happen if you do.

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,041
How much I can hurt you.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,333
[YUI] The sticky walls.
My father's sickening odor.

34
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,916
And my brother, who was as
disgusting as the fat itself.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,583
I hated it all.

36
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,958
The older I got,

37
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,666
the more sensitive I became
to the oil in our house.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,958
I was eventually able
to sense how much of it

39
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,125
was in the air at
any given time.

40
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,333
I could feel it around me.

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,166
Clinging to my skin
and coating my lungs.

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,291
Oil saturation. That's the
term I used to describe

43
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,625
how much grease there was.
Like a weather report.

44
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,125
Ding dong, ding dong.

45
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,750
The current oil
saturation is at 50%.

46
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,916
Please exercise caution
around any open flames.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,458
The current oil saturation
level is at 60%.

48
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,958
I repeat, saturation
level is at 60%.

49
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,333
[YUI]
When my brother entered puberty,

50
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,000
he started getting really bad
pimples all over his forehead.

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,250
Eventually, the breakouts
spread to the rest of his face.

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,583
[GIRL B giggling]
Hey, be quiet or he'll hear you.

53
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,458
[BOY A] You stay the
hell away from us, Goro!

54
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,333
[BOY B] Your face looks
like it's about to erupt.

55
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,708
[BOY A]
Idiot!

56
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,250
You touched my uniform with
your greasy nose, freak.

57
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,875
You gotta pay for the cleaning.

58
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:35,375
I want 50,000 yen by tomorrow
or you're dead, got it?

--[YUI screams]
--[GORO] I saw you there!

63
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,166
You laughed, didn't you?

64
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,083
You thought I deserved
to get beaten up.

65
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,875
[YUI'S DAD]
Goro, stop this right now!

66
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,666
Let go of me, dammit!

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,958
It's your fault my face looks
like this in the first place!

68
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,541
My entire body is polluted
thanks to all the oil

69
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,708
from your restaurant.

70
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,875
But you don't give a
damn at all, do you?

71
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:06,583
[YUI'S DAD] Stop it, Goro!
That's enough. Calm yourself.

72
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,541
[YUI] After that,
my brother shut himself up

73
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:12,583
in his dark room. He just sat
there drinking bottles of oil.

74
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:18,250
[GORO grunts] Yui? Hey, Yui!
Where the hell are you?

75
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,458
I'm here. What's the matter?

76
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,708
[GORO] I'm outta oil.
Go buy some more.

77
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,708
And get me a new mattress, too.

78
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,625
This one's so sticky, I can't
sleep on it. It's gross!

79
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,375
Yeah, mine's the same way.

80
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,541
Only, Dad won't
give me any money.

81
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,250

be cash somewhere!

have to make me so angry?

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,375

Disgusting!

84
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:48,708
[GORO] Huh? Did you...
just say I was disgusting?

85
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,208
[YUI gasps]

86
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,875

my face that much, do you?

[GORO chuckles]
Yeah? You like that?

All the oil coming up
from my volcanoes?

00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,541
Serves you right.

You and everyone else always
trying to make a fool out of me.

You wait. I'll kill
every last one of you!

And you're the first one
who's going to be punished.

96
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,375
This is what you get
for laughing at me!

be kidding, right?

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,916
I'm not eating there.
That place is seriously filthy.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,708
Yeah. But it's good.

105
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,333
I went the other day and
the food was incredible.

106
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,208
The meat was super fatty.

107
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,083
In that case...

Welcome, gentlemen!

of that delicious new meat.

Oh, hm. I'm sorry, but...

...we actually ran out
of that meat yesterday.

113

You're gonna have to
order something else.

Aw, man. Really?

Uh, yeah.

116

Current oil saturation, 70%.
That's higher than yesterday.

117
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,541
[YUI] It was around
that time that I started

118
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,583
having really odd dreams.
And terrible nightmares.

119
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,166
[YUI] They usually
started off the same way.

120

With me staring at Mt. Fuji.

[YUI gasps]

122
00:07:56,416 --> 00:08:00,166

Oh, no!

[YUI] More and more

130

all over my face. And because
I was embarrassed,

131
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,416
I barely ever left the house.

not feeling any better?

Why don't you go take a
walk or something outside?

you a drink.

155
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,500
[YUI] From that point on,
I took precautions.

156
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,458
At night I was
constantly on guard.

Who cares about <i>yakiniku</i> ?

159
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,000
[YUI] In the days that followed,
my dad got even greasier.

160
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,083
The saturation level
would rise the moment

161
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,958
he walked into the room.

162
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,458
[YUI] There would be a
layer of grease in the bath

163
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,541
after he used it.
Shimmering sickly.

164
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,708
And more oil soaked into his
mattress than ever before,

165
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,416
as if it were a sponge.

[YUI] What dribbled down
to the floor wasn't blood.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,250
Instead, it was thick,
golden-brown oil.

172

The current saturation level

[KANAKO] My grandmother
lives in the country alone,

and lately it seems
like she's scared.

00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,000
She asked for someone,
anyone to come over.

This place always
looks so gloomy.

[KANAKO] Who would be
out here at this hour?

179

Maybe a friend of grandma's?

Excuse me. Good evening.

You must know my grandmother,

Oh, good. I hoped so.

183
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,208
She's lived here
since last year.

184
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,958
That's when my grandfather died.

185
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,833
Honestly, we've all been
kind of worried about her,

that she has visitors.

Just give me a second.

00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,583
[KANAKO gasps]
Grandma, what was that thing?

195
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,083
That's Kingorou.
He's family, my uncle.

196
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,458
But he died a
very long time ago.

197
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,625
I was only a child
when it happened.

198
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,958
Still, I remember it.

199
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,541
He's out there
every night lately.

200
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,375
Wandering around the bridge.

201
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,166
Since your grandpa died and
I've been alone out here,

202
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,208
those things have started
popping up around sundown.

203
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,708
You'll likely see more of them.

204
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,750
[KANAKO] Are you saying
that they're ghosts?

205
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,458
[OSODE] They must have
been waiting for me

206
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,583
to be by myself before
they showed up.

[GHOSTS murmuring]

208
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,083
You hear that, the ghosts
are calling for me.

209
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,500
But there's... so many voices.

210
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,250
A lot of people in this village
have died over the generations.

211
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,875
And many of them haven't
fully passed on yet.

212
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,958
Yes, but, what do
they want with you?

213
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,750
Well, you see, my dear.

214
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,625
They want to get a hold of me
and drag me down into the river.

215
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,583
Look closely at them.
They're beckoning me out.

216
00:13:51,666 --> 00:14:01,000
[GHOSTS] Osode! Osode, come join
us in the water, Osode! Join us!

We're waiting for you, Osode!

[KANAKO gasps]

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,625
They yell for me all night long,

220
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,000
I've barely slept at all since
I've been back at this house.

221
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,625
I'm sure you'll see. You won't
be able to sleep, either.

222
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,666
Instead, why don't I tell you a
story from when I was young

223
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,708
that might explain a few things.

224
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,541
Come, take a seat
over here with me.

225
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,125
It's a tale I've never
told you before.

226
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,291
I was born and raised
in this house.

227
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,625
My entire life has been spent
living within these walls,

228
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,250
give or take a few years.

229
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,625
The village used to
be pretty lively.

230
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,958
I know that must be hard
to believe because of

231
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,500
how empty it feels these days.

232
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,666
But back then, we were
a tight community,

233
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,375
and we even had
some odd traditions.

234
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,125
Like the way we
handled our funerals.

235
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,666
[OSODE] The first funeral I can
remember was when Kingorou died.

236
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,083
The uncle who you met outside.

237
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,958
The day of the ceremony,
everyone in the village

238
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,500
met at the edge of the river
to see his body off to heaven.

239
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,541
I watched by my mother's side

240
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,500
from a spot on top
of the bridge.

241

He's coming! Kingorou's just
around the bend.

to make it through the opening.

Hey, wait, Mom.

249
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,916
What's going to happen to him
now that he's in the water?

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,208
[OSODE'S MOM] The river widens
on this side of the bridge.

251
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,416
And it's much deeper as well.
He won't drift downstream.

252
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,166
He's going to sink here.

253
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,916
If he had just
stayed on the mat,

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
he could have been able to
float on, all the way to heaven!

[MAN D] Can't we at least
tie the bodies to the mats?

00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,541
It would be much safer.

257
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,083
[MAN E]
That's out of the question.

258

Tradition is tradition,
after all.

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,833
[OSODE]
And then there was Shokichi.

260
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,916
Shokichi?

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,250
Yes, he was a very
popular young man

262
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,625
in the village who died when
he was only 20 years old.

263
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,875
He was also the last person
who we put to rest that way,

264
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,791
sending his body floating
down the river.

I was 16 when it happened.

266
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,166
Shokichi was the biggest man
in the village. A giant.

267
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,375
Goodness, he must have been
over six and a half feet tall.

268
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:44,166
But he was a good man. He had
a gentle heart as soft as silk.

269
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,416
He was the first person
I ever fell in love with.

[OSODE chuckles]
And he was my fiancé.

271
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,125
But some trees fell on
him in the mountain,

272
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,583
and he passed away.

273
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,583
He was so tall we had to
use two mats at the funeral.

00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,375
I was so sick with grief
that I was beside myself.

275
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,625
Even if some people were
secretly excited to see if his

276

As he floated away,

it felt like my love Shokichi
had his eyes wide open,

Is that possible?

what he was trying to say

--[GHOSTS murmur]

298

I think that... maybe his

I don't think I'm going to last
much longer in this world.

307
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,875
What are you saying, grandma?

308
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,791
You only think that because
you've been alone here too long.

309
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,333
You're coming back to the
city with me tomorrow.

310
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,166
It's too late for me.
I'm going to die very soon.

311
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,458
No, grandma,
you can't say that.

312
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,000
Kana, dear. If I die,
please promise me

313
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,541
that you'll bury me
beneath the ground.

314
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,583
No matter what happens, don't
let me float down the river.

315
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,125
I don't want to sink
into the water forever.

316
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,083
Promise me. I'm counting on you.

317
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,500
[KANAKO gasps] Are you okay?
Please talk to me, what's wrong?

318
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,583
Grandma! Grandma!
Please don't die.

319
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,916
[KANAKO gasps]

320
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:44,500
Thank goodness.
It was just a dream.

321
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,541
I get it. I must have gotten
sleepy on the way here

322
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,333
and pulled over so
I could take a little nap.

323
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,833
That's creepy. Just like
it was in my dream.

324
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,666
[KANAKO]
It can't be...

325
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,083
[KANAKO]
Good evening.

326
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,166
[KINGOROU]
My niece, Osode.

327
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,458
I'm sorry to tell you
that she's passed away.

328
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,000

--[KANAKO] Grandma!

330
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,625
Grandma, are you back here?

331
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,583
Grandma?

332
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,833
[KANAKO]
Oh, no...

333
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,000

[KANAKO gasps]

335
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:10,416
[MALE GHOST A] Look!
Up the river. Here comes Osode!

336
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,458
[GHOSTS murmuring]

337
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,750
Isn't it wonderful?

338
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,458
Now Osode and Shokichi
can finally be married.

339
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,208
Yes, but Osode has grown to
be quite old, unfortunately.

340
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,375
[KANAKO]
Grandma! Grandma!

341
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,250
[KANAKO]
Am I crazy,

342
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,583
or did it seem like
she was looking at me?
