[YUUJI] My bedroom window
looks straight out into

00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,250
my neighbor's backyard.

00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,916
The place is nice, but doesn't
get a whole lot of sunlight.

No!

00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,375
[YUUJI]
Rina, the girl next door,

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,875
is a few years younger than
I am, and apparently she's

8
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,916
been sick all her life.
She never leaves the house.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,916
At least, not that I've seen.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,375
[RINA yells]

11
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,875
[RINA]
The bugs! I can feel them!

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,958
[RINA'S MOM]
Rina, quiet down, please.

13
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,083
There are no bugs,
I promise. Look!

14
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:00,416
[RINA] They're coming! I can
see them! They're everywhere!

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,958
[YUUJI] Wow. She must
really be afraid of bugs.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,958
[giggles]

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,291
[YUUJI'S GRANDPA]
I'm cold. So cold.

18
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,875
[YUUJI]
Is Grandpa okay?

19
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,166
Your grandfather's going to
be travelling to heaven

20
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
very soon, dear.

21
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,666
[YUUJI'S MOM]
Yuuji! You can't go in there!

22
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,416
This man has passed on.

23
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,666
[RINA giggles]

24
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,625
[RINA'S MOM] Rina! What are
you doing over there?

25
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,375
Get back inside.

26
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,416
[HIDEO]
Really? That's weird as hell.

27
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
[YUUJI] Don't tell anyone
else about this, Hideo.

28
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,458
[HIDEO] You actually
think there's a disease

29
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,375
that covers your
body in holes?

30
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,208
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's what I saw

31
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,083
whenever my
grandpa died, too.

32
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,875
And whenever I ask
my family about it,

33
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,708
they tell me I just
dreampt it all up.

34
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,291
They won't answer
any of my questions.

35
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,041
I think I might
agree with them.

36
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,041
Well, how do you explain
Rina's arm, then?

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,708
I mean, it's not like you
saw her up close, right?

38
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,291
[YUUJI grunts]

39
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,291
[HIDEO] Now, which one of these
combos comes with the most food?

40
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,875
Anybody home?

41
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,166
[YUUJI'S MOM]
Oh, Hideo, it's been so long!

42
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,750
Yuuji, your friend is here!

43
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,833
Hey, bud!

44
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,750
[YUUJI]
Come on back.

45
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,583
It was nice to see you.

46
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,875
[HIDEO] So, I mentioned what
you said about that Rina girl

47
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,833
to my mom. How you
saw those holes.

48
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,208
Idiot, I told you to keep
that stuff to yourself.

49
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,666
[HIDEO]
Just listen.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,250
My mom already knew
about her condition.

51
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,458
She used to be a nurse
when I was a kid.

52
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,708
And it turns out, she was in the
room whenever Rina was born.

53
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,708
Apparently she
didn't cry at all.

54
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,375
She didn't make a sound.

55
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,916
They couldn't get her
to breathe, either,

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,791
no matter what they did.

57
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,833
Which means she should
have died, right?

58
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,208
But, somehow, Rina survived.

59
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,916
And then, A few days later,

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,125
these little holes started
appearing all over her body.

61
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,833
From what the
doctors could tell,

62
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,083
it seemed like she was breathing
through those new openings.

63
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,958
Then again, my mom does have a
pretty warped sense of humor.

64
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,833
I mean, that whole story might
just be her idea of a bad joke.

65
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,958
Whoa, where'd these
old books come from?

66
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,083
[YUUJI]
They belonged to my grandpa.

67
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,291
This used to be his room,
before he passed away.

68
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,958
[HIDEO]
Huh? A diary?

69
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,625
Is this yours?

70
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,041
[YUUJI] Do I seem like a
person who'd keep a diary?

71
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,125
I guess it must've been
your grandpa's then.

72
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,708
Maybe we should read it.

73
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,583
Eh, I don't know.

74
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,750
Come on, this might be the
only way to find the truth

75
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,666
about how he died.

76
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,125
Weird. Look at this drawing.

77
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,000
"I got my hands on
something very..."

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,375
[YUUJI'S GRANDPA]
...odd today.

79
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:38,416
A peculiar carving made out
of beautiful green jade.

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,875
September 13th. I spent my
hours gazing at the jade figure.

81
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,375
September 23rd. I couldn't
stop shivering all day.

82
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,375
I feel so cold. And I keep
finding strange marks

83
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,833
that have appeared on my skin.

84
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,708
September 25th.

85
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,250
This afternoon, some doctor
that no one called for came by

86
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,208
and gave me an injection.

87
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,958
September 27th.

88
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,833
I can't believe it, but holes
have opened up all over my body.

89
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,250
I can feel air entering
me through them.

90
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,625
I don't understand
what's happening.

91
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,416
September 29th.

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,916
A swarm of insects came
through the window today.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,958
They looked just like
the jade carving.

94
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:25,541
They entered my body through
the holes in my back.

95
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:30,916
I can feel them moving around
inside of me. Crawling.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,333
October 2nd.

97
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,375
I'm growing so weak, and there
are even more holes now.

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,750
The jade figure has damned me!

99
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,666
Anyone who touches
it will be cursed.

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,750
I used what little strength
I have left to throw it

101
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,500
out my window.
Will that help?

102
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,125
[HIDEO] The handwriting gets
too messy to read after that.

103
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,875
This means I was right
about the holes after all.

104
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,666
He threw out the carving,
and now Rina next door is being

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,875
cursed by it.

106
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,833
Are you sure this
is for real, though?

107
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,833
This has got to be made up.

[RINA whimpers, yells]

114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,083
[YUUJI] Could he be
the mysterious doctor

115
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,125
this diary mentions?

116
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,291
The same one who was with
grandpa when he died?

117
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,416
From what I can remember,
they look pretty similar.

118
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
This man has passed on.

119
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,541
[YUUJI]
So, if he's Rina's doctor...

120
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,083
...and if the jade carving
was what caused all this,

121
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,791
he might be looking
for it or something.

122
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,958
Maybe I should tell them about
this diary. For Rina's sake.

What happened to you?

I found it!

[YUUJI] Holy crap.
Is that the jade carving?

136
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,875
The day we read the diary.
I went searching for it.

137
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,708
It was in the exact spot
Rina was pointing.

138
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,250
I didn't believe that
the curse was real.

139
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,458
I thought maybe I
could sell the jade.

140
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,208
But I was so, so wrong
about everything.

141
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,458
It was all true. Holes started
opening up all over my body.

142
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,500
And then that man appeared.

143
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,708
He's the curse's servant.
He goes wherever the jade goes.

I was born into a poor family

of traveling entertainers.

Our father was the

Are you all... being controlled
through the ceiling?

310
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,416
Yes, that's right. Our bodies
are actually being manipulated

311
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,708
with piano wire at the moment.

312
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,500
[HARUHIKO]
So, someone's up there

313
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,125
pulling your strings, then?

314
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,458
[YUKIHIKO] Several highly
skilled workers I've hired.

315
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,750
Right now there are four or
five of them handling me.

316
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,000
I had this house built
for that very purpose.

317
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,583
[HARUHIKO]
Why go through so much trouble?

318
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
Why not just move on your own?

319
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,333
Tell me, brother, do I look
troubled to you in any way?

320
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,791
With the exception
of my fingers,

321
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,083
my body is completely relaxed.

322
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,791
And yet, despite being
so at ease,

323
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,583
I can still move
however I'd like to.

324
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,041
People believe
it's the puppeteer

325
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,500
who controls the puppet.

326
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,583
But, as I've always thought,
it's the other way around.

327
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,666
It is actually the puppet
who is truly in control.

328
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,208
Do you understand?

329
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,041
[SUMIRE]
Our new ballerina is ready!

330
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,000
Come on in. Let's see her.

331
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,333
[SUMIRE]
Well? Isn't she stunning?

332
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,375
[YUKIHIKO]
Ah! Absolutely beautiful.

333
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,750
Though, it looks to me like
she's still far too tense

334
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,416
to dance.

335
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,750
[NATSUMI]
Huh?

336
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,458
[YUKIHIKO]
Try relaxing more.

337
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:12,625
[NATSUMI gasps, giggles]

338
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,625
--[YUKIHIKO] Fantastic!
--[clapping]

339
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,750
Natsumi, take those strings off
right now. We're leaving.

340
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,875
[NATSUMI]
What? Why?

341
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,166
There's really no
need to go, brother.

342
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,958
You two can unwind
with us here today.

343
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,083
I'm sorry. But we're not
getting mixed up in this

344
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
sick marionette
fantasy of yours.

345
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,666
Go change your clothes.

346
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,458
No way. If you wanna leave,
then go, but I'm staying here.

347
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,000
In fact, I'm going to
move into this house.

348
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,041
Why don't you go live with
Kinuko or something?

349
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,875
Don't be stupid, Natsumi.

350
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,083
[YUKIHIKO]
We'd love to have her.

351
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,833
You should move in,
too, Haruhiko.

352
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,625
No thanks, brother.

353
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,958
[KINUKO]
What's the matter?

354
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,666
I feel like you've
been avoiding me.

355
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,500
What happened? And why haven't I
seen your sister around lately?

356
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,833
[HARUHIKO]
When it came to my brother,

357
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,625
I always found a way
to change the subject.

358
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,916
I couldn't bring myself to
introduce Kinuko to him

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,166
and his weird marionette family.

360
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,833
[YUKIHIKO] You'll be happy
to know that Natsumi's

361
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,791
fitting in perfectly
here at the house.

362
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:16,375
That's right! I'm a first-class
prima ballerina, you know.

363
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,625
[HARUHIKO]
Huh? What's that?

364
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,416
[HARUHIKO laughs]
Oh, let me guess,

365
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,875
you want to string
me up, too, don't you?

366
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,875
Sorry, but I think
I'm gonna pass.

367
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,166
I have no intention of joining
your little dance party.

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,208
[KINUKO]
So that's it.

369
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,666
He's seeing another
woman on the side.

370
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,125
Damn it!

371
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,583
He's dead wrong if he thinks
I'm just gonna back down.

372
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:42,791
[door clatters]

[KINUKO gasps]

374
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,708
[KINUKO]
Okay. That's a little creepy.

375
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,875
Wait. I've seen you before.
In the old truck.

376
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,083

[HARUHIKO grunts]
What are you doing?

00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,666
[NATSUMI, YUKIHIKO, SUMIRE yell]

380
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,583
[NATSUMI]
Please, brother. Help me!

381
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,500
What the hell is this?
Bro, come on, make them stop!

382
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,958
[YUKIHIKO] It's no use!
I can't move like I want to.

383
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,500
[YUKIHIKO gasps]
He must be upset.

384
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,500
He's the one to blame for this.
It's Jean-Pierre's fault!

385
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,291
[HARUHIKO] Hey, you!
People up there in the ceiling!

386
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,958
Cut it out! Let them loose!

387
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,208
[NATSUMI]
Help me!

[BOTH grunting]

399

[HARUHIKO pants] It can't be.
How is this possible?

400
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,708
[NATSUMI]
Where did you go?

401
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,166
[NATSUMI] Big brother,
I can't get up. What's wrong?

402
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,500
Don't worry! You'll be
back to normal soon.

403

Where're the others?

[gasps]

405
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:55,166
[HARUHIKO]
They're... marionettes?

406
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
[HARUHIKO]
My brother and his family

407
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,125
had completely transformed.
They were just dolls now.

408
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,250
Was it because they had been
manipulated like puppets

409
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,708
for so long? Was that to blame
for what happened to them?

410
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,750
Or was it possible they were
puppets the whole time?

411
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,750
I had no way of
knowing for sure.
