1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:12,000
[CHILDREN chattering]

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,750
Have you met the new
transfer student yet?

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,083
I think the two of you might
get along pretty well.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,291
Yeah, I could see that.

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,208
He's kinda strange,
though, dontcha think?

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,541
Huh. And speaking of the devil.

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,208
Hey, Tsukano!

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,125
I'm Shibayama.
And this here is Hosotani.

9
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,375
Both of us are in
your homeroom class.

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,125
How do you like
the new school so far?

11
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,458
[TSUKANO]
I really love it here.

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,083
And not just the school,
the whole town's the best.

13
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,083
I think there might be
a few mysterious things

14
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,416
hiding around the area.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,833
Wait, really?

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,625
I dunno, I've lived in
this town since I was a baby.

17
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,166
Trust me when I say there's
nothing interesting.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,583
Sorry, but she's right.

19
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,791
Honestly, It's a pretty
boring place to live.

20
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,625
We have put together
a group of people

21
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,541
interested in exploring the more
unusual things in life, though.

22
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,291
[HOSOTANI] We call it
the Supernatural Club.

23
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,541
Sounds cool, huh?

24
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,583
[SHIBAYAMA]
Whaddaya think?

25
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,375
Would you maybe
consider joining it?

26
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,125
We promise it's not
dumb or anything.

27
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,750
Are you serious?!
I'm totally into joining.

28
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,750
I love weird and creepy
stuff like that.

29
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,125
Welcome aboard.

30
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,291
In that case, I can
let you in on a secret.

31
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,000
He actually has
special abilities.

32
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,083
--[SHIBAYAMA chuckles]
--He's even gonna be on TV soon.

33
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,083
[TSUKANO]
What?

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,291
It's nothing too
flashy. I promise.

35
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,708
I don't have crazy superpowers
or anything like that.

36
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,041
[TSUKANO] Wow, I don't care,
that's still so cool!

37
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,500
You've gotta show me!

38
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,166
[SHIBAYAMA] How about we have
a little welcome party

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,041
for you after school's out?

40
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,416
I can show you during that.

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,083
I can't believe I
just started here

42
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,208
and I'm already seeing
awesome stuff.

43
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,916
--[HOSOTANI gasps]
--[SHIBAYAMA] Huh? What is it?

44
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,750
Take a look at this.

45
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,500
What a strange flower.

46
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,708
[HOSOTANI gasps]
It's an eyeball!

47
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,416
When did odd plants like that
start growing on campus?

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,083
Ugh. They're so gross.

49
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:53,250
This town is incredible!
I'm gonna have so much fun here!

50
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,000
[TSUKANO singing]

51
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,333
[SHIBAYAMA]
Everyone listen up.

52
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,125
I'd like to introduce the newest
member of the Supernatural Club.

53
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,250
This is Tsukano.

54
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,250
Nice to meet you!

55
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,416
And you as well.

56
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,375
Let's start by talking
about this flower.

57
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,541
I actually dissected another
one that I picked earlier

58
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,791
and the inside looked exactly
like a human eyeball.

59
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,000
There must be a reason
they're growing.

60
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,250
Curious.

61
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,666
Wish I had your gift.
Do you see something?

62
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,000
I do.

63
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,041
There's a spirit here
that can't move on--

64
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,666
that of a warrior.

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,583
I'm sensing that
several cursed souls

66
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,833
have inhabited these
plants and started a colony.

67
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
[TSUKANO gasps]
Do you mean to tell me that

68
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,125
you can see spirits?

69
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,250
It's not that big a deal.

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,583
[TSUKANO chuckles]

71
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,375
[SHIBAYAMA sighs]

72
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,500
[TSUKANO]
Bravo!

73
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,583
That gets me every
time. Isn't it cool?

74
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,250
[TSUKANO]
Oh, man, definitely.

75
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,916
Hey, whaddaya say,
Shibayama. Can I have a try?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
--[SHIBAYAMA] Huh?
--Do you have powers, too?

77
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,041
[TSUKANO chuckles]
I dunno,

78
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,750
but there's only one
way to find out, right?

79
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,041
[laughs] Yeah, that's true.

80
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,666
You won't really know
unless you try it.

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,916
Okay, Tsukano.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,666
You're gonna wanna start
by picturing the spoon

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,666
broken in your mind.

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,958
Concentrate on that image and
block out the rest of the world.

85
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,375
Break, spoon.

86
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,666
Break just like his did.

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,666
[ALL gasp]

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
Holy crap, that
happened so fast!

89
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,875
I can't believe both
of you can do this.

90
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,458
[TSUKANO laughs]
No, no, no, you're wrong.

91
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,333
I was just fooling around.

92
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,583
I'll show you.

93
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,750
I bend the spoon's neck
until it weakens. See?

94
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,541
Back and forth.

95
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
Until it'll break at
the slightest touch.

96
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,041
And then when I pretend to
be concentrating, watch this.

97
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,750
It snaps.

98
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
[HOSOTANI] Huh? But I
didn't see you do that.

99
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,958
Yeah, it looked like
you just picked up

100
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,666
one of Shibayama's spoons.

101
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,500
Hiding that move is easy
enough if you've practiced.

102
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,833
Magicians do this sort
of thing all the time.

103
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,625
--[HOSOTANI] Huh?
--[SHIBAYAMA] Don't be mistaken.

104
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,541
The only thing I use to
break the spoon is my mind.

105
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,833
I don't fake anything.

106
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,625
Yeah! Of course, I know that.

107
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,125
It's the whole reason
I had to cheat.

108
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,041
I don't have any extraordinary
mental powers like you do.

109
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,458
[HOSOTANI]
He's right.

110
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,291
Don't worry, no one here thinks
you've been pretending.

111
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,041
[MIYOKO]
We believe you.

112
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,041
[KITAGAWA]
Well, this is rare.

113
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,250
[HOSOTANI gasps]

114
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,333
It feels like I never
see you by yourself.

115
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,625
[HOSOTANI]
Oh, hi, Kitagawa.

116
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,750
Where's Shibayama hiding?

117
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,875
[HOSOTANI] He's off doing
some mental training.

118
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,291
He didn't want your
help this time?

119
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,666
Well, I kinda got the feeling
he wanted to be alone.

120
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,208
[KITAGAWA chuckles] I'm honestly
not surprised by that.

121
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,541
Between you and me,

122
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,458
I think the transfer student
really shook him up.

123
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,083
Uh, what are you talking about?

124
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,708
That spoon joke yesterday.

125
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,041
Tsukano managed to pull off the
same trick Shibayama does.

126
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,333
Sort of, but it wasn't
the same thing at all.

127
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,208
Sure. Let's hope not, at least.

128
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,458
Hold on. Please tell me
you're not suggesting

129
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,333
that Shibayama's a
liar or something.

130
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Now wait a sec,
you've got it all wrong.

131
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,250
[TSUKANO] Yo! I've been
looking everywhere for you guys

132
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,416
and the rest of the club.

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,916
I wanted to talk to Shibayama,

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,541
but he wouldn't answer
me when I called.

135
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,083
Unfortunately, I didn't
have anyone else's number.

136
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,500
Anyway, I found the greatest
thing on my morning walk.

137
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,708
Your town has the most beautiful
waterfall I've ever seen!

138
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,208
A what?

139
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,333
Yeah, you know, the one up the
trail north of the school.

140
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,500
Don't tell me you guys
have never seen it before.

141
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,250
There's a waterfall up there?

142
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,416
Guess so.

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,041
[TSUKANO]
Wait. Are you being serious?

144
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,458
That's great, actually.

145
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,958
We'll go check it out
as a club after school!

146
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,333
[HOSOTANI] Are you sure you
weren't just seeing things?

147
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,000
We run this trail when we do the
school marathon in the spring

148
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,250
and I've never seen a
waterfall around here.

149
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,625
That's so weird.

150
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,416
I can't believe you somehow
missed it every year.

151
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,625
There, you can hear the water
flowing if you listen.

152
00:06:55,708 --> 00:07:01,666
[water flowing]

153
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,875
He's right. It sounds
like a waterfall!

154
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,750
[HOSOTANI]
Where'd it come from?

155
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,000
[SHIBAYAMA] It's almost like
it appeared out of nowhere.

156
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,791
There's only one possibility.

157
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,083
Think about it.

158
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,458
Something supernatural
must be happening here.

159
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,958
[TSUKANO]
Oh, good, Shibayama.

160
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,625
You've been so quiet
the last few days.

161
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,166
I'm glad you started
talking again.

162
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,208
Yeah, I was starting to get
kind of worried about you, too.

163
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,125
I thought you'd gone and
taken a vow of silence

164
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,708
so you could focus on
your mental powers

165
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,041
like some kind of monk.

166
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,375
No, don't worry,
it's nothing like that.

167
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,791
The truth is, I've been
pretty concerned lately.

168
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,666
Concerned? What's on your mind?

169
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,250
It's just that...

170
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, I guess I'm afraid a bent
spoon won't surprise anybody,

171
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,958
you know?

172
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,083
Seems like it doesn't
impress people much.

173
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,583
I'm gonna have to
figure out a new trick

174
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,416
to keep everybody interested.

175
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,541
[TSUKANO]
Look in front of you.

176
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,416
Everything you need
is right here.

177
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,333
Huh?

178
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,666
Earlier today,

179
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,958
I stood under the water
on those rocks over there.

180
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,000
It was kinda dangerous,
sure, but totally worth it.

181
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,291
You won't believe
what happened to me.

182
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,375
[HOSOTANI]
What? Tell us.

183
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,833

[SHIBAYAMA]
Tsukano.

187
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,666
How the hell did you
shoot that bird down?

188
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,916
Well...

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
I pretty sure it's
because of the waterfall.

190
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,541
I think that if you
stand underneath it,

191
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,791
you're granted some kind of
special power like I just used!

192
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,625
I can't believe it.

193
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,000
[FEMALE TEACHER A]
Okay, class.

194
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,583
I have something important to
ask you, so listen closely.

195
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,041
You've probably realized
this yourselves by now,

196
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,708
but your classmate, Shibayama,
has been absent from school

197
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,583
for the last several days.

198
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,833
If anyone has any idea
where he might be,

199
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,000
please let me know.

200
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,583
I don't get it. Where do
you think Shibayama went?

201
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,875
So many strange things
have been happening lately.

202
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,416
First it was those gross
eyeball plants growing,

203
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,291
then that waterfall
that just appeared.

204
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,375
I'm having trouble wrapping
my head around it all.

205
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,458
Could you use your
abilities, Kitagawa?

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,750
Maybe spirits could
help us find him.

207
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,500
Um, I guess I do sense something
unpleasant in the area.

208
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,625
In fact, I feel his aura
coming from this direction.

209
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,166
I'm certain of it.

210
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,875
Shibayama is trapped at the
bottom of the waterfall.

211
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,041
Please tell me you're joking.

212
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,000
[HOSOTANI] You must have
made a mistake, Kitagawa.

213
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,458
[KITAGAWA]
Not possible.

214
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,791
My abilities are telling me
he's underneath the water.

215
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,791
Then we have to get
down there and help him!

216
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,166
No, I'm afraid it's
far too late for that.

217
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,083
His spirit's bound to
this location forever.

218
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,541
Besides, it'd be impossible
to retrieve his body

219
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,541
from the bottom of that pool.

220
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,083
Shibayama...

221
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,416
We all know he was worried

222
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,541
that we didn't believe
in his powers, right?

223
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Maybe the pressure was
just too much for him

224
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,125
and he threw himself into
the water to escape from it.

225
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,291
[gasps] Look. Up there!

226
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,458
I can see his spirit!

227
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,833
[TSUKANO]
Kitagawa, no.

228
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,000
You've got it all wrong.

229
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:54,958
What do you mean?

230
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,958
Shibayama didn't commit suicide.

231
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,708
[KITAGAWA]
Okay, then how did he drown?

232
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,416
[TSUKANO] I think he wanted to
stand underneath the waterfall.

233
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,291
He thought that doing so
would boost his power

234
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,416
or give him a new one
that he could show off.

235
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,916
But it's slippery
there and he fell.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,250
This can't be real.

237
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,125
I can't shake the feeling that

238
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,958
even more scary things are gonna
happen to us sometime soon.

239
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,458
[TSUKANO] Hey! You guys
won't believe this!

240
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,583
[KITAGAWA]
Whoa. What's wrong, Tsukano?

241
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,375
I found the craziest thing!

242
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,708
I was on a walk and saw
something amazing!

243
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,083
You guys gotta come see it!

244
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,708
[MIYOKO]
What did you find this time?

245
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,291
It's a mysterious
lake that appeared

246
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,583
about a kilometer from here.

247
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,541
And there's something
strange inside it!

248
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,916
What kind of thing?

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,625
[TSUKANO]
See? This is it!

250
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,041
[KATSUKO]
No. This can't be real!

251
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,333
There was a whole
neighborhood here before!

252
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,500
Where are the houses?

253
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,125
And the people
who lived in them?

254
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,375
They couldn't have
just disappeared--

255
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,291
And wait till you see
what's in the water.

256
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,791
I swear, I wouldn't
have believe it

257
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,041
if I hadn't seen it with
my own eyes earlier.

258
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,541
Stop it, Tsukano.

259
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,166
Don't you care that
Shibayama might be dead?

260
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,625
We think he drowned.

261
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,875
It's your fault!

262
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,250
You're the one who took
him to that waterfall

263
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,500
and told him all that
weird stuff about powers.

264
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,416
Wait, I don't like
what you're insinuating.

265
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,125
It's like you're saying it's my
fault that he died or something.

266
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
We don't know he's
dead for sure.

267
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,583
[TSUKANO laughs]
You're right. Relax, Hosotani.

268
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,750
For all we know he's alive and
well and just hiding from us.

You monster. What are
you laughing about?

I can't believe you guys are
starting to lose your nerve.

272
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,458
Aren't you supposed to be
the Supernatural Club?

Don't you want the see
some extraordinary things

274
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,750
that can't be explained?

275
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,916
Your hearts should be
racing in anticipation

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,041
of what I have to show you.

277
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,291
You aren't going to
believe your eyes,

00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,625
I promise you that!

279
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,625
You should be trying to
enjoy all these things

280
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm introducing you to.

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,625
Of course they may be
a little dangerous,

282
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,000
but that's all part of
the thrill, isn't it? Yeah!

283
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,166
If you're afraid of stepping
outside your comfort zone,

284
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,625
then you shouldn't go looking
for supernatural things!

00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,916
It's been alive since
prehistoric times!

289

There's a legitimate dinosaur
that lives inside this lake!

290
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,083
[HOSOTANI] All this stuff
happened after he transferred.

291
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,250
He's the one to blame
for everything.

292
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,166
Somehow he's doing this.

[MIYOKO] I mean,
I get what you're saying,

294
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,916
but how is it even possible
that he can make things

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,625
like that waterfall
appear out of thin air?

296

it's Tsukano's fault.

[HOSOTANI] But that couldn't
really be him, could it?

out of the water.

Oh, uh, hey, guys.

324
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,500
I was in tutoring super late,
and when I got back,

325
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,125
these huge statues were here
instead of my neighborhood.

326
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,750
So weird.

[HOSOTANI] Kitagawa,
listen to me. It's him.

He's the one causing all this.

You must have spent so
much time in the water

that you gained an

You're a great shot, Kitagawa.

363
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,708
[laughs] And I know you
got that fancy new power

364
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,708
from the waterfall.

365
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,625
I was watching you.

366
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,166
[TSUKANO]
I saw the entire thing.

367
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
Shibayama went there to
get power for himself,

368
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,916
but you snuck up
and pushed him in.

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,250
Then you went under
the waterfall yourself.

370
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,375
My whole spirit sense
may have been a sham,

371
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,541
but it doesn't matter because
what I have now is real power.

372
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,083
So I had an audience
that night, huh?

373
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,583
I gotta say, I like this bizarro
world of yours, Tsukano.

374
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,791
It's fun.

00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,583
Why don't you and I
turn this stupid town

376
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,791
into our own
personal playground?

Oh, poor, poor Kitagawa.

I won't do that.
I'm gonna have to say no.

[HOSOTANI]
The next day,

382
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,791
Tsukano transferred to another
school somewhere else.

383
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,958
The town quickly
returned to normal.

384
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,875
But Shibayama never
came back to us.

385
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,750
And eventually, Kitagawa stopped
showing up at school, too.

386
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,666
There were rumors, of course.

387
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,958
From what I heard, he ran off
in order to track down Tsukano.

388
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,541
I wonder...

389
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,416
Is that transfer student
still out there?

390
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Is he discovering strange
things at his new school

391
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,583
and reshaping another
town like he did ours?

but burying Yuki's remains

00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,583
will ensure that she
makes it to heaven.

into her life,

into a regular scarecrow.

when we left the cemetery.

Don't ask me. I have no idea.

471
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,500
I told you we shouldn't have
put this damn thing here.

472
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,208
[SETSUKO]
He's looking right at you.

473
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,708
[UCHIDA]
It's your eyes playing tricks.

474
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,291
It's time we get rid
of this monstrosity!

475
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,916
No! Put him down!

476
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,166
[UCHIDA grunts]
Let me go!

477
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,291
[UCHIDA gasps, groans]

478
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,500
I get it now.

479
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,083
You murdered our
Shigeru, didn't you?

480
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,125
[gasps]

481
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,208
[NUMATA groans]

482
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,291
[NUMATA]
He's dead.
