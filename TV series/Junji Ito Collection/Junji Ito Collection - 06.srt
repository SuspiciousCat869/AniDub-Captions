1
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,041
[HIROSHI'S MOM] C'mon, Hiroshi,
quit dragging your feet.

2
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,041
[HIROSHI]
Why do I have to go with you?

3
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,250
[HIROSHI'S MOM]
Because we should be friendly

4
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,541
and start on good terms
with the neighbors.

5
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,541
Doesn't the air feel so fresh?

6
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,958
I think it's all the
greenery around here.

7
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,541
[HIROSHI]
Huh, look at that.

8
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't you think there's
something kind of weird

9
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,250
about this house, mom?

10
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,833
How so?

11
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,666
[HIROSHI] Well, there's only one
window on the whole building.

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,416
It's not much of a view looking
out onto the side of our house.

13
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,291
[HIROSHI'S MOM]
Really, Hiroshi.

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,041
You shouldn't be so judgmental
of other peoples' taste.

15
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,875
[doorbell rings]

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,958
[HIROSHI'S MOM]
Huh. Guess no one's home.

17
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,541
[doorbell rings]

18
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,250
[WOMAN A]
Yes? Who is it?

19
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,791
[HIROSHI'S MOM] Hello!
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,125
I hope we're not intruding,
but we're the Sakaguchis,

21
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,041
and we just moved in
next door to you.

22
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,375
We wanted to take a moment
to introduce ourselves

23
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,875
to all of our new neighbors.

24
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,875
Here, we brought you
a little gift, too.

25
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,416
It's not much, but I
hope you like it.

26
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,875
[WOMAN A] Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have.

27
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,416
[HIROSHI'S MOM]
Also, I was wondering.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,375
Do the Numages work
during the day?

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,875
No one was home earlier.

30
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:52,250
Who knows? That house is always
quiet and locked up tight.

31
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,500
But at night, you can
sometimes see a silhouette

32
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,333
in the upstairs window,
so someone must be there.

33
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,041
They just hardly ever
go outside, I guess.

34
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,333
[HIROSHI'S MOM] The rumors
on the block are that a

35
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,250
middle-aged woman
lives there alone.

36
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,125
Some kind of strange, eccentric
type, from what I gathered.

37
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,500
She seems to avoid contact
with the outside world,

38
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,833
isn't that odd?

39
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,791
I guess. But you haven't
actually gotten the chance

40
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,666
to meet this woman yourself,
have you?

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,500
I've rung the bell
several times now.

42
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,583
But so far no one's
answered the door.

43
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,166
I think it's very sad.

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,166
Thanks for dinner.

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,916
What? Finished already?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,541
[HIROSHI] Yeah, I wanna
make sure I get my stuff

47
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,166
unpacked tonight.

48
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,291
Of course the window looks
right into my room.

49
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,416
So much for privacy.

50
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:49,666
[NUMAGE] Young man...
Young man... Young man...

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,375
[NUMAGE] Good evening.
Are you asleep in there?

52
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,166
How are you feeling tonight?

53
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,166
[HIROSHI]
Who is that?

54
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,208
[NUMAGE]
Young man... Young man...

55
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,708
There you are.

56
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,208
[HIROSHI gasps]

57
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,958
[NUMAGE] Are you finding your
new house to your liking?

58
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:14,166
Young man, how are
you feeling tonight?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,166
Come by and visit me someday.

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,625
I'll be waiting for you in here
with the front door unlocked.

61
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,750
[HIROSHI]
What the hell was that thing?

62
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,375
[NUMAGE]
Young man... Young man...

63
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,000
How are you feeling tonight?

64
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,041
[HIROSHI gasps]

65
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,458
[NUMAGE]
Are you asleep in your bed?

66
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:56,458
Come, let me see your face.
Why didn't you visit me today?

67
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:00,583
I was waiting for you
with so many sweets.

68
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,791
Shall I come over and see
you instead, then? In your room?

69
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,791
[HIROSHI gasps]

70
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,708
[NUMAGE]
I'm on my way.

71
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,750
What? Are you crazy?

72
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,916
[gasps]

73
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,166
[HIROSHI gasps]

74
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,833
[NUMAGE] There's a good boy.
I'll pass you the laundry pole.

75
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:32,583
Make sure you grab it.
Hold it tight, okay?

76
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,416
[NUMAGE] I'll use it to cross
over so I can visit you.

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,875
[HIROSHI shouts]

78
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,208
What are you doing?

79
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,375
[NUMAGE gasps]

80
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,916
[HIROSHI gasps] Mom! Dad!
Quick, you gotta wake up!

81
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,500
What are you talking about,
son, I don't see anybody.

82
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,583
[HIROSHI'S MOM] And there's no
laundry pole outside, either.

83
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,833
You've gotta believe me!

84
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,791
It happened, I swear
she was out there!

85
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,083
That creepy woman wanted
to come over here.

86
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,916
It's fine. You were probably
just having a nightmare.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,875
It's the second night
of this, dad!

88
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:30,541
[NUMAGE] Young man....
Oh, young man....

89
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,625
Are you there?

90
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,041
[gasps]

91
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:39,875
[NUMAGE] Are you awake? How are
you feeling tonight, hm?

92
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,541
[HIROSHI]
Damn it, not again!

93
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,791
[NUMAGE]
Are you asleep right now?

94
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:48,125
Please, let me see
your pretty face.

95
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,416
Just wait a bit longer.
I'll be joining you soon.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,125
It won't take much more time.

97
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,666
My hands can almost
reach your window.

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll knock on the glass shortly.
Make sure you open up when I do.

99
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:10,750
Then I'll be able to see you all
I want. Doesn't that sound nice?

100
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:16,666
Oh, it's still too far.
Just out of reach.

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,791
Don't worry, it won't be long.

102
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:25,583
I'll be there soon.
I'm coming for you.

103
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:53,625
[RIKO sobs]
Papa died. He's gone!

104
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,333
[RIKO]
When I was a little girl,

105
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,125
I had terrible, recurring dreams
about my father dying.

106
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:03,000
No, Riko! Ha, ha! Your papa
is not gonna die. Promise.

107
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,583
[RIKO]
No matter what he said,

108
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,500
my anxiety about it
never went away.

109
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
[RIKO] My father's death
is the one thing I fear

110
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,416
most in this world.

111
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,250
If he died, I don't
know what I'd do.

112
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,375
[RIKO] When I married into the
prestigious Tokura family,

113
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,083
they insisted we have
a traditional wedding.

114
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,416
[RIKO] Father. Mother.
Grandfather. Grandmother.

115
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,000
I know I come from nothing,
so thanks for accepting me.

116
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,125
[TOMOKA]
I was thinking, Riko.

117
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,708
[RIKO]
Hm?

118
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,625
From now on. I guess I should
start calling you "sister", huh?

119
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, right.
I'd like that, Tomoka.

120
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,541
[RIKO] My husband, Makoto,
defied his own family

121
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:04,500
in order to marry me. I didn't
want him to regret it.

122
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,375
[MAKOTO]
Keep your spirits up, Riko.

123
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,958
I'm sure they'll warm up
to you eventually.

124
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,958
[RIKO]
Hm.

125
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,333
[RIKO gasps]

126
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,875
[MAKOTO] Oh, yeah. Those are
my great-grandparents.

127
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,666
They couldn't come to the
wedding on account of their age.

128
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,208
Great-granddad? Great-grandma?

129
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,583
Let me introduce you
to my wife, Riko.

130
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,875
It's an honor to meet you.

131
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,750
[RIKO'S DAD breathes heavily]

132
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,208
Riko. Riko!

133
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:42,125
[RIKO sobs] I'm right here.
Can you see me, Papa?

134
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,625
[RIKO'S DAD] Riko. I hope you
have a happy life with Makoto.

135
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,291
[RIKO gasps]
Papa!

136
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,958
[MAKOTO sighs] You had that
same dream again, didn't you?

137
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,458
[RIKO] I'm so sorry. I don't
know why it keeps happening.

138
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,208
[MAKOTO] It's okay.
Come on. Get some sleep.

139
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,791
[MAKOTO'S MOM laughs] You are
just too much, Tomoka.

140
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:15,333
[TOMOKA] Hey! He, he. Come on!
Not you, too, Dad. Stop it!

141
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,625
Grandma, Grandpa,
you should know better!

142
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,083
[RIKO] This house is gigantic,
almost too big.

143
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,333
[RIKO gasps]

144
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,916
Wait. Are you?

145
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:44,291
[yells] There's a ghost.
I saw it! Right there!

146
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,791
[MAKOTO]
They're not ghosts, exactly.

147
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,291
[RIKO exhales]
Then what are they?

148
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,875
Even the way your
great-grandparents look

149
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
is kind of strange.

150
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,583
I think the person you
thought was a ghost

151
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,375
is actually my
great-great-grandmother.

152
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,375
It's nothing to worry about,
she's just old.

153
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,416
She's your what?
How can she still be alive?

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,666
She must be ancient.

155
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,250
She's a hundred
and twenty-five.

156
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,458
[RIKO]
No way, are you kidding me?

157
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,125
I didn't think people could
really live that long.

158
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,125
There are a couple of other
relatives you haven't met

159
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,125
that live here, too.

160
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,166
My great-aunt and
my great-uncle.

161
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,208
I think that should
account for everyone.

162
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,041
Those two are
really faint, though.

163
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,458
They're almost gone.

164
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,958
But if you look closely,
you can still see them.

165
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
What do you mean "almost gone"?

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
[MAKOTO] My great-great
grandfather and his

167
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,208
mother used to be around, too.

168
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,625
But they disappeared
a while ago.

169
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,791
[RIKO] I don't understand.
They disappeared?

170
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,916
[MAKOTO] Because,
they're just after-images.

171
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,625
[RIKO] My grandfather-in-law
died the next year,

172
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,458
and the family gathered
for his funeral.

[MONKS chant]

174

[RIKO'S DAD]
It's been a while, Riko.

175
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,625
[RIKO] I know.

176
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,291
Thanks for coming today,
Papa, it means a lot to me.

177
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,708
Tell me, dear. Are they
treating you well?

178
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,291
Has his family accepted you?

179
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,791
[RIKO]
Yeah.

180
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Thank you so much for travelling
all this way to be here with us.

181
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,291
[RIKO'S DAD] Think nothing
of it. Well then, Makoto,

182
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,333
be sure to take care of my
little girl for me. Please.

183
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,083
You can count on me, Sir.
I promise.

184
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,750
[MAKOTO] Let's go, Riko.
My family's here.

185
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,041
They're already gathering
in the living room.

186
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,708
[RIKO gasps]

187
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,083
[MAKOTO] I guess this is
the first time for you.

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,916
[MAKOTO'S DAD]
My father, Ryouzou,

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,583
was honored at his funeral.
It was a beautiful service.

190
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,000
Now that it's over,
it's time that we begin.

191
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,416
Everyone.

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,666
Focus all of your thoughts
on Ryouzou and his image.

193
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Use every ounce of
strength to envision him.

194
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,666
His actual body
may be cremated,

195
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,916
but with the combined
will of our family,

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,791
my father will appear
before us once again.

197
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,333
That's it, everyone. Focus!
Think with all your might.

198

[TOKURA FAMILY mutters]

200

[MAKOTO'S DAD]
We will see you again, Father.

201
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,375
Father!

202
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,000
[MAKOTO'S DAD] Come to us!

[TOKURA FAMILY chatters]

204
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,333
[RIKO gasps]

205
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,166
[MAKOTO] It's not that Grandpa
actually came back to life,

206
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,625
and I wouldn't call him a
ghost or spirit, either.

207
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,166
He's simply a construct
formed by my family's will.

208
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,208
Nothing more. We call
them after-images.

209
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,791
We see them,

210
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,208
but they don't really have any
physical presence to speak of.

211
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,583
They serve a purpose. They seem
real whenever we talk to them.

212
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,791
It's like the loved ones who've
passed away are still there.

213
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,583
Even though that comfort is an
illusion we create ourselves.

214
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,291
Still, the after-images only
ever say things that the

215
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,083
living imagine they would.

216
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,875
Yet, despite knowing
they aren't alive,

217
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,208
we keep making them every
time a family member dies.

218
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,708
They continue to function
as part of our family,

219
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,625
as if nothing had
ever happened.

220
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,458
And help fill the void
that's left behind

221
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,916
when we lose someone.
A bandage for our pain.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,416
But they don't last.
As the years go by,

223
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,166
they begin to grow fainter
and more transparent.

224
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,291
The images fade.
They start degrading.

225
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,166
After around twenty years,
they disappear completely.

226
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,583
Finally leaving this world.

227
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,083
But those twenty years
help the living cope.

228
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,541
It gives us the chance
for a gentle goodbye.

229
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,708
To gradually let go
of those we love.

230
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,666
It's been almost two decades
since we created the after-image

231
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,666
of my great-great-grandmother.

232
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,583
She'll probably be
vanishing sometime soon.

233
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,666
That's why you thought
she was a ghost.

234
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,208
Honestly, I don't think anyone
in our family pays her much

235
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:00,166
mind these days. I know
I don't, not anymore.

236
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,791
Of course, that's only
because we've had an extra

237
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,083
twenty-two years to come to
terms with saying goodbye

238
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,833
to her for good.

239
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,166
[RIKO]
So, Makoto...

240
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,708
Someday, when my father
dies and it's not a dream,

241
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:20,000
would we be able to make
an after-image of him, too?

242
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,041
I had a feeling you'd ask
me that. I don't know.

243
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,000
But I understand why you'd
want an after-image

244
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,625
of your own family.

245
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,333
[MAKOTO'S DAD]
You can't be serious, Makoto.

246
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,083
It's completely
out of the question.

247
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,166
What would be the point
in creating an after-image

248
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,541
of Riko's father? Have you
thought this through at all?

249
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,375
[MAKOTO'S DAD] I'm sorry.
It's just not going to happen.

It was wrong of me
to ask you for this.

Hey, Sister.

00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:07,000
Please don't think too badly
of our mom and dad, okay?

259
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,083
They're both really nice.

260
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,083
Sometimes they just
come off as mean.

261
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,083
I know. And I realize that
it was selfish of me

262
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,125
to ask for such a thing.

263
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,166
I'll go apologize to
them again tomorrow,

264
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,125
and hopefully this time
they'll forgive me.

265
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,375
Thank you, though.

266
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,541
For always being there
and worrying about me.

267
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,875
Well of course I'm going to
be here for you, sister,

I love you after all.

And never forget that
I love you, too, Tomoka.

271
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,500
[RIKO] I was wondering.
About Tomoka.

272
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,708
[sighs]
I guess you noticed.

273

My sister is an
after-image.

274
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,125
[MAKOTO] She died from
an illness ten years ago.

275
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,666
Lately, she's begun
to fade a little bit.

276
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,000
Time is catching up to her,
and she's disappearing.

277
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,333
[TOMOKA]
I was wondering, Mom.

278
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,208
Yes, what is it,
my darling one?

279
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,583
[TOMOKA] Could you not
be so hard on Riko?

280
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,875
She's a really good wife.

281
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,416
[sighs] I understand that,
but it can be so difficult.

282

[TOMOKA] I love you, Mom.
I want to stay with you forever.

283
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,000
Wouldn't it be nice if I never
left the house when I grew up?

284
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,583
It means I'd never
get married, but still...

285
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,875
It'd be okay with you,
right, mom?

286
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,666
Yes, of course, my dear.
Stay as long as you like.

[RIKO]
As the months went by,

289
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,916
Makoto's great-
great-grandmother,

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,125
his great-aunt, and his
great-uncle disappeared.

291
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,333
His great-grandparents
also started looking

292
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,416
more transparent. Almost foggy.

293
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,458
Eventually there was another
family funeral to attend,

294
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,958
and I took part
in the ceremony

295
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,875
to conjure up
another after-image.

296
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,750
I had already done so
several times by that point.

297
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,125
And I tried my hardest to
help as a member of the

298
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,875
Tokura family.

299
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,875
Still, even though it'd been
eight years since my wedding,

300
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,958
my in-laws remained distant.

301
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,208
As if they had no desire
to get to know me at all.

302
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,291
I figured it had
to be my own fault,

303
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,166
and I put extra effort
into winning them over.

304
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:29,708
[RIKO pants] Honey, wait!
You forgot your--

306
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,291
[MAKOTO] Ha, I thought we
agreed to meet at the station

307
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,750
like we usually do.

308
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,208
[MORI] Aw, but I wanted to
see you as soon as possible.

309
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,583
[MAKOTO, MORI laugh]

310
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,750
[RIKO] That was Mori from your
office this morning, wasn't it?

311
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,291
[RIKO] The two of you
are having an affair.

312
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,000
We are.

313
00:18:54,083 --> 00:19:00,708
[RIKO gasps] So... what does
that mean for the two of us?

314
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,833
I'll be honest with you.

315
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,416
I intend to marry her
someday in the future.

316
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,916
You will not! I refuse
to let you divorce me!

317
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,083
Riko. Don't worry, okay?

318
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,125
I'm not going to
end our marriage.

319
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,791
I'll fulfill my duties.
It's my responsibil--

320
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,583
What are you talking about?

321
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,083
How are you going to marry
her without divorcing me first,

322
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,958
you lying bastard?

323
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,833
Let's see what she has
to say about this.

324
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,458
No, don't!

325
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,583
You let go of me!

326
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,583
[MAKOTO]
I said to stop!

327
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,666

[MAKOTO gasps]

329
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,000
[MAKOTO]
I'm... I'm so sorry, Riko.

330
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,916
[RIKO gasps]

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,375
I should've... been honest.
And told you the truth.

332
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,625
What?

333
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,333
It was ten years ago.

334
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,083
We were supposed to
be married soon,

335
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,958
but then it happened.

336
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,791
The day before our
engagement ceremony.

337
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,916
[ambulance sirens]

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,583
[MAKOTO] You were in a serious
car accident... and you died.

339
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,833
I begged my father,
down on my hands and knees.

340
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,166
I wanted us to make an
after-image of you.

341
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,208
[TOKURA FAMILY chattering]

342
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:35,166
[MAKOTO]
Riko!

343
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,958
You're lying. I'm alive.

344
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,583
[MAKOTO]
If you don't believe me,

345
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,625
then go to your family's house.

346
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,208
There's a marker for you
on the family plot.

347
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,583
That will be your proof.

348
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,125
Then... I really am just...

349
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,458
[RIKO]
I am an after-image.

350
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,166
In ten years,
I'll be gone forever.

351
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,375
[RIKO]
Oddly enough,

352
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,375
realizing this took a
weight off my shoulders.

353
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,916
The next day, I quietly slipped
out of the Tokura house.

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
[TOMOKA]
Hey, sister.

355
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,791
[TOMOKA]
Where are you going?

356
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,708
[RIKO]
After apologizing profusely,

357
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,500
I bade my sister-in-law goodbye.

358
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,833
Thinking back on it now,
I wonder what Makoto thought

359
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,375
about having a wife
that cried so often.

360
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,583
Always after dreaming
of her father's death.

361
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,375
In fact, I don't think I
ever cried from a dream

362
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,041
about my husband dying.

363
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,833
I suppose. I probably owe
him an apology, too.

364
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,708
Ten short years before I vanish.

365
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,750
I wonder which one of us will
go first, my father or me?

366
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,291
Riko? Is something wrong?

367
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,666
Papa... I'm coming home.
