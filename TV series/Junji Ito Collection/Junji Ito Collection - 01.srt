2
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,125
[SOUICHI chuckles]
A curse upon you.

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,291
Ah... My stomach.

4
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,208
How does it feel?

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,041
[groans] I think I'm dying.
Somebody help me!

6
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:49,916
[chuckles] Are you prepared
to witness true horror?

7
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,208
[school bell rings]

8
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,833
[SOUICHI] There's no one
quite as incredible as me.

9
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,041
How is it possible that
I'm so extraordinary?

10
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,208
I am a man of incomprehensible
power and potential,

11
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,125
basically a superhuman.

12
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,791
[SOUICHI chuckles] I'm on a
completely different level

13
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,625
from the idiots
around me.

14
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,208
And on top of that,
I'm handsome.

15
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,000
[FEMALE STUDENT A] Hey, did you
hear what happened last night?

16
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,125
Ooya from Class Three passed out
in the middle of the street.

17
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,333
What?

18
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,625
I know. Apparently he's
in the hospital now.

19
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,625
[SOUICHI giggles]
That's so sad!

20
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,125
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Huh?

21
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,958
A tragedy. I wonder what could
have caused such a thing.

22
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,625
[giggling continues]

23
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,791
[SOUICHI] Ooya thought
he was such hot stuff.

24
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,500
Someone had to remind him
that he's not untouchable.

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,291
Hm, hm. Unfortunately, I can't
let anyone know it was me.

26
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,833
It would probably be a bad
idea for everyone to find out

27
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,041
exactly how amazing
I really am.

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,958
The morons at this school
are all convinced

29
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,791
I'm a perfectly
ordinary student,

30
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,791
a loser like one of them.

31
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,625
But even so, heh, the girls
can't help but hang around

32
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,625
in the classroom just
to be close to me.

33
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,000
He's giggling again.

34
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,458
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
He's such a freak.

35
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,666
And the faces he
makes are so creepy.

36
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,250
[AKIYAMA] I'm done
taking crap from you!

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,708
What the heck's your problem?

38
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
You are! Obviously.

39
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,458
It looks like Kuroda and
Akiyama are going at it again.

40
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,791
Of course they are,

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,500
those two guys are always
at each other's throats.

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,791
[KURODA]
I'm warning you, man!

43
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,916
I don't think you've
got the guts.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,750
[KURODA groans]

45
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,083
[BOYS] Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

46
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,291
[KURODA]
Stop whining.

47
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,500
[SOUICHI giggles]

48
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,625
And just like that,
a new hatred is born.

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,500
[squeals]

50
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,208
I wonder if people realize how
kind-hearted I am deep down.

51
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,083
Full of compassion.

52
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,208
For example, on a
wintery day like this,

53
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,583
I bet I can find a new
friend underneath the dirt.

54
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,833
This is perfect!
A hibernating little toad.

55
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,625
[SOUICHI chuckles] I bet it's
pretty cold in the ground,

56
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,916
isn't it, little guy?
You're freezing.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,708
How about you come live
at home with me instead?

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,625
It's nice and warm, I promise!

59
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,333
[SOUICHI]
Well, this is your new house!

60
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,708
Do you like it?
I think you will.

61
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,583
I've even got some
water here for you.

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,375
Why don't we grab a
seat over there?

63
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,625
That'd be a great idea.

64
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,625
If my butt didn't
feel like it was on fire.

65

[ALL laugh]

66
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,666
Lookie here, the whole family
watching TV after dinner.

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,458
It sounds like
they're having fun.

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,250
My big brother, Kouichi.

69
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,083
A pitiful bastard who takes
everything too seriously.

70
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,333
Always finding ways to try
and make me look like a child.

71
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,791
And of course,
my big sister, Sayuri.

72
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,750
The poor girl has somehow
convinced herself

73
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,000
that people think
she's beautiful.

74
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,375
And, honestly, there's really
not anything interesting

75
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,833
at all about the three
adults in the room.

76
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,125
I can't imagine a
more boring group.

[laughs]

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
[KOUICHI] Hey, Souichi.
If you wanna watch TV with us,

79
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,666
just come in and
grab a seat. Kay?

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,083
Otherwise close the door,

81
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,375
you're letting all of the
warm air out of the room.

82
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,666
Just wait. I'll make you
suffer for your idiocy

83
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,833
one of these days,
you arrogant fool.

84
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,458
Did you say
something to me?

85
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,458
Nothing! Not a word.

86
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,541
Oh, I heard what he said.
He called you an arrogant fool.

00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,625
[KOUICHI]
Is that true?

Damn you, Sayuri!

I'm not a peon like the rest
of you losers I call a family.

101
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,458
In fact, you should all
be bowing down to me!

Huh?

106
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,875
[SOUICHI]
The definition of "wonted."

107
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,541
"Average or commonplace."
Wait, seriously?

108
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,041
Damn you, Kouichi!
How dare you embarrass me!

109

Huh! Not that it matters anyway.

110
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,666
I don't have time
for this nonsense.

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,916
After all, I should really be
focusing on my new project.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,916
Why don't we get to work on it?

113

What do you think would
be a good punishment, hm?

114

Yeah, you're right.

115

would be perfect.

You know how Kuroda's been
absent the last few days?

122

It turns out he isn't sick,
he's actually gone missing.

123

Was he kidnapped? Or worse.

I hope he wasn't
murdered or something.

Not again.

Damn kids driving nails
into my cedar trees.

135

They're gonna destroy them all.

If this is a prank, it's gone
too far, and it's not funny.

this is going to pay for it.

[YAMADA] Did you hear
they found Kuroda?

148
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,166
He was buried up to his
neck out in the cedar forest.

149

actually was dead?

No, that's the weirdest part,

151
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,166
he was just sleeping,

152

and I heard he didn't wake up
until he was at the hospital.

153

He was just taking a
nap in the ground?

He must have been out there for
days in this freezing weather.

How did he survive?

Aw... This isn't fair at all.

he crawled out of the dirt

00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,041
in the spring like some
kind of animal. I hate this.

159
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,500
[YAMADA] Kuroda says he has
no idea how he got out there.

160
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,500
--He doesn't remember anything.
--[SOUICHI] Huh?

161
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,416
God, what a strange dude,
maybe he was hibernating.

162
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,583
[ISHIZAKA laughs]

163
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,958
[YAMADA laughs]

164
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,625
[SOUICHI]
Something's off over there.

165
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,208
They look like they're having
a normal, friendly chat.

166
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,250
But there's an air of tension
between those three today.

167
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,000
I do believe there's been a
change in the status quo

168
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
for this trio.

169
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,541
Let's take a closer look,
shall we?

170
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,583
Yamada and Kawai are talking
like they always do.

171
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,541
But Kawai and Ishizaka aren't
saying much to each other.

172
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,291
Not like usual.

173
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,750
Which means...

174
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,041
...something awkward must
have happened between them.

175
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,250
Some kind of heinous,
embarrassing ordeal

176
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,833
has ruined their friendship and
fragmented their little group.

177
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,666
The four-eyed Ishizaka is
probably getting pushed around

178
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,625
by Kawai, who's more outgoing!
I bet that's it!

179
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,000
The seeds of hate are
growing between them.

180
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:03,083
Ishizaka must want Kawai dead.
I see it in his eyes!

181
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,416
I'll be right back, okay?

182
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
[YAMADA]
'Kay.

183
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,833
[SOUICHI] Hey, Ishizaka!
Wait up for me!

184
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,958
[ISHIZAKA]
Oh, hey, what's up, Souichi?

185
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,250
Do you need something?

186
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,958
Is it eating you up inside?

187
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,916
Huh? What do you mean?

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,625
Don't worry, I get it.

189
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,291
Cursing someone is a
difficult burden to bear.

190
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,375
And I bet you've
imagined putting Kawai

191
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,750
through some horrible
tortures, haven't you?

192
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,666
You've dreamed of killing him.

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,166
But you don't have to
feel bad about it anymore.

194
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,958
Just leave Kawai to me. I'll
curse him so you don't have to.

195
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,791
Everything will work out.

196
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,958
[ISHIZAKA]
Hm?

197
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,416
[SOUICHI giggles]

198
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,750
[KAWAI]
He seriously said that stuff?

199
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,416
You shouldn't talk
to that freak.

200
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,708
[ISHIZAKA] Uh, he said he
was going to curse you.

201
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,833
You should watch your back.

202
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,166
[KAWAI laughs]
Maybe it'll be fun.

203
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,458
Hey, look.

204
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,083
[KAWAI]
It's that old psycho.

205
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,583
[OLD MAN grunts]
Damn kids.

206
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,958
[AKIYAMA]
Be careful.

207
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,708
It's an import.
Really expensive.

208
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,458
[SOUICHI] I'll keep it safe.
Oh, yeah, really nice.

209
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,791
This is perfect. I think I'll
go home and explore the attic

210
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,750
to see what treasures
I can find up there.

211
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,625
[SOUICHI chuckles]
See ya later.

212
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:29,291
[SAYURI screams] No...!
Keep that thing away from me!

213
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,416
[chuckles] But I went through
the trouble of finding this

214
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,791
giant dead orb
weaver for you.

215
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,083
Go on, eat up. It's delicious.

216
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,791
[SAYURI]
Stop screwing around.

217
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
Souichi! What are you
doing to your sister?

218
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,250
Will you please get
him out of here?

219
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,166
[KOUICHI] You can't keep pulling
stupid crap like this, okay?

220
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,375
Get rid of that
spider right now!

221
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,333
I'm not gonna toss
him out like garbage.

222
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,833
Look at the gold
coloring on his legs.

223
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,125
You can't tell me
he's not beautiful.

224
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,250
[KOUICHI]
That's enough!

225
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,541
[SOUICHI whimpers, yelps]

226
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,916
[KOUICHI] Hey, Sayuri. Did you
hear the way he just screamed?

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,125
Uh-huh!

228
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
--[SOUICHI whimpers]
--[KOUICHI] Well, well.

229
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,750
I think he's more scared of
spiders than he lets on.

230
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,208
[SOUICHI]
Hey, what are you doing?

231
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,916
[KOUICHI laughs]
What's wrong? Take it. Here!

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,625
I can't believe you're holding
that thing with your bare hands.

233
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,708
It's so disgusting.

234
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,625
[SOUICHI sighs]
I'm not some dumb kid.

235
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,666
And I don't have time to
waste on such idiotic people.

236
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,708
I have another new project
I have to take care of.

237
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,833
[SOUICHI] I wonder which curse
I should use this time. Hm...

238
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:40,875
I know. Something with
spiders will do nicely.

239
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
[MALE STUDENT A] "In Japan
for the first time in a year.

240
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,166
In my home for the
first time in a year.

241
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,291
It would be natural
to feel relieved now,

242
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,041
but I find it disturbing.

243
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,083
The reason being that
someone else has lived here

244
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,875
during that time. Worse yet
is the fact that it was

245
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
the family of my middle
school teacher...

246
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,625
[KAWAI]
Uh, excuse me!

247
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,916
[MALE TEACHER A]
Huh? What is it, Kawai?

248
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,333
[KAWAI] Well, that was
pretty embarrassing.

249
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,375
[KAWAI grunts]

250
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,583
What the--?

251
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,250
Hey, that's strange,
the pain in my stomach

252
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,041
is completely gone now.

253
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,000
I should have just waited it
out instead of making a scene.

254
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, come on.
Is this thing stuck?

255
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,958
[SOUICHI giggles]

256
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,833
[KAWAI] What the hell?
This is so lame!

257
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,208
Guess I'll have to climb out.

258
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,625
[KAWAI grunts]
Hm?

259
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,583
[yells]

260
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,666
[ambulance siren blares]

261
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,541
[MALE STUDENT B] They found him
passed out in the bathroom.

262
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,166
[MALE STUDENT C] Yeah, and he
was wrapped head-to-toe

263
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,500
in toilet paper
for some reason.

264
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,166
So what do you think?
I did this for you,

265
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,750
so please let me know if you're
satisfied with the result.

266
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,083
What result?

267
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,375
Don't worry. It's not
like I'm expecting

268
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,875
anything from you
in return, Ishizaka.

269
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,958
I mean, I did take the
time out of my day

270
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,250
to teach Kawai an
important lesson for you.

271
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,166
But as long as you're
happy with what I did,

272
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,416
that's enough for me.

273
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,750
Don't get me wrong.

274
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,000
The service I performed
for you was definitely one

275
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,416
worthy of payment.

276
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
But I'm not the kind of petty
guy who'd demand money

277
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,833
or something from you.

278
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,666
It was just a favor.
Think nothing of it.

279

You know, you don't
even have to thank me.

280
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,916
Really, I don't
think it's necessary.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,125
He, he. I'm just that kind.

[ISHIZAKA] Souichi. What the
heck are you babbling about?

What do you mean you taught
Kawai some kind of lesson, huh?

284
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,041
What's up?
Is something going on?

285

No. It's not anything important.

show me no gratitude,

but you embarrass me afterward.

get away with this.

next to the elementary
school right away.

Oh, and come alone.

We can go over all the
details when you get there.

ready fast.

[ISHIZAKA] Okay. So that
was obviously Souichi

on the phone earlier.

307
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,125
I don't know what that creep is
planning, but I'm ready for it.

No fair. You tricked me!
What a coward.

I can't believe you set that
trap up to take me down.

No, stupid, that insane old

Bastard. He actually
left me hanging here.

336
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,666
He should be ashamed of himself,
abandoning me like that

and running back to
the safety of his house.

Hello, sir. Is there a problem?

[OLD MAN grunts] What are
you doing out here?

358

Hey, Souichi. Why are you
playing up in that tree?

359
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,708
[whimpering] Brother!
You've gotta save me!

360
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm teaching this
little brat a lesson

361
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,833
since he's been messing
with my cedar trees.

362
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,291
Once I'm all done here,
I'll call the cops on him.

363
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,291
Simple as that.

364
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,916
Well, do you have
any actual proof

365
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,750
that my brother is the culprit?

366
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,541
Are you not seeing what's
going on behind me?

367

[KOUICHI] Fair enough.
You have a point.

368
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,208
I'll take him to the
station myself, then.

Huh?

be some kind of trick,

371

or you'll pay for it.
Go straight to the police.

372

[KOUICHI] Of course, if we
do go and talk to the cops,

373
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,083
I'll have to tell them about
all these traps lying around.

Wonder what they'll think
about you setting them up

After all this time,

406

my daughter has
finally succumbed

412
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,041
I'll never hear her voice again.

413
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,083
[MARIE'S FATHER]
My darling daughter.

414
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,875
Have I seen you smile
for the last time?

415
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,250
Is there nothing left of you?

416
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,291
[MARIE'S FATHER] Most people
in this world put their children

417
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,833
to a final rest once they've
turned into dolls.

418
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,958
But I didn't think I could
do that to my Marie.

419
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:44,000
We kept her at home, with us.
Where she belonged.

420
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,375
Only.... Her transformation
didn't stop there.

421
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,916
Soon we began to understand
how those other parents

422
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,750
must have felt. The horror.

423
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,250
Dearest, I think
the time has come

424
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,500
to put our daughter to rest.

425
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,958
I know.
