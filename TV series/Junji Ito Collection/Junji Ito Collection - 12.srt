[OGI grunts]

5
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,791
[OGI] For a minute
there, I was scared.

6
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,250
I didn't think I'd make
it back to Japan alive.

7
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,791
I risked my life to
bring this treasure back.

8
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,416
[SUGIO] You sure that's
what this is, Ogi?

9
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,916
It just looks like
an old jar to me.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,041
I hope it's full of
gold or something.

11
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,375
No, nectar.

12
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,791
Wait, that's it? Must be good.

13
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,666
You've no idea, Sugio.

14
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,791
I got this nectar from
a tribe in South America

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,083
I happened across.

16
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,666
They actually worship
the giant plant

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,750
that they extract
the stuff from.

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,291
The nectar is so delicious

19
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,041
that it tastes like it's imbued
with the power of the gods.

20
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,583
Trust me, you've never tasted
anything like this before.

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,916
It's heavenly.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,583
[sighs] Yeah, yeah,
no need to lay it on thick.

23
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,416
It's so sweet.

24
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,750
Seriously unbelievable!

25
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,458
Wanna have a little taste?

26
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,833
[SUGIO] Sure, why not.
Hand the jar over.

27
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,125
Okay, but first, I need to
warn you not to be noticed

28
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,916
while you're eating it. That's
real important apparently.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,625
Huh? Who besides you
would notice me?

30
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,958
Lemme guess.

31
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,291
Is there some kind of
angry nectar god watching?

32
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,708
[OGI laughs]
Yeah, I suppose it must sound

33
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,208
pretty damn crazy to you.

34
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,083
But the tribespeople
were especially adamant

35
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,750
about making sure I
understood what they said.

36
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,333
So whatever you do,
don't be noticed.

37
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,791
It's good!

38
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,750
[knocking]

39
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,458
[KAMEDA]
Hey, Ogi! You home or what?

40
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
[SUGIO] What are you
doing back there, Kameda?

41
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,375
Using the side entrance.

42
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,375
Look, the window's open.

43
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,625
That's not cool, man. You can't
just break into Ogi's house.

44
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,750
[KAMEDA]
Come on, he won't mind.

45
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,791
[SUGIO]
There it is.

46
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,041
[KAMEDA]
Time to try this famous nectar.

47
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
I'm sure he won't
miss any of it.

48
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,250
But just a taste,
okay, you guys?

49
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,083
I don't want Ogi to
be pissed off at me.

50
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
Huh. I'm sure it'll be fine.

51
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,791
Oh, wow. This stuff's amazing!

52
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,291
Here, you gotta try it.

53
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,375
You're right.

54
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,791
I don't even know
how to describe it

55
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,583
except to say it's delicious.

56
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,791
Where'd he get it?

57
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,416
I could eat this stuff all day.

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,958
Mm! This is incredible!

59
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,333
I'm not leaving after just
one taste of this stuff.

60
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,708
Let's eat the whole jar.

61
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,500
No way, we can't do that.

62
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,500
This is Ogi's nectar, man.

63
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,000
There's so much.
It's not fair for him

64
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,666
to keep it all to himself.

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,375
[YUE]
Before we eat more,

66
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,750
do you smell something
funky in here?

67
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,583
Yeah. Like someone left
meat out and it rotted.

68
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,333
[YUE] I think it's
coming from over here.

69
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,875
[YUE gasps] Does that look
like blood to you guys, too?

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,958
[ALL gasping]

71
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,375
I don't know, but... we should
probably get outta here.

72
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,083
[YASUMIN] Come on, you've
got way more than us, man!

73
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,208
[KAMEDA]
I measured it out equally.

74
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,125
Oh, that's it!

75
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,458
So good. Heh!

76
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,041
[YASUMIN]
Aw, yum!

77
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,708
What part of South America does
this delicious stuff come from?

78
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,958
[YASUMIN]
I dunno.

79
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,416
I doubt Ogi could find
it again if he tried.

80
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:26,583
[ALL gasping]

81
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,625
[RIRUKO] What the hell
just happened to him?

82
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,208
I... think he just exploded.

83
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,708
Look there. His glasses.

84
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
[SUGIO]
No, this isn't possible.

85
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,750
How did he get smashed
against the wall?

86
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,833
Call the police!

87
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,291
Don't you dare.

88
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,583
That'll cause problems.

89
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,791
Then what are we
supposed to do?

90
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,375
He's been splattered
all over my room!

91
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,916
[SUGIO]
I don't get it.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,250
How did this happen?

93
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,500
[KAMEDA] Maybe we're all
having the same nightmare.

94
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,833
This can't be real life.

95
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,125
You're right.
This is just a dream.

96
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,875
Soon we'll wake up.

97
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,291
Well, I hope the dream started

98
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,375
after we found this
nectar, at least.

99
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,291
I'd be so depressed if
this stuff wasn't real.

100
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,500
[ALL scream]

101
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,541
[YUE]
Ri-Riruko!

102
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,416
But she was just sitting there!

103
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,791
It's the nectar.

104
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,166
I think if we keep eating it,
we're gonna explode.

105
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,708
No! That doesn't make
a lick of sense.

106
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,625
All of us had the
same amount of it!

107
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,416
Are we all gonna die?

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Is this going to
happen to me, too?

109
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,666
Ogi said not to be noticed
when you drink this.

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,333
I have no idea what that means,

111
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,625
but that's what
the tribe told him.

112
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,250
So... maybe we just
don't eat it anymore.

113
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,541
[SUGIO groans]
It's no use.

114
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,500
Everything I try tastes so bad.

115
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,708
I can't even swallow it.

116
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,583
[SUGIO]
Ever since I tried that nectar,

117
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,916
I haven't been able
to eat any food.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,416
[YUE]
Mm-hmm...

119
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,791
[SUGIO] The only thing
I can think about is

120
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,625
filling my mouth with
this damn exploding stuff.

121
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,291
Also...

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,333
...have you seen the news?

123
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,833
They've found several other
flattened bodies around town,

124
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,791
not just Riruko and Yasumin.

125
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,333
[YUE] I thought for sure
one of them would be Kameda,

126
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,375
but it wasn't.

127
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,750
That's true,
but I did notice that

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,958
some of his friends
had been killed.

129
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,208
They must've eaten some of
that cursed nectar themselves.

130
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,166
[SUGIO] Maybe he got
scared and gave it away

131
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,125
so he wouldn't be tempted by it.

132
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,833
[KAMEDA]
Hey, long time no see, guys.

133
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
[SUGIO]
Kameda.

134
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,875
Damn, you guys look
really skinny.

135
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,250
I bet I know why.

136
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,375
You can't eat the
food here, huh?

137
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,583
[YUE] I wish we'd never
tried this nectar.

138
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,916
I know.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,916
It's the only thing that
tastes okay to us anymore.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,458
Only, it's way too dangerous
for us to eat now.

141
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,000
You could drink it...

142
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,208
...as long as you were sure
that you weren't bein' noticed.

143
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, yeah.

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,666
[YUE]
Huh?

145
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
I've tested a few things
to see how it works--

146
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,541
what gets you noticed

147
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,500
and what lets you
survive the nectar.

148
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,625
What do you mean "tested"?
What have you been doing?

149
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,208
[KAMEDA]
Don't look at me like that.

150
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,000
Those guys kept beggin' me
for more of the stuff.

151
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,041
[SUGIO, YUE gasping]

152
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,541
[chuckles]

153
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,666
[SUGIO]
So... did you find a trick?

154
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,458
[KAMEDA] No. I gave
away the last of mine.

155
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,083
Still have no idea
how people get noticed.

156
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,666
I can't stand it anymore.

157
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,791
I have to eat some!

158
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,083
[KAMEDA]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, hold on.

159

A couple of fourth graders

much of the woman's body,

but she was incredibly tall,
towering several feet over them.

She stood in the

and didn't say a word
to them--just stared.

[FUCHI growls]

473
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,958
[whimpers]

474
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,875
[FUCHI]
You there. Boy.

475
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you know what
a bad idea it is

476
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,166
to take my photograph
without permission?

477
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,333
How did you know I was
here in the first place?

478
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,041
You're disturbing
my beauty rest.

479
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
[FUCHI]
Did a publisher send you?

480
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm a pro fashion
model, after all.

481
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,666
That's why anyone who
takes a photo of me

482
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,750
without my permission
has to be dealt with.

483
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,041
[laughs] I'm going to
make sure you never

484
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,875
make this mistake
again. [laughs]

485
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh, yes. You look so
tender and delicious.

486
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,000
This will be a treat for me.

487
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,625
--[FUCHI laughing]
--[SAKIYAMA screaming]

488
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,166
[SAKIYAMA] That model
really was in our town.

489
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,833
I've never heard of such
a terrifying coincidence.

490
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,583
But... I wonder what
will happen to Souichi.

491
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,541
[SOUICHI]
Wha--

492
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,875
What a creepy... beautiful lady.
