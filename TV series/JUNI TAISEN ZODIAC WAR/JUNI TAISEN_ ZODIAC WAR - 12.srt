00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,916
[DUO] The Juni Taisen is
held once every 12 years.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,375
The winner of this battle
royale is granted one wish.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,791
Anything they desire.

00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,041
[TSUGI]
Now presenting the champion

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,083
of the 12th competition.

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,958
Congratulations... me.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:40,083
[TSUGI] I get one wish.
So, what should it be?

8
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,083
[STUDENT A] You guys see
that show last night?

9
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,041
Mornin', uh-- Oh.
It's just Nezumi.

10
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,208
[STUDENT A]
Jeez, get my hopes up.

11
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,041
For a second...

12
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,416
Every one of you, just die.

13
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,416
What a weirdo.

14
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,375
So you guys wanna come over...?

15
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,250
[TSUGI]
Just kidding.

16
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,833
I didn't go into the Juni Taisen

17
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,166
with any particular
wish in mind.

18
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,875
But after going
through hell to win,

19
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,583
I'm not gonna waste it on
something so pointless.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:48,250
I mean, in a hundred years,
they'll all be worm food anyway.

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,250
[STUDENT AA] Well, you
look as gloomy as ever.

22
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,041
[TSUGI]
Hm?

23
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,083
[STUDENT AA] So do you just
come to school to sleep?

24
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,750
C'mon, don't you have like,
hopes or dreams?

25
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,416
[TSUGI]
Flip up her skirt.

26
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,458
[gasps]

[screams]

28
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,291
[STUDENT AA]
Hello?

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,541
Earth to Nezumi,
ya in there somewhere?

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,291
Where you zone out
to all of a sudden?

31
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,625
Something on your mind?

32
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,958
No, nothing really. Just stuff.

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,333
[TSUGI]
Dumbass.

34
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,541
Actually, if you could
have one wish granted

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,541
in the whole world,
what would it be?

36
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,208
Aww. Only get one?

37
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,291
Yeah. But whatever it was,
it would for sure come true.

38
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,750
Ooh, that's tough. Lemme think.

39
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,833
Uh, how 'bout...

40
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,833
"Let everyone be happy."

41
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,375
That's my wish!

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,000
That way I could grant lots of
other people's wishes, too,

43
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,625
all at the same time!

44
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,458
Huh, interesting.

45
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,250
That's not a bad idea.

46
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,666
[TSUGI]
Yeah, right.

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,541
Let's just make the worst
people in the world happy.

48
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,083
Take for example the
most terrifying competitor

49
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,458
in the Juni Taisen.

50
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,750
If he had his wish granted,
it'd be a nightmare.

51
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,208
He could wipe out all
life in the universe.

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,166
But the more I think about it,

53
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,875
granting the wish of somebody
nice sounds pretty good to me.

54
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,791
And not to be all arrogant,

55
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,041
but if I can't come up
with one on my own,

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,166
it'd be a real slap in
the face to those who died.

57
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,125
I could never face 'em again.

58
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,416
But you, I hope you
truly believe

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,666
this is the right
end for you, too.

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,208
[ANNOUNCEMENT A] Now
arriving. Please stand clear--

61
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,666
[TSUGI]
I didn't really do what I did

62
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,500
'cause I thought it was
"the right thing to do."

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,625
It was just the only choice
that would allow me to survive.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,375
The right thing...
What is the right thing?

65
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,500
It's full of trash people,
all of 'em numbed by peace.

66
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,916
When I think about
risking my life

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,875
to protect the
anesthetized lifestyle

68
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,416
of those ungrateful brats,
I get sick to my stomach.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,416
[TSUGI]
Don't you ever get tired of it?

70
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,125
I bet no one in the
world has saved

71
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,750
as many people as you have.

72
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,625
But that means, according to
the law of averages anyway,

73
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,750
that you've saved a
lot of garbage, too.

74
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,458
Doin' the right thing, that's
more her field than mine.

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,750
[MISAKI]
I carry it with me. Forever.

76
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,458
I choose to stop wars with
the power of my words.

77
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,541
And yeah, I've been through some
terrible things myself, too.

78
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,291
But I won't let that stop me
from getting along with people.

79
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,708
Ideally, I'd like
to be at peace

80
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,458
with everyone in
the whole world.

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,958
So don't sell
platitudes short, okay?

82
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,458
[TSUGI] To be honest, I found
that whole speech pretty lame.

83
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,250
But still, I kinda dug
your commitment

84
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,500
to those platitudes
of yours, Sharyu.

85
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,750
I know.

86
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,541
What if I bring the
most righteous person

87
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,416
in the world back to life?

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,416
After all, I couldn't've
won without her.

89
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,125
Yeah, that's good.
No problems there.

90
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,833
I'll go with that. It's decided.

91
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,500
The wish I want granted
more than any other is...

92
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,125
Wait a minute.

93
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,583
Should someone be brought back
just 'cause they're righteous?

94
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,833
Is it righteous for only the
most righteous to get to live?

95
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,916
Would she even accept that?

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,791
Okay, so what about, "Bring
back everyone who died"?

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,875
But then, that would
include some people

98
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,791
who don't wanna come back.

99
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,500
Besides, that'd just lead
to a rehash of the Taisen.

100
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,666
And who am I to be making
decisions about life and death?

101
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,000
And would they still be
the same people they were

102
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,958
before their lives ended?

103
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,583
Or would they be more like
clones of themselves?

104
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,291
And if so, does that mean I'd
just be doing it for myself?

105
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,833
Then again, it is my wish,
so maybe that's okay.

106
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,625
[TSUGI] But what's the point
of bringing them back anyway?

107
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,541
Do I expect them to thank me?

108
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,208
Honestly, I don't wanna
see them again.

109
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,666
Any of them. Ever.

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,666
Okay, so if I'm gonna use
this wish for myself...

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,500
Let's see. How 'bout
wishing for... good health?

112
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,250
Yeah, come to think of it,

113
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,791
the old man said
something like that.

114
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,958
Huh? What would I wish for?

115
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,208
Eternal life and youth.

116
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,791
When you get to my age,

117
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,208
you discover that youth is the
greatest treasure of 'em all.

118
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,166
[TSUGI] But immortality would
kinda suck though, right?

119
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,583
And staying this age
forever sounds rough, too.

120
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,125
Wasn't just him.

121
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,458
Along my different paths,

122
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,375
I asked all the fighters
about their wishes.

123
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,541
Don't know if they were
telling me the truth,

124
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,625
but their answers
came so easily.

125
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,041
Huh? You wanna know
what I'm wishing for?

126
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,083
Yeah.

127
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,000
I suppose... confidence?

128
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,708
Yeah, confidence.

129
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,291
Confidence? Really?

130
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,333
Confidence in what?

131
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:57,666
Uh, well, I guess I'd probably
say confidence in myself.

132
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,208
Yeah, but you're
a badass warrior.

133
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,416
I'm sure you've been through

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,625
some hard core battles
in your day, right?

135
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,708
Well, yeah, I guess
so, but still.

136
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,291
I don't really have a
solid sense of who I am.

137
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,666
I sorta fell into
this line of work.

138
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,541
I do what I'm told, when
I'm told, the way I'm told.

139
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,625
And even if I make
it out of here alive,

140
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,166
I'll have to keep
doin' this job, right?

141
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,333
So I'd at least like to have
some pride, maybe?

142
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,125
A sense of accomplishment.
Some meaning in what I do.

143
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,000
Or something like that.

144
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,458
Okay then,

145
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,833
why wouldn't your wish be to
just stop being a warrior?

146
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,833
Oh, yeah. Huh. I guess that
is an option, isn't it?

147
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,500
[TSUGI]
I don't get it.

148
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,750
You seem so strong and yet
you'd still ask for talent?

149
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:55,791
Truth is... I'm more afraid
of losing than dying.

150
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,708
[TSUGI] Afraid? I mean,
nobody likes to lose.

151
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,791
And sure, a genius like Ox,

152
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,166
bet he doesn't have
much to fear.

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,833
But it sounds to me like

154
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,125
you just have an
inferiority complex.

155
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,666
[YOSHIMI] It's not a
complex. It's a disease.

156
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,083
[TSUGI]
If I had more power or talent,

157
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,666
my odds of survival
would seriously increase.

158
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,041
But in that case, wouldn't
I just get sent off

159
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,083
to more and more battlefields

160
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,083
to fight more and more
dangerous enemies?

161
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,791
[TOSHIKO] I want a harem
of men, of course!

162
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,541
A harem, harem, harem!

163
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,541
As the heiress to a
historic household,

164
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,791
I want a life surrounded by
three billion gorgeous boy-toys!

165
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,958
To love and be loved
by every single one!

166
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,000
[TSUGI] Maybe it's 'cause
I'm still a teenager,

167
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,958
but I don't wanna
wish for anything

168
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,666
I'd be embarrassed to
tell people about.

169
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,125
This sucks.

170
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,916
Having infinite options only
makes it harder to decide.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,083
Ah, it's just Nezumi. That
kid's such a waste of space.

172
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,750
Like, sometimes I
forget he even exists,

173
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,583
and then I'm like...

174
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,250
Vanish, all you.

175
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,125
So what say we head
out to the mall...?

176
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,875
[TSUGI]
Just kidding.

177
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,666
[TSUGI] This power to
experience the results

178
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,833
of a hundred different actions,

179
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,125
the Hundred Paths of Nezumi

180
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:25,583
maybe I should upgrade
it to a thousand paths.

181
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,791
While it's true this ability
is what allowed me

182
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,708
to win the Juni Taisen,

183
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,958
without it, I never
would've had to participate

184
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,166
in that horror show
in the first place.

185
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Plus, I still remember
the fear and pain I felt

186
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,958
every one of those 99
times I was murdered.

187
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,750
[TSUGI]
Hey, wait! Don't do this!

188
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,541
[RYOKA]
I really am sorry, Nezumi.

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,125
[TSUGI screams]

190
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,666
[TSUGI]
The others retained no memories

191
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,875
of the alternate
paths, obviously.

192
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,083
[TOSHIKO] I regret to inform
you there's no escape.

193
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
So just sit back and relax

194
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,125
while I pump your adorable
body full of lead.

195
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,666
[TSUGI] Occasionally
they did recognize me,

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,958
but only as a vague
feeling of déjà vu.

197
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,708
Hello there. You
wanna be my friend?

198
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,083
Don't be afraid.
I'll make it quick.

199
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,916
[TSUGI]
But it's burned into my memory,

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,458
as though it all
really happened.

201
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,916
Not the kinda thing
you can forget.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,583
[ANNOUNCEMENT A]
For your own safety...

203
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,833
[TSUGI] Still, I was lucky
there was at least one path

204
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,541
where I managed to survive.

205
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,333
There are plenty of
situations where,

206
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,750
even with a hundred options,
I can't catch a break.

207
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,208
For example, there was no
choice I could've made

208
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,416
to avoid the Juni
Taisen altogether.

209
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,708
I doubt anyone can
understand the despair

210
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,291
of trying a hundred
different paths

211
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,500
and having none of 'em pan out.

212
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,875
It was middle school.

213
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,500
I fell in love with the most
popular girl in school.

214
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,666
Well, her third best friend.

215
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,166
A plain girl, but I was smitten.

216
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,583
So I tried a hundred different
ways to ask her out.

217
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,916
[TSUGI] Being shot down
a hundred times at once

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,083
hurt at least a
hundred times more.

219
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,375
I found out later that
she was totally obsessed

220
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,750
with this one kid in our class

221
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,208
and wouldn't even
look at another boy.

222
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
Guess there are some things
that won't work out,

223
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,750
no matter what you try.

224
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,416
Ever since then, I've written
my power off as something

225
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,625
that's only good for winning
at rock-paper-scissors.

226
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,000
So yeah, I think I'll pass
on the hellish experience

227
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,458
of trying a thousand options
and having them all fail.

228
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,125
I'm a teacher.

229
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,750
At a preschool.

230
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm good. The kids and
parents all seem to like me.

231
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,291
Yeah, it's great. My
daughter goes there, too.

232
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,833
Ya think I'm lyin'?

233
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,250
[TSUGI] No, it's just surprising
on pretty much every level.

234
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, a long time ago, I made
a mistake on this one job,

235
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,708
and this kid wound up
getting sold to a real sicko.

236
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,791
I managed to get her back,
but she had nowhere to go.

237
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,416
I couldn't live with that,
so I took the little girl in.

238
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,625
[MICHIO]
Now I gotta keep workin',

239
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,083
so I can earn enough
to support her.

240
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,083
[giggles]

241
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,083
[TSUGI]
That must be hard on you.

242
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,958
Not really. And thanks
to her, I have...

243
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,458
I wouldn't call it a purpose,

244
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,750
but it's a less crappy life
than I used to have.

245
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,041
[TSUGI]
A purpose. That reminds me.

246
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,916
Ha. Our wish? Can
you believe this guy?

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh, c'mon, like you
even have to ask.

248
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,666
[BOTH]
Money, money, money!

249
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,875
It's all about
makin' that scratch!

250
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,583
Ain't nothin' in this
world you can't do

if you got da big moolah!

252
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,916
[TAKE] I know that's what
my big brother said,

253
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,666
but deep down he doesn't really
believe in the value of money.

254
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,500
Hell, I don't think he believes
in much of anything these days.

255
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,916
Except himself, of course.

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,291
[NAGA] I know that's what
my baby brother said,

257
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,833
but for him, money's
just one more thing

258
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,125
out there to be stolen.

259
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,000
It's all one giant game to him.

260
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,875
[TSUGI] Those guys,
who acted like money

261
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,791
was their sole purpose in life,

262
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,333
when I really talked to them,
and got to know them,

263
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,208
they weren't as shallow or
simplistic as I thought.

264
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,250
Even a seemingly
irredeemable creep like--

265
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,083
So if what you're
telling me is true,

266
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,416
I should be patient and
wait till the very end

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,791
to make you my friend?

268
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,041
Yeah, that's right!

269
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,666
I can't tell you what
my ability is,

270
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,416
but I don't think it'll do you
much good after I'm dead.

271
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,708
So...

272
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,708
[USAGI]
Okay.

273
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,125
Then will you help me track
down the other warriors?

274
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,208
Sure, anything you say.

275
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,750
[USAGI] Let's start with
the Warrior of the Ox.

276
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,166
I'd really, really like
him to be my friend.

277
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,458
[TSUGI]
With each warrior,

278
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,458
once we were able to
have a conversation,

279
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,375
they turned out
to be so different

280
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,208
from my first
impression of them.

281
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,791
Huh? What would my wish be?

282
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
Yeah.

283
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,708
My deepest desire is...

284
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,791
To be friends with everyone.

285
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,041
Everyone in the whole world.

286
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,583
[TSUGI]
It was a chilling thing to hear,

287
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:07,208
but at least he was honest about
what he genuinely wanted.

288
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,750
What a joke.

289
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,875
What cosmic irony for me,

290
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,333
the one person who went into
this without a wish, to win!

291
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,458
[KANAE] So after that, I ended
up thinkin' to myself,

292
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,125
"How the hell does
this guy always know

293
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,708
the right thing to do?"

294
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,250
Ya know? Like, come on!

295
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:27,166
I thought about,
how "bu" and "michi,"

296
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,750
those things don't mean
nothin' on a battlefield.

297
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,291
Nothing good about war.

298
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,791
But Ushii, he was truly good.

299
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:41,166
So I guess my wish'd be to
see him again, and finally...

300
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,291
Hey, you listenin'
to me, pipsqueak?

301
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,833
Uh, yeah.

302
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,791
'Kay, then take a swig! Boom!

303
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,250
Um, no thanks. I'm underage.

00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,458
Wha'd you say? You think...

305
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,666
[TSUGI]
Miss Tiger.

306
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,625
The one warrior
in the Juni Taisen

307
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,250
who actually got her wish.

308
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,333
[KANAE]
You sayin' I'm old?

309
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,791
[TSUGI] I started to think
that having hopes and dreams

310
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,250
was a recipe for misery.

311
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,375
If you make achieving them
your purpose in life,

312
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,375
you'll only wind up feeling
empty if you don't get 'em.

313
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,166
On the other hand,
if you do get them,

314
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,666
what's the point of
living after that?

315
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,916
Doing the right thing
is the same way.

316
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,291
Is that the reason I
fought in the Juni Taisen?

317
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,833
Maybe I just got swept
along in the moment.

318
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,583
Not everyone can see the world
the way Monkey and Ox did.

319
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,583
To finish off the rest of
the Necromantist's allies,

320
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,791
I believe I'll need this.

321
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
[yells]

322
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,083
Stop hiding and reveal yourself.

323
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,375
Or must I come to you,
Warrior of the Rat?

324
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,041
[sighs]

325
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,958
[USAGI]
Hey.

326
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,333
Can I ask you something
before you kill me?

327
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
What is it?

328
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,250
C'mon, don't you have any,
like, hopes or dreams?

329
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,541
[TSUGI] Do I need to
have hopes or dreams?

330
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,000
I haven't crawled my
way up out of anything!

331
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,458
I've never faced adversity!

332
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,166
Perhaps I could
ask you a question.

333
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,500
Tell me, what would your
wish be, young man?

334
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,250
What matters to you that
you're fighting for?

335
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,083
Living for?

336
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,333
[TSUGI]
Oh, gimme a break.

337
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,125
I've never thought about
a reason for fighting,

338
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,875
let alone a reason for living!

339
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,791
What's my wish?
I have 99 of 'em!

340
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,416
Rule the world? But the ruling
itself is the hard part.

341
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,625
I want a girlfriend.
But would that really be love?

342
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,458
I want wisdom. But
foolishness makes you...

343
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,541
I want to be a pro baseball
player. But you'd have to...

344
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,666
Telekinesis. But then...

345
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,666
I want to fly.
But then why have feet?

346
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,208
I want to speak all languages...

347
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,583
I want X-ray vision...

00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,125
To never stub my toe again...

349
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,500
I want a cool supercar...

350
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,500
I wanna not feel pain...

351
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,541
I wish every day
could be Sunday...

352
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,041
The ability to wake up early...

353
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,333
--I want that rare book...
--Just to go back to sleep...

354

...but it would be
harder than it sounds...

355
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,791
I wanna play all instruments...

356
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,750
I wanna live in a mansion...

357
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,458
I wanna enter a manga...

358
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,458
The power to stop time...

359
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,708
It's like you're saying you want
the power to commit crimes.

360
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,958
...be a manga artist...

361

...one of Young Jump's
rectruiting posters...

--I wanna be free of stress...
--I wanna hire a maid...

364
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,750
But you need stress
in order to grow...

365
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,500
I wanna be on the front
page of the newspaper...

366
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,833
I wanna eat the world's
most delicious food...

367
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,166
...but you'd just want
to be shorter again.

--I want courage...
--I want prestige...

00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,458
I wanna be the strongest
in the world...

370
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,416
I wanna invent
something amazing...

I wanna learn the
truth of the world...

00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,541
No, you really don't.

375
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,541
I wanna wish misfortune
on people I hate.

376
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,041
But wishing misfortune on
others is a crappy thing to do.

377
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,125
[TSUGI] If I do this,
then that'll happen.

378
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,375
But if I do that instead,
it'll lead to this,

379
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,291
so I'd better just...

380
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,500
Hold on, wait.

381
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,291
If that doesn't work,
then what about...?

382
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,125
No, no, that'll ruin this,
so I can't do that.

383
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,958
Okay, if this happens, it'll
result in maybe, possibly...

[DUO] So, have you chosen
your wish yet, Mr. Nezumi?

385
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,416
Turing your one wish into a
hundred is also an option,

386
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,250
if you so desire.

387
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,166
Although, in my experience...

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,750
[chuckles]

389
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,875
[DUO] ...even a hundred
wishes are not enough

00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,083
to satisfy a person's ambition.

391
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,708
[TSUGI]
I've decided.

My one wish...

The wish granted to the
winner of the Juni Taisen...

394
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,916
What I want more
than anything is...

395
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,375
I wanna forget!

396
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041
I just wanna forget I ever
had this decision to make!

Please.

Very well. What a
wonderful wish.
