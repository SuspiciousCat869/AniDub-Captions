1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,708
[KANAE] I know you're hidin' in
those bushes, dirty old man.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,083
Quit peepin' on me
and get out here!

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,083
C'mon! Let's go!

4
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,791
What're you 'fraid of?

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,958
You're a little too old

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,958
to be playin'
hide-and-seek, ain't cha?

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,791
But if you're willin'
to change your stripes,

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,291
I'll play with ya.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,875
That was a joke.

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,500
Y'know, 'cause of how us tigers

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,666
got stripes and stuff,
ya get it?

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,250
[laughs]

13
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:15,208
[SUMI] Well, if you insist,
perhaps I will play along.

14
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,916
[SUMI] I had hoped to avoid
any direct confrontation

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,333
up until the very end.

16
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,083
Beatin' this drunk
wouldn't mean much.

17
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,208
But that Juseki inside of her

18
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,083
could hold some value
in a negotiation later.

19
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,250
[KANAE] Heh. You coulda just
done that from the start.

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:34,958
Oh!

21
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,000
What a mess. Hm?

22
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,000
[SUMI]
Hm?

23
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,916
[gasps]

24
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,500
[EIJI] It's clear that
one of my competitors

25
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,375
was hiding out there.

26
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,250
Likely that most
seasoned of veterans.

27
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,041
The Warrior of the
Sheep, I believe.

28
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,708
If he hastily set
out those traps

29
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,875
only after sensing my arrival,

30
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,541
he couldn't have
gotten very far.

31
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,500
[chuckles]

32
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,208
Come on, that stance
is preposterous.

33
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,875
[growls]

34
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,000
Huh? Hey, what'd
you say, old man?

35
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,708
Somethin' about a hippopotamus?

36
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,083
'Cause I don't remember

37
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,791
no Warrior of the Hippopotamus
in the Juni Taisen.

38
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,041
Though I guess if there's
rabbits, boars, monkeys, hors--

39
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,041
I was merely complimenting
your stance.

40
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,583
It's truly unbelievable.

41
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,333
[SUMI] Unbelievable in that
you've managed to survive

42
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,791
this long using such
a ridiculous technique.

43
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,625
Aw, shucks, old man,
that's sweet,

44
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,041
but flattery won't get
you nowhere with me.

45
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,416
Sorry, I just ain't the
kinda gal to take it easy

46
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,750
or hold myself back.

47
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,916
Or show my prey any mercy.

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,291
See?

49
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,958
[SUMI] They say a wise hawk
keeps its talons hidden,

50
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,916
but it seems this
kitty-cat never heard that.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,875
I'll admit to being
a bit surprised

52
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,708
when she was able to sense
me hidin' in the bushes.

53
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,666
But even so, she's got to be
the weakest of all the warriors

54
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,000
in this thing.

55
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,250
Hey, Grandpa?

56
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,416
Whoa, you can do that ninja
clone thingy? Badass.

57
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,625
How do ya do that, though?

58
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,666
Makin' copies of
yourself like that?

59
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,208
[SUMI]
Huh?

60
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,666
[YOSHIMI]
If I go back out there,

61
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,958
even if I were able to take
out all the other fighters,

62
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,541
I would still die.

63
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,416
It's no use.
I have to stay here.

64
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,791
[SUMI] I can't afford to waste
too much more of my time

65
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,208
here with this paper tiger.

66
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,125
I seriously doubt that
fake trail I left behind

67
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,583
will fool the natural-born
slayer for much longer.

68
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,500
He's too smart for that.

69
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,541
Huh? Hey, hold on.

70
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,541
When did you make one, two,
three, two, four more of you?

71
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,500
Hmm.

72
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,666
This s'posed to be, like,

73
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,125
a counting sheep-type
deal or somethin'?

74
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,583
Don't be tryin' to put me
to sleep here, old man.

75
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,416
[SUMI] I'd hoped that
being back in the field

76
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,291
would get my blood
flowin' again,

77
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,541
but this battle's bound
to be all too easy.

78
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,500
[MISAKI] I suppose the
Warrior of the Snake

79
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,916
was sent out first in order
to divide up our forces.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
He's moving us
around like checkers.

81
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,750
No, more like chess.

82
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,250
A cold, calculating
game of strategy,

83
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,875
with no thought given
to us as people.

84
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,291
He was aiming for my stomach.

85
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,125
Does he see his opponents as
mere vessels for the Juseki?

86
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,000
What a dangerous mentality.

87
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,166
As far as fighting goes,
he still has a lot to learn.

88
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,375
Though I guess a Necromantist
doesn't have much need

89
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,791
to practice swordplay.

90
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,333
He can't escape.

91
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,208
[MISAKI] It's not just the
way he wields his blades.

92
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,875
It's how he moves his legs
and uses his body.

93
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,625
He clearly isn't
a martial artist.

94
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,666
If I get behind him,

95
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,500
I'll be able to lock
him down easily.

96
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,625
Render him powerless
so we can negotiate again.

97
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,958
He won't have time
to turn around.

98
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,000
[thud]

99
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:45,708
[MISAKI] How... did he perform
such an advanced technique?

100
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,125
[MISAKI]
Is that...

101
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,541
...Snake's head?

102
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,375
[USAGI] Isn't it nice to have
friends in high places

103
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,791
looking out for you?

104
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,458
It's the best. It's really
the best, isn't it?

105
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,000
[MISAKI]
Oh, right.

106
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,458
It was a headless corpse
that ran off after Nezumi.

107
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,166
I should've been on the
lookout for the rest of him.

108
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,666
Oh, hey. No, it's okay.
Don't worry.

109
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,083
All I'm taking here is
your life, that's all.

110
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,250
And in exchange,

111
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,041
I'm hoping that you'll
be my friend, too.

112
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,000
You can never have
enough friends.

113
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,666
I've wanted to make
you my friend so badly,

114
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,750
since the moment
I first saw you.

115
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,791
[SUMI] Why don't we
introduce ourselves?

116
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,750
After you've sobered
up a bit, that is.

117
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,375
Aw, shaddup!
I ain't drunk, fool!

118
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,375
I aint drunk! I ain't drunk!

119
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,041
Okay, maybe I'm just a
teensy weensy bit drunk,

120
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,583
but see, I can drink a
whole boatload of booze

121
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,416
and still not drunk that get!

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,208
[SUMI] Just lookin' at this wino
is makin' me feel embarrassed.

123
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,791
I should just finish her off.
Do us both a favor.

124
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,708
Matter of fact, I think I will.

125
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,125
Killing deceptively, Warrior
of the Sheep, Hitsujii.

126
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,041
[KANAE]
Killin' in a drunken rage,

127
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,041
Warrior of the Tiger, Tora.

128
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
[SUMI]
In a drunken rage?

129
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,000
[gasps]

130
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,708
[SUMI]
What the...?

131
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,291
But she's nothing
more than a drunkard.

132
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:22,708
Slurred speech, stumbling,
reeking of booze.

133
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,333
A drunkard.

134
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,750
Yep! It's the famous
"Drunken Fist"!

135
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,791
Though, honestly, you look
a hell of a lot more

136
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,041
like the typical Drunken
Fist type than I do.

137
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,833
[KANAE grunts]

138
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,833
[KANAE] Now, see, personally,
I get way more drunk

139
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,500
from drinkin' human blood
than from drinkin' booze.

140
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,041
Too bad you've got barely
enough in you to get me tipsy.

141
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,083
[DUO]
We started with 12 warriors,

142
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,083
we are now down to six.

143
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,041
Let the wagering commence!

144
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
I believe the abilities that
these competitors possess

145
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,916
are by now fairly apparent.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
To help you make your decisions,

147
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,000
here are the current rankings
for the remaining six fighters.

148
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,625
[VIP AA] So, the top two
are Ox and Rabbit, then.

149
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,708
[VIP F] I see Tiger
received quite a boost

150
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,625
for slaughtering Sheep.

151
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,666
[DUO]
And in the back of the pack.

152
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,375
I'm sure no one is surprised

153
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,958
that the lowest-ranking
warriors are Dragon,

154
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,708
who lost his brother
and partner,

155
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,750
and Rat, who has
yet to accomplish

156
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,875
anything in this battle.

157
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,666
[chuckles]

158
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,083
[VIP C] That leaves the
Warrior of the Horse

159
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,000
right around the middle in
fourth, with average odds.

160
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,083
Neither a sure thing nor
a complete long shot.

161
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,708
The mere fact that he
survived Ox's attack

162
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,291
is to his credit, however...

163
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,583
[DUO] He seems to have
lost the will to fight

164
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,750
and has isolated himself.

165
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,000
But that strategy
may pay off for him

166
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,041
if Ox and Rabbit
are able to take out

167
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,583
some of the other warriors
before they get to him,

168
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,958
including the
higher-ranked Tiger.

169
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,083
But in the end, it may
just be the time limit

170
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,458
that kills them all.

171
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,541
And we'd certainly
prefer to avoid

172
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,375
such an unsatisfying resolution.

173
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,333
[YOSHIMI] At this rate,
I'll hit the time limit,

174
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,666
and die from the poison.

175
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,833
[gunshots]

176
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,625
[yells]

177
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,750
[yells]

178
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,708
[screams]

179
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,458
[YOSHIMI]
A critical failure on my part,

180
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,041
the result of my own weakness.

181
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,416
[YOSHIMI] After that, I set
out to completely alter

182
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,458
my physical body.

183
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,166
[YOSHIMI]
I underwent grueling training

184
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,250
to make my muscle like armor.

185
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,875
[YOSHIMI]
I tried every experimental

186
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,958
treatment available.

187
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,833
[YOSHIMI]
And the result was

188
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:18,416
the impenetrable defense
technique I call "Stirrup."

189
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,333
Right now, I can feel my body
changing on the cellular level.

190
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,625
Could it be?

191
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,500
Could Stirrup's
safeguards be effective

192
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,458
even against the poison
attacking my body?

193
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,500
I may not technically
win the competition

194
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,333
if I fail to acquire the
other warriors' Juseki,

195
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:40,375
but if I survive this,
that's still a win.

196
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:45,583
As long as I keep my armor up,
at the very least, I won't lose.

197
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:51,083
And if I don't lose, that's
the same as winning, isn't it?

198
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,541
[TSUGI] So dark down here;
it's hard to keep my eyes open.

199
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,750
[YOSHIMI]
Huh?

200
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,916
They say the glass used
in smartphone screens,

201
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,541
it's the same reinforced
type that's being used

202
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,416
by the military.

203
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,458
I even heard this
urban legend once

204
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,333
that if you keep your phone
in your breast pocket

205
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,916
it can stop a bullet.

206
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,625
I wonder if that's true. Huh.

207
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,208
[YOSHIMI] What is this
kid talkin' about?

208
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,625
[TSUGI]
Me, though?

209
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,375
I'm the kind who intentionally
breaks a phone screen.

210
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,583
Like, the second
I get a new one,

211
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,500
I just smash the sucker.

212
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,250
Those cracks that splinter
kinda like a spider web?

213
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,791
I dunno, I just
like how it looks.

214
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,875
It's pretty metal, though.
I mean, don't you think so?

215
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:31,958
[YOSHIMI]
I don't get it.

216
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,625
How the hell did he get in here?

217
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,833
[TSUGI] Hm. And don't worry
'bout how I got in here.

218
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,416
You know how rats are.

219
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
We can slip through any crack,
no matter how small it may be.

220
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,583
[YOSHIMI]
Wait. There's a crack?

221
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:55,041
[TSUGI] Killing all,
Warrior of the Rat, Nezumi.

222
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,875
Uh. Killing silently,
Warrior of the Horse, Uuma.

223
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,250
[TSUGI]
That's cool.

224
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,791
[YOSHIMI] How did he...?
Why did he come in here?

225
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,541
Oh, just needed a
place to hide out.

226
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,125
I was thinking maybe this'd
make a decent panic room,

227
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,291
so I came in here
to take a break.

228
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,750
The Snake is on
my tail right now.

229
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,416
Well, the body of
the Snake, anyway.

230
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,875
At first, I was the
one chasing him,

231
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,958
but then things took a turn.

232
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,500
Even dead, that guy's as
relentless as a serpent.

233
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,500
Huh. Or maybe... it's
because he's a serpent...

234
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,291
[YOSHIMI] What the hell
is going on out there?

235
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,000
[TSUGI] Weren't you one of
the ones who volunteered

236
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,833
to join Monkey's alliance?

237
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,416
Well, since we're in here,
guess I oughta fill you in.

238
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,250
That plan went up in smoke.

239
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,291
[YOSHIMI]
What?

240
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,666
Yeah, it died along
with the Monkey.

241
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,041
I mean, that pacifist was
really the driving force

242
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,875
behind the peace proposal,

243
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,000
so without her, I'd say
it's pretty much history.

244
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,541
How lame is that?

245
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,958
Guess the only thing less
effective than a pacifist

246
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,583
is a dead pacifist.

247
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,000
[YOSHIMI]
Monkey is dead?

248
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,166
But she was so skilled.

249
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
[TSUGI] ...what her big
brilliant plan was.

250
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,750
Almost makes you wonder

251
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,708
if she was just bluffing her
way through from the start.

252
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,291
The peace talks
themselves may've been

253
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,208
what she was really goin' for.

254
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,125
You get people to stop fighting,

255
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,250
then everyone
thinks things over.

256
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,458
Seems plausible, right?

257
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,291
[YOSHIMI] Was it Ox
who took Monkey out?

258
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,791
[TSUGI] ...I mean,
when it comes down to it,

259
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,791
how much is peace worth?

260
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,958
Imagine if everyone everywhere

261
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,625
just shut themselves in
like you're doing now.

262
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,250
The whole world would
stand still, right?

263
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,833
People who put themselves out
there bring about change,

264
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,166
and progress, hopefully.

265
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,583
A paralyzed world where
everything stays the same,

266
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,958
that's basically a dead world.

267
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,541
Kinda like how you might
as well be dead right now.

268
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,375
[YOSHIMI]
What's that supposed to mean?

269
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,750
[TSUGI] Just surviving,
it's the same as being dead.

270
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,458
[YOSHIMI] What the hell
is he talkin about?

271
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,958
...by that freaky Rabbit,

272
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,750
they seem more alive
to me than you do.

273
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,250
Oh, hey.

274
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,833
Meant to ask, do you know
where that Sheep geezer's at?

275
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,666
[YOSHIMI]
Sheep geezer?

276
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,250
[YOSHIMI]
He must mean that old man

277
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,291
who was asking about explosives
back in the observation room.

278
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,958
He definitely left
an impression.

279
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,166
But why would this kid
care where he is?

280
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,208
So you don't know?

281
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,958
That's cool, whatever.

282
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,833
No big deal. Don't worry
about it, horse guy.

283
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,625
But, seriously,

284
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,333
staying locked up in tomb
like this the whole time,

285
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,625
it seems like a waste.

286
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,041
Not to mention kinda gloomy.

287
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,583
Anyway, I think I'd
better get going now.

288
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,583
Huh?

289
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,458
[TSUGI]
One last bit of advice, though.

290
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,708
Snake's prob'ly gonna
show up lookin' for me,

291
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,041
best as a headless
corpse can "look."

292
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,083
So you might wanna get
outta here before he does.

293
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,958
[YOSHIMI]
"Get outta here"? Yeah, right.

294
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,083
Where would I go?

295
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:11,250
The natural-born
slayer is out there.

296
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:16,666
And Rat boy, I still don't
know how he snuck in here.

297
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,333
Though Snake, or Snake's corpse,

298
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:24,625
I doubt it'll be able
to do the same thing.

299
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:29,250
Either way, it's still gotta be
safer to stay hidden down here.

300
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,583
[TSUGI] A paralyzed world where
everything stays the same,

301
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,916
that's basically a dead world.

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,666
Kinda like how you might
as well be dead right now.

303
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,000
Just surviving, it's
the same as being dead.

304
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,833
[YOSHIMI]
The infantile wisdom of a kid

305
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,208
who doesn't know how
the world works yet.

306
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,750
What does he know?

307
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,416
Go on the defensive.

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,625
Hide out. Remain still.

309
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,375
That should be the easiest thing
in the world to do, and yet...

310
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,583
[grunting]

311
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,625
[YOSHIMI]
Why's--?

312
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,041
Why's it getting so
hard to breathe?

313
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,666
It's hard to breathe
because... because...

314
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,500
Not because of anything
the boy said.

315
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,333
Something's burning.

316
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,208
[YOSHIMI]
No, it's being burned!

317
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,958
[YOSHIMI] I can take the heat,
but the oxygen is running out.

318
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,791
[KANAE]
Huh?

319
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,791
[DUO] They say a half-dead
snake can still strike.

320
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,541
And a headless snake may
not have a leg to stand on,

321
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,291
but since when does
a snake need legs?

322
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,416
Next time: "In Like a Dragon,
Out Like a Snake Part One."

323
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,083
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
