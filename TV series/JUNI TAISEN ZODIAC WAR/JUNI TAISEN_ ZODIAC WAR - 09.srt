1
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,333
I'm countin on you, bro.

2
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,375
Just keep them distracted
for a little bit longer.

3
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:33,375
And I will get you,
the memorial you deserve!

4
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,750
[gasps]

5
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,750
Huh?

6
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:54,500
[USAGI] Warrior of the Rabbit:
Killing psychotically.

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,000
Usagi!

8
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,583
Haven't you heard the
old tale, Mr. Dragon?

9
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:05,333
'Bout the rabbit who could
jump as high as the moon?

10
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:10,083
Now go down there and
help your little brother for me.

11
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,625
Tiger. Rat. Ox.

12
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,500
Those are the
last three to kill!

13
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,208
[EIJI]
Hmm?

14
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,541
[KANAE]
Huh?

15
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,583
It's two against two now.

16
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,708
Wait.

17
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,458
[EIJI]
If we count Snake's armless,

18
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,583
walking trunk,
his decapitated head,

19
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,875
and Dragon's newly
bifurcated body.

20
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,000
It's actually four against two.

21
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,250
[KANAE]
See ya!

22
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:31,875
Bye!

23
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,541
Later!

24
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,666
[GIRL A] So you know
Kanae's story, right?

25
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,708
About her family?

26
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,041
[GIRL B]
Kinda.

27
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,583
Don't they don't run
a big dojo, or something?

28
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,125
[KANAE]
Are you guys ready for this?

29
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,833
[DOJO MEMBERS]
Yeah!

30
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,291
Great!

31
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,791
[INSTRUCTOR]
That's enough!

32
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,583
The Aira dojo, hundred-man
sparring exercise

33
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,875
is now complete!

34
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,750
Yes, sir, master.

35
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,166
Thank you.

36
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,208
[KANAE'S FATHER] You were
magnificent out there, Kanae.

37
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,583
In light of your mastery,
I will recommend you

38
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,875
as a candidate for
head of the Aira dojo.

39
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,125
[KANAE]
Thank you, Father.

40
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,000
I must say, there is not
a soul left at this dojo

41
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,750
who's able to best you.

42
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,916
Any critics you had,
have fallen silent.

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,083
[KANAE]
Yes, sir.

44
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,666
My daughter.

45
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Can you tell me
the meaning of <i>bu</i> ?

46
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,666
The meaning of <i>michi</i> ?

47
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,125
[KANAE]
Okay.

48
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,708
" <i>Bu</i> " is the power's form.

49
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,875
What we practice and refine.

50
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,500
<i>Michi</i> is how we
use it, for good.

51
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,625
Correct.

52
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:08,750
And can I trust you'll continue
using your skills for good?

53
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,166
You can.

54
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,875
I am proud.

55
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,250
Now, Kanae.

56
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,708
Those blessed with the name
"Aira" must go and fight

57
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,916
on real battlefields.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,333
You mean in wars?

59
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,875
[KANAE'S FATHER]
Yes.

60
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,166
There are things a warrior can
learn only in actual combat.

61
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,416
This is your next test.

62
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,000
[KANAE]
Yes, Father.

63
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,083
I'll take what I've learned into
the world to do great things!

64
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,208
[KANAE]
So this is what war looks like.

65
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,500
[KANAE]
Where is the <i>michi</i> ?

66
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:06,833
Where is the righteousness
in all this destruction?

67
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,166
[gunfire]

68
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,750
[KANAE]
I don't understand.

69
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,916
What is it in human nature
that makes us kill each other?

70
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,583
[KANAE] We say life is sacred,
but we don't act that way.

71
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:51,875
[KANAE] All I learned
is lost in the chaos of war.

72
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,333
[KANAE]
If we all disappeared tomorrow,

73
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,833
maybe the Earth
would be better off.

74
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,166
All right. That's your last one.

75
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,583
[KANAE]
You're not my dad.

76
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,791
This stupid world doesn't
make sense anyway.

77
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,666
Hypocrites.

78
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,250
People talk about doing
good and being good.

79
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,250
Ya know what makes
the world go 'round?

80
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,875
It ain't good, it's "evil." 

81
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,458
Spend your life
fighting for peace.

82
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,583
Just to find you
changed nuthin'.

83
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,416
We free some country
from tyranny,

84
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,375
and the new leaders are
worse than the old ones.

85
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,625
If ya ask me,

86
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,166
I'm not getting sent out
there to bring peace,

87
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,083
but to create
even more chaos

88
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,666
for the big fish to
take advantage of.

89
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,166
They say fish won't swim

90
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,791
in water that's too
clean, don't they?

91
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,208
[BARTENDER]
It's healthier for them

92
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,541
if the water still has a
little bit of the wild in it.

93
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,875
Ours isn't an easy world
for the honest person

94
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,333
to build a life in, is it?

95
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,583
[KANAE laughs]

96
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,291
I love alcohol!

97
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,000
As long as I'm drunk.

98
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,083
I don't gotta worry 'bout
nothing except not throwing up!

99
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,875
Ya know.

100
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,833
Maybe the bartender was right.

101
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,375
I'm fast!

102
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,375
This kicks ass!

103
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,083
If you can't walk on two legs,
try running on four!

104
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,500
Ow-wee!

105
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,250
[laughs]

106
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,666
[KANAE] I gave myself
to the booze and the blood,

107
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,291
and it was only when
I was swimming in the two,

108
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,625
that I could forget
everything else.

109
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,000
[KANAE] They kept showering me
with more praise and honors.

110
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,916
I'm pretty sure I won more
awards fighting drunk

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,083
than I ever did sober.

112
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,666
[KANAE]
What was that for?

113
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,291
Is this how you have honored
your commitment to <i>michi</i> ?

114
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,875
[KANAE]
" <i>Michi</i> "?

115
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,291
I mean, really,
what's that even mean?

116
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,583
Yeah.

117
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,666
I said <i>bu</i> -bye
that stuff's too deep.

118
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,250
Emptyin' out my head made
everything way easier for me.

119
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,958
And all the brass
are getting their wins

120
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,541
and they're happy, so...

121
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,375
The fighting you're
doing is no longer " <i>bu</i> "!

122
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,583
You've become nothing
but a drunken beast!

123
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,291
[KANAE laughs]
Dad.

124
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,333
Man's the most savage
beast of 'em all.

125
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,625
Go away.

126
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,166
Never darken my doorway again.

127
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,875
[KANAE]
Yeah, fine!

128
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,291
I was done with
your stupid dojo anyway!

129
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,833
[KANAE] I don't wanna see
the bottom of that glass again!

130
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,458
I'm sorry to say,

131
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,583
you don't seem like
the girl I remember.

132
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,375
You got that right.

133
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,583
Whoda thought my life was
gonna turn out the way it has.

134
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,958
Is that what you wanted to hear?

135
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,583
[KANAE] I forget what
it means to show effort.

136
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,333
To be diligent.

137
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,875
Perseverance?

138
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,750
I can't even spell it for ya.

139
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,375
[laughs]

140
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,000
But none of that matters,
'cause the way I am now...

141
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,291
Nothing's gonna stop me.

142
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,416
[KANAE]
Nothing's gonna stop me.

143
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,250
Nothing's gonna stop me.

144
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,458
[KANAE] I couldn't read
people's expressions, anymore.

145
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,791
So I stopped looking
at their faces.

146
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,208
I couldn't remember
my allies' names, anymore.

147
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,375
So, I started fighting alone.

148
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,833
I forgot how to read a map.

149
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,000
But nothing could stop me.

150
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,208
Nothing could stop me.

151
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,333
That was just the start.

152
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,291
Soon, I could barely
read big words.

153
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:34,125
And outside of some basic crap,
math became a blur.

154
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,041
But still,
nothing could stop me.

155
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,666
I couldn't tell ya what day
of the week it was.

156
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,666
Remembering my own birthday was
enough to give me a headache.

157
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,125
All I could do was
keep moving forward.

158
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,708
And still...

159
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,333
Nothing could stop me.

160
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,583
[KANAE]
Finally, it got to the point...

161
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:04,875
...where I didn't even care
if I was alive or dead anymore.

162
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:12,083
There was nothing, and no one...
who could stop me.

163
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,875
[EIJI]
Hmm...

164
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,875
If the Necromantist brings
all his forces against us.

165
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,208
Then I suspect
our remaining time

166
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,500
in this Juni Taisen
is very limited.

167
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,250
Therefore, we have
to move against him now,

168
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,250
before the rest of his
reinforcements have assembled.

169
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,833
If you have an attack plan,
Tiger, I'm all ears.

170
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,791
Failing that, any as of yet
unseen special power of yours

171
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,375
would be quite welcome
right about now.

172
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,333
Perhaps something
like the ability to fly

173
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,083
or tunnel underground
at superspeed.

174
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,958
Sorry, Oxy Boy,
all I gots is my Drunken Fist.

175
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,666
I didn't come into this thing
expecting to fight zombies.

176
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,208
Let alone zombie body parts.

177
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,166
[EIJI]
Hmph. Fair point.

178
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,416
I can't blame you
for thinking that.

179
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,916
Never expected zombies either.

180
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,291
We need to approach
this, strategically.

181
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,583
I'd prefer a head-on fight,

182
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:10,291
but some kind of gambit
might just even the odds.

183
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,708
Tiger, look at the torso
hovering in the air.

184
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,708
Do you know what chemical is
inside that tank on its back?

185
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,708
Aww, jeez, I don't know.

186
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,875
You tryna say that it's not
the same flamethrower juice

187
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,291
that his dopey
brother was wearing?

188
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,333
[EIJI]
Indeed.

189
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,833
The Snake's backpack
was the fire.

190
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,166
I think this one is the ice.

191
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,208
I'd lay a wager,
it's liquid hydrogen.

192
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,708
[KANAE]
Oh.

193
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,500
Uh, liquid-what-now?

194
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,125
Wait. Are you serious? It's--

195
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,666
Even a small snake
can eat a man.

196
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,041
The Dragon!

197
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,125
The Elder Tatsumi Brother.

198
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,500
Killing for money.

199
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,083
And I'm the Snake.

200
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,791
The younger Tatsumi brother,
also killing for money.

201
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,166
A lot!

202
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,000
[EIJI] That's what we'd
be hearing, if they'd lived.

203
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,875
Ushii.

204
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,250
Killing systematically. The Ox.

205
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,000
[KANAE]
Hmm?

206
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,375
Tiger warrior!

207
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,416
Killing in a drunken rage!

208
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,750
Tora!

209
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,208
[KANAE]
Aww, jeez, I don't know.

210
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,125
You tryin to say that it's not
the same flamethrower juice

211
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,625
that his dopey
brother was wearing?

212
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,666
[EIJI]
Indeed.

213
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,208
The Snake's backpack
was the fire.

214
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,458
I think this one is the ice.

215
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,500
I'd lay a wager,
it's liquid hydrogen.

216
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,791
I got it. That's what he
wants me to do with the tank!

217
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,833
A hell of a fine weapon
you're wearin' pal!

218
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,166
Gotta wonder.

219
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,333
What's the big reason
ya got fur not usin' it?!

220
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,458
[EIJI]
I see you got my message.

221
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,166
Although, I'd prefer
you'd've warned me

222
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,541
before opening that
tank above my head.

223
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,291
You gotta communicate
better, ya'know that?!

224
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,458
It took all of my brains to
figure out what you wanted me

225
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,083
to do with that tank.

226
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,708
[EIJI]
Despite being corpses,

227
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,708
their eyes still display
a flicker of awareness.

228
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,541
Had I explained how
I wanted to use that tank,

229
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,750
they may have overheard
and reacted accordingly.

230
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,166
This kind of gambit's
not my forte.

231
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,875
Trying new things
isn't always easy.

232
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,583
But it all worked out.

233
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,458
[KANAE] Let's not slap each
other's asses just yet,

234
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,791
Fancy Pants.

235
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,125
If things had really ended well,

236
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,875
you'd be crushed ice
right there along with 'em!

237
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,041
[EIJI]
Oh, my.

238
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,125
You seem so certain of that.

239
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,708
Still, I am a man of my word.

240
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,166
I shall honor
my promise to a duel.

241
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,166
However, it would appear
our alliance-of-necessity

242
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,041
will have to continue
just a bit longer.

243
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,083
You know why, don't you?

244
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:22,916
[KANAE]
No, duh.

245
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,458
I know Rabbit's here.

246
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,208
That old sheep geezer did a
better job sneakin' up on me!

247
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:28,916
Hey.

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
Get out here and fight!

249
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,333
Jack ass!

250
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,458
[EIJI]
The tables have turned

251
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,708
and now it's you
who is outnumbered.

252
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,833
But it's only fair,
considering how many you

253
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,333
and your "team"
have disposed of.

254
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,041
Warrior of the Rabbit.

255
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,625
Killing psychotically.

256
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,666
Usagi.

257
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,125
Killing systematically.

258
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,458
Ushii.

259
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,166
The Ox.

260
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,541
Warrior of the Tiger!

261
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,583
Killing in a drunken rage!

262
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,250
Tora!

263
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,041
[EIJI]
Now, then.

264
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,416
Would you like to rest
before we do this?

265
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,166
Or shall we start?

266
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,291
[KANAE] Spare me the "chivalrous
gentleman" routine, Ox.

267
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:43,083
I got a good buzz goin from
all the blood I been drinkin.

268
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,833
So...

269
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm ready when you are, stud!

270
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,708
Just know nothing's
gonna stop me.

271
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,958
[EIJI]
Hmph.

272
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,208
Very well.

273
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:58,000
Consider our alliance
officially dissolved.

274
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,666
I challenge you to a duel.

275
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,958
[DUO]
They say,

276
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,208
"One can't catch a tiger
without entering its den."

277
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,750
You may still end up eaten,

278
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,541
but you won't know
for sure 'til you're inside.

279
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,083
Next time: "A Tiger May Die,
but It Leaves Its Skin."

280
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,958
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
