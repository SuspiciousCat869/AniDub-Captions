Consider our alliance
officially dissolved.

Are you injured, miss?

00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,333
Can you hear me?

00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,958
Do I smell...?

They forced you to drink.

Those animals.

00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,291
They are a disgrace.

15
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,000
They don't even deserve
to be called warriors.

16

You can rest easy now.

There's no need to worry.

this to you are gone.

[KANAE]
"Miss"?

What, does this guy think
I'm a civilian or somethin.

Where's Mr Matador

If you got a sec, can I
ask you a quick question?

26
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,041
[EIJI]
Of course.

27
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,750
Okay, okay, so you're
clearly somebody

28
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,125
who does the right thing,
but like, how do you do it?

29
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,708
Without hesitation.

30
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,916
Without fear.

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,916
Without making mistakes.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,208
Is that possible?

33
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,791
Just do the right thing?

34
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,458
[EIJI]
Hmph. You know,

35
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,041
I've never really given
it much consideration before.

36
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,375
Why do you ask?

37
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you desire to do
the right thing, is that it?

38
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,083
Well, then for your sake, I'll
give it some thought right now.

39
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,541
It can be beneficial to express
one's motivation verbally,

40
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,041
from time to time, at least.

41
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:14,083
First, step one, I want
to do the right thing.

42
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,500
Then, I do the right thing.

43
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,416
That's it.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,041
[KANAE] What kinda circular
mumbo jumbo is that?

dumb it down for me

'cause he thinks
that I'm just a child?

47
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,416
Well, screw him.

48
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,750
I mean, if it were that simple,
I wouldn't be suffering so much.

49
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait.

50
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,375
Am I still suffering?

51
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:54,000
oh... Here, I thought I'd
left the pain behind, but...

52
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,333
Does this mean
I haven't drowned it all out?

53
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:01,708
That I've actually been
suffering this whole damn time?

54
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,458
[EIJI]
What I mean by that is,

55
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,958
it's impossible for you
to do the right thing--

56
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:10,125
unless you make
a conscious effort.

57
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,750
People do wrong in
the most offhanded ways.

58
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,458
Just swept along,
they fall into evil.

59
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,791
Without purpose,
without deliberation,

60
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,875
without any thought at all.

61
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,333
Then just like that,

62
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,708
they're on the wrong path
as if there were no choice.

63
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,125
" <i>Michi</i> ."

64
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,875
[EIJI] By contrast no one
ever says something like,

65
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,791
"Without realizing it, I was
just doing the right thing."

66
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,041
Or how about,

67
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,375
"The next thing I knew
I was doing good deeds."

68
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,875
Or perhaps,

69
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,125
"I helped someone
by mistake. Oopsie."

70
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,083
You never hear that.

71
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,708
And you never will.

72
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,500
Without intent,
there's no righteousness.

73
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,833
There can't be,

74
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,500
because righteous action
requires righteous intent.

75
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,791
You can't do the right thing

76
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,125
unless you set
your mind to do it.

77
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,000
If your inability
to do the right thing

78
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,041
is causing you
to suffer right now,

79
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,125
that's likely because
you're aware of the fact

80
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,875
that you're not trying to do it.

81
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:12,125
There are many reasons why
one may not try to do good.

82
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:16,541
A myriad of fears which
might inspire hesitation.

83
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,875
You can blame it on another
person or on society as a whole.

84
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:25,041
You can blame the age we live
in, or the cards you were dealt.

85
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,125
But hear me, those who are
not doing the right thing,

86
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,708
must admit to themselves,
it's not that they cannot do it,

87
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,125
but that they will not do it.

88
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,583
And you...

89
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,666
You need not force yourself
to do what is right,

90
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,708
but don't fool yourself into
thinking your failure to do so

91
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,083
is because you're unable

92
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,958
but because you've made
the choice not to even try.

93
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:51,666
All righteous people
decide to do right.

94
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,208
And then, they do it.

95
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,750
[EIJI] The steps must be
taken in that order.

96

Worrying about the second step
while you're still on the first,

97
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,666
is the height of calamity.

the difference between us

was like the difference
between an adult and a child.

advice, did what he said to do.

I'm still not feeling too well.

109
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,333
I'm afraid I can't
oblige your request.

110

There are many more
children just like you

112
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,375
I must go.

113

But in the future,

114

be sure to stay far
away from battlefields.

115

I pray you never have to witness
killing or witness a slaughter.

116
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Like the sort I've
inflicted, ever again.

117
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,458
[KANAE] The two of
us were both warriors,

118
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,666
and yet, we were so different.

119
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,250
I started to think that
maybe only people like him

120
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,333
had the right to be called that.

121
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,291
A warrior.

122
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:28,083
But weirdly,
it didn't bother me that much.

123
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,458
Instead, for the
first time in my life,

124
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,958
I felt like I had a goal.

125
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,625
It wasn't like when I had
blindly tried to follow my path

126
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,541
or when I had strayed from it

127
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,833
I wanted to become the
kinda person that warrior

128
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:48,041
would acknowledge as a peer
the next time he and I met.

129
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,583
He said,"Be sure to stay
far away from battlefields."

130
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,458
Yeah. I ignored that part.

131
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,625
[KANAE]
Step one, want to do it.

132
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,875
Step two, do it.

133
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,208
I might never really
know the right thing to do

134
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:11,458
or figure out a
good reason to fight.

135
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,750
But what mattered was that
I decided to open my eyes.

136
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,333
I decided to try
and find myself again.

137
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:24,291
I decided to reexamine things
I had stopped thinking about.

138
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,125
All my life nothing
could stop me.

139
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,791
But now, a towering
wall was in my way.

140
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,791
A teacher I wanted to impress.

141
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,375
Wasn't long before I learned
that the one who'd pushed me

142
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,291
was none other than
the Natural-Born Slayer,

143
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,500
the Warrior of the Ox.

144
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,541
After that,
it didn't take much effort

145
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,250
for me to find out that
his name was Ushii.

146
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,208
But it's a wide world out there,

147
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,625
and there are
countless battlefields.

148
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,625
For a long time, I clung to the
belief that if I kept fighting,

149
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,458
our paths would
cross again someday.

150
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,250
And then, just when I was about

151
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,208
to give up hope of
that ever happening.

came back he would--

160
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,500
[laughs]

161
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,041
You're kidding me, right?

162
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,666
Like I really care
about that stuff now.

163
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,666
I got no interest in
some make-believe war

164
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,833
between the twelve families.

165
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,583
Twelve families?

166
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,583
Huh?

167
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,375
[KANAE]
The Ox.

168
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,375
What is it?

169
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,708
[KANAE] I went crawling
back to my estranged father,

170
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,208
got down on my hands
and knees and begged.

171
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,125
By some miracle, I got the
old man to nominate me.

172
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,250
I got to that observation deck,
and there he was.

173
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,541
Looking just like
he had back then.

174
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,541
I was thrilled beyond belief.

175
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,541
[KANAE]
But the warrior of the Ox.

176
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,208
That callous idiot...

177
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,833
...didn't evn recognize me!

178
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,583
He didn't remember me at all!

179
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,166
[gasps]

180
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,750
[EIJI]
Tora!

181
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,291
[KANAE]
Damn.

182
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:45,625
After everything
I did to get this far.

183
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,000
After I'd gotten the man
who'd inspired me

184
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,500
to challenge me to a duel.

185
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,625
[coughs]

186
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,125
Guess I'm just cursed.

187
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,500
Nothing in my life ever
goes the right way, does it?

188
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,875
A brilliant fighter like him

189
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,625
coulda easily handled
that attack himself

190
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:12,000
without a pathetic fool
like me getting in the way.

191
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,666
[EIJI]
Tora.

192
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,208
[KANAE]
But still, I...

193
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:21,791
I made the decision to do it.

194
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,791
Tora!

195
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,833
[EIJI]
This won't end.

196
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,791
I'm sorry, but you'll have
to hold on a little longer.

197
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,791
Don't worry,
I won't let you die.

198
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,791
[KANAE]
Look.

199
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,250
He's carrying me
on his back again.

200
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,083
In all my years, I've never
been saved by anyone before.

201
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,041
I swear, I will repay
this debt I now owe you!

202
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,000
[KANAE]
You blabbering fool.

203
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,958
I'm the one who
was repaying a debt.

204
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,958
You're so dense.

205
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,708
I see. That explains it.

206
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,666
[KANAE]
Explains what?

207
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,083
[EIJI]
It was clearly the Rabbit

208
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,916
who was controlling the
Dragon and Snake earlier.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,666
He must have been
trying to ambush us,

210
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,416
so he could add us
to his ranks as well.

211
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,583
[KANAE] But we chopped
him up into little pieces.

212
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,916
[EIJI]
Yes.

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
Though there's still one
thing I don't understand.

214
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:13,333
He wouldn't show up in front
of us without any kind of plan.

215
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,250
Did you happen to notice
he did something right

216
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,708
before we sliced him apart?

217
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,541
My theory is that he
bit off his own tongue,

218
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,125
thus turning
himself into a corpse

219
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,333
that he could
control after death.

220
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,416
[KANAE]
No more.

221
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,916
[EIJI]
Huh?

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,583
[KANAE]
Please, no more talking

223
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:38,791
about that mangled,
freaky-ass bunny.

224
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
[KANAE]
Lemme down.

225
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,500
[EIJI] But the Warrior of the
Rabbit is still pursuing us.

226
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,791
Stopping now to face him in your
condition would be too risky.

227
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,708
[KANAE]
Just do it, okay.

228
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,875
The bleeding ain't gonna stop

229
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,791
if you keep bouncin me
around like this.

230
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,125
[EIJI]
All right.

231
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,125
We'll stop the bleeding first.

232
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,958
We should be
far enough away now.

233
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,083
It'll take him some
time to catch up.

234
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,625
[KANAE]
Not usually a big fan

235
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:26,083
of havin' someone gawking
at my open wounds like this.

236
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,916
You're bleeding out, Tora.

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,166
You were stabbed
through the abdomen.

238
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,875
That requires significant
medical care.

239
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,416
Fortunately, I believe there
are numerous hospitals

240
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,083
in this particular ghost town.

241
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:42,666
So I guess you're gonna
find one, then carry me there,

242
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,875
and fix me up,
all before I croak?

243
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:53,000
You really believe
I got time for that?

244
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,333
No way, man.

245
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,083
No way. No chance.

246
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,500
You mustn't give up!

247
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,375
If you surrender now,
then what will become

248
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,791
of the duel I've already
challenged you to?

249
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,875
[KANAE] It's easy for
a saint like him to spew

250
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:11,875
that kinda nonsense when he's
never suffered pain like this

251
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,541
in his whole perfect life.

252
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,208
Besides, even if he could

253
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,208
miraculously do
all that in time.

254
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:25,458
I'd still be in no
condition to fight.

255
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,166
We couldn't have our duel.

256
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,041
So...

257
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,666
What's the point?

258
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,791
Hey.

259
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,541
Mr. Warrior of the Ox.

260
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm callin off our duel. OK?

261
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,166
[EIJI]
Tora.

262
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,125
[KANAE] But in exchange
for that I wanna ask you

263
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,791
for kind of a favor.

264
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,041
[EIJI]
A favor?

265
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,541
[KANAE] Or you could call
it more of a dying wish.

266
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,083
I guess.

267
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,666
Yeah, that's better.

268
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,666
I have one wish to ask of you.

269
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,041
[KANAE] A more girly-girl
type'd probably be asking him

270
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:10,583
for a romantic kiss
at a moment like this.

271
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,125
But that's never really
been my style, so...

272
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,541
I want you to be
the one to kill me.

273
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:34,958
Cuz if I... just bleed
to death like this,

274
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,541
it'll mean that...

275
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,916
...I was killed

276
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,833
by that demented little
Rabbit creepazoid, won't it?

277
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,708
It'll have been his
blade that killed me.

278
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,750
So then, what?

279
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,791
I become another one of
his walking dead marionettes?

280
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,916
Huh?

281
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,625
I don't know exactly how

282
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,958
all that Necromantist
mumbo-jumbo works, but...

283
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,666
...I know I want no part of it,

284
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,208
and I know I don't
wanna keep fighting you

285
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,125
even after I'm dead.

286
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,500
[KANAE] The moment you
challenged me to a duel,

287
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,500
made all the fighting I had
to do to get here worth it.

288
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,500
[KANAE]
So I want you to be the one

289
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,750
who brings an
end to all of this.

290
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,166
And hey, isn't it better
for you if I don't come back

291
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:37,000
as a merciless zombie,
hell-bent on slaughtering you?

292
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,000
I wanna leave no regrets behind.

293
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,291
I want you to use
your incredible power

294
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,958
to kill me systematically,

295
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,375
Natural-Born Slayer.

296
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,833
[EIJI]
Very well.

297
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:04,833
However, let this be
a duel to the death.

298
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,791
You shall die with dignity.

299
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,000
Now let's do this right.

300
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,541
State your name.

301
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:18,541
[KANAE] Wow, asking a lot
of a dying woman, aren't ya?

302
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,125
And so formal.

303
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:26,583
Or it's just the
right thing to do.

304
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,666
Man, this is perfect.

305
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,708
Getting to die in
a duel with the Slayer.

306
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,833
Maybe a little too perfect

307
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,958
for a good-for-nothing
like me.

308
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,458
Yeah, that's for sure.

309
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,416
I slipped up
somewhere along the way,

310
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,041
and things got really
muddled there for a while.

311
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:55,416
But in the end, I'd say my
life wrapped up pretty nicely.

312
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,708
[KANAE] Think I'm gettin'
drunk on the moment here.

313
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,333
[EIJI]
Tora.

314
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,750
Before this is ended,
would you please tell me

315
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,333
why you were holding a
grudge against me?

316
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,708
Did we perhaps meet on some
battlefield once upon a time?

317
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:23,791
I don't have any grudge against
you, not at all, how could I?

318
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,500
This is the first time
we've ever met.

319
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,291
You just reminded me of someone.

320
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,916
Don't worry about it.
That's all that it was.

321
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,041
Killin' in a drunken rage.

322
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,666
The Warrior of the Tiger.

323
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,583
Tora.

324
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,416
And the Ox.

325
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,333
Killing systematically.

326
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,291
Ushii.

327
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,583
[DUO] They say,
"Only a fool plays a harp

328
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,583
to stop a raging bull."

329
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,000
But might there be a song

330
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,041
that plucks at the heartstrings
of a music-loving bull?

331
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,333
Next time: "To Treat a Man
to Beef From His Own Cow."

332
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,958
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
