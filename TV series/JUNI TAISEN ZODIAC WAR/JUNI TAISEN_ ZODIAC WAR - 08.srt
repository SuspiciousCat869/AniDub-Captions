1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,375
[JUDGE A]
Court is in now session!

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:14,916
This is a
Warrior Misconduct Hearing

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,875
for the Tatsumi Brothers.

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,625
Accused are present.

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,000
Counselor.

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,166
The prosecution may begin.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,416
Thank you, Your Honor,
guests of the court.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,625
The Tatsumi Brothers
defy warrior standards.

9
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,958
Their actions are routinely
selfish and anti-social.

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,750
And given the
most recent incident,

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,875
the prosecution hereby
requests that Nagayuki

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,000
and Takeyasu Tsumita
be formally censured.

13
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,625
[NAGA]
He already fried Horse.

14
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,041
And now he's strangling Ox
and Tiger at the same time.

15
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,916
Even when he was alive
and in one piece,

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,083
there's no way he
could've killed like that.

17
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,416
[NAGA] But maybe I'm
getting ahead of myself.

18
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,166
I don't think Ox and
Tiger'll go down that easily.

19
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,250
So let's see...

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,875
If that's the state of the game,
then what's my next move?

21
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
[LAWYER] Let the record show,
that the defendants,

22
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,958
Takeyasu Tsumita
and Nagayuki Tsumita,

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,083
each worked for rival clients
in a foreign conflict.

24
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:53,166
This "playing of both sides"
was nothing short of disastrous.

25
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,958
Resulting in an
immense loss of life.

26
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,458
These craven actions have
damaged the prestige

27
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,791
of the Twelve Houses

28
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,500
and their standing in the
international community.

29
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,625
I see.

30
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,791
We will now begin
the question phase.

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,958
The defendant originally stated
he'd serve as his own counsel,

32
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,250
is that still true?

33
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
Yep.

34
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,208
Before we start, if both
Tatusmi brothers are on trial,

35
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,000
then why is only one
Tatsumi brother

36
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,750
standing in my courtroom?

37
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,166
Uh... My little brother's
stomach is acting up bad.

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,541
He didn't want
to be a distraction,

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,916
so he thought
it best to stay home.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,250
Don't lie to me.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,166
[NAGA] Your Honor, this is
a chronic condition for him.

42
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,708
He humbly asks the
court's understanding.

43
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,416
And because he can't be here,

44
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,333
I'll also be serving as
his defense attorney.

45
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,916
Very well.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,541
The elder Tatsumi will serve as
proxy for his younger brother.

47
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,791
This will be in conjunction

48
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,000
with his duties as defense
counsel for both.

49
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,291
[NAGA]
'Can't believe he bailed on me.

50
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,458
[JUDGE A]
Prosecutor, you may proceed.

51
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,875
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,083
Your Honors,

53
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,250
the incident in question
began one year ago.

54
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,250
[screaming]

55
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,916
[MAN B]
Sir, watch out!

56
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,666
[CHIEF] Side effects
from our newest drug.

57
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,416
All part of the process.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,666
Is zat right?

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,416
You said we were done
with this kinda thing!

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,750
Hmph! We are.

61
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,666
But drug testing can
be a tricky business.

62
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,708
Yeah.

63
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,250
Let me show you
our long-term care.

64
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,875
[BOY A]
Doctor!

65
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Is my little brother ever
gonna get better, sir?

66
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,041
[DOCTOR]
Don't worry.

67
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,500
Your brother will
be taken care of.

68
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,625
But this remains a very
complicated ailment,

69
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,833
so it'll take time and money.

70
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,791
[BOY A]
I'll get the money!

71
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,583
I swear!

72
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,916
I'll do whatever it takes.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,291
Just give it time,
I'll get better on my own.

74
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,166
If you keep running...

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,000
Unfortunate side effect.

76
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,500
Drug-induced
temporary blindness.

77
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,166
Of course, they don't
need to know about that.

78
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,458
How interesting.

79
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,583
[MAN C]
Chief.

80
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,791
Your visitors have arrived, sir.

81
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,875
Right on time.

82
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,125
Have them wait
in my office for now.

83
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,125
I'll join them, shortly.

84
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,500
So yesterday,
I was in this back alley.

85
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,500
Stay here, I don't
need you for this one.

86
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,166
Sure.

87
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,083
[phone ringing]

88
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,291
Hey, question.

89
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,333
[NAGA]
Yeah.

90
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,041
What's the status on the money?

91
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,833
Do the pharma guys
have it ready?

92
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,541
[NAGA]
Yeah, enough to show.

93
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,791
But, here.

94
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,250
Look.

95
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,458
The bulk of it's just biding
its time in that vault.

96
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,333
[TAKE]
Biometric entry.

97
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,041
[NAGA]
We'll figure that out.

98
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,208
[CHIEF]
Excellent.

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,125
We're still on for tomorrow,
as scheduled

100
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,791
[BOSS]
As scheduled.

101
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,666
Though, I heard something
that's got me wondering.

102
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,916
[CHIEF]
What's that?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,208
A little birdie tells me
you might wanna get out

104
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,333
of our little arrangement.

105
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,958
Your birdie is lying.

106
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,375
[TAKE]
I'll be honest:

107
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,750
Neither of these guys'
actions make much sense to me.

108
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,041
Why do they even
need two guys like us?

109
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,625
This seems to be
just your average

110
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,416
run-of-the-mill
business deal, right?

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,791
[NAGA]
Well, it's a lot of money,

112
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,625
and neither side
trusts the other.

113
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,458
Happens all the time.

114
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,000
[TAKE] Nah, there's gotta
be more to it than that.

115
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,666
Then lemme lay it out for ya.

116
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,583
The pharma boys test their
drugs on orphans supplied

117
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,583
by the organization
you currently work for.

118
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,666
[TAKE]
Disgusting.

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,125
On the surface,
they're a kids' charity.

120
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,291
They run shelters,
clinics, stuff like that.

121
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,208
But they make their real
money in human trafficking.

122
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,750
Too bad for them,

123
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,708
the pharma company's almost
done testing their latest drug.

124
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,750
So your guys won't need
what my guys are selling

125
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,000
for much longer, huh?

126
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,500
But what happened
to all those side effects?

127
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,500
They've almost got
em all ironed out.

128
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,416
And once they say it's
good enough for market,

129
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,416
they're gonna terminate their
relationship with your guys.

130
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,416
In turn, your client wants
mine to keep paying,

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,333
or they'll leak the
testing to the press.

132
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,458
Hah!

133
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,458
One more thing.

134
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,958
If our transaction
was made public,

135
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,666
it's your company
that suffers most.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,583
Try not to forget that.

137
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,583
Threaten all you like, friend.

138
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,916
You're not the only one
with leverage here.

139
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,291
[TAKE] So, tomorrow's
the final exchange

140
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,333
between our two employers.

141
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,291
Yeah.

142
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,416
Then we make our move.

143
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,833
[BOSS] Whaddaya mean you're
ending our partnership?!

144
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,500
It's just what it sounds like!

145
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,958
We got what we wanted from
you and now we're finished!

146
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,458
[BOSS]
Oh, you got that right!

147
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,958
And here's the one to finish it.

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,208
[CHIEF]
Call in our guy!

149
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,250
Hey!

150
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,583
Hello!

151
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,666
What? Your guy and my guy are...

152
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,166
Wait, are you two brothers?

153
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,791
Crazy, am I right?

154
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,708
Let's get it on, brother!

155
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,166
Hey. Hey. No, not yet!

156
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,500
[CHIEF]
Hey, I didn't say attack!

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,416
Yeah! Yeah!

158
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,958
What? Afraid of fire?

159
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,750
[chuckles]

160
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,041
Hey! Don't follow me!

161
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,125
Who does that?

162
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,083
You tell me.

163
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
Who hires a psycho?

164
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
[CHIEF]
Apparently, you do!

165
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,791
The power's out!

166
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,125
Hi!

167
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,750
You can take him!

168
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:29,583
[CHIEF]
Close it!

169
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,333
[BOSS]
You close it!

170
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,000
[NAGA]
End of the line, boys.

171
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,041
Wait, please, don't hurt us!

172
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,333
[BOSS]
You lousy punks, you set us up!

173
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,958
[NAGA chuckles]
Of course!

174
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,291
I-I'll pay you!

175
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,458
How much?
Just name your price!

176
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,416
Whatever he says,
I'll double it!

177
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,916
No, wait, I'll...
I'll quintuple it!

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,750
Sound good?

179
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,000
That's four times more!

180
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,166
[laughter]

181
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,208
Naw.

182
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,791
I think we'll
just take all of it.

183
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,708
[TAKE]
Yes!

184
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,750
[laughs]

185
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,500
[NAGA]
What can we do next?

186
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,125
[LAWYER] The Tatsumi
brothers burned down

187
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,083
the pharmaceutical company's
research building.

188
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,083
They slaughtered dozens
of innocent people.

189
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,041
But not before
stealing millions.

190
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,000
Would counsel for the defense
like to make a rebuttal

191
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
for the record?

192
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,958
Nothing to say,
'cause warriors accept

193
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,625
that innocents will die
on the battlefield.

194
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,750
[LAWYER] Then do you also
accept the outrageous cost

195
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,000
of cleaning up after
your wanton destruction?!

196
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,125
Hey, now wait.

197
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,083
That was collateral damage!

198
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,458
Collateral damage?

199
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,833
Is that what you call
your dead clients?

200
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,041
Your Honors, they're murderers!

201
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,375
Not true.

202
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,666
I killed my brother's client
and he killed mine.

203
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,208
That's exactly what
we were hired for

204
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,041
and an example of
meeting warrior standards

205
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:03,750
No!

206
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
You are a team.

207
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,375
But this time you falsely
presented yourselves!

208
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,666
You were hired separately
under individual contracts.

209
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,875
The brothers clearly should have
executed separate missions!

210
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,333
Which wouldn't have
changed the result at all.

211
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,083
That's a lie!

212
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,458
[JUDGE A]
Order! Order!

213
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,916
The purpose of this hearing
is to evaluate whether

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,250
the Tatsumi brothers adhere
to normal warrior standards.

215
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,833
I've looked at these
materials submitted

216
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,208
by the brothers' family,
on their behalf.

217
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,375
The defendants in this case
have a complex record, indeed.

218
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,958
They once stole
treasure that had been

219
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,041
hoarded by a
brutal dictatorship

220
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,791
and redistributed them
to the oppressed citizens.

221
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,583
[NAGA] Though,
it ended up sparking a riot.

222
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,458
[JUDGE A] On another occasion,
they stole the entire take

223
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,583
from an high-end
underground casino,

224
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,875
and gave it to the children
of a nearby orphanage.

225
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,166
[NAGA]
And the orphanage director

226
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,791
ended up stealing it all.

227
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,916
[JUDGE A] And they once stole
millions from a corporation,

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,500
then spread it around to
the poorest areas of the city.

229
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,291
[NAGA] Though the company
killed most of those people

230
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,958
when they came
back to retrieve it.

231
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,750
And then there was
our latest job, at the docks.

232
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,541
What should
we do with this stuff?

233
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,458
It'd be a real waste if it
ends up back in crates.

234
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,625
Honestly, we just did our heists
to have fun and kill time.

235
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,333
[JUDGE B] The younger boy was
one of their guinea pigs.

236
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,416
The testing devastated his life.

237
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,333
Side effects from the drug
blinded him in both eyes.

238
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,166
The Tatsumi Brothers learned
of this boy's misfortune,

239
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,208
and thought long and hard
about the best way to help.

240
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,291
So they gave the boy a large
sum of the money they took

241
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,833
from the pharmaceutical
company operation.

242
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,333
Thank you.

243
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,041
[BOY A]
Huh?

244
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:48,666
[MAN E]
What's that?

245
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,958
What's...?

246
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,375
[MAN E]
Look!

247
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,250
[BOY A]
Money?

248
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,166
[BOY B]
What's goin on?

249
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,250
[BOY A]
It's raining money!

250
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,041
You're a sucky pilot,
ya know that?

251
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,000
[NAGA] Hey, I don't see
you flying, wise-ass!

252
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,750
I wonder if it's them.

253
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,083
I've heard stories about
a pair of brother thieves

254
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,833
who're like modern
day Robin Hoods.

255
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,750
They steal from the rich, and
then give it back to the poor.

256
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,458
Wow.

257
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,916
[JUDGE B] Any impartial hearing
of the Tatsumi brothers' conduct

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,875
must also take these
incidents into account.

259
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,791
[NAGA]
That one backfired, too.

260
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,208
[CLIENT]
We've been ordered to take out

261
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,250
anyone connected to the
incident with the pharma group.

262
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,833
You guys in or out?

263
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,916
Erase any remaining evidence of
their human guinea pig program?

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,041
Depends on the pay.

265
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,208
Take a look in
the case beside you.

266
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,625
We're in!

267
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,875
[BOY B]
I see you!

268
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,208
I'm glad.

269
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,708
You both worked hard for this.

270
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
Thank you, Doctor.

271
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,208
It's so bright.

272
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,916
Still blurry.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,125
It worked.

274
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,750
Welcome back.

275
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,666
Fire!

276
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,000
It's blocked!

277
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,916
Move!

278
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,125
[BOY B]
Hold on!

279
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,291
Help! Somebody!

280
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,083
My leg's trapped! Go!

281
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:47,958
Get outta here!

282
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,958
No way, I'm not leaving you!

283
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,666
[BOY A]
If you stay, we'll both die!

284
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,125
Go on! Go!

285
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,916
Go!

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,333
[BOY B]
No!

287
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:17,625
[TAKE laughs]

288
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,916
[MAN F]
Found one alive!

289
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,583
Huh?

290
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,916
What?

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,125
[TAKE]
Hey. Hey kid!

292
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,583
What are you doin out here?
You could get hurt!

293
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,375
I could ask you the exact
same question, mister.

294
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,250
I'm just out here
takin' a few pictures.

295
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,791
My brother died here.

296
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,791
We were both in the hospital,
and it burned to the ground

297
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,375
before he could get out.

298
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,541
Ah. Well, I hate to
pop your bubble kid,

299
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,708
but prayin's not
gonna bring him back.

300
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,458
That's a rude thing to say.

301
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:12,541
I know he's not coming back, but
praying makes me feel connected.

302
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,000
[TAKE]
Connected.

303
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,333
Ok, so you believe in God,
heaven, all that fun stuff?

304
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:21,291
Because if ya don't you're
just wasting a lot of energy.

305
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,875
Maybe.

306
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
I don't really know.

307
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,166
[TAKE] Heh. So, you're just
out here talking to yourself

308
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,041
like a crazy person?

309
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,416
If coming here makes me
feel better, why's it matter?

310
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,250
You're a pretty bad
man ya know that?

311
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,291
[laughs]

312
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,083
The world's full of bad men

313
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,583
with money who're
a lot worse than me!

314
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,375
That's where
you're wrong, mister.

315
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,458
I know for a fact there
are some rich men out there

316
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,916
who give their money away
to the people who need it most.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,541
[NAGA]
Yeah.

318
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,250
That my young friend is
truer you could ever know.

319
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,000
Here, this is for you.

320
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,708
Please accept our apologies
for killing your big brother.

321
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,583
[NAGA] But hey, you got your
vision back so that's something.

322
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,083
I'm sorry, but the good deeds

323
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,333
from those noble thieves
you believe in.

324
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,458
They mean nothing and
aren't worth one thin dime.

325
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,916
[LAWYER]
The whole thing's a con!

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,375
Giving to the poor.

327
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,666
They don't do it out of the
goodness of their hearts!

328
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,291
Objection!

329
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,000
Hurtful statement!

330
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,416
Defendant!

331
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,875
You will raise your hand
before you address this court!

332
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,500
Prosecutor, please continue.

333
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,875
They're amoral warriors
and follow no code at all!

334
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,625
It's a joke to them!

335
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,791
They steal, then give
away their ill-gotten gains

336
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,166
for their own amusement!

337
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,916
[JUDGE A]
Go ahead.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,208
Look.

339
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,708
We're part of one of
the Twelve Zodiac Houses.

340
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,833
The jobs we take involve us
in all sorts of criminal acts.

341
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,708
Are you really gonna judge us
by a typical standard?

342
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,708
Or just by your
personal standards?

343
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,083
I've seen kids kill their own
parents for food scraps.

344
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,791
This moral standard you
wanna apply to the two of us.

345
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,875
You can't apply it
to anyone out there.

346
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,083
Honey, I'm home!

347
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,333
[sniffs]

348
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,791
What's cooking?

349
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,041
Hey, you're back
sooner than I thought.

350
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,666
What are you doing?

351
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,125
Oh. Yeah, he died.

352
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,458
So, I'm havin myself
a little memorial.

353
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,375
What a nice way
to remember a friend.

354
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,916
I can't believe you blew off
our hearing for this.

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,041
You owe me an attorney's fee!

356
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,166
So, are you gonna blog that?

357
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,708
[TAKE]
What are you an idiot?

358
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,541
I'd freak out my fans.

359
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,708
A toast!

360
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,708
A fond farewell
to that little blind kid!

361
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,458
Is that thing any good?

362
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,125
Yeah, it's awesome.

363
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,291
What do ya think?

364
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,666
[NAGA] My little
brother is even weirder

365
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,791
than I gave him credit for.

366
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,708
When he's not killin for money,
he's blogging about reptiles.

367
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,291
And when he's not doing that,
he's eatin' 'em!

368
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,791
Oh, look what the
mailman brought today.

369
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,625
[TAKE]
Yep, we're going to "the show."

370
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,291
Nice.

371
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,291
[NAGA] I never thought
the day would come.

372
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,166
Now, our whole lives
lead to this,

373
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
and you're dead
before it even starts.

374
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,250
Stupid fool.

375
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,791
Still, even in death,

376
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,958
you've given me a chance
to win the whole thing.

377
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:55,000
[KANAE screams]

378
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,875
So fire will kill it.

379
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,208
And that answers
my other question as well.

380
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,791
I had wondered why we're
not fighting Horse, too.

381
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,625
Being burned to death
must've prevented Rabbit

382
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,375
from turning him into
one of his puppets.

383
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,916
That's how I'll defeat him.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,166
Fire.

385
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,416
It's the only permanent way

386
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,708
to be rid of his
re-animated friends.

387
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,375
[KANAE]
You stupid, son-of-a-bitch!

388
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,125
You're a dead man!

389
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,166
I'll kill you!

390
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,250
Bastard!

391
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,416
All you did was
piss me off more!

392
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,666
Right here! You and me!
Right now!

393
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,041
I'm glad you're
back on your feet

394
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,291
and with that chip on
your shoulder still intact.

395
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,791
I expect our duel later
to be quite lively.

396
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,083
But first...

397
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,083
Our mutual enemy is
proving troublesome.

398
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,083
Setting him on fire
wont be easy now

399
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,625
that we've burned up the fuel,
and chopping him up

400
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,708
will just put us right back into
the bind we were in before.

401
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,750
[NAGA] Those two are making this
way harder than it needs to be.

402
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,000
If they had all the information,

403
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,750
they'd know that my dead
brother's first priority

404
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,875
is following that rat brat.

405
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,375
He's only fighting Ox and Tiger

406
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,125
because Ox and Tiger
are fighting him.

407
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,250
Run away, guys,
and this fight's over!

408
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,125
Assuming Ox's honor
would even let him run away.

409
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,541
Man, would I love to see that

410
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,750
Oh, well.

411
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,083
It's time I made my move.

412
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,666
[chuckles]

413
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,750
I had given up on winning.

414
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,625
But now, with my reanimated bro

415
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,125
we'll have that Tatsumi Brother
teamwork, once more!

416
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,166
Not even death can sever
the bond between us.

417
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,958
How sweet.

418
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,583
Just looking out for
my little brother, that's all.

419
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,416
Why do you make it
so hard to love you?

420
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,416
[NAGA] I'm countin on you,
little brother.

421
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,875
Just keep em distracted for me.

422
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,458
And I will get you the
memorial that you deserve.

423
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,125
[DUO]
They say,

424
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,750
"only a fool hopes a stump
will kill a rabbit twice."

425
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,333
Though, if stumps
could hunt rabbits,

426
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,041
the fool's hope
would be rewarded.

427
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,541
Next time: "The Man Who Chases
Two Rabbits Catches Neither."

428
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,875
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
