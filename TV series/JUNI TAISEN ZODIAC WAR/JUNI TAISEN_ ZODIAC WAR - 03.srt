[RYOKA] The apartment.
The oldest memory I have.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,583
A dirty building in
an even dirtier neighborhood.

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,583
A room crawling
with the remains of life.

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,083
People had lived there
for a long time.

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,416
Trash piled high,
the air thick with rot.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,166
And the pain shooting
through my body.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,833
But most vividly,
I remember the cold steel

9
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,833
of the egg topper in my hand

10
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,291
and the warm liquid
on the floor.

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,916
By then, you couldn't recognize
their faces if you tried.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,250
But I'm pretty sure those bodies
were once my parents.

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,666
I couldn't remember how
I got there, or why I did it.

I couldn't remember anything

to spend more time with him

but it all worked out.

I didn't know anything

about anyone. Because I did
know all about you.

I knew you were a Poisoner.

Thanks again for
the power up, Dotsuku.

Now that I've got One-Man Army

[thud]

43
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,041
[RYOKA] I have a vague memory
of a hospital and doctors

doing lots of tests on me.

No memory, huh?

No, not of the incident itself.

47
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,041
And certainly not of
the years of physical abuse

48
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,041
that led up to her killing them.

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,250
Severe amnesia is my diagnosis.

50
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,166
Is her memory back?

51
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,583
[DOCTOR 3B]
No. The psychological shock of

52
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,458
what she's gone through is still
causing her to block it out.

Hm. That may make things easier.

Any change in her abilities?

00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,583
[DOCTOR 3B] None. Not only
can she control any type

of bird, she's able to exchange
visual information with them.

Then I've made
my decision on her fate.

The Niwa family
will take her in.

[RYOKA] Everything that
happened after I moved in

63
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,125
with the Niwa family,
I remember clearly.

64
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,125
They adopted me as
their daughter and began

65
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,708
training me as a warrior.
I learned everything

there is to know about
espionage and killing.

67

The Niwa family business is war.

68
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,250
They involve themselves
in conflicts around the world.

They wasted no time
putting me to work.

They gave me jobs
and I always delivered.

71
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,458
[RYOKA] Because I had
no memory of the past,

I had no dreams for the future.

No idea of what

00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,666
Go work up an appetite so
you're ready for the next one!

158
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,791
[distant clanging]

159
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,458
[YOSHIMI]
Ah!

160
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,583
[thud]

161
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:23,916
[EIJI] Ah, Ironclad.
Is that your ability?

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,875
Heh. Well, if you don't mind,

163
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,416
I'd like to test
the limits of that ability.

164
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,291
[YOSHIMI grunting]

165
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,583
[yells]

166
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,833
[RYOKA groans] Y'know,
if we weren't in the city,

167
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,250
I'd have a lot more birds
helping me out here.

168
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,416
--[gasps]
--[door bell ringing]

169
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,666
--[TSUGI] Hello, miss.
--[door bell ringing]

170
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,791
You don't have to point
your pitch fork at me.

171
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,541
I'm not here to fight you.

172
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,625
Wait. Of all the stores in town,

173
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,666
how'd you know
I was in this one?

174
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,750
[TSUGI] I didn't.
I came here for one reason

175
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,166
and one reason only.

176
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,458
Snacks.

177
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,375
Though I suppose I owe you
a proper greeting.

178
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,041
I'm Nezumi. Warrior of
the Rat, killing all.

179
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,500
Your turn.

180
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:20,041
[RYOKA] Uh, Niwatori. Ch--
Warrior of the Chicken.

181
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:24,166
[TSUGI]
Huh. Oh, yeah. I 'member.

182
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,458
You raised your hand
for the Monkey.

183
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,625
I did what?

184
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,750
Oh. You're right,
I certainly did.

185
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,708
[RYOKA] Of course my plan
was just to play along,

186
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,500
then kill you later.

187
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,583
What about it?

188
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,500
[gasps]

189
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,666
[TSUGI] Why don't you come
with me, Miss Chicken?

190
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
[RYOKA]
Huh?

191
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,333
Don't be scared. I'm just
taking you to see her.

192
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,875
[RYOKA] Is this a set up?
Maybe I should I kill him.

193
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,583
My birds can't see down here.

194
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,041
I don't know if I should be
going along with this.

195
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,250
It's a perfect hide out.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
[MISAKI]
Huh? Oh, good you're back!

197
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,083
And with a new friend?

198
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,083
[TSUGI]
Hm. I found her in the store.

199
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,000
[RYOKA]
He left his back wide open.

200
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,291
Has he forgotten why we're here?

201
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,375
Hey, there's no time to sleep!

202
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,541
I'm the one who hiked up there.

203
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,500
You got this. Night, Monkey.

204
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,458
Kid, you might be the weirdest
fighter in this thing.

205
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,750
Anyway. I'm sorry if
the Rat made you nervous.

206
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:42,458
No, he didn't at all.
I wasn't nervous. It's fine.

207
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,458
[RYOKA]
He looks so familiar.

208
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,083
I could swear I've
met him somewhere before.

209
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,958
Or maybe the poison's
got me imagining things.

210
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,333
[MISAKI] After my
little speech back there,

211
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,875
you raised your hand.

212
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,458
How much do you know about me?

213
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,375
About what I try to do?

214
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,958
Well, all I really know
is that you're the Monkey.

215
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,916
[MISAKI] Then allow me
to introduce myself.

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,291
I'm Sharyu. Killing
peacefully, the Monkey.

217
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm Niwatori. Killing
by pecking. The Chicken.

218
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,208
[RYOKA] Got the whole
thing out that time.

219
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,291
That's great!
So nice to meet you.

220
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,791
And thanks for accepting
my proposal back there.

221
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,916
I really believe we can make
this peaceful alliance work.

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,458
Uh, yeah.

223
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,416
[RYOKA] Wait, she was serious
about the cease fire thing?

224
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,666
I thought she was playing nice
to get teammates

225
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,333
for a typical
back-stabby alliance.

226
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,833
Naw, this pacifist thing
has to be fake.

227
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,750
No one invited to
the Juni Taisen

228
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,166
would ever seriously try it.

229
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,041
After nearly dying up there,
he just wants to hide down here.

230
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,708
I'd rather we
catch our breaths...

231
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,708
[RYOKA] Not surprised that
he's hiding in the sewers.

232
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,083
He is the Rat.

233
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,750
[MISAKI] I think the longer
we stay down here,

234
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,416
the lesser our chance
of finding the others

235
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,750
who raised their hands.

236
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,583
Although, I am
getting to meet you.

237
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes me
really happy, too. Yep!

238
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,875
[MISAKI] But just 'cause
we met up doesn't mean

239
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,333
we're sittin' tight.
I wanna find the others, ASAP.

240
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,333
[RYOKA]
Yeah, the others.

241
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,833
It's hard keeping
all these animals straight.

242
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,125
I know Rat and I
raised our hands.

243
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,666
Then so did Ox, Horse,
and Rabbit, I think.

244
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,583
But Rabbit seemed more
like he just wanted to

245
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,375
mess with her. She can't be
serious about finding him.

246
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,500
Heck, I wasn't really agreeing
to her proposal, either.

247
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,208
And I bet Horse and Ox were
doing exactly the same thing.

248
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:30,041
Even Rat boy's probably
working his own angle.

249
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,833
I could kill
both of them right now

250
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,625
without batting an eye. But.

251
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,875
[MISAKI] Niwatori. Have you
run into anyone else?

252
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,250
If so, what's it like
up there right now?

253
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,791
[RYOKA] Uh, well. A few
of them have been killed.

254
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,750
I know for a fact
that Boar and Dog are gone.

255
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
Oh, and Snake died
before the tournament began.

256
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,791
So that's at least...

257
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,708
[RYOKA] Why am I telling her
the truth about any of this!

258
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,916
[MISAKI] I see. Just like that,
two more warriors dead.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,208
Such a shame.

260
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,000
[RYOKA] "A shame"?
Are you kidding me?

261
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not just that Monkey's
too trusting, she's a fool!

262
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,375
It's impossible to win the Juni
Taisen without using violence.

263
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,875
To think otherwise
you'd have to be

264
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,000
completely detached
from reality!

265
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,875
[MISAKI] Zombies?
He does sound like trouble.

266
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,208
Have some.

267
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,333
--Oh, thank you.
--[MISAKI] Careful, it's hot.

268
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,333
Three warriors gone
out of twelve. That's 25%.

269
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,875
Can you still pull off your plan

270
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,333
with a big chunk
of us already dead?

271
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I think so.

272
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't share all
the details just yet,

273
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,958
but it shouldn't be a problem.

274
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,791
Pretty sweet.

275
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,583
Oh, did I use
too much sugar?

276
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,333
I always crave it
when I'm tired.

277
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,041
[RYOKA] What's wrong
with you, Niwatori?

278
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,958
What've we got here?

279
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,708
Japanese egg and rice? Uh huh.

280
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,875
After all that sugar in the tea,
this might be too many carbs.

281
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,375
Sorry, but I can't be
a part of your plan.

282
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,958
I think it's better
if I work alone.

283
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,750
Oh. Sorry to hear that.
But hey!

284
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,541
If you change your mind,
you're always welcome here.

285
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,291
You know where to find me.

286
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,000
Promise you won't give up.
Fight to the end.

287
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,541
Hold on, before you go,
why don't you eat with us?

288
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,500
I can't. But thanks
for the offer!

289
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,291
[RYOKA]
You stupid, dumb chicken!

290
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,791
Would it have killed you
to just play along?

291
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,625
What happened to all my
strength and cunning?

292
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,041
My ruthless trickery?

293
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,166
Damn. It's the Dog's poison!

294
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,000
One-Man Army. Yeah,
it's boosted my strength,

295
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,875
but it's also messed
with my emotions.

296
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,791
I've trained myself
to ignore things

297
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,125
like compassion and sincerity,

298
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,500
but now her kindness
is tearing me apart!

299
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,708
So stupid. Why be strong

300
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,291
if you can't control
your emotions anymore!

301
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,541
--[EIJI] All alone?
--[gasps]

302
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,458
[RYOKA]
Ox! Oh god, just my luck!

303
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,041
Answer the question:
Are you alone?

304
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,333
If you have any allies
hiding in the area,

305
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,166
I'd like to see them.

306
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,750
Though to be honest,
it doesn't really matter to me

307
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,000
how many of you there are.

308
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,416
[RYOKA]
He's already fought someone.

309
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,458
No. He's already killed someone.

310
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,208
Wait. Didn't you claim
to be a pacifist earlier?

311
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,125
No. You have me
confused with the Monkey.

312
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,416
[RYOKA] But when she proposed
a non-violent alliance,

313
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,875
you raised your hand.

314
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,541
[EIJI]
I did raise my hand.

315
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,625
Because I wanted
to be a part of a team.

316
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,708
As soon as the explosion
and our dispersal, however,

317
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,708
her peace proposal
was rendered moot.

318
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,666
[RYOKA] What do I do?
Even if I was ready for him,

319
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,208
facing the Natural-Born Slayer
in a straight-up fight

320
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,750
would be suicide.

321
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,208
My birds should
be hungry again soon.

322
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,333
If I run it will give me time
to come up with a plan.

323
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,875
Or I could play dumb,
earn his trust,

324
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,083
and get Ox to drop his guard.

325
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,666
Yeah, I like that.

326
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,708
One-Man Army is still
giving me incredible power.

327
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,541
He has no idea how strong I am.

328
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,041
[EIJI] Hm. The fact that
you bring up the Monkey

329
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,916
means she's on your mind.

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,625
In turn, that could mean

331
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,041
that the Monkey
is hiding very close by.

332
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,000
[RYOKA gasps]

333
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,458
[RYOKA]
What? No!

334
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,000
[EIJI]
Oh, my. Judging from that,

335
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,083
the Monkey's your new friend
and you're going to defend her.

336
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,458
Are we playing the
"If you want to get past me,

337
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,458
you'll have to kill me" routine?

338
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,166
Never pegged you
as the heroic type.

339
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,083
[RYOKA] He's right.
This is not who I am!

340
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,833
It's that damned drug.

341
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,500
One-Man Army is changing
my whole approach to battle.

342
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,750
I'd advise against this--
trying to defend her.

343
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,666
It won't make you stronger.

344
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,833
And the honor you're defending
isn't even your own.

345
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,250
It belongs to a person
you barely know.

346
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,750
When you fight, it should
be only for yourself.

347
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,458
[RYOKA]
You don't think I know that?

348
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
I know better than anyone!

349
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,041
I gotta get outta here.

350
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,625
I'll make like I'm gonna strike,

351
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,875
then I'll turn and run
as fast as I can.

352
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,333
Niwatori. Warrior of the
Chicken, killing by pecking!

353
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,625
Killing systematically.
Ushii. The Ox.

354
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,208
[RYOKA gasps]
I can win this!

355
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,833
[squelching]

356
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,333
[RYOKA] I spent years
mastering strategy, deception,

357
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,625
and my own special power.

358
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,708
Then someone comes along who's
immune to all those things

359
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,083
and wins in a second.

360
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,250
[EIJI]
Hm.

361
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,000
[birds cawing]

362
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,958
[RYOKA] Well, I guess
this is the end of me.

363
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:09,375
Could've been worse. At least
I died in a stand-up fight.

364
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,583
Heh. That's pretty good!

365
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,541
My friends. Thank you for
your help all those years.

366
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,166
By now, I bet
you must be starving.

367
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,708
Go ahead. Eat your fill.

368
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,625
[DUO] They say, "Even a monkey
can fall from a tree."

369
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,416
We can also say
that too much talent

370
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,416
can make a sage fall to earth.

371
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,583
Next time:
"The Enemy, a Noble Primate!"

372
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,916
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
