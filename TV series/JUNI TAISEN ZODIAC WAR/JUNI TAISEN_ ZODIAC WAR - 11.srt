1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,291
[EIJI]
Why is this affecting me so?

2
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,791
This isn't something new for me.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,333
I've put down
many a dying soldier.

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,083
It's the humane thing to do.
The honorable thing to do.

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,708
Maybe... it's because she
reminds me of a young girl

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:39,625
I once met in a
war zone, long ago.

7
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,291
Of course, comparing someone
as incredible as Tiger

8
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,916
to a lost little girl is
affront to her as a warrior.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,541
I don't partake in alcohol,
but if I had a drink in hand,

10
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,250
I'd raise it you,
"Warrior of the Tiger."

11
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,833
[EIJI]
Now then.

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,958
[EIJI]
Usagi, Warrior of the Rabbit.

13
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,291
He's so desperate to fight,

14
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,708
he continues even as
a dismembered corpse.

15
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,750
For the traditional warrior,

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,666
death at least brings with
it a promise of peace.

17
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,750
There's nothing traditional
about this Necromantist.

18
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,916
To enslave his own
body as he has?

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It defies the very
definition of sanity.

20
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,166
And while such actions
are phychotic,

21
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,666
the motivation behind
them may be rational.

22
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,000
It seems even in death,
he's still trying to win.

23
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,416
I doubt even the tournament
organizers expected him

24
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,791
to go to such lengths.

25
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,208
On the other hand, they knew
he possessed this power.

26
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,166
They may have accounted for it
as his advantage from the start.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,541
When I think of what I've
experienced in the Juni Taisen,

28
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,666
every warrior possessed at least
some kind of power or skill

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,291
they could use to bend the
tournament in their favor.

30
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,208
I have no such advantage.
Only my skills with the sword.

31
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,750
But perhaps I should
consider meeting the Tiger

32
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,750
to be my advantage.

33
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,416
If not for our alliance
of necessity...

34
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,166
If not for her taking
that stab wound,

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,000
I would currently be among
the living dead myself.

36
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,958
Although, I can't help but
think he wasn't going for me.

37
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,666
The way he stabbed
her didn't look like

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,041
he'd missed his primary target.

39
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,458
It was a precision strike,

40
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,416
aimed at the poison
jewel in her abdomen.

41
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,875
Once again, there appears to
be a logic to his actions.

42
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,333
And so long as I look at
the situation unemotionally,

43
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,416
I should be able to see it.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,625
He's not doing this simply
to show off his powers

45
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,958
or his fighting style.

46
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,000
It's all about winning
the tournament.

47
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,500
But why?

48
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,666
Why enslave your own corpse
and try to steal the jewel?

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,166
Yes, if you win the Juni Taisen,

50
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
you get to have
one wish granted.

51
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,875
But such a prize is
only worth something

52
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,750
if you're around to enjoy it.

53
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,625
Can a person have a wish
that's so important

54
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,000
they still desire it
even in death?

55
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,333
But if it is so important,

56
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,625
why gamble your life
fighting in the first place?

57
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,375
Why not just hide and
wait everyone out?

58
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,666
What is the Rabbit doing?
And why is he doing it?

59
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,166
These mysteries will remain
frustratingly unsolved.

60
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,000
I must put my mind toward
what I can accomplish:

61
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,458
Holding a proper
memorial for him.

62
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,041
And when I use
the word memorial,

63
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,666
I mean I shall burn his
corpse down to ashes.

64
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,083
[EIJI] But it may prove
difficult to find

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,666
the necessary
flammable materials.

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,375
Maybe I can get to a gas
station before he gets to me.

67
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,250
There's fuel in those cars,

68
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,958
though siphoning it
may take even longer.

69
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,166
[EIJI]
He's already here?

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,875
I chopped that corpse
into a dozen pieces.

71
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,291
I assumed it would take longer
for him to reassemble.

72
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,416
[EIJI] "Walking corpse" is
too tame a word for him now.

73
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,666
He's become a monster.

74
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,166
[EIJI]
My God. Now what?

75
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,791
I could slice him into even
smaller bits with my saber,

76
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,208
but he'll simply re-form
into a new grotesquerie.

77
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,833
One thing is certain:

78
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,500
I cannot waste any more
time on this wretch.

79
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,291
I need to destroy the
Rabbit, definitively.

80
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,250
I shall use both sword
and fire in concert!

81
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,416
First, I'll dice him up again.

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
And then with the
time that affords me,

83
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,500
I'll prepare the gasoline
for his ultimate demise.

84
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,250
[EIJI] There are no vital
spots on the undead.

85
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,541
Heart, brain, throat--
they mean nothing now.

86
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,291
[EIJI]
He's already killed the Monkey?

87
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,708
How could I be so... careless?

88
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,125
Even though I didn't know
Monkey had been killed,

89
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,458
I should have been
able to predict

90
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,416
that a monster assembled
from the parts of corpses

91
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,208
could have someone
hiding inside.

92
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,500
It did seem strange
that once re-assembled,

93
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,666
he became larger
rather than smaller.

94
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,791
He used the parts of his
old body to bind together

95
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,958
an even more monstrous form.

96
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,458
The only time he
could have done this

97
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
was while I was running
away with Tiger.

98
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,750
And he couldn't
have done it alone.

99
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,250
He must have summoned Monkey
and had her reassemble him.

100
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,375
Like pieces from a model kit.

101
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
Even for a haphazard assembly,

102
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,166
his re-formed body was
especially gruesome.

103
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,208
He had her put
himself back together

104
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,291
so she could fit inside.

105
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,000
And then kill me.

106
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,625
[EIJI]
Damn! What a fool I am!

107
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:45,583
If only I hadn't averted my eyes
and kept my wits about me!

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,083
No.

109
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,833
Even if I had figured out that
she was hiding inside him,

110
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,833
that the corpse belonged
to someone of her skill

111
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,291
means I'd still have
ended up in this spot.

112
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,125
I'm completely at
the mercy of a corpse.

113
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,333
If she wanted to, she could
crush my limbs into powder.

114
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,791
The only reason she's not

115
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,750
is because her master
doesn't want her to.

116
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,125
That pulsating ghoul wants
to finish me off himself!

117
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,083
That way, he's assured
of keeping my body

118
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,000
as intact as possible,

119
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,708
thus making me a more
effective servant.

120
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,083
No consciousness. No
desires. No principles.

121
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,333
I'll be fighting constantly,
forever following orders.

122
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,708
In a way, it won't be
so different from now.

123
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,083
But there will be one difference
I very much dislike.

124
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,625
I won't be able to
act righteously.

125
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:37,083
First, step one: I want
to do the right thing.

126
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,750
Then, I do the right thing.

127
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,583
[EIJI] So what's the
right thing to do now?

128
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,125
I fear my only remaining option

129
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,833
is to kill myself
before he does.

130
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,916
I just have to work up the
nerve to actually do it.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,208
I never imagined killing myself.

132
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,791
And certainly not like this.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,250
[EIJI groans]

134
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,208
[EIJI] Makes sense that
they wouldn't care

135
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,291
about knocking out
my teeth, either.

136
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:10,583
As a corpse, I'll be mute
and won't need to eat.

137
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,875
One day, they may look back

138
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,416
and say the outcome of this
Juni Taisen was decided

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,791
the moment Rabbit killed Monkey

140
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,583
and turned her into
his deadliest friend.

141
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,541
I don't know how many
warriors remain.

142
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,041
I'm fairly certain that
neither Sheep nor Dog

143
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,250
possessed the power to
resist Rabbit on their own.

144
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,791
So who else may yet survive me?

145
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,416
There is one of whom I haven't
seen or heard anything.

146
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,708
[TSUGI]
Nezumi.

147
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,625
[TSUGI]
Warrior of the Rat.

148
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,875
Looks like you're in trouble.

149
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,583
[EIJI]
Yes. That boy.

150
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,000
But why is he only emerging
at this late moment?

151
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,916
Up to now, he's been a complete
non-factor in the Juni Taisen.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,083
If he was smart,
he'd go back into hiding.

153
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,916
He can't expect to kill
Rabbit or Monkey on his own.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,125
Did he simply wander
here by mistake?

155
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,291
[TSUGI]
Glad I made it in time.

156
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,916
Sorry, it took me a lot longer
than I was expecting

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
to find the Sheep's body.

158
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,458
[EIJI]
Sheep? That old fossil?

159
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,000
Why were you looking for him?

160
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,208
[TSUGI] I wasn't looking for
him. I was looking for this.

161
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,458
[EIJI]
He made it "in time"?

162
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,708
Yes. In time to use that bomb.

163
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,166
I chopped Rabbit to pieces
a moment ago, which means

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,791
his energy is currently
going toward reforming.

165
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,750
And until then, he's unable
to take any action.

166
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,208
Monkey's role is to
pin me to the ground.

167
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,250
But that also means she can't do
anything else right now either.

168
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,958
The Rat didn't arrive
"just in time."

169
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,750
He arrived at the exact moment

170
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,708
where he can destroy
Rabbit and Monkey

171
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,708
and win the entire Juni Taisen.

172
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,375
His timing is so perfect.
It's almost superhuman,

173
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,750
Of course.

174
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,750
Killing Rabbit and
Monkey with that bomb

175
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,416
ensures that he'll
take me out, too.

176
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,750
The Warrior of the Rat could
be the most evil villain ever,

177
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,000
or he could simply be a cheater.

178
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,625
It doesn't matter.

179
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,500
I'll still take this
result over the one

180
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,375
where the Rabbit hops away.

181
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,041
[TSUGI] I don't know if
what I'm about to say

182
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,458
will bring you any
comfort before you die.

183
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,000
But the only reason I'm here
now is because your friend,

184
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,666
Miss Tiger, killed
the Sheep earlier.

185
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,083
If it wasn't for her kill,
I wouldn't be holding the bomb

186
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,166
that's about to end
this tournament.

187
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,125
So any credit for
what's about to happen

188
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:32,375
really belongs to her.

189
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,708
As for you, Mr. Ox,
do you have any last words?

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,958
No. Just do it.

191
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,583
This is the right end.
It's my time to go.

192
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,791
But you, I hope
you truly believe

193
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,291
this is the right
end for you, too.

194
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,875
Killing systematically.

195
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,125
Warrior of the Ox. Ushii.

196
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,083
[EIJI]
He wins.

197
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
Legend says the Rat
got to be the first

198
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,375
in the Zodiac by
riding the Ox's horns.

199
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,333
In a way, that's just
what he did--

200
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,333
rode me right to victory.

201
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,041
And that's all right.

202
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,208
What he told me about
Tiger and the bomb

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,791
has actually put
my mind at ease.

204
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,291
But now, having talked to him,

205
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,041
I can't shake the feeling
I've met him once before.

206
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,458
I think it was at--

207
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,708
[DUO]
Congratulations, Warrior Nezumi!

208
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,666
Well done and bravo!

209
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,083
You, my boy, are the winner
of the 12th Juni Taisen!

210
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,583
Everyone, give
yourselves a hand!

211
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,625
[DUO claps]

212
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,458
[DUO] The antidote should
be in full effect by now,

213
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,708
so rest easy, young warrior.

214
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,958
[TSUGI]
Okay, got it. So can I go?

215
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,250
[DUO] Not yet. Just a little
bit longer if you will.

216
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,250
Your win was a dazzling
accomplishment, by all measures.

217
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,125
I'd like to interview you
for the official record

218
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,625
so that future Taisen warriors
may understand how you did it.

219
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,708
[TSUGI]
Great. Interrogation time.

220
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,083
What do you say?

221
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,791
It's more of a
formality, really,

222
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,875
it shouldn't take very long.

223
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,041
I'll pass.

224
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,375
Very well then.

225
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,500
It's been a pleasure and
congratulations again.

[TSUGI screams]

228
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,916
What do you say?

229
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,291
It's more of a
formality, really,

230
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,541
it shouldn't take very long.

231
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,791
[DUO]
Very well then.

232
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,666
It's been a pleasure and
congratulations again.

[yells]

[DUO]
What do you say?

235
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,666
It's more of a formality,
really, it-- Uh.

236
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
What's wrong? Nezumi, wait.

237
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,958
What do you say?

238
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,625
[TSUGI]
That didn't work.

239
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,208
[DUO] What do you say?
It's more of a formality.

[gasps]

241
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,291

242
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,333
What do you say?

243
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,250
It's more of a
formality, really,

244
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,000
it shouldn't take very long.

245
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,416
I'll pass.

246
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,083
[TSUGI]
In less than an instant,

247
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,666
I refused him a hundred
different ways.

248
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,166
They all failed.

249
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,000
And 40 of those times,
I ended up dead.

250
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,916
Although if you compare
that to my dying

251
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,375
99 out of the 100 times I ran
through the Juni Taisen,

252
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
60% survival odds
with our host master

253
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
is actually pretty good.

254
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,458
[DUO]
What do you say?

255
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,250
It's more of a
formality, really,

256
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,041
it shouldn't take very long.

257
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,541
Sure. Ask me
anything you want.

258
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,541
[TSUGI]
Okay, lock it in!

259
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,750
[DUO]
I suppose my main question is,

260
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,416
would you explain to us
your over all approach

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,958
to the Juni Taisen?

262
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,666
While it's obviously clear
how you won in the end,

263
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,708
many of your actions leading up
to that point were rather,

264
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,041
shall we say, difficult for us
outside observers to understand,

265
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,125
let alone analyze accurately.

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,166
You're kidding. I don't think
I did anything that strange.

267
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,125
You're a pain in the ass!

268
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,916
[TSUGI] It seems resisting
is pointless. Lock it in.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
You're kidding. I don't think
I did anything that strange.

270
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,166
Ah. What do you mean by that?

271
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,500
I mean, I just did
what I always do.

272
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,375
I ran through a hundred
different strategies

273
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,166
at the same time.

274
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,625
I call it "The Power
of Intervention."

275
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,083
I found the one path, one
strategy out of a hundred,

276
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,875
that allowed me to survive.

277
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,625
Very impressive indeed, my boy!

278
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,583
No matter how
skilled the warrior.

279
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,500
No matter how
brave or brilliant.

280
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,750
No matter if he's a
re-animated corpse!

281
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,250
He still only gets one
try at any given action.

282
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,958
In other words,
if he looks right,

283
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,166
he can't look left
at the same time.

284
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,166
But it sounds as if you can.

285
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,875
Yep, that's pretty much it.

286
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,708
Now that the Taisen's over
and we understand your approach,

287
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,833
it's clear you dominated
it from start to finish.

288
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,083
[TSUGI]
You make it sound so easy.

289
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,541
It'd be nice if you also
understood how hard it is

290
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,458
to try a hundred different
scenarios at once.

291
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,958
I could really use some sleep.

292
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,208
[DUO]
Your power reminds me

293
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,541
of the paradox of
"Schrodinger's Cat."

294
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,916
The cat in the box exists
simultaneously in two states:

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,416
Alive and dead.

296
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,916
Perhaps we should call you
"Schrodinger's Rat."

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,208
[TSUGI]
I do kinda feel like a lab rat.

298
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,208
[DUO] ...Zodiac because the
rat tricked it out of its spot.

299
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,458
But this time,
the cat's not alone.

300
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,833
You put one over on
every single warrior.

301
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,125
[tSUGI] Ya know,
that's not exactly true.

302
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,083
There's a cat in the Zodiac.

303
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,958
I mean, a Tiger is a kind
of cat, don't ya think?

304
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,666
[DUO]
Heh. Good point.

305
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,250
[TSUGI]
On one of the paths I tried,

306
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,000
Tiger and I actually
formed an alliance.

307
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,083
[TSUGI] Of the hundred different
paths I dreamt up and tested,

308
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,875
this was the only one
where I survived

309
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,708
the whole way through,
and won the Taisen.

310
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,791
You are a fascinating
young man, indeed

311
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,583
[TSUGI] And I wouldn't have
even stumbled on this path

312
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,375
if it wasn't for
Sharyu, the Monkey.

313
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,750
Oh?

314
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,166
While we were
hiding in the sewer,

315
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,625
she asked me for a favor if
things went south for her.

316
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:28,666
[MISAKI] Hey, Nezumi.
I wanna ask a favor.

317
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,333
If I get killed up there,

318
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,166
and the Necromantist
ends up controlling me,

319
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,416
please destroy my body.

320
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,458
So, yeah.

321
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,625
But I refused to do it.

322
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,375
She was also the
one who reminded me

323
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,375
of the explosives the Sheep
had mentioned at the start,

324
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,333
and said they would be
effective against the zombies.

325
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,875
[TSUGI] So the one who deserves
credit for taking out Monkey

326
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:56,791
and the other zombies...
is Monkey.

327
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,000
[TSUGI] All the routes I
cooked up were failures.

328
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,416
I guess I'm just lucky.

329
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,291
[DUO]
You are also humble.

330
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,541
I find it most
impressive how nimbly

331
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,416
you changed your
combat priorities

332
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,541
depending on the circumstances.

333
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,333
Juggling so many different
realities has had

334
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,541
the beneficial effect of making
you a most flexible fighter.

335
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,833
Oh, and if anyone is curious,
of the hundred paths I tried,

336
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,416
I never learned what
Monkey's peace plan was.

337
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,875
It was probably
all just a bluff.

338
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,750
It was probably
all just a bluff.

339
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,375
[DUO laughs]

340
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,666
I disagree.

341
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,583
I'm going to give her
the benefit of the doubt

342
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,541
and assume she did have a plan.

343
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,125
For example, it's quite possible
that a warrior of her renown

344
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,458
has friendships...

345
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,041
[TSUGI] There are only three
paths of the hundred

346
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
where I can get him
to explain this.

347
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,458
...a large enough alliance,

348
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,583
she intended to
negotiate with them.

349
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,666
The people of the countries
Monkey has saved

350
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,500
revere her as a hero.

351
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,958
She has ties across the world.

352
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,000
In fact, if she wanted to, she
could have sat at the same table

353
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,666
as the Taisen's organizers,

354
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,666
betting and swapping entire
countries, just as they do.

355
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,375
[TSUGI]
They bet countries? Like money?

356
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,791
Unfortunately, we can never
really know the exact truth.

357
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,208
[TSUGI]
Every time I died,

358
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,708
my last thoughts would be
about finding the one path

359
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,083
with the sequence of events
where her peace treaty worked.

360
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,625
If Sharyu is the warrior
who's saved the most people,

361
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,583
I'm probably the one who's
destroyed the most worlds.

362
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,708
[DUO laughs]

363
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,583
Putting aside her peace treaty,
I can't help but wonder

364
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,458
who won in each of
the other 99 routes.

365
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,416
I imagine it ran the gamut
of the whole line-up.

366
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,833
I can't answer that.

367
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,208
Since I died half-way through
all the other scenarios,

368
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,333
I was never around to
see the eventual winner.

369
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,083
But considering the
state of the tournament

370
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,625
whenever I would die,

371
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,791
I bet Rabbit took
the crown most times.

372
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,583
In fact, among those
hundred outcomes,

373
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,708
there was actually one
where we really hit it off

374
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,416
and formed a weird
sorta friendship.

375
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,583
Oh? You and Rabbit, partners?

376
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,416
[TSUGI]
Tch. Oh, crap.

377
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,166
I said way too much
about deleted paths.

378
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,458
Should I erase this one, too?

379
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,916
No.

380
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,625
No matter what I do, he'll
get it outta me in the end.

381
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
Lock it in.

382
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,291
[DUO]
Thank you for your time, Nezumi.

383
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,000
This concludes the
winner's interview.

384
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,125
You're free to go home and
get some much-needed rest.

385
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,291
Really?

386
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,541
Okay. Thanks.

387
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,666
And don't forget,

388
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,875
you have yet to pick the
wish you want granted

389
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,250
for winning the Taisen.

390
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,416
Once you do, feel free to
contact me at any time.

391
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,750
[TSUGI]
Right. Got it.

392
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,250
[TSUGI]
If I had to pick right now,

393
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,666
I'd just wish for a
good night's sleep.

394
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,791
[TSUGI] I'm gonna run through
a hundred different wishes

395
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,583
and make sure I ask for the one
that works out best for me.

396
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,291
[DUO] They say
"a mountain's great labor

397
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,833
may yield only a mouse."

398
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,958
Whatever you think of it,

399
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,375
know that it will at
least be resolved.

400
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,958
Next time: "The One Wish
That Must Be Granted,

401
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,625
and the Ninety-Nine That
Can Be Done Without."
