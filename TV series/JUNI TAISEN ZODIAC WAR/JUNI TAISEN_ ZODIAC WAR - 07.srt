1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,791
In my experience,
the best strategy

2
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,083
for winning a fight is to
have friends in said fight.

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,458
Friends are great.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,875
Aren't they just the best?

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,333
It's okay, there's no
need to be scared.

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,708
The only thing
I'm taking is your life.

7
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,916
In exchange for relieving
you of this burden,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,208
you'll be my friend.

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,166
And I hope I don't
creep you out by saying that

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,833
from the moment
I first saw you,

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,791
it's all I've wanted!

12
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,916
Well, well, well.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,166
The friend I sent after Rat must
have found the rodent's nest.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,958
[USAGI]
You're up!

15
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,458
Let's go.

16
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,250
I don't think any of the
other warriors have arrived yet.

17
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,000
I say we use our extra
time to set up an ambush

18
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,125
and then pick off
the others, one-by-one.

19
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,208
You idiot.

20
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,500
No one here is
going down that easy.

21
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,291
How about we
make a brotherly wager

22
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,250
over which idiot bites it first?

23
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,125
Come on.

24
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,541
Hey.

25
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Huh...

26
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,000
Is that a trap?

27
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,875
I hope so.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,416
[sighs]

29
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,875
You got any idea which fighters
we'll be going up against?

30
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,875
Well.

31
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,166
It's probably safe to assume

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,916
that Boar, Monkey,
and Ox'll be here.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,208
So, what you're saying is,

34
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,166
the line-up's gonna
be really boring.

35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,708
[NAGA]
Boring?

36
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,833
Without me, you wouldn't last
a second against these guys!

37
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,083
What?

38
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,041
I could win this whole
thing on my own, dude.

39
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,375
[chuckles]

40
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,875
Yeah, you <i>could</i> win, maybe,

41
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,166
but if we work as
a team, we <i>will</i> win.

42
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,541
[TAKE groans]

[NAGA chuckles]

Shut your hole.

46
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,041
[TAKE]
I'm trying!

00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,666

Try that way!

00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,083
[POLICEMAN B]
Right!

51
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,916
[POLICEMAN B]
Hey! Let's see that pretty face.

52
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,708
Not our guy.

53
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,166
Yeah.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,583
Where'd he go?

55
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,458
How'm I supposed
to know the good pieces

56
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
from the great pieces?

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,625
[TAKE]
Ooo!

58
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:06,500
[alarm]

59
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
Nice work tripping
the alarm, dope.

60
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,041
Bite me.

61
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,916
I still managed
to get away with it.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,958
Why's it matter?

63
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,458
So, what do we have here?

64
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,500
I don't know if I stole
a good piece or not.

65
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,958
Shuddup.

66
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:29,958
Tell ya what.

67
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,583
So, let's say, it's a draw.

68
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,166
Ugh. Draws are for losers.

69
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,875
And wait, when did this
even become a competition?

70
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,916
[chuckles]

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,166
[NAGA] Nothing wrong
with a little sibling rivalry

72
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,750
to keep us sharp.
Right? Right? Right?

73
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,375
[TAKE]
You're creeping me out!

74
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,166
We of the Dragon
select the older brother.

75
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,333
The floating power known
as Heaven's Holding,

76
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,583
makes him worthy
of the Tatsumi family.

77
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,416
And then, the Snake
chooses the younger one.

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,125
The brother with the special
power of Earth's Guidance.

79
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,791
[MAN B]
Ladies and Gentlemen,

80
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,625
it is our high honor to
declare these young men,

81
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,000
the next Warriors
of the Dragon and Snake.

82
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,083
For generations
a pair was chosen

83
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,791
to represent our two houses.

84
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,666
But never in history have a
Dragon and Snake possessed

85
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,916
as great a compatibility

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,041
as these two standing
before us now.

87
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,250
After twelve long years,

88
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,791
the next Juni Taisen
is finally upon us.

89
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,125
As the representatives
of Dragon and Snake,

90
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,916
your duty is to kill until
only one fighter remains.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,166
Huh?

92
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,375
[MAN B]
I predict a great victory!

93
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,375
At last your Tsumita family
will know glory in the Taisen!

94
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,500
Takeyasu.

95
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,666
Nagayuki.

96
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,333
We pray for your success.

97
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,208
We can't both
win the Juni Taisen

98
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,333
so even though we're
family one of us might have

99
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,375
to kill the other.

100
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,291
Never saw that one coming.

101
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:19,500
[laughs]

102
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,875
What's in the box boys?

103
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,541
They look like a pro crew.

104
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,333
And they're smuggling what now?

105
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,708
Ugh. Nothing good here, either.

Yeah.

in flames, too, moron.

the damn lighter!

death wish or somethin?

only reason he's here.

I do appreciate
the help from him.

We don't even know
if he's a warrior,

or just some weird guy
who works here.

Fine.

And I'm the Snake.

The younger Tatsumi brother.

164
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,416
Very much killing for money.

very close to one another.

ya tell, cotton-tail?

[USAGI]
Do you wanna drink?

169
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,625
He's a few eggs
short of a dozen.

170
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,000
Both of you.

171
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,583
Will you please be my friends?

172
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,583
Normally, I'd say
"no chance in hell,"

173
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,291
but maybe we can use him?

[NAGA]
Yeah, I'll pass.

Uh...

Is that...?

Can I have that?

You're funnier than
you look, y'know that?

181
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,666
Trust me, Thumper, you can't
handle this kinda firepower.

Huh?

There's something un--

Aw, shit.

Sorry, brother.

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,166
That's just so nice.

I can't wait to make you
my friend, as well.

Yeah, try that.

That back-pack tank.

The outfit that shows
just enough skin

to get people like me looking.

Hey, this ain't no circus,
it's the Juni Taisen!

This kitty only
fights living partners.

250

And I thought I'd get to spend

251
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,750
the whole night drinking
real, human blood.

252

[USAGI]
All right, my friend,

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,125
I want you to draw away
the Rat and kill him.

254
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,916
But if anybody
tries stopping you,

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,833
it'd be a big help to me
if you killed them, too.

I wouldn't get back up

unless you want to lose
those legs as well.

You no longer answer
to that Necromantist.

262
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,708
I control your fate now.

263
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Wait.

264
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,291
Let me finish here first.

265
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,541
There's no need
to rush into our fight.

266
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,500
You're very impatient.

267
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,333
I'd think you'd want me
to take my time with him

before starting in on you.

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you must be the
Warrior of the Tiger.

Damn right I am!

And you look alot like
the Ox to me, buddy.

The warrior, Ushii!

know me and my work.

275

Perhaps we've met before
and I've simply forgotten you?

[EIIJI]
Oh, dear.

277

You seem to be holding
some grudge against me.

278
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,291
Did I kill your siblings,
or parents, or both?

279
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,833
[EIJI] Huh. I suppose I can
finish off the Tiger first.

280
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,958
The corpse isn't going anywhere.

Tora: Warrior of the--

282
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,750
[EIJI] Unbelievable, the corpse
has no personal limiters.

283
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,666
It's using one hundred percent
of its muscles' latent power!

284
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,500
It may tear itself apart,
but until then, it's too strong!

285
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,666
Is that...?

286
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
[EIJI]
Warrior of the Tiger.

287
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,583
Can you hear me?

288
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,708
What do you want?!

289
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,875
And don't call my name like
you and me are old buddies!

290
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,708
I know you have good
reason to want me dead

291
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,791
rather than to
trust me like this.

292
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,375
But if we agree
to help each other,

293
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,708
we can get out of this bind now
and have a proper fight later.

294
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,375
Oh, please, gimme a break.

295
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,708
You're only saying
that to sober me up,

296
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,416
so you can pull a fast one!

297
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,625
No, I'm not.

298
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,166
If we free ourselves
from this predicament,

299
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,500
I swear we can battle
any way you want.

300
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,291
Name your terms
and I will abide by them.

301
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,833
This one time, we can forget
we're in the Juni Taisen

302
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,416
and just have a
straight-up street fight.

303
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,833
Do you understand?

304
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,166
This isn't a case of you
challenging me to a duel.

305
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,750
It is I who is challenging you,
Warrior of the Tiger!

306
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,291
Ugh. Fine.

307
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,625
I accept your challenge.

308
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,541
You got your truce, Ox.

309
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,000
Now what am I supposed
to do in this big plan of yours?

310
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,041
You don't have to do anything.

311
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,208
Just keep foaming alcohol at
the mouth like you have been!

Gotta admit, Rabbit.

Gettin' a lot of use
out of my little brother.

More than I ever did,
that's for sure.

[DUO] When painting a dragon,
remember the details.

A dragon that hides
in the dark of night

318

must not forget the
moon's revealing light.

Out Like a Snake Part Two."

Give yourselves a hand!
