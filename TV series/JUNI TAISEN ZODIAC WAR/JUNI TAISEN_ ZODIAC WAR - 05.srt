1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,083
To the dignitaries gathered
here this evening,

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:26,083
the Juni Taisen is an
encapsulation of all wars.

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,291
Wars, with their enormous
economic, humanitarian,

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,916
and environmental costs are,
once every 12 years,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,833
distilled into a
single tournament

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,875
of 12 special warriors.

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,666
A proxy war.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,375
A peaceful way to settle
territorial disputes

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,708
between our lands,
represented by each of you.

10
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,750
A high-minded gamble for
control of the world!

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,708
When we reach the point
in the tournament

12
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,166
where half the participants
have been eliminated,

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,625
we shall begin the
formal betting.

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,041
Allow me to now update
you on the performance

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,416
of each remaining warrior.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
The Warrior of the Ox
took an early lead

17
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,750
and currently holds
three Juseki jewels.

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,666
The Rabbit and Dragon Warriors
are tied for second place,

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,250
with two jewels each.

20
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,750
Everyone else is in fourth,

21
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,375
with only the jewels
they swallowed

22
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,458
at the tournament's start.

23
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,250
[VIP A]
Under the Juni Taisen rules,

24
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,291
I assumed they would all
divide into teams early on.

25
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,083
But so far only the Rabbit
appears to've formed one.

26
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,500
[VIP AA]
You said we can place bets

27
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,833
when half of them remain.

28
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,583
I assume the headless
corpse doesn't count

29
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,833
as an active fighter.

30
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,291
[DUO]
Yes, madam, that is correct.

31
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,666
[VIP B] I wonder if any
one fighter will be able

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,166
to defeat the Rabbit's
team by themselves.

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,583
[VIP BB]
The Ox.

34
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,041
[VIP C] The Natural-Born Slayer
would only be held back

35
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,333
by any others.

36
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,375
I guarantee that any
team he encounters,

37
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,958
he'll dispense with quickly.

38
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,500
[VIP AA]
We talk about Rabbit's team,

39
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,750
but Monkey and Rat
are also allied.

40
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,666
[VIP D] I don't know what
to think about them.

41
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,333
The Monkey's certainly
a known quantity,

42
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,958
but there's so little
info on the Rat,

43
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,375
I have no clue how
well he'll perform.

44
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,750
[VIP E]
In the Juni Taisen,

45
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,083
I don't see a scenario where
the Monkey's pacifism

46
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,666
is anything other than
a huge disadvantage.

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,083
[VIP A]
I disagree.

48
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,583
I say, Rabbit, Ox, and Monkey
are the clear favorites.

49
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,958
[VIP AA]
Ugh. Where's the fun in that?

50
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,291
Only three favorites means the
winning bet won't pay much.

51
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,375
There must be something we
could do to shake things up.

52
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,583
[VIP B] We have yet to
talk about the Sheep.

53
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,916
[VIP AA]
The Sheep.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,750
[VIP BB] As the winner
of the Ninth Tournament,

55
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,833
he does possess a pedigree
the other's lack.

56
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,083
[VIP F]
Not only that,

57
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,500
he won decisively
and single-handedly.

58
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,291
[VIP D] Three decades ago!
He's well past his prime.

59
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,833
[VIP C] Ha! He's the most
experienced warrior of the 12!

60
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,083
There's no way the old man
entered the Juni Taisen

61
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,208
without a plan.

62
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,083
Dismiss him at your own peril.

63
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,833
[VIP AA]
I tend to agree.

64
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,083
Whatever the Sheep
ultimately does

65
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,041
will undoubtedly
affect the outcome

66
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,875
of the entire tournament.

67
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,541
[VIP E]
So is he one of the favorites?

68
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,958
Or is he a dark horse?
A black sheep?

69
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,208
[VIP F]
Excellent.

70
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,750
Now it's showtime, everyone!

71
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,041
We don't want to
miss any moment!

72
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,166
The outcome of the Juni Taisen

73
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,875
will ultimately re-draw the
maps of the entire world!

74
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,666
After three more warriors die,
wagering will commence.

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,500
In the meantime,
watch them fight carefully.

76
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,875
Their performance now
will help you determine

77
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,833
whom you think will
survive to the end.

78
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,500
Distinguished guests,

79
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,666
we are about to enter
an exciting new phase.

80
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,166
From what I know and've seen
of the remaining warriors,

81
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,333
there are three who'll not only
be trouble for me in a fight,

82
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,041
but have gotta be
clear favorites

83
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,041
to win the whole she-bang.

84
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,583
Sharyu, Warrior of the Monkey.

85
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,208
Usagi, Warrior of the Rabbit.

86
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,750
And Ushii, Warrior of the Ox.

87
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,458
Anytime you bring 12
folks together for a fight,

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:27,166
of course some are gonna
have more talent than others.

89
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,041
But the imbalance in favor
of these three warriors

90
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,458
is far too great.

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,041
It'd be smart to avoid
direct conflict with them

92
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,333
for as long as possible.

93
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,583
At my age, all that's
left is skin and bones.

94
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,125
I'd crumple from a single blow!

95
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,666
So while everyone else is
zigging, I'm gonna zag. Ha-ha!

96
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,708
I'll trick those three
into killing each other

97
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,208
before they can even
get close to me.

98
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:56,083
That way, this weak old
man stands a chance.

99
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
[MISAKI]
Your raised your hand. Remember?

100
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,541
When I asked people
to join my team?

101
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,958
[USAGI]
Uh?

102
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:06,166
[YOSHIMI]
Stupid. Stupid!

103
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,833
[SUMI] It's true, I won
the Juni Taisen once before,

104
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,708
but that was ages ago.

105
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,458
All I did in the past makes
no difference in the present.

106
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,416
If my own mother ranked
the warriors in this Taisen,

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,208
even she wouldn't put
me higher than tenth.

108
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,333
The older I get,
the more I realize

109
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,458
that a young body in
itself gives great power.

110
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,541
[SUMI]
Little Taro took his bear,

111
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,791
curled up with the blanket,
and fell fast--

112

[SUMI yawns]

113
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,416
How is it this book's
putting me to sleep,

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,666
while you're more
awake than before?

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,875
Wanna hear a story about
your Papa when he was young?

116
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,958
A long time ago, before
things were as peaceful

117
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,291
as they are now, there was
a wily weapons merchant,

118
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,000
who peddled his goods
in a far-away land.

119
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,041
[MAN A] You're right.
It is a good product.

120
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,541
That's why I want you
to put it on my tab.

121
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,416
Now, wait. That wasn't
part of our deal.

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,166
Thought I made it
clear when I got these

123
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,375
that I only trade 'em for cash.

124
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,541
Well, me and the
boys have been

125
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,166
pretty strapped for cash
ourselves, lately.

126
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,375
So put it on my tab
and we'll be good.

127
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,875
[SUMI]
Oh, I see.

128
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,708
It either goes on the tab,
or you pay in lead.

129
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,166
Well, you don't leave
me much of a choice.

130
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,458
Okay. It's been a pleasure
doin' business with ya.

131
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,666
[PIRATES scream]

132
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,333
[MAN B] So you took out a
whole cell, just like that?

133
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,375
[SUMI]
Eh, no biggie.

134
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,458
Things had run their
course with 'em.

135
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,083
I gotta say, it's a little weird

136
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,458
that you'd try to sell
us the same goods.

137
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,791
[SUMI]
It's not weird at all!

138
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,208
I'll sell to anyone

139
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,458
so long as he respects the
value of what I'm sellin'.

140
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,750
When you're in the sales game,

141
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,375
you find that making
new customers

142
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,250
helps make more new customers.

143

In honor of our new friendship,

As that young man waded through

146
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,833
the worst battlefields
in the world,

147
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,750
he wasn't just selling weapons.

148
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,416
He made quite a name for
himself as a warrior, too.

149
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,166
[SUMI]
It wasn't long after that

150

one of the man's most powerful
clients, the Tsujiie family,

151
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,416
welcomed him into their house
as their new son-in-law.

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,666
During the Juni Taisen,

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,041
that young man had his
greatest accomplishment,

00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,541
representing the family as
the Warrior of the Sheep.

157
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,208
who is here with you now,
watching you sleep.

158
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,541
[SUMI'S GRANDCHILD]
Hey, Grandpa.

159
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,833
What's this thing?

160
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,541
I was wondering
when you'd find that.

161
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,166
It's my birthday present to you.

162
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,916
Don't be afraid. Push it.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,375
[SUMI]
As a young man,

164
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,000
I lived on the battlefield
and I expected to die there.

165
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,958
I never thought
I'd reach the age

166
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,416
where I'd get to play
with my grandchild.

167
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,625
"The best laid plans
of mice and men."

168
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,291
Or, in my case, sheep.

169
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,750
Grandpa, that's five
games in a row now!

170
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,416
Why are you no good at battles?

171
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,083
I'm just a little lost.

172
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,875
This game is nothing
like any battle

173
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,291
I've ever been in,
that's for sure.

174
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,583
If you went on one of the
battlefields these days,

175
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,041
you probably wouldn't
last a second!

176
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,375
What're ya talkin' about?
I'd kick their butts!

177
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,208
Father, are you sure
you want to do this?

178
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:24,000
At the next Juni Taisen, I will
go in my grandchild's place.

179
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,208
My mind is made up.

180
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,458
[SUMI] Unlike other warriors,
I've had a long and happy life.

181
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,083
My family. My grandchild.

182
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,000
They have made it that way.

183
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,875
I refuse to let them bear the
burden of the Juni Taisen.

184
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,875
Maybe I can take this
burden with me to nirvana,

185
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,833
and bring the other Taisen
warriors along with me.

186
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,791
[TSUGI] I didn't come
here to chase corpses.

187
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,500
[TSUGI]
What the hell?

188
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,625
[TSUGI]
Well, this took a turn!

189
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,750
You don't have to
do this, Usagi!

190
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,916
it's not too late to join us!

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,083
Remember what I said?

192
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,208
I have a plan where
we can all survive!

193
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,250
Just put down your weapons

194
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,833
and listen to what
I have to say!

195
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,875
We're all here because we
want to have a wish granted,

196
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,041
so just stop fighting
and tell me yours!

197
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,375
If we're on the same team,

198
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,333
I promise I'll work with
you to make it a reality!

199
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,083
All right, then. Tell
me what your wish is.

200
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,083
[gasps]

201
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,250
[SUMI] If all the other warriors
are stronger than me,

202
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,333
how do I make up the difference?

203
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,583
What can I do that they can't?

204
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,833
What do I have that they don't?

205
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,083
The easy answer is experience

206
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,166
and the wisdom that
comes with it,

207
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,666
but if there's a more
tangible advantage...

208
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,416
...I suppose it's this!

209
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,666
As you get older,

210
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,750
you learn to approach
things with due caution.

211
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,250
Taking unnecessary risks
can be the difference

212
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,083
between life and death.

213
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,208
As soon as I saw this gemstone,

214
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,166
something about it
seemed unnatural.

215
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,041
Sure, the color was beautiful,

216
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,458
but its cut was too unusual
for normal jewelry.

217
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[DUO] However, for the sake of
this being a fair tournament,

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,541
I request that you only
swallow one of them.

219
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,208
[SUMI]
The moment he gave that order,

220
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,041
I knew this jewel was
dangerous with a capital "D."

221
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,208
[DUO]
...the rest of you, as well.

222
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,833
I want you all to
swallow your jewels.

223
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,583
[SUMI] Now, which Warrior shall
I deceive with this beauty.

224
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,166
[YOSHIMI] I can't believe I
thought I could partner with Ox

225
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
and dominate the tournament.

226
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,041
[YOSHIMI]
What's wrong with me?

227
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,291
Why do I get my hopes up?

228
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,291
[YOSHIMI]
Why?

229
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,041
Sorry, but given the current
state of the tournament,

230
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,000
the window for any
teamwork has now closed.

231
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,125
But I will say that I've
never fought someone

232
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,250
who's survived as many
of my attacks as you.

233
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,208
Your Ironclad defense is a
very special power, indeed.

234
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,750
[YOSHIMI]
He's a fighting savant.

235
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,208
Without surprising me,
distracting me,

236
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,875
or fighting dirty,

237
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,208
he reduced me to a panicked
mess in a straight-up duel.

238
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,416
[SUMI] Ranked fourth would
have to be the Boar,

239
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,708
daughter of a previous
Taisen winner.

240
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,875
Let's say Horse and Dog
are fifth and sixth.

241
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,416
Both look like they're
straightforward brawlers,

242
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,125
but good luck to the poor sap

243
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,166
who underestimates
Horse on defense!

244
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,083
In seventh and eighth place are
the twins, Dragon and Snake.

245
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,125
'Course, they'd rank higher
if they came as a set.

246
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,166
But Snake's early elimination
lowered Dragon's position.

247
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,916
And finally, let's put
the Chicken in ninth.

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,916
I need to go after the ones in
the middle of the ranking.

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,833
The top three are
far too powerful

250
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,666
for them to hope to face.

251
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,791
And while I'm sure that
hasn't stopped them

252
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,708
from making their own plans,

253
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,083
I bet they'd love to get
their hands on something

254
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,291
they think can put
them over the top.

255
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,958
I am more than happy to
offer that something.

256
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,875
[SUMI] The tournament
is stressful enough,

257
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,541
but throw in the poison?

258
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,541
Now you're talkin'
about a situation

259
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,833
that'll rattle even the
most stoic of warriors.

260
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,208
I'll exploit their unease
to my advantage.

261
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,625
In a way befitting a kindly
old man, of course.

262
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,625
[SUMI]
Hm?

263
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,458
Phew. That was too close for me.

264
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,375
Doubtful that little bomb'll
take out the Ox,

265
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,458
but it should slow
him down a bit.

266
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,125
Now, where was I?

267
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,708
[MISAKI]
Damn, he's left me no choice.

268
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,000
The Rabbit was only
pretending to listen

269
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,250
so he could buy more time

270
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,666
for his reinforcements
to get here.

271
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,291
[MISAKI]
This is awful.

272
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,333
I hate having to kill animals,
even if they are already dead.

273
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,208
[chuckling]

274
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,541
[SUMI]
Before you kill me,

275
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,291
at least hear about
my special power.

276
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,541
Would you believe I can
use quantum tunneling

277
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,250
to move objects through matter?

278
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,458
[SUMI] Not a complete lie, but
that's what'll I'll tell 'em.

279
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,916
[SUMI] How 'bout this,
my warrior friend?

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
As a show of good faith,

281
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,416
I'll use my power to pull that
Juseki jewel from your belly,

282
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
with no ill effects.

283
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,083
Now, I won't actually
be removing anything.

284
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,416
And to be honest,

285
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,666
I doubt they'll take me up
on the offer at first.

286
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,333
They'll think it's better
just to keep the jewel

287
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,666
for the time being,

288
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,500
rather than risk some old
man runnin' off with it.

289
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
So that's when I'll say,

290
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,833
"You can tell me later if you
want your jewel gone.

291
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,708
For now, why don't we team up?"

292
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,166
"These old bones ain't makin'
it to the end, no matter what,

293
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,916
so you know I'm not
gonna get in your way."

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
[SUMI]
If I can offer 'em a partnership

295
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,875
they see as all favorable,

296
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,625
I can hold off on runnin'
my "jewel removal" scheme

297
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,291
till I really need
a favor from 'em.

298
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,916
The longer they have
to think about it,

299
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,541
the better the chance
they pick my story apart.

300
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,000
They'll say, "Why don't
you just use your power

301
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,208
to steal the jewels
from everyone?"

302
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,041
Anyway, that's how
I'll form a team

303
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,875
that levels the playing
field in my favor.

304
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,958
[SUMI] I won't offer
myself to all of 'em,

305
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:45,000
even if forming a larger team
would be more to my advantage.

306
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,041
I'll only approach
one of the warriors.

307
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,916
People have a hard
time realizing

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
when they're being deceived,

309
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,375
but they can always see it
when it's happening to others.

310
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,958
I admit, a team of only
two seems rather weak.

311
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,750
But with Dragon and Snake broke
up before we even started,

312
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,541
the only other team we're
likely to tango with'll be

313
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,000
whatever the Monkey's
cobbled together,

314
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,166
and judgin' from the
pitch she made,

315
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,833
they're all gonna be
pacifists anyway!

316
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,500
In all my years,

317
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,541
enemy numbers alone
have never scared me.

318
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,458
And if worse comes to worse,

319
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,375
then I'll wipe them all out
with the ultimate weapon.

320
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,666
I've created a work of art.

321
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,750
The grenade I call, "Old Timer."

322
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,541
Had I not been interrupted
at the skyscraper,

323
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,666
I coulda finished 'em
all off in one blast.

324
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,041
By my count, about
three hours have passed

325
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,291
since the Juni Taisen began.

326
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,375
Plenty of time for the
remaining warriors

327
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,708
to settle into position.

328
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
Tch. It's just a
headless corpse.

329
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,791
How has it been able to
follow me this far?

330
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,791
[TSUGI]
It can't see, how does it know?

331
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:11,541
Ah, his other senses.
Well, in that case.

332
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:18,750
[alarm beeping]

333
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,416
[SUMI] Partnering with a weaker
warrior does me no good,

334
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,916
no matter how friendly they are.

335
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,333
It's essential I find someone

336
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,291
I ranked in the
middle of the pack.

337
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,041
Fourth, fifth, sixth.

338
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,625
I'll bet my horns that the
only two weaker than me

339
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,541
are that lazy Tiger
and the Rat boy.

340
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,041
In fact, lumpin' 'em together
is a disservice to Rat!

341
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,291
Tiger's so damn weak, I don't
even know why she's here!

342
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,166
There must be
something I'm missin'.

343
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,666
Some skill or power that
made her good enough

344
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,750
to enter the Juni Taisen.

345
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,250
[SUMI]
Speak of the Tiger.

346
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,458
Looks like she already found
the liquor store, too.

347
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:28,833
I can't imagine any scenario
where I'd ever partner with her.

348
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,375
I mean, look at her!

349
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,666
She's not trying to find the
others, let alone fight 'em!

350
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,458
She's just out
here gettin' wasted.

351
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,291
Nothin' about her's even
remotely threatening.

352
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,333
I'd wondered why she
was in this tournament,

353
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,541
but now I don't even care.

354
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,583
She's just pathetic.

355
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,875
Hardly worth wastin'
a grenade on.

356
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,958
[KANAE] I know you're hidin' in
those bushes, dirty old man.

357
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,291
Quit peepin' on me
and get out here!

358
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,708
C'mon! Let's go!

359
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,041
[DUO] "You can't judge a
horse you haven't ridden,

360
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,041
or a person you
haven't lived with."

361
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,041
To ride demands courage,
to share a home demands more.

362
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,291
Next time: "Even a Champion
Racehorse May Stumble."

363
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,000
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
