[TOSHIKO]
How about that.

3
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:33,583
A brand new building
and not a soul inside.

[footsteps]

5
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,750
[TOSHIKO]
An entire city of 500,000

00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,083
relocated in a single night.

7
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,250
There's no better
example of the power

8
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,416
of the Juni Taisen's
organizers than that.

9
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,875
Of course, the city's
not completely empty.

10
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:23,250
I assume the other participants
have already gone inside.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,500
Which is fine.

12
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,375
As the Boar, I take
my role very seriously.

13
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,083
And it's tradition that
the Boar always arrive last.

[elevator dings]

15
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,708
[TOSHIKO] Hm. How could I
choose a mode of transport

16
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,833
with no escape and still
call myself a warrior?

When you're on the battlefield,

20
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,208
always have an escape
route planned.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,125
I know this
is training, Toshiko,

22
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,291
but those mercenaries
are still trying to kill you.

23
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,958

Okay, Father.

[TOSHIKO'S FATHER]
Excellent. So long as you keep

30
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,166
both hands free,
you can dispatch enemies

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,291
coming from any direction
at any time.

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,708
Okay, Father. I understand.

33
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,958
[TOSHIKO] Now I've learned
it's even easier to simply

34
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,666
carry weapons all the time.
Right, Father?

[MERC 1G groans]

46

[TOSHIKO'S FATHER]
When you have a chance to kill,

47
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,625
you always take it.

48
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,666
Showing mercy is pointless.

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291

My father's "discipline"

51
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,583
[TOSHIKO'S MOTHER] Honey,
this color's gorgeous on you.

52
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,000
Look how it pops!
It's important to look good.

53
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,500
You'll be head of
the Ino family someday.

54
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,083
[TOSHIKO] My mother's entire
world revolved around me

55
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,500
and my sister. She was obsessed.

56
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,291
Two very different sets
of expectations growing up.

57
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,166
And I met them both. However.

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,208
[KIYOKO]
Toshiko!

59
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,625
Kiyoko.

60
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,000
[KIYOKO] Check this out.
I killed three already today!

61
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,750
Actually, if you count
the newborn cubs,

62
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,625
and I think we should,
it's eight!

63
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,541
After the first,
I picked 'em off one-by-one

64
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,208
as they came out of their den!

65
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:48,000
My beloved little sister
was obsessed with killing.

66
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,083
[TOSHIKO]
Welcome home, Father!

67
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,250
Congratulations on
winning the Juni Taisen--

68
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,541
Enough! I didn't
ask for your praise.

69
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,166
Pay attention.

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,000
I've chosen the entrant
for the next Juni Taisen.

--[KIYOKO gasps]
--That's in twelve years!

Yes. This family's next

73
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,375
Taisen competitor will be...

74
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,625
[TOSHIKO]
Don't worry, Father.

75
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,291
You taught me
everything I know.

76
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,125
The family's honor
demands that I win,

77
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
and I plan to do just that.

78
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,666
In a way, my entry's simply
a continuation of your work

79
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,125
in that last tournament.

80
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,250
And I'll win with
grace and nobility.

81
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,291
Traits befitting our title of
"Defending Champion."

82
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,208
[TOSHIKO] Sorry, everyone,
I didn't mean to be this late.

83
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
A warm hello to you all!

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,166
In case you didn't know,
I am the Boar.

85
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:44,125
[TOSHIKO] My, my.
So many familiar faces.

86
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,666
The Ox.

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,708
The Sheep.

88
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,333
The Chicken.

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,833
The Dog.

90
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,916
Looks like she's
waiting to pounce.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,583
That would be our
old friend, the Tiger.

92
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,250
The big guy's a mystery.
Never seen him before.

93
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,166
Oh, look. The Monkey.

94
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,916
[MISAKI giggles]

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,041
[TOSHIKO] I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised to find that

96
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,916
repulsive young woman here.

97

[TOSHIKO gasps]

98
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,375
[TOSHIKO] I definitely don't
recognize Mr. Sleepyhead.

99
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,666
[TOSHIKO]
Huh. What a pathetic warrior!

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,166
Who gets himself killed before
the fighting even starts?

101
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,250
Uuh. It wasn't me--
don't you dare say it was me!

102
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,000
You can't just accuse people
of murder with no evidence!

103
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,125
[TOSHIKO] Sorry, but when
I see a headless body

104
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,000
and a bloody sword,
it's not hard to do the math.

105
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,666
[DUO]
Warriors, welcome!

106
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,750
It is my great pleasure
to announce that

107
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,166
with the final entrant arriving,
we can at last begin

108
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,333
the 12th Juni Taisen!

109
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,125
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!

110
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,208
[USAGI]
Uh? Uh. Uh?!

111
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,500
I will be the referee for
the duration of the Juni Taisen.

112
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,750
You may call me Duodecuple.

113
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,666
Please try not to forget that.

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,000
Since time is always
of the essence,

115
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,500
I will familiarize you with
the rules of our tournament.

116
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:19,250
First, allow me to direct you
to the center of the table.

117
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,708
Twelve jewels. Twelve of you.

118
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,083
Would you each be
so kind as to take one?

119
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,541
[TOSHIKO] As black as a
starless night sky. Beautiful.

120
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,916
[TOSHIKO] If we just leave
Mr. Sleepyhead there,

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,833
does that mean he
forfeits the tournament?

122
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,250
[MISAKI]
Hey. C'mon, wake up!

123
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,375
Tch!

124
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,708
[MISAKI] You gotta
take one of those...

125
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,291
[TOSHIKO]
Stupid, meddling monkey.

126
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,166
[TSUGI]
What?

127
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,416
[TOSHIKO]
It's been a while since we

128
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,041
last shared a battlefield.

129
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,541
And unfortunately for me,
the Monkey remains

130
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,125
as annoyingly nosy as ever.

131
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,708
"When next we meet,
one of us will die."

132
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,458
I promised that before
and I intend to keep it.

133

--[NAGA] Yo, ref!
--[TOSHIKO gasps]

134
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,666
Since my little brother's
not gonna need it,

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,291
do you mind if I
take his jewel for myself?

136
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,666
I mean, it's only fair it...

137
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,208
[TOSHIKO]
Warrior twins?

138
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,125
[DUO] Of course, young man!
Consider it yours!

139
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,208
[NAGA chuckles]

140
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,875
This should fetch
a pretty penny.

141
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,125
However, for the sake of
this being a fair tournament,

142
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,708
I request that you only
swallow one of them.

143
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,333
Wait. What'd you just say?

144
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,708
Yes. And that goes for
the rest of you as well.

145
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,458
I want you all
to swallow your jewels.

146
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,333
I can't be the only one
here who's thinking

147
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,208
this is too big to swallow.

148
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,041
[DUO] I can get you a glass of
water, but that's about all.

149
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,333
I can handle it.

150
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,666
[DUO] Good. Then I take it
you've all finished?

151
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,625
The black jewel
you just swallowed

152
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,125
is a piece of
slow-acting poison.

153
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,000
--It's called "Juseki."
--[TOSHIKO] I should have known.

154
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,291
[DUO] A crystalized version
of a powerful drug that

155
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,208
once ingested, chemically reacts
with your stomach acid.

156
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,958
After twelve hours,
you'll all be dead.

157
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,375
Now that you're ready,
allow me to explain the rules--

158
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,583
I urge you all
to listen closely.

159
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,833
I will only explain this once.

160
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,833
These Juseki jewels are
also called "beast jewels,"

161
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,875
and the one who collects
all twelve will be the winner.

162
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,166
What does the winner recieve?

163
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
Whatever they want.
Because the grand prize

164
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,750
is the granting of one wish
of their choosing.

165
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:40,500
Huh? Wait, me? Yes! All right!

166
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,708
--Father, I will work so hard!
--[TOSHIKO] What?

167
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,541
[KIYOKO] I'm gonna win
just like you did.

168
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,541
I'll keep the title
in the family!

169
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,166
[giggles]
Wow.

170
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,625
Twelve years, though, huh?

171
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,375
[TOSHIKO]
Father. Why?

172
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,666
[KIYOKO] That's a long time
to wait. But hey! No problem!

173
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,041

You won't take this from me.

[KIYOKO panting]

--Toshiko?
--[TOSHIKO] Kiyoko.

178
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,375
I've got everything
under control.

179
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,375
You just need to
dispose of these men.

180
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,041
Dispose?

181
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,708
That's right.

182
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,458
Okay.

Kiyoko! Hey!

189
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,625
Remember that favor I asked for?

190
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,833
I kinda need it
sooner rather than later.

191
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,958
Mhmm. Say no more.

192
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,541
[MALE STUDENT 1A]
Awesome! I owe you!

193
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,041
[MALE STUDENT 1B]
C'mon, man!

194
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,250
[FEMALE STUDENT 1A] Kiyoko,
what's this favor he wants?

195
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,583
Ooh. Sorry, it's a secret.

[TOSHIKO]
You were late, so I decided

200
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,375
to come get you in person.

201
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,000

207
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,750
[TOSHIKO]
Not enough.

208
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,458
Oh, my.

Toshiko. Um, did I...

...kill them?

[TOSHIKO]
Don't let it bother you.

212
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,541
Killing people is no different
from killing small animals.

213
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,875
You understand me, don't you?

214
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,666
[KIYOKO]
Mm.

215
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,333
[TOSHIKO] You have so much
more killing to do.

216
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,916
--[KIYOKO] Mm.
--More strength to find.

--[KIYOKO] Mm.
--Much more.

[KIYOKO]
Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,250
So much more.

220
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,791

She's almost there.

228
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,541
[KIYOKO]
More. I need more.

229
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,708

--[KIYOKO] More. More.
--[TOSHIKO] Kiyoko.

231

[TOSHIKO] There's a hunger
inside you now, isn't there?

232
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,375
It says, "More." More!

233
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,166
So many more.

234
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,500
Hundreds more. Thousands more!

235
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,250
More for you to stab,
shoot, slice, chop,

236
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,750
choke, burn, shred, break.

237
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,458
[KIYOKO]
More?

238
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,750
So many people to kill!

239
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,541
Lucky for you, you're the
Ino family's chosen one.

240
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,500
Killing people
is your sacred duty.

241
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,958
The taking of lives.
Killing is what we desire most.

242
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,958
Mother, Father, and I.

243
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,250
The more you kill,
the happier we are!

244

[KIYOKO]
Uh!

245
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,333
[TOSHIKO] Wait, I thought you'd
be so excited to hear that.

246
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,708
Is this not the life
you want for yourself?

247
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:04,291
Oh, well. Then do
what your heart tells you to do.

248
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:12,458
[KIYOKO panting]

249
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,666
[door creaks]

250
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,333
[door thuds]

251
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,666
[EIJI]
Excuse me. May I?

252
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,125
--[TOSHIKO] Ox.
--[DUO] Yes. Of course!

253
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,666
[TOSHIKO] He has to be
considered one of the favorites.

254
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,125
Since you've already forced
every warrior to swallow poison,

255
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,458
does it even matter
who wins the Juni Taisen

256
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,416
if we're all going
to be dead anyway?

257
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,291
Your concerns
are understandable,

258
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,250
so I'm more than happy
to put your mind at ease.

259
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,333
Rest assured that as a bonus
prize, the winner will also

260
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,916
receive an antidote
to the Juseki poison.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
[MISAKI]
So, basically, if we don't win,

262
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,500
we're for sure dead, right?

263
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,458
[DUO] Yes. The poison's
effects differ by individual,

264
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,291
but the process is the same.

265
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,416
The crystal slowly
dissolves over the course

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,875
of the tournament
until the person dies.

267
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,250
So, it sounds like
some of us might bite it,

268
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,125
even before the entire
twelve hours have passed.

269
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,875
[DUO]
That is a safe assumption, yes.

270
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,083
[MICHIO]
Hm.

271
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
If you don't mind,
this old man would like

272
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,708
to pipe in with
a question of my own.

273
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,750
[TOSHIKO]
The legendary Sheep.

274
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,416
The way people talk about him,

275
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,958
I assumed he was
either dead or retired.

276
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,916
Over the course
of the Juni Taisen,

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,166
I'm planing on using
various high explosives.

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,875
My question, referee sir,
is what happens if

279
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,583
in killing the others,
my 'splosions also blow up

280
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,750
the jewels
I'm supposed to collect?

281
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,333
[TOSHIKO]
This talk of explosives

282
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,666
is just him trying
to intimidate us.

283
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,041
Such a disagreeable trait
from a gross, old man.

284
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,125
[DUO] There's no chance
of damaging the crystals

285
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,291
by physical force,
no matter how powerful

286
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,708
your weapons may be.

287
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,333
In fact, you may try it
right now if you like.

288
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,375
Nah, that's fine. I don't
wanna make a mess for nothing.

289
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,125
[laughs]
I trust ya!

290
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,416
I do have one other
question for you.

291
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,708
How are we supposed
to retrieve these jewels

292
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,958
from our victims if
they've all been swallowed?

293
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,875
There's more than just one way--

294
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,291
each warrior may use
his own method.

295
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,250
But if I may offer
my own opinion,

296
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,458
I'd say slitting open
the victim's stomach

297
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,958
is the most efficient way
to recover the jewel.

298
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,541
Since there appear to be
no more questions,

299
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,333
I will declare
the tournament open

300
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,666
and wish you twelve
warriors good luck!

301
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,875
[MISAKI]
'Scuse me! Can I have a moment?

302
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,375
I have an idea.
Under the rules he gave,

303
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,541
I don't think any
of us have to die.

304
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,333
[TOSHIKO] Well, aren't you the
brave, selfless one.

305
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,208
Foolish Monkey.

306
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,875
Let me guess:
You want to rig the battle,

307
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,750
then have the ultimate winner
wish everyone back to life?

308
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,250
Hell, it's probably even
more ridiculous than that!

309
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,875
[TOSHIKO]
Don't waste our time.

310
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,250
Why would any of us ever
use something so powerful

311
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,833
on a bunch of people
we don't even know?!

312
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,416
Raise your hand if you're
interested in hearing my plan?

313
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,875
[TOSHIKO] There's no way any of
them want to join some scheme

314
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,625
to become "super best friends"--

315
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,416
--[TSUGI clears throat]
--[TOSHIKO] Who was that?

316
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,666
[TSUGI] So, yeah, if...
if no one has to die,

317
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,916
then I think that's kinda
for the best. Yeah.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,083
We let you kill us...

319
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,041
[TOSHIKO]
His voice. It's very familiar.

320
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,791
[TSUGI] ...you use
your wish to bring us back.

321
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,125
That's you're big idea...

322
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,708
[TOSHIKO]
No. I'm just hearing things.

323
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,958
[MISAKI] If I suggested that,
I'm guessing most of you

324
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,458
would have concerns
about whether

325
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
I'd go through
with reviving you.

326
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,666
My plan offers something more
secure than just a promise.

327
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,166
[TOSHIKO]
Uh. Good lord.

328
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,208
She's really going
for the soft sell.

329
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,666
But they'll see it through it.

330
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,500
It's nothing more than
a monkey's trick.

331
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:01,125
[TOSHIKO gasps]
No. You've got to be kidding.

332
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,958
I underestimated her.

333
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,291
Right out of the gates,
there's an alliance.

334
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,666
And they've got
the Ox on their side.

335
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,000
I better put an end
to this before it ends me.

336
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,083
I'm in.

337
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
[YOSHIMI]
Mmm.

338
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,666
--[TOSHIKO chuckles] Hilarious.
--[MISAKI] Okay. That's fine.

339
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,750
So right now, it's me
and the two pacifists.

340
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,875
[TOSHIKO] What exactly
makes you think a creep

341
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,875
holding a bloody knife
is a pacifist?

342
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,125
[MISAKI]
Well, Sleepyhead get up.

343
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,833
Hey! Bunny Ears!

344
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,250
Your team's over here! C'mon!

345
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,500
[TOSHIKO]
What the hell?

346
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,041
[TOSHIKO]
I'm impressed.

347
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,333
You guys are smarter
than you look.

348
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,958
I'd hide in a giant
dust cloud, too,

349
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,208
if I was about to face me.

350
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,250
I haven't yet decided
who's responsible for

351
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,500
collapsing the floor,
but I do know

352
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,791
I'll have to tread
carefully around them.

353
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,166
[TOSHIKO]
Was it the Sheep?

354
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,333
Was it even
caused by explosives?

355
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,833
Or did they bring down the floor

356
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,250
with some kind of special power?

357
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,291
Well, whomever did it, I'll
have to thank before I kill.

358
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,000
It was positively
delightful seeing

359
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,375
Team Monkey cut off
at the knees.

360
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,833
[TOSHIKO]
Mm.

361
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,541
[TOSHIKO]
I know you're there!

362
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,458
Be a good sport
and come out and face me!

363
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,458
[USAGI] Aw, man. I would've
been happy fighting anyone,

364
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,333
but you know what they say.

365
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
Nothing good ever happens
when you start a fight

366
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,375
with unfinished business
weighing you down.

367
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,750
Oh, jeez!

368
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,125
[TOSHIKO]
Even the stupid Monkey gang

369
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,125
would have been
preferable to this creep.

370
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,208
Hopefully I can squeeze
some fun out of him

371
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,166
before fillin' him with holes.

372
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,458
[USAGI] State-of-mind is so
important when you're a warrior.

373
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,541
I've been bothered ever since
you suspected me

374
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,041
of killing that guy.

375
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,416
Without any proof!
You're an awful person!

376
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,791
[TOSHIKO]
I'd say his state-of-mind's

377
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,958
been in question from the start.

378
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,958
Still, he does seem like one
of the more capable ones.

379
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,708
He could probably dominate
every one of the twelve,

380
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,708
except Ox and myself.

381
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,250
I'll begin with
an opening volley

382
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,916
from Aishu and Inochigoi.

383
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,416
I'll keep my distance
to maintain the advantage.

384
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,750
[USAGI laughing]

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,750
[TOSHIKO]
Dodge.

386
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,125
Then pretend
I'm out of ammo...

387
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,458
...to draw him in close.

388
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,208
And then use the
Infinite Fire of Non-Reload

389
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,250
to finish him off.

390
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,958
All that's left will be
to carve the jewel

391
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,875
out of his belly and
move onto the next one.

392
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,375
Regrettable that you'll
die first, but maybe order

393
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,250
doesn't matter
when I'll kill you all!

394
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,666
Killing bountifully.
Inonoshishi. I'm the Boar!

395
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,458
Killing psychotically.
I'm the Rabbit Usagi.

396
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,083
[TOSHIKO]
You're a brave little bunny,

397
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,291
but bravery still
isn't enough to beat--

398
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,125
[TOSHIKO groans]

399
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,458
[TOSHIKO]
Someone's... helping him?

400
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,333
[gasps]

401
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,875
[TOSHIKO]
Who?

402
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,541
[TOSHIKO gasps]

403
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,458
You're a... Necromancer?

404
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,625
Technically, "Necromantist."

405
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,333
That means I have the power
to make the people I kill

406
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,375
into my personal zombies.

407
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,583
I'm sorry I lied about
killing the snake warrior--

408
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,125
really, I am!

409
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,458
[TOSHIKO]
I wasn't fooled by your lie.

410
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,583
You were holding
the murder weapon!

411
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,416
I can't believe I'm dying here.

412
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,333
At the hands of this freak!

413
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,666
I thought you might have had
my special power figured out,

414
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,375
so I had to be careful.

415
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,250
But, hey, listen to me, okay?

416
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,000
You're gonna forgive me
for all this lying and killing,

417
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,666
because I'm making you
my new friend.

418
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,916
[DUO] They say that when
a barking dog catches you,

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,583
he won't bite. But what
does the biting dog do?

420
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,583
He doesn't bark. He laughs.

421
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,291
Next time:
"Tricks Both Mongrel and Fowl."

422
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,958
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
