[MIZARU]
Wonderful, Sharyu.

5
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,166
Effortlessly bisecting
such a large rock

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,833
simply by transforming
one plane within it to sand.

7
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,083
Elegant indeed.

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,875
[IWAZARU] It would seem
you've already reached

9
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,833
the level at which
you can easily transmute

10
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,333
any substance between
physical states.

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,083
[KIKAZARU] We have trained many
great pupils in our time,

12
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,250
but your mastery of these skills
is quite unprecedented.

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,208
I'm honored by your words.
Thank you, Masters.

14
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,416
Well, it appears there
is nothing more for us

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,875
to teach you, my child.

16
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,666
Now go forth out into
the world, and do as you will.

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,333
You alone shall decide how you
will wield this immense power.

18
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,041
We shall not interfere.

19
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,416
Sirs. I wish to use it
to transmute all things.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,000
For the benefit of all things,
and for all people.

21
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,333
From this day forward,
I want to dedicate my life

22
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,500
to eradicating the folly
of killing from this world.

23
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,875
You did say it was
up to her, right?

24
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,166
Unspeaking Rock?

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,541
Actually, I believe
Unhearing Vapor said that.

26
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,500
Huh. I don't recall for certain.

27
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,833
Though it does sound like
something I might say.

28
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,708
[MIZARU] Regardless,
among the three of us,

29
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,875
no discord can be found
in our knowledge,

00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,750
personalities,
or emotional states.

31
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,333
In truth, I am at a loss
to think of any reason

32
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,333
why we three should not be one.

33
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,375
After all, we never argue.

34
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,333
[KIKAZARU] If the world
were made more like us,

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,333
there would be
no conflict at all, however.

36
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,833
[MIZARU] The world is an
unfeeling place, Sharyu.

37
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,750
I understand how cruel
the world can be,

38
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,500
and I know it won't
be easy, but still.

39
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,875
I won't know what's possible
until I try, right?

40
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,875
[TSUGI]
That scheming girl.

41
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,791
Or maybe "timid"
is a better word for her.

42
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,708
Either way, she's prob'ly
dead by now.

43
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,041
[MISAKI] Hm? Wait, why would
you say something like that?

44
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,500
Are you a psychic?

45
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,166
Is that one of the special
talents as a warrior?

46
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,833
I wouldn't call it a talent.

47
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,583
I mean, it's just...

48
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,041
Y'know how they say that us Rats

49
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,833
always know when
to flee a sinking ship?

50
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,750
Well, maybe we can
read impending doom

51
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,083
on a person's face, too.

52
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,458
But hey, if that chick does
bite it, it's all your fault.

53
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
You know that, don't you?

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,875
My fault? Now how
do you figure that?

55
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,875
She may not have
looked like all that much,

56
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,500
but she was still
a part of this.

57
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,166
I mean, she had to
have some skills

58
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,666
to be chosen
for the Juni Taisen.

59
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,500
But then, the whole time
that you were talking to her,

60
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,791
she just kept growing
weaker and weaker.

61
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,125
A warrior who
started out only timid,

62
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,500
became truly powerless.

63
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,208
Your boundless optimism
disarmed her.

64
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,583
To a trickster like her,
your genuineness was deadly.

65
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,916
Uh, hey, Nezumi, maybe I'm
being overly sensitive here,

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,666
but it kinda feels like you're
trying to pick a fight with me.

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,458
I'm sorry. I'm slow on the
uptake with things like that.

68
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,791
Okay. In that case,
I'll drop the subject.

69
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,166
Maybe I can read death
on people's faces,

70
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,541
but I can't read minds.

71
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,500
FYI. You won't reform me
no matter what.

72
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,208
So don't worry about that.

73
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,000
But for real, how do you
see this playing out?

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,666
I mean, no offense or nothin',
but if that girl is dead,

75
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,708
then we're down four warriors.

76
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,083
And those are just
the ones we're aware of.

77
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,833
That's a third of us.

78
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,416
Can your peaceful plan still
work with those numbers?

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,166
Sure it can! Just a
shame that there are

80
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
fewer people to save.

81
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,791
But you seem to be operating
under a false assumption,

82
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,541
so let me clear
things up for ya.

83
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,125
The fact of the matter is, I
have more than one plan in mind.

84
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,708
Is that so?

85
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,208
I may be a hopeless optimist,
but I'm not so naïve

86
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,375
as to think I could end the Juni
Taisen without back-up plans.

87
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,750
[TSUGI] Hmm. Well, guess
I never really thought about

88
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,791
how to end a war before.

89
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,166
So maybe I oughta
just leave that to you.

90
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,666
--Hey, Nezumi.
--[TSUGI] Yeah?

91
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,583
I'm starting to get the feeling
that you don't really

92
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,750
want to stop the war, do you?

93
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,666
Plus, earlier you said that
you would never be reformed.

94
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,041
So I gotta ask:
then why'd you raise your hand

95
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,666
and agree to my peace proposal
if you're not even a pacifist?

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,833
Well, a peace agreement
is one thing,

97
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,208
it's just the peace
itself that I hate.

98
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
'Cause when I'm not out
there on the battlefield,

99
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,875
I've gotta go to this
normal boring high school.

100
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,916
It's full of trash people,
all of 'em numbed by peace.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,833
When I think about
risking my life to protect

102
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,750
the anesthetized lifestyle
of those ungrateful brats,

103
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,708
I get sick to my stomach.

104
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
Don't you ever get tired of it?

105
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,166
I bet no one in the world

106
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,000
has saved as many people
as you have.

107
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,916
But that means, according to
the law of averages anyway,

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,916
that you've saved
a lot of garbage, too.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And who knows.
Maybe being saved is what

110
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,666
turns 'em into garbage.

111
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,208
They start to think
that fighting and killing

112
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,250
are jobs for someone else to do.

113
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,125
Hate to admit it, but truth is,
the more I protect 'em,

114
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,833
the more I wanna kill 'em.

115
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,208
So what do you say
to that, pacifist?

116
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,166
How do you justify defending
the entitled scum of the earth?

117
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,000
[MISAKI] He has a childish
sensitivity to him.

118
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,416
But I guess that's
part of being a teenager.

119
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,458
Still, it'd be too glib
to dismiss his concerns with a

120
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,041
"You'll understand
when you're older."

121
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,416
[MAN 4A] Look, how many times do
I have to explain this to you?

122
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,125
There's no problem here.
We have nothing to argue about.

123
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,333
That land has belonged
to our country for centuries!

124
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,000
It's as plain
and simple as that!

125
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,916
If we have no problem here,
then why are our

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,833
respective nations still
locked in a bloody battle?

127
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,291
Because your people stubbornly
refuse to accept the facts.

128
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,958
[WOMAN 4A] It's you
that can't accept facts.

129
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
[MAN 4A] I'm telling you,
your country is the--

130
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,041
This bickering gets us nowhere.

131
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,208
[MISAKI]
May I interject?

132
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,458
I, too, believe that
this conflict can't be

133
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,000
easily resolved anytime soon.

134
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,625
So, I'm not suggesting an end
to fighting, but a ceasefire.

135
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,541
Ceasefire? Absolutely not.

136
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,041
We've long since
passed the point where

137
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,708
we can just keep kicking
the can down the road.

138
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,625
I've been told
you have a reputation

139
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,250
for getting results
in tense situations.

140
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,250
I understand you've
helped bring peace in over

141
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,541
300 international conflicts
and 200 civil wars.

142
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,875
There's no question
about your qualifications.

143
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,583
Thank you, I appreciate that.

144
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,541
But the reason we're
fighting is complicated.

145
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,500
Perhaps more complex
than you're used to.

146
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,291
You should know that by now.

147
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,333
May I direct
your attention there?

148
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,250
This is all about the region
between your two countries.

149
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
If I'm not mistaken,
the dispute over that region

150
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,458
has been raging
for well over 70 years.

151
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,833
This ongoing battle,
with no willing compromise

152
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,583
on either side,
has become unproductive.

153
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,333
"Unproductive."
That's putting it mildly.

154

Fine, but let me say this!

159

My country is legally in
the right here, and that's...

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
What I was trying to say is,

161
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,541
negotiations between
the two parties

162
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,833
have proven to be unproductive.

163

[WOMAN 4A] Under the treaty
that we agreed to a century ago,

164
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,125
your government acknowledged
that the land belonged to us.

165
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,875
[MISAKI] I have a feeling that
the reason you've both

166
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,875
continued fighting
for so long is less about

167
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,208
protecting the wellbeing
of your people

168
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,833
and more about
preserving national pride.

169
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,041
Listen here. It's a fact
that they're the ones

170
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,708
who attacked first. We had
no desire to wage a war.

171
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,666
Then why don't <i>you</i> be
the first ones to lay down

your arms so you can end it?

173
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,583
We can't just drop our defenses

We have a right

Please, stop.

either of your
countries, right?

[WOMAN 4A]
That was a long time ago.

179
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,875
The nation it used to be was
broken up and lost its autonomy,

180

I'm sorry to interrupt.

Our army's had a sudden
rash of deserters.

What'd you say?

189
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,458
[MAN 4B] They armed
themselves and declared that

they were renouncing the war.

Countless others have
followed suit. There's more.

What's going on?

Uh, please forgive me,
but an urgent matter has

00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,750
come to my attention that I
have to deal with immediately.

202
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,041
Perhaps--

203
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,625
[MISAKI] Are the front-line
soldiers deserting

204
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,166
and calling for a ceasefire?

205
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,041
Wait a minute. Don't tell me
you were behind this?

206
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,916
[MISAKI] They're the
descendants of the country

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,166
that used to exist there.

208
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,708
And together, they're
repudiating your war

209
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,625
and choosing independence
for themselves instead.

210
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,250
[MAN 4C] So you really
think your plan will work?

211
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,666
Well, look, both countries'
armies are already exhausted.

212
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,583
If you reduce their
forces even further,

213
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,875
and get public opinion
on your side,

214
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,333
a ceasefire's inevitable.

215
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
It's true that the soldiers
on the front lines

216
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,666
are fatigued and demoralized.

217
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,750
But I'm not convinced
we can come together

218
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,583
after so much blood has
been spilled on both sides.

219
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,708
I'm sure there'll be grudges.

220
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,041
But I'll bet
every single one of 'em

221
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,041
are as sick of
this war as you are.

222
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,583
A ceasefire and a promise
to restore our homeland.

223
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,916
[MISAKI] I don't know
how much I can do to help,

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,750
but I'll give it my best shot.

225
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,083
And as in all things,

00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,375
you won't know what's
possible until you try.

227
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,750
While you two were focused
on these fruitless talks,

228
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,208
bickering over old grievances,
you turned a blind eye

229
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
to the soldiers fighting
your war for you.

230

How they were
suffering and dying.

231
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,125
It was your pride and
negligence that led you

232

to this current predicament.

233
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,583
And by the way, this is
no longer just a matter

00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,666
involving your
two countries alone.

235

the message far and wide.

[PEOPLE cheering]

239
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,750
[MISAKI] Eventually, the two
sides did bury the hatchet.

240
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,333
Unfortunately, they buried it

241
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,083
right in the backs
of the rebels.

242
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,000
The allied forces
have joined together,

243
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,083
taking up arms
in the disputed territory

244
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,583
to suppress
the insurgent uprising.

245
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,291
The formation of a
third faction, the rebel army,

246
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,916
was designated
a severe threat

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,833
by the generals
of the allied forces

248
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,166
who then commenced a large-scale
search-and-destroy operation.

249
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,375
Fighting has subsided
throughout most of the region,

250
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,708
however some...

251
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,958
[MISAKI] I wish I could
tell you otherwise,

252
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:45,458
but this happens all the time.

253
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,000
Me getting emotional over it
doesn't help anyone.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,750
All I can do is respond
honestly with candor

255
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,208
based on everything that
I've seen and experienced.

256
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,666
So you see,
I don't make peace with it.

257
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,750
I carry it with me. Forever.

258
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,708
[TSUGI] Ah, gotcha.
How very saintly of you.

259
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,291
But it's not gonna
speak to the masses.

260
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,375
I mean, you put all this
time and energy into

261
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,500
negotiating peace, and proposing
ceasefires or whatever.

262
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,791
But like, if you just used
your power to instantaneously

263
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,458
end all the fighting, like,
"Bam, it's over,"

264
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,666
wouldn't you be able
to save even more lives

265
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,750
and in way less time?

266
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,416
What does that mean?

267
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,666
It means, you may be the
exception, but otherwise,

268
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,125
the kinds of people who
participate in the Juni Taisen,

269
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,250
myself included,
we're not exactly...

270
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,791
I guess what I'm asking is,
why would you put yourself

271
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,666
through hell
trying to save our lives?

272
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,291
The world would be
much better off

273
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:03,125
if every last one of us monsters
died as quickly as possible.

274
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,541
We fighters are the only ones
who could find any meaning

275
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:10,458
in this war--a war for which
an entire city was evacuated.

276
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,458
Almost no one knows
about the Juni Taisen.

277
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,291
But if they did, I bet they'd
all say something like,

278
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,625
"I hope every last one
of those bastards croaks

279
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,750
so we can be done with it."

280
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,125
Y'know how people say,

281
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,250
"Each and every life
is a precious gift"

282
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,083
or "Nobody is
entirely evil," right?

283
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,750
Well, those are just
the platitudes

284
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,000
of those who're
blind to reality.

285
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,333
How sad. If that's the
conclusion you've come to then,

286
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,083
honestly, I really think
you should just give up

287
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,833
on being a warrior right now.

288
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,416
You're not qualified
to be on the battlefield.

289
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,583
[TSUGI]
Huh.

290
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,208
Also, earlier you said
something about how nobody

291
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,666
has saved as many
people as I have.

292
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,125
Then it follows that
no one's failed to save

293
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,333
as many people
as I have either.

294
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:02,083
There are so many lives I tried
to save, but wasn't able to.

295
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,541
Far more than I could
ever count.

296
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,041
And more than I could ever
begin to forget.

297
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,000
I've seen nation
after nation fall to ruin.

298
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,833
I've seen slaughter on top
of endless slaughter.

299
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,500
Horrific crimes against humanity
are burned into my brain.

300
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,083
Hunting down people,
institutionalized slavery,

301
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,500
civil war, immoral weaponry,
human trafficking,

302
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,041
senicide, patricide,
infanticide, ethnic genocide,

303
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,333
destruction of
cultural heritage sites,

304
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,750
prejudice and discrimination,
revenge and retaliation,

305
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,333
subjugation of women,
the theft of resources,

306
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,250
famine and epidemics.

307
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,000
I've seen those things again,
and again, and again,

308
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,250
and again, and again,
and again, and again,

309
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,750
and again, and again, and again.

310
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,333
I've seen them all.
I've looked them in the eye.

311
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,625
I've faced that reality.

312
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,750
Yet despite it all, I still
speak those platitudes.

313
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,416
I still choose to do what I do.

314
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,166
I choose to stop wars
with the power of my words.

315
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,333
And yeah, I've been through some
terrible things myself, too.

316
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,750
But I won't let that stop me
from getting along with people.

317
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,458
Ideally, I'd like
to find happiness

318
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,250
with everybody
in the whole world.

319
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,750
So don't sell
platitudes short, okay?

320
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,166
[MISAKI'S BOYFRIEND]
Need some help?

321
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,625
Nah. Thanks, but it means
more if I make it myself.

322
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,583
Sure. Okay.

323
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,625
[door creaks]

324
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,166
[door knob clicks]

325
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,125
--Hey.
--[MISAKI] Mm?

326
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,375
Uh, nothing, sorry.

327
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,291
No, tell me.

328
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,833
Well, I was just gonna say that

329
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,875
I know you're
leaving again soon.

330
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,958
And I--I don't see you
as some badass warrior.

331
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,291
To me, you're just Misaki Yuki.

332
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,333
The person sitting here
who makes pastries--

333
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,500
she's the one I love.

334
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,666
And I want to protect
this life we have together.

335
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,375
I just wish that was enough.

336
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,791
I know, and I feel
the same way.

337
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,458
I wanna protect
this life we have, too.

338
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,750
That's why I go out
and fight on battlefields.

339
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,583
Sorry. I get it, I do.

340
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,791
It's just that
the house feels so...

341
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,416
...empty when you're
always having to--

342
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,208
Baby, if you're gonna love me,

343
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,416
I need you to be
stronger for me.

344
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,708
'Cause when it's over, I will
be coming back home to you.

345
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,958
Ya got that?

346
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,125
[MISAKI]
This is a battle in itself.

347
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:09,208
Maybe I took it
a little bit too far.

348
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,250
[MISAKI]
What should I do now?

349
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,000
[RYOKA] I know for a fact
that Boar and Dog are gone.

350
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,625
Oh, and Snake died
before the tournament began,

351
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,333
so that's at least
three warriors

352
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,333
already out of the running.

353
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,291
[MISAKI] If Chicken's dead,
that leaves only six,

354
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,375
not including Nezumi and myself.

355
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,666
Some might call me naïve
for thinking this,

356
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,958
but it seems unusual to have
so many highly aggressive

357
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:38,250
fighters competing in this
sort of battle royale.

358
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,625
Sure, having any wish
granted's a tempting prize,

359
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,375
but you'd think just
about all of those guys

360
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,875
would be capable of granting
most wishes for themselves.

361
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,625
So, this Warrior of the Rabbit.
He's the most dangerous one.

362
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,708
His Necromantistry lets him--

363
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,291
It means that he can...
well, y'know.

364
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,583
He makes zombie slaves
by re-animating the dead.

365
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,291
[MISAKI]
If he has a power like that,

366
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,291
why even bother
with this contest?

367
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,458
Well, participation
is mandatory,

368
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,458
so I guess he couldn't say no.

369
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,625
[sighs]

370
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,541
[MISAKI]
I need to make up my mind.

371
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,708
Should I bide my time
down here a little longer,

372
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,833
or head up to the surface?

373
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,958
Sooner or later I'll need to--

374
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,958
[MISAKI]
Nezumi, get up!

375
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,083
[TSUGI] Ow. I thought
you were against violence.

376
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:53,000
What is that?
Looks like a dead bird.

377
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,958
[MISAKI]
Dead? The Necromantist!

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,250
This is looking pretty bad.
There're way too many of 'em.

379
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,208
And in a festering
disease pit like this place,

380
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,541
even the smallest scratch
could give us tetanus.

381
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,541
--[MISAKI] We're leaving!
--[TSUGI] Hey, wait!

382
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,625
Let go, I can run
on my own just fine!

383
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,708
[MISAKI] The Snake!
Rabbit's zombie slave.

384
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,708
But the weapon he's using.

385
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,333
[TSUGI]
Uh.

386
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,875
Killing psychotically.
Warrior of the Rabbit, Usagi.

387
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,333
[MISAKI]
I have no choice.

388
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,416
Nezumi, you think
you can handle the Snake?

389
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,208
Wait a minute.
So you're gonna fight now?

390
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,375
Even though I'm
a pacifist at heart,

391
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,541
that doesn't mean
I won't defend myself.

392
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,166
I'll restrain
them both peacefully,

393
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,083
and then we can
talk it out rationally.

394
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,250
[TSUGI] Really? You wanna
restrain them peacefully.

395
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:31,041
That sounds like way more
work than just killing them.

396
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,625
[TSUGI] Damn. Why's it always
gotta be like this with you?

397
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,583
[MISAKI]
Hm? "Always"? We just met!

398
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,125
Doesn't take too long
to figure out

399
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
what someone's always like.

400
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,416
Oh, fine, I'm in.

401
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,208
Killing peacefully.
Warrior of the Monkey. Sharyu.

402
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:50,375
Killing all.
Warrior of the Rat. Nezumi.

403
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,083
[USAGI chuckling]

404
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,625
[DUO]
There's an old saying,

405
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,250
"Advertise mutton,
sell dog meat."

406
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,250
Meaning goods are worth
what people will pay for them.

407
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,833
Next time:
"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing."

408
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,083
Everyone!
Give yourselves a hand!
