clear out the entire population

of the city just for
one night, didn't they?

I don't know if everyone
made it out of there in time.

You're worried about
the guys tryin' to kill us?

24
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,250
Ah. Good point. For now,
let's just try to find a place

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,166
where we can lay low.

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,333
[MISAKI]
Yeah, that'll do.

27

[MISAKI] Hah. No one's going
to be looking for us down here.

By the way, thanks for
agreeing to my peace treaty.

00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,791
[TSUGI] No problem.
I mean, that is the reason

30
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,458
you saved me, isn't it?

31
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,875
[MISAKI]
True.

32
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,916
I just realized we haven't
introduced ourselves yet.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,750
I'm Sharyu. Warrior of
the Monkey. Killing peacefully.

34
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,958
I'm Nezumi. Warrior of
the Rat. Killing all.

35
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,375
[MISAKI] Huh. You're awfully
young, aren't you?

36
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,916
Though if you were chosen to
participate in the Juni Taisen,

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I guess you must at least be
a halfway decent warrior.

38
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,083
Well, maybe, but when
it comes to fighters,

39
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
I think everyone
has their own standard

40
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,916
for what makes
a "decent" one, right?

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,708
[MISAKI] Dealing with children
can be such a pain.

42
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,375
[TSUGI] Hey, you're pretty
powerful, aren't you?

43
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
[MISAKI]
Hm? Well, powerful enough

44
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,375
to defend myself, I should hope.

45
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,083
You don't have to be so modest.
I mean, you were the one

46
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,458
who blew up the floor,
weren't you?

47
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,750
Miss Sharyu?

48
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,041
[MISAKI]
Oh? He figured it out, huh?

49
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,833
[TSUGI] See, I'm thinkin'
someone saw you

50
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,791
putting together that alliance
and felt threatened.

51
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,958
They were about to launch a
first strike to try and stop it.

52
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,458
But you sensed
something was up

53
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,333
and protected us
by taking out the floor,

54
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,625
causing enough chaos
for us to slip away.

55
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,708
Am I right?

56
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,916
[MISAKI]
Well, yeah, more or less.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,291
[MISAKI]
But I didn't just "sense" it,

58
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,791
or anything as vague
and subjective as that.

59
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,250
Someone in that room
was emitting

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,500
a palpable urge to kill.

61
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,333
That means one of the
other warriors wanted to end

62
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,416
the Juni Taisen with
a bloodthirsty approach

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,375
that was the polar opposite
of my peaceful solution.

64
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,166
And I couldn't have that.

65
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,750
[SUMI]
Ooh... and down we go.

66
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,791
[SUMI] Seems most of 'em used
the commotion as a cover

67
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,666
so they could hide out,
at least for the time being.

68
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,583
There are no strict boundaries

69
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,333
to the Juni Taisen
playing field.

70
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,958
Why, I've heard contestants
can even leave the country,

71
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,458
if they desire.

72
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,291
In fact, the man who won
the last tournament, Boar,

73
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,250
managed to turn the
competition around in his favor

74
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,833
specifically by traveling
to a densely populated area.

75
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,875
But with a ticking clock
dictated by this poison

76
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,041
we've got swimming around
inside our bellies,

77
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,291
I doubt anyone'll stray
too far from this city.

78
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,791
Sooner or later, this old-timer
here will get another chance

79
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,250
to use this "Old-Timer"
that I cobbled together.

80
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,375
Tick, tick, tick,
just a matter of time.

[laughing]

82
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,250
[KANAE] Now where the hell did
that bastard get off to?

83
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,416
Well, hello there!
Hello, hello, hello!

and then reduced to serving

85
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,958
as somebody else's
sad little puppet.

86
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,666

The rules of this year's Taisen

state the winner
has to nab each

92
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,083
of the poison jewels
we all swallowed.

93
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,375
That little twelve-hour
time bomb is gonna make it

94
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,208
hard to fall back on
the tried-and-true strategy

95
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,833
of just laying low early on.

96
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,041
Ha, that's not my style.

97

[sniffs]

98
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,083
If everyone's doing one thing,
I do the opposite.

99
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,833
That's me.

100
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,500
[MICHIO] Over the years,
I've been happy

101
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,416
to let the world believe
that my special power

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,875
is the savage
Mad Dog's Vise bite.

103
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,416
But the thing that truly
separates us Dog warriors

104
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,583
from the pack is the venom
secreted from our fangs.

105
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,208
'Course, anyone who gets
a taste of it winds up dead,

106
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,666
which tends to keep
the word from spreading.

107
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,875
I produce the toxins
in my own body,

108
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,458
and then inject 'em into
my enemy's bloodstream.

109
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,750
Side effects may include
death, death,

110
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,208
and horrifically violent death.

111
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,708
Of course, a bite is a bite,
so to say that biting

112
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,708
is my go-to move
isn't technically a lie.

113
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,958
[growls]

114
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,791
[MICHIO]
Given my expertise in the area,

115
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:21,000
I could tell right away that
the jewel was a type of poison.

116
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,833
And since I knew that, I had
my body prepare an antidote

117
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,916
to neutralize it before
I even popped it in my mouth.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,916
Cheating? Sure,
you could call it that,

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,125
but ask me if
I feel guilty about it.

120
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,166
When I see an advantage,
I seize it

121
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,666
and use it to the fullest.

122
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,166
Besides, it seems
we have a pretty

123
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,833
bloodthirsty bunch
this time around.

124
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,875
They'll prob'ly thin out
their own numbers up front,

125
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,250
so for now, I'll just
hang back and wait. Gladly.

126
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,708
Waiting is what a dog does best.

127
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll wait till they're down
to the last two or three.

128
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,083
Got the perfect hiding
spot here, so why--

Oh. There you are!

Um, hi there.

135
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,166
[MISAKI]
There we go.

136
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,083
By the way, about before.

137
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,833
It's not like I was trying
to hide the fact that

138
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,833
I was the one who made
the floor go all kablooey

139
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,666
back at the tower.
But, y'know...

140
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,333
Okay, yeah, maybe I was.

141
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,083
It's just, I knew you'd look at
me that way if I'd told you.

142
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,833
[TSUGI] I'm not sure what way
you're talkin' about.

143
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,750
I mean, this is just how
my face looks all the time.

144
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,708
But more importantly,

145
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,083
do you know who
was comin' after you?

146
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
[MISAKI] No, I don't. There
wasn't a whole lot of time

147
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,666
to investigate.
Took all I had just to

148
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,708
make sure everyone could escape.

149
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,458
There ya go, playin' all
modest again.

150
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,666
Bet if you'd wanted to,
you coulda easily ID'd them

151
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,708
and even obliterated 'em
right on the spot.

152
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,250
You're more than capable
of that, aren't you?

153
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,833
[MISAKI] Yeah, that's true.
I could have.

154
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:12,125
But I choose not to
use my power like that.

155
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,416
You'll learn there are
far more appropriate ways

156
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,083
to exercise great power, Nezumi.

157
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,416
Appropriate, huh?

158
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,166
[yawns]

159
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
[TSUGI]
Given the circumstances,

160
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,125
I'd say the mystery
aggressor was the one

161
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,333
acting more appropriately.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,625
[growling]

163
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,583
[RYOKA] Uuh! Please
don't get the wrong idea!

164
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,000
Really, I have no desire
to hurt you--I swear!

165
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,458
[MICHIO] What the hell
is this brat thinking?

166
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,750
She was in the perfect
position for an ambush!

167
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,666
Oh right, where are my manners?

168
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,375
I'm Niwatori, the Chicken.

169
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,291
I came here because I was, uh...

170
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, I was hoping
we could team up.

171
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,708
Team up, eh?

172
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,583
[MICHIO] That's right.
She tried to accept

173
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,875
the Monkey's offer, too.

174
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,083
For such a timid little
waif, that's one hell

175
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,833
of a flashy outfit.
Like a costume someone

176
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,833
picked out and made her wear.

177
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:16,333
Sent in to the Juni Taisen
against her will, maybe?

178
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Team up? With you?

179
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,416
[RYOKA] Uh huh.
Things may have gotten off

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,541
to a rocky start
back there, but, but--uh!

181
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,791
In a battle royale, you should
obviously try to form

182
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,041
a solid alliance quickly, right?

183
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,250
[MICHIO] Oh, yeah? If that
was such a brilliant idea,

184
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,833
the Monkey wouldn't have been
the only idiot who suggested it.

185
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,916
Everyone knows there can
only be one winner here.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,625
Doesn't she get that teamwork
and betrayal go hand in hand?

187
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,708
Besides, can't see what
I'd get outta working with

188
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,250
a scrawny, obnoxious
flibbertigibbet like her.

189
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,125
Still, if we go at it now
and somehow I end up wounded,

190
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,833
that's not good for me, either.

191
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
I don't want to have
even the slightest chance

192
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,916
of getting eliminated early.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,291
My best move here
might be to pretend like

194
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm teaming up with this girl,
and then slay her

195
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,375
before we run into anyone else.

196
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,083
[RYOKA] So, can we go now?
We're kinda in trouble here!

197
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,333
Big trouble!

198
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,916
You know that creepy
half-naked guy

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
with the bunny ears?

200
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,833
I know this sounds crazy,
but he's a Necromantist!

201
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
A Necromantist?

202
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
He killed the Boar! And now
with her walking corpse,

203
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
he's got a three-person team!

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,208
How do you know?

205
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,916
[RYOKA] Well, I have
this secret ability

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,916
called Eye of the Cormorant.

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,291
It allows me to communicate
with all of the birds

208
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,166
in the sky, and see
everything they see.

209
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,666
And that's how I found
your hiding spot down here.

210
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,000
[MICHIO] That pigeon.
It was her filthy little spy.

211
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,083
This birdbrained chick
is even dumber than she looks!

212
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,125
Blabbing about her
"secret" ability to someone

213
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,958
she's just met.
And a rival, no less!

214
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,083
But that Rabbit warrior
is the real problem right now.

215
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,750
A Necromantist. I thought
they were just a myth.

216
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,041
The more they slaughter,

217
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,083
the more they
expand their ranks.

218
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,208
A killer who
creates more killers.

219
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,291
She'll be a cinch to beat,
so I can always take her out

220
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,833
whenever I want.

221
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,791
I'll get all the use I can outta
the girl, then discard her.

222
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,125
But first things first.

223
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
[RYOKA]
So if we just combine our--

224
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,875
--[MICHIO] Niwatori.
--Yes?

225
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,916
[MICHIO] Do you by chance
know where the Rabbit is now?

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,041
Yes, of course I do.

227
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,541
I've been tracking him.

228
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,791
I had the birds keep their
distance so he wouldn't notice,

229
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,083
but keeping tabs on him
should be our first priority,

230
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,750
don't you think?

231
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,375
All right, fine.
Given the circumstances,

232
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,875
I've decided I'll go along
with your little plan.

233
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,375
[MICHIO]
But make no mistake about

234
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,875
who's in charge here, girlie.

235
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,958
Wait, do you mean that we are--?

236
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,541
[MICHIO] That's right,
let's go hunt some rabbit.

237
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,750
[RYOKA]
Oh, yay! That's awesome!

238
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
With you and I working together,
we can win this thing!

239
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,208
You won't regret this,
I promise!

240
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,791
[MICHIO]
Don't get used to it.

241
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,458
Our partnership ends the second

242
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,958
the Rabbit's zombie squad
is destroyed.

243
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,666
I should formally
introduce myself!

244
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,250
Niwatori. Warrior of the
Chicken, killing by pecking!

245
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,625
Dotsuku. Warrior of the Dog,
killing by biting.

246
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,250
[MICHIO] Now it's time
to figure out how to

247
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,083
best use this girl
to my advantage.

248
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,708
[RYOKA]
You know the song that goes,

249
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,541
♪ "We ran through those
mountains full of rabbit, ♪

250
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,291
♪ we fished in those
rivers full of carp," ♪

251
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,250
and the joke about how it
sounds like it's the people

252
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,208
who are full of rabbit,
not the mountains,

253
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,291
even though clearly
that's not what they meant?

254
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,708
But I was thinking,
since the next line

255
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,291
is about catching fish,

256
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,250
they probably caught and ate
a lot of the rabbits, too,

257
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,166
so maybe they really were
full of rabbits,

258
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,500
just like the mountains were...

259
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,375
[MICHIO] If you wanna gab,
then why don't you start

260
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,958
by telling me everything you
know about the other fighters.

261
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,333
Sure!

262
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,208
The only ones <i>I</i> know
anything about are

263
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,916
Ox, Dragon, Snake,
Monkey, and Boar.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,750
Just those five.

265
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,416
The most dangerous among them
is Ox, without question.

266
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
How shall I put this this?

267
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:01,000
He's simply more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

268
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,125
He crushes every foe
he meets on the battlefield.

269
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,166
People call him
the Natural-Born Slayer.

270
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,166
Well, that sounds horrifying.

271
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,083
I'm sure he's gotta be
one of the favorites

272
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,541
to win this thing. If a fighter
like you runs into him,

273
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,166
my advice would be
to run like hell.

274
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,291
[RYOKA]
Mhmm.

275
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,791
[MICHIO]
Not that it really matters.

276
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,916
Whether you're killed
by the Ox or by me,

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,375
you're still gonna end up dead.

278
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,708
Lemme see. Not much to say
'bout the Tatsumi brothers,

279
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,333
Dragon and Snake.

280
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,041
They're a pair of twins
who make a terrifying team.

281
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,208
But since one of em's
already dead,

282
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,916
their threat level's
cut in half.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,666
Haha. Literally.

284
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,666
Got it. So, who else then?

285
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,916
Well, as you saw,
Monkey's a pacifist

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,666
and all-around do-gooder.

287
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,833
A disgrace to the warrior name.

288
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,916
She makes a living
running into combat zones,

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,916
trying to negotiate
peaceful resolutions.

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,333
Her mediation has
resulted in ceasefires,

291
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,916
prematurely ending countless
perfectly good wars.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,208
Sure, that broad may be
a warrior for hire like us,

293
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,916
but she's also a huge threat
to our business.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,291
She's probably only
doin' the Juni Taisen

295
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,791
to bring about an end
to this war, as well.

296
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,541
But would that even be possible?

297
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,333
[MICHIO]
Ordinarily I'd think not,

298
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,708
but knowing Monkey,
she just might pull it off.

299
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,458
[RYOKA]
And the last one?

300
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,250
No need to talk about Boar now.

301
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,250
I mean, she could pull off
a pretty impressive

302
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,000
gun maneuver called
Non-Reload, but...

303
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, let's just say
it's probably lucky for us

304
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,625
she got taken out so early,

305
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,250
before we had to
go up against her.

306
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,625
So, Niwatori, which of these
fighters do you got dirt on?

307
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,000
[RYOKA] Well, I don't know much
of anything about anyone.

308
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,375
Aside from just some vague,

309
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,375
unverified rumors
here and there.

310
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,166
Sorry. I've lived
a sheltered life.

311
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,791
[MICHIO]
Hmph. You're helpful.

312
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,500
[MICHIO] But it's
not like I was expecting

313
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,625
all that much
out of her anyway.

314
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,625
[RYOKA]
Oh, but wait. That boy.

315
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,166
I wonder what
his deal is, don't you?

316
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,791
[MICHIO]
Huh? Who?

317
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,166
[RYOKA]
The sleepy one.

318
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,166
You know, the kid who
kept dozing off. Remember?

319
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,875
He didn't really seem
like the warrior type.

320
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,875
[MICHIO] Ha, like you're
one to talk, princess.

321
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,291
[MICHIO]
Hmm.

322
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,666
She's right, though--he did
stand out in that crowd.

323
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,958
Not stand out like
psycho Rabbit stand out,

324
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,625
but like he didn't belong there.

325
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,625
Think he's worth
keepin' an eye on?

326
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,583
No. I mean,
it's not like he seems

327
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,083
all that impressive,
exactly, but.

328
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,125
It's just, I don't know.
I can't shake this feeling

329
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,458
like I've seen him
somewhere before.

330
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,125
Did you get that feeling?

331
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,958
[MICHIO]
Hmm.

332
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,208
[RYOKA]
Huh? Wait up.

333
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,625
[MICHIO]
Now that she mentions it,

334
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,208
there was something
familiar about his face.

335
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,958
But I don't know why.

336
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,208
Did I fight with him?
Against him?

337
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,666
--On a battlefield somewhere?
--[RYOKA gasps]

338
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,750
--What's the problem?
--[RYOKA] Bad news, Dotsuku!

339
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,208
Rabbit's gang has split up
into two groups now!

340
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,750
[TOSHIKO gasping]

341
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,375
[EIJI]
Hm. Walking dead, huh?

342
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,083
If there's someone here
who can create those things,

343
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,916
then the first thing
<i>I</i> need to do is...

344
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,250
[YOSHIMI] The most dangerous
person in that room was Ox,

345
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,541
the famous Natural-Born Slayer.

346
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,250
Then again, he was the
first one to raise his hand

347
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,583
in response to the Monkey's
peace proposal.

348
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,125
[YOSHIMI]
Ow!

349
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,625
[YOSHIMI]
That alliance fell through

350
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,833
once the Rabbit joined in.

351
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,458
But perhaps we
could still find a way

352
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,375
to work together
as fellow moderates.

353
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,583
[RYOKA] I'm sorry, but I've lost
sight of Rabbit and Snake.

354
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,416
They might have realized
I was watching them

355
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,541
with my eyes in the sky.

356
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,416
[MICHIO]
I'm not surprised she lost 'em.

357
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,333
Given how green she is.
Although...

358
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,375
If they know we're watching,
this could be a decoy.

359
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,125
Rabbit and Snake send that
zombie Boar out as bait,

360
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,125
while they lurk in
the shadows ready to pounce.

361
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,291
Maybe that Rabbit
isn't as crazy as his

362
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,750
severely messed up
appearance might suggest.

363
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,291
Naw, he is. Anyone who
uses one of his own allies

364
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:27,041
as a pawn is definitely
not right between the ears.

365
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,333
In that case, I'll just have to
beat him at his own game.

366
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,458
Out-crazy the crazy.
And become a mad dog.

367
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,750
Niwatori.

368
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,291
[RYOKA]
Uh, yes? What is it?

369
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,541
[MICHIO]
Lemme see your arm.

370

[RYOKA]
Uh? Okay.

371
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,041
[RYOKA]
Aah!

372
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,041
[MICHIO]
Don't move!

373
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,541
How's that feel?

374
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
[RYOKA]
Why? Why would you do that?

375
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,625
Hey, wait. What'd you do to me?

376
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,208
[MICHIO] I drugged you.
And you're welcome.

377
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
I call it the One-Man Army.

378
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,625
It unlocks the full potential
of your combat abilities.

379
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,041
[MICHIO] My poison can do
more than just kill.

380
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,666
There is such a thing
as non-lethal poison.

381
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,375
I temporarily power her up
with that venom,

382
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,250
then I'll send her out there
to deal with that decoy Boar.

383
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,916
I don't even care if she wins,
just put up a decent fight.

384
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,166
That should be more than enough
to lure out Rabbit and Snake.

385
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,791
Then I'll sneak up on 'em
and wipe out Rabbit.

386
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,333
Course, even with
the power boost,

387
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,375
Rabbit or Snake
could still kill the girl,

388
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,375
but that just saves me
the trouble later.

389
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,125
Once that's done, I'll make
my way back underground.

390
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,750
A hunter <i>and</i> a killer.

391

That's the Warrior
of the Dog, Dotsuku.

392
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,708
[MICHIO] Calm down!
Everything you're feelin',

393
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,625
that's still your own power.

394
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,458
I just gave ya a little push.

395
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:53,250
So just relax and
let it happen-- get a grip.

396
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,166
[RYOKA]
Okay.

397
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,833
Okay. Get a grip.
