[Music]

2
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,791
How can this be?

3
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,166
Akasha must
have failed...

4
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,916
That's the only
explanation for this.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,291
Oh, he succeeded.

6
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,000
The bonds with our
Shikabane Hime were broken...

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,833
I don't doubt for a second
your plan worked.

8
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,625
I never thought
this could happen...

9
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,666
I didn't think it was possible
to preserve the connections

10
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,708
all of us created.

11
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,291
No one thought
it could be done.

12
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,208
For crying out loud...
I can't believe you guys.

13
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,791
At least, now we know how
you really feel about us.

14
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,000
It's been said that the
very first Shikabane Hime

15
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,583
was created by the founder
of the Kougon Sect...

16
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,083
Most believe
this to be true.

17
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,333
The existence of the first
works as a catalyst,

18
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,875
which connects all
Shikabane Hime to their monks.

19
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,250
Perhaps I was fooled
into believing this.

20
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,875
Deep in the pit
of my stomach...

21
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,916
I always felt a strong
presence connecting us.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,083
Now I know it was
the first Shikabane Hime

23
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,166
giving Umehara and I her
strength and power...

24
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,666
However.

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,166
The first isn't the only
thing connecting us to you...

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,333
A moment shared with
Takamasa is what binds us.

27
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,791
I see... We thought
we bound you...

28
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,125
With the Kougon Sect's power,

29
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,958
we believed we were
creating the bond,

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,750
but you were
the ones binding us.

31
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,791
Precisely... In the battles
that we'd face,

32
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,416
we wanted you
to fight alongside us...

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,333
The Kougon Sect is only a
piece of the puzzle after all.

34
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,458
The contract can
easily be severed...

35
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,333
Our will... is what
keeps us connected.

36
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,083
Those responsible for the
existence of Shikabane Hime...

37
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,875
Have always been the
Shikabane Hime themselves?

38
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,666
Let them try
everything they can...

39
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,458
No one can
eliminate our will.

40
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,583
Will...? Call it what
you want, ladies.

41
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,541
It's nothing
more than regret.

42
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,541
Your regrets are inferior
to our beloved nature...

43
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,333
Your emotions make
you weak and pathetic.

44
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,416
[Firing]

45
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,583
Help me!

46
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,833
I can't.

47
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,458
Coward.

48
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,333
All I wanted...

49
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,583
All I wanted was to spread
happiness to the world.

50
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,708
Death is happiness...

51
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,583
Death is forever.

52
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,625
But all of you...

53
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,083
Already knew...
What happiness was.

54
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,416
Is this really happiness?

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,250
She might be
onto something...

56
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,583
I never knew what true love
was until after I was dead.

57
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,041
I guess you could
say happiness

58
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,041
wasn't something
I knew the meaning of until...

59
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,041
I became a
Shikabane Hime.

60
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,958
I thought I knew
what happiness was...

61
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,458
I was wrong.

62
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,916
Toya!

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,333
Impossible...

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,166
I haven't felt Hokuto's
presence in quite sometime.

65
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,833
Maybe I'm the only member
of the Seven Stars left.

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,333
I cannot die...!
I won't perish...!

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
I will make
it through this!

68
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,958
No one can violate
my nature...!

69
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,875
No one can
destroy me!

70
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,291
You really think you chose
your contracted monk?

71
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,833
I know I did...

72
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,208
That's why we have the ability
to reconnect our bond again.

73
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,625
As long as I,...

74
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,708
The Shikabane Hime, wish
for the bond to remain.

75
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,333
This is the true power
of Shikabane Hime.

76
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,250
Let's do this, Ouri!

77
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,833
I'm ready.

78
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,041
Makina!

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,708
You're my enemy...!

80
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,916
You're Akasha's enemy!

81
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,666
You have to get up,
Makina!

82
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,833
No, Ouri.

83
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,833
Come on, Makina.

84
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
Your curse is
rather something...

85
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,500
You have quite
the wonderful ability

86
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,833
to regenerate infinitely.

87
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,250
You can battle Hokuto
on equal footing.

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,458
However, the problem is that
it takes a large amount

89
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,291
of rune away from
your contracted monk.

90
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,166
He weakens with every
second that you fight...

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,583
And this time, no one
is going to save him.

92
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,958
Don't listen,
Makina... I'm fine.

93
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,125
You're my enemy...!

94
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,583
You're my enemy!

95
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,083
Haven't you
heard the news...?

96
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,375
Hokuto isn't a Shikabane,
she's death itself.

97
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,666
Death?

98
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,375
Her actions have
neither a regret

99
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,000
or a nature fueling them...

100
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,666
She is the evolution of
all primitive Shikabane.

101
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,833
She is the death that awaits
you and the rest of this world.

102
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,875
Humanity doesn't stand
a chance against Hokuto.

103
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,333
After all,
everyone dies.

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,875
You should know that
better than anyone.

105
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,500
This can't be it!

106
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,291
You're my enemy!.

107
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,583
You're Akasha's enemy!

108
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,625
Sadahiro...?
Akira?

109
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,125
Akira... I figured you'd
relish the day your bond

110
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,625
with me came to an end...

111
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,208
Now I know that you'd
be lost without me

112
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,916
as your contracted monk.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Try not to get
the wrong idea...

114
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,708
I'm only here because
I haven't killed enough.

115
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,583
I was murdered
by monsters like these

116
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,416
and I intend to kill as
many as I can... Period...

117
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,625
That's the reason
I was brought back.

118
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,916
We've accepted a heavy
responsibility...

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,083
Humans who know the true
fate of Shikabane Hime

120
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,125
must be silenced
at any cost...

121
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,125
This situation requires
a different approach.

122
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,791
What the hell...
are you aiming for?

123
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,750
Lotus Flower!

124
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,958
Hokuto, you're not
injured, are you?

125
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,541
What's wrong,
Akasha...?

126
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,541
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

127
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,541
What are they...?
And what's inside them?

128
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,625
These are the tombs
of all the Shikabane Hime

129
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,500
that have destroyed 108...

130
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,791
You'd think this
was a graveyard.

131
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,083
They're forced to live out
eternity as Destroyer Shikabane.

132
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
I see... This is where
the journey ends...

133
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,375
There is no heaven
for a Shikabane Hime.

134
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,458
Any Shikabane Hime that has
destroyed 108 Shikabane...

135
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,916
Rests here...
Including yours, Akasha.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,375
What's the matter?

137
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,791
Nothing, I'm fine.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,958
Akasha!

139
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,208
Why can't I feel you...?

140
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,625
Why can't I feel your rune?

141
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Including his...
Akasha's Shikabane Hime.

142
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,833
Now's your
chance...! Ouri!

143
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,000
Makina!

144
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,208
Right.

145
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,208
Zadan technique!

146
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,166
I don't understand...

147
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,791
Why?

148
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,083
I promised myself I would never
create another Shikabane Hime...

149
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,208
I know now that
I couldn't have saved her.

150
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,041
A Shikabane Hime is nothing
more than an abomination

151
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,625
with regrets and obsessions
from this world.

152
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,000
It's no surprise that
she couldn't go heaven.

153
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,541
Hibiki... She was the only
thing that mattered to me...

154
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,708
And I turned her
into a monster...

155
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,625
Because I believed
their lies.

156
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,625
I wanted revenge
against them

157
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,833
for what they
had done to my love.

158
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,166
And you helped me
to make that happen.

159
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,166
Unlike the others,
you exist without a nature.

160
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,208
I was wrong.

161
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,958
Shikabane aren't
defiled creatures.

162
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,000
They had no choice,
they were born this way.

163
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,250
My regret...?

164
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,958
I thought of Hibiki
as an awful defilement.

165
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,416
By making you
my Shikabane Hime...

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,000
I felt I could atone
for the chaos I created.

167
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,833
Hibiki.

168
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,666
I'm so sorry, Hokuto...

169
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,458
But I can
no longer do this.

170
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,166
Oh great... She reverted
back into a Shikabane...

171
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,125
We have to work quickly!

172
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,125
Okay!

173
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,125
I should have
known better...

174
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,125
It was my fault
for placing our trust

175
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,000
in the hands
of a pathetic human.

176
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,875
I'm sorry your experience
was so unpleasant.

177
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,500
I missed the bugs...
I don't see the child...

178
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,000
Will he really
be gone forever?

179
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,625
Yes... We won't be seeing
Akasha ever again...

180
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,083
Now come with me,
Hokuto.

181
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,875
I couldn't get
a clean shot.

182
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,166
Dammit!

183
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,250
Sadahiro.

184
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,333
They're gone...
Where'd they go?

185
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,333
The number of Shikabane
is rapidly decreasing.

186
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,708
There were
so many of them.

187
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,875
I'd never seen that
many Shikabane before...

188
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,875
The Seven Stars
definitely succeeded

189
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,041
in creating swarms
of Shikabane.

190
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,166
The Seven Stars are gone.

191
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,333
The remaining Shikabane
will lose their power

192
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,916
or die instantly...

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,875
Am I wrong
in assuming this?

194
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,000
Of course not, sir.

195
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,541
But that doesn't
eliminate the threat

196
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,708
they pose against
our Shikabane Hime.

197
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,250
You know as well as I do
that after this battle...

198
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,708
Many will have killed
more than 108 Shikabane...

199
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,333
Preparations must be made.

200
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,833
Haven't you heard?
They'll just go to heaven.

201
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,541
Sadahiro!

202
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,625
Gon Dai Sojo Shiou has
joined the spirit realm.

203
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,208
Before he passed on...

204
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,833
It was decided that Sadahiro
Mibu will be his successor.

205
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,791
I consider this an honor...

206
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,958
Things will change
from here on out...

207
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,416
I'll take responsibility in
dealing with the Shikabane Hime

208
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,333
who reach 108 ...

209
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,250
I know we can do better.

210
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,083
We must fulfill our
promise of heaven to them.

211
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,583
Sadahiro...
Tell us what happened...

212
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,833
And Akasha...?
Did he...?

213
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,291
None of you need to know
the details... It's finished.

214
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,000
It's that simple?

215
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,875
Akasha has been destroyed...

216
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,041
Shikabane Hime are
still at our disposal...

217
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,041
What else do you
need to know...?

218
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,875
It's finished.

219
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,250
Where's Makina?

220
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,625
She's gone missing...

221
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,250
Or at least, that's how
they're going to treat it.

222
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,958
Treat it?

223
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,291
You don't think she got
herself killed, do you?

224
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,625
There's no way Makina
could be dead, Flesh.

225
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,000
What about Ouri?

226
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,916
Same story.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,708
Then she'll be okay.

228
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,916
As long as Ouri
is with Makina...

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,958
It doesn't matter where she
is, she'll be safe with him.

230
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,833
Am I right?

231
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,708
I don't know what I should
do or where to go anymore.

232
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,250
I know... But I think
you're done fighting.

233
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,666
Even if you kill
108 Shikabane,

234
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,958
you won't be able
to get into heaven.

235
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,041
There's no reason
for you to keep fighting...

236
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,458
Do you know what I mean?

237
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,333
If you continue
down this path...

238
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,083
There's a chance you'll
become a destroyer Shikabane.

239
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,041
I know that, Ouri...
It's just that...

240
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,583
I don't... I don't
have any place to go...

241
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,750
I mean what am I
supposed to do now?

242
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,708
Come with me...
I know a place.

243
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,958
Makina?

244
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,916
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,375
Now hold on a second...

246
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,500
I was just taking
your hand to lead you,

247
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,208
we're going
this way... Come on.

248
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,833
I don't need you
to lead me anywhere.

249
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,125
This is where you
want me to live?

250
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,666
Yeah...

251
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,750
I think Riko and the kids will
be coming back pretty soon.

252
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,750
You know it
wouldn't be long...

253
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,791
Before they found
me living here.

254
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,416
I figured that...

255
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,208
But I'll try to have a talk
with someone in the Kougon Sect.

256
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,333
And who knows...

257
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,541
Maybe you'll
finally be able

258
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,166
to have some kind of
a normal life, Makina...

259
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,625
Given the chance...

260
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,000
I think the kids could
really warm up to you.

261
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,750
You won't have to
think about fighting...

262
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,666
You can just be like
a regular girl again.

263
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,541
Makina?

264
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:50,375
I can't... I've never been able
to step inside this gate before.

265
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,500
What...? But what
about you and Brother?

266
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,875
Keisei always wondered
why I couldn't.

267
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,291
I don't know why
I can't either...

268
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,125
I think it has something to do
with the children playing

269
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,291
and having fun...

270
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,583
I guess I thought...

271
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,000
This place
wouldn't accept me

272
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,708
because of my
defiled human form...

273
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,833
I shouldn't enter.

274
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,291
Wow, I...
I'm inside.

275
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,291
See?

276
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,458
Ouri...!
There you are!

277
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,000
Dude...! Where the hell have
you been hiding all this time?

278
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,958
Sorry... Are we ruining
an intimate moment?

279
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,291
What are you
talking about?

280
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,708
Nevermind... What are
you guys doing here?

281
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,458
We've been so
worried about you.

282
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,958
You disappeared on us after
that disturbance at school...

283
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,291
So many things have
happened since then.

284
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,708
Some airplanes
crashed in the city.

285
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,541
No one's saying anything,

286
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,375
but we've been seeing monsters
all over the freakin' place.

287
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,291
I wish someone would
tell us what's going on.

288
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,041
Uh, monsters...? Sounds like you
guys have been through a lot.

289
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,416
Ouri... And Makina, if
I'm not mistaken?

290
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,916
I don't mean to pry, but...

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,583
Do you guys know
about any of this...?

292
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,333
Are you connected somehow?

293
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,708
We were... But all of
that is in the past now...

294
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,708
I'll explain it
to you later.

295
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:18,041
You, uh... You haven't
seen Nozomi, have you?

296
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,208
Nozomi is the only
person we can't find.

297
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,125
Do you know
where she is...?

298
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,500
We thought... Maybe
she might be with you.

299
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,375
She was.

300
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,541
Makina?

301
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,625
Wait. Where are you going?

302
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,750
For a second,
I forgot everything.

303
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,458
You're talking about Nozomi,
aren't you...?

304
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,291
She wasn't the only one
to get caught in the crossfire.

305
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,958
You don't...
I mean, you shouldn't...

306
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,041
Please don't think what
happened to her was your fault.

307
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,000
That's not it.

308
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,708
You know as well as I do...

309
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,708
Nozomi Kasuga adored death.

310
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,458
An eternal death...

311
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,166
She wished to stay
beautiful forever.

312
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,875
She wanted to be a Shikabane
more than anything.

313
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,500
If I don't do something...

314
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,833
An eternal death
is what awaits me.

315
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,166
I don't want that...!
I want to live!

316
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
I didn't know
what it meant...

317
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,541
When I was alive,
I couldn't fathom it.

318
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,625
What it means
to be truly alive...

319
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,708
How to get the most of
what we already have.

320
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,416
I stood by Keisei's
for years...

321
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,083
For as long
as I can remember,

322
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,291
fighting was all
I knew how to do.

323
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,916
I finally
figured it out...

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,916
I understand what
it means to live.

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,416
And I know that
in order to live,

326
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,166
I have to keep on fighting.

327
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,666
Makina, I don't know if
you should be doing this...

328
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,916
I mean what about Hokuto?

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,916
Hokuto isn't really
death itself...

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,208
Not even close...

331
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,916
She's just another
Shikabane that I must fight.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Her memory is just a
little clouded right now...

333
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,333
It's my job to help her remember
why we do all of these things.

334
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,250
She'll know what
it means to live...

335
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,500
And what it really
means to die.

336
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,291
No one can escape from death
and I'm no exception...

337
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,375
I don't know about you,

338
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,458
but I choose to live
and die fighting.

339
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
Please... You can't.

340
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,250
Let me ask you this...

341
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,833
Do you wish for me to become
the person Nozomi Kasuga dreamt

342
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,166
of being someday?

343
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,041
Simply existing in this form
for all eternity...?

344
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,375
Not dead,
but not alive either?

345
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,416
My heart would...

346
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,875
Be the only thing
about me to die.

347
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,416
Is that the life you
wish for me to have?

348
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,041
I intend to keep
fighting death... I...

349
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,416
This is what it
means to be alive...

350
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,833
You know that I'm right.

351
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Ouri...
I need you with me.

352
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,083
Did you forget...?

353
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,666
You're my contracted monk,
after all.

354
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,583
And I need you
to be there...

355
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,291
I want you
to see me fight.

356
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,375
You know where?

357
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,541
I can feel him...
Keisei is near.

358
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,333
Hazama...

359
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,833
He has Akasha's
catalyst with him.

360
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,875
It was created using
a part of Keisei's body.

361
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,000
The bond between
you and Brother...

362
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,958
It's still there,
isn't it?

363
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,041
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,541
Oh, don't be...

365
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,791
It doesn't seem to stop me
from being your contracted monk.

366
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,000
Besides...

367
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,666
He once told me that we're
not here for the dead.

368
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,125
A monk's duty is
to help lessen the pain

369
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,666
for those who the
dead leave behind.

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,041
I know I'm still
new at this...

371
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,291
But I can help you...
So please let me.

372
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,708
Monks aren't here
for the dead.

373
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,041
You're not dead.

374
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,250
That's why you
fight, isn't it?

375
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,666
To stay alive...

376
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,083
That's not something
a dead person does.

377
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,458
Makina!

378
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,958
Enemy...!
I've missed my enemy!

379
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,791
You have to remember...
Damn you!

380
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,541
Stop it, please...
You're going to kill her.

381
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,416
I'll help you remember...

382
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,250
All the pain, sorrow,
hatred, and anger!

383
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,291
You're human just like
all the rest of us!

384
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,375
I'll keep fighting...

385
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,625
To stay alive.

386
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,708
Am I alive...?

387
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,958
Right now...

388
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,208
I am...

389
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,291
I am!

390
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,291
You and I...
Are not dead...

391
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,625
We're alive!

392
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,375
