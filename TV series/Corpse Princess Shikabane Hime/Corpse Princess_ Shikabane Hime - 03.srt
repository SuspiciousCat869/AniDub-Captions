You're not
scared are you?

4
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,291
Did you just hear
a baby crying?

5
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,708
No...

Okay...
I heard it then.

8
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,125
It's more than
a little creepy

9
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,708
to hear a baby crying
out here at night.

Did you see it?

13
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,958
Who are you?
What was that thing?

14
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,625
It has nothing to do
with either of you,

15
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,458
so just forget
what you saw.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,583
Dammit, Shikabane,
where are you...?

17
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,458
Makina!

18
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,833
Looks like it
did it again...

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,125
It always leaves
only one victim...

20
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,291
then the Shikabane vanishes,
no trace of it...

21
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Say, Ouri...

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,583
You ever heard about
a story like this one?

23
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,750
Huh?
Like what one?

24
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,208
I was getting there.

25
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,958
The one where the high
school girl has a kid

26
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,041
but abandons
the baby.

27
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,750
Why is it always "high school
girls" in your stories?

28
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,250
Just cuz...

29
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,166
Anyway, so the baby's cursed
and its cry is heard every--

30
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,000
Come on, girls these
days won't be scared

31
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,041
by a goofy story
like that.

32
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,333
But it's
not a story!

33
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,208
The whole thing really
happened, like I said!

34
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,458
Ouri?

35
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,041
Sorry... I'm kinda not
feeling all that well...

36
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,666
Ouri, buddy, tell me you
didn't do anything so dumb

37
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,583
that you'd get
cursed by a baby?

38
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,583
You didn't, right?

39
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,958
Please tell me
you didn't!

40
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,750

stay pure forever, right?

and a bunch of other stuff,
to help you along.

48

You should've just told
us you caught a cold.

49
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,083
Sorry.

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,750
So it was the
Sekuu Temple?

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,458
Should we let
them know?

52
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,125
I don't think so...

53
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,541
I have to do everything on my
own now, that's the deal.

54

Well... Just do what
you think is right.

It's calling you...
for help.

77
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,708
I take refuge in the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha

78
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,041
Until I attain
enlightenment.

79
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,541
By the merit
I have accumulated

80
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,500
from practising generosity
and the other perfections.

81
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,208
Enough.

82
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,541
I need you to confirm the
investigation of the corpse.

Uh... And can I have
some of your baklava?

85
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,416
I found
the Shikabane.

86
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,958
Don't lose it like last time,
you good-for-nothing!

87
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,416
I can feel it! It's moving
closer to me by the second!

88
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,750
Minai has
her eye on it.

89

We've got the
thing cornered.

90
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,416
I didn't lose it
for even one second.

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,125
I swear I didn't.
It got another victim...

92
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,583
And we lost another round.

93
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,791
It's not win or lose...

94
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,458
Then how
should we put it?

95
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,000
'Cause it seems to me
that each time we lose,

96
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,291
someone gets killed.

[Mew]

98
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,083
I think we all agree

99
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,291
that this one cannot be
a transparent Shikabane.

100
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,166
So, how much more time
do you plan to waste

101
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,458
in pursuit of it,
Sho-Sojo Tagami?

102
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,041
The Shikabane appearance rate
here is abnormally high.

103
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,166
I myself killed
5 this month.

104
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,208
Tagami killed
almost 10.

105
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,083
Like many clinics these days,
this one is short on doctors.

106
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,375
So short that it offers
only one service--

107
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,833
that of an ob-gyn.

108
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,916
And seeing that all the
victims were young females,

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,416
and some were
pregnant...

110
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,625
it's worth an
investigation.

111
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,208
The crying baby...

112
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,583
Do you think a stillborn child
there came back as a Shikabane

113
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,208
and began to attack
the patients?

114
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,666
I really don't believe
that an infant born deceased

115
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,166
could have a strong enough
obsession to become a Shikabane.

116
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,958
The ones we took care of
the other day were children.

117
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,458
Have you received any word
on the corpse's tissue analysis

118
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,666
that I requested?

119
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,250
They don't have
the results yet.

120
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,458
In the meantime, you should
investigate this clinic.

Makina...

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,833
Why do I have
to do this?

123
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,375
Probably because you're
a softy who'd follow me

124
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,083
without many questions.

125

Sorry, dear,

133
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,500
but the nurse had an unexpected
matter to attend to,

so I'm the only one
here right now.

Please, you have
to help me.

My boyfriend
doesn't care about me

and I don't
have anybody.

138
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,583
I don't know
what to do.

139
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,708
It happens to a lot of
young people these days -

140
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,666
just a bit short sighted
with their actions.

141
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,458
Don't cry, dear,
I'll take good care of you.

142
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,333
Oh, you're awake,
young man, good.

143
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,541
I found him lying out
on the street last night.

144
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,958
... obviously got
a bad cold...

145
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,541
And he didn't
understand

146
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,666
we don't practice
that kind of medicine...

147
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,625
...so I just gave him an
IV to keep him hydrated.

148
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,458
So, are you
feeling better?

149
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,875
Ah, yeah I am,
thanks.

150
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,875
No problem whatsoever,
young man.

151
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,041
Excuse me,
where's the restroom?

152
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,541
Ah... it's
down there...

153
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,625
I'll go and make the necessary
preparations for you.

about you...?

You're the one who came here
'cause she got herself pregnant.

This can't be some kind
of coincidence, right...?

three times I've run into
you while chasing Shikabane.

00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,750
Forget it.
There's no time.

164
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,958
Uh... wait!

165
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,166
Hey!

166
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,000
Would you hold
on a second?!

167
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,500
Stop following me!

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,125
What's your real name,

169
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,916
Shikabane Hime
or Makina Hoshimura?

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,875
Shikabane Hime is a title
for those who kill Shikabane.

171
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,458
Then I guess I'll call you
Makina, if that's alright.

172
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,250
Get out of the way.

173
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,666
What do you think
you're doing?!

174
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,625
Five women have been brutally
murdered by a Shikabane...

175
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,000
and at each murder site,
a baby's cry was heard.

176
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,708
It's possible that those
murdered women were patients

177
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,041
of this clinic.

178
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,125
That's why you think
this baby's a Shikabane?

179
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,500
Look at that baby.
Carefully.

180
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,958
It's not a newborn.

181
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,250
He looks to be at least
three months old.

182
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,083
Why would he be sleeping
alone in a place like this?

183
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,750
I'll tell you
that doctor,

184
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,916
he's also gotta be under
the Shikabane's control.

185
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,208
I need to ask...
for your assistance.

186
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,958
I don't care,
this baby's no monster!

187
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,500
It's pretending
to be human...

188
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,500
Now move!

189
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,541
Cut it out!

190
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,000
Sorry...

191
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,416
See...?
You get it now...?

192
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,416
This is the smell
of Shikabane...

193
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,041
I'm dead Ouri... the body
is incapable of lying.

194
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
And so is that baby.

195
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,958
He should smell
just like me.

196
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,375
The same stale,
sour aroma.

197
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,250
Smell him!

198
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,250
He smells like
every other baby...

199
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
Like a combination
of milk and diapers.

200
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,625
Liar...!
Forget it then!

201
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,958
You'd better let
that baby go!

202
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,958
I'm taking
him with me.

203
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,833
That child isn't
a Shikabane!

204
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,583
Yeah? I guess we'll see
about that, won't we?

205
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,625
Makina!

206
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,791
Makina!

207
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,250
Shikabane cells?
Really?

208
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,208
Yes. In the bodies
of those five victims

209
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,541
we found quite a
few foreign cells

210
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,333
we suspect are
from a Shikabane.

211
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,416
That means someone planted
the Shikabane tissue

212
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,208
into these humans
which turned them

213
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,916
into a kind of
quasi-Shikabane...

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,625
What Makina and the
others have been seeking

215
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,250
were victims themselves
who became quasi-Shikabane...

216
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,125
No wonder we
couldn't find them...

217
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,041
And then the victims returned
to their old dead selves,

218
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,208
I guess...

219
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,375
Is that possible?

220
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,208
I don't know,
but it's happening...

221
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,416
In all honesty,
we should just admit that

222
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,041
we really know practically
nothing about Shikabane.

223
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,958
Who's doing this?

224
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,583
Maybe the Shikabane are trying
to increase their population...?

225
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,083
Or it could be some sort
of experiment I suppose...

226
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,583
Senior Tagami, I've heard
how the number of Shikabane

227
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,416
in this district
has been increasing...

228
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,041
I think you should stop
doing field work

229
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,416
so you can spend
more time here

230
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,916
being a mentor to those
of us who need it.

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,958
Come on, Rika,
what are you talking about...?

232
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,791
I'm a perennial
Sho-Sojo.

233
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm not a
Gon-Sojo like you.

234
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,666
You know that,
don't you?

235
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,750
I only got this promotion
because my name is Aragami...

236
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,833
But still...

237
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,125
Still I'll fight
Shikabane with Makina...

238
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,291
because that is the
promise I made long ago.

239
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,250
Makina...

240
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,958
There, there...
That's it sweetheart...

241
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,208
Everything's fine...
It'll be alright...

242
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,666
there we go.

243
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,208
Never thought
I'd see that,

244
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,500
a Shikabane listening
to a human.

245
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,875
It's not so odd...

246
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,166
That baby
is her child.

247
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,541
Poor thing passed
away during labor.

248
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,208
It was a heart attack.

249
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,541
I did everything
I could to stop it,

250
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,083
but I had to make the
choice to save the child.

251
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,458
She became a Shikabane.

252
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,458
She probably understands
by now that if I'm gone,

253
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,375
there is no one left to
take care of her baby.

254
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,166
I assume that's why
she listens to me.

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,583
It can't be...

256
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,458
Shikabane, huh...?

257
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,833
I've heard rumors about this
among my fellow doctors

258
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,541
for some time now.

259
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,500
A dead person comes back to
life and becomes immortal...

260
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,000
But to think of it actually
happening was something else...

261
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,583
Wouldn't it be
a wonderful gift

262
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,458
if we could share immortality
with all humans, everywhere?

263
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,583
You put that
into people?

264
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,750
Even if you do that, it's not
gonna make them immortal...!

265
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,291
I get it... You did
that to all those women!

266
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,500
Some day it will succeed.

267
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:30,125
I knew someone like
you would come...

268
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,708
I was quite pointedly
warned about it.

269
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,750
Makina Hoshimura!

270
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,541
Hoshimura...
I remember that name.

271
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,708
That was the name of a
family killed in a fire

272
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,875
a few years back.

273
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,250
Did you know them?

274
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,125
Were you related
to them or something?

275
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,375
Oh, interesting.

276
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
You're not becoming a
monster like the others.

277
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,083
I wonder if it was changing
the distribution of blood.

278
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,583
You've got no pulse but
you're still breathing.

Yes, I am a Hoshimura.

281
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,041
I'm the daughter of the family
that died in the fire...

282
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,750
But it wasn't the
fire that killed them.

283
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,291
And since I've
already died...

284
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,083
I don't need a
Shikabane's flesh.

285
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,125
It's truly sad that you
didn't cast away

286
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,041
your human heart once
you became a Shikabane.

287
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,500
It would've been
easier on you.

288
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,958
You're owned
by a human

289
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,208
and you have him creating
bad imitations of you.

290
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,916
You think you haven't
become a monster?

291
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,750
No matter how tight a hold
you place on being human,

292
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,750
it won't matter.

293
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,625
Because in the end...

294
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,666
You're still...
a Shikabane.

295
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,166
It's no use!
Shikabane are immortal!

296
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,125
And I am the
immortal killer...

00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,375
this man implanted
with Shikabane flesh...

301
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,791
they all died.

302
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,041
You're supposed to
kill Shikabane, right?!

303
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,208
He murdered five people!

304
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,291
Right! But he's a human
being, just like you!

Someone must have called the

So I came and
picked you up.

They told us that the director
of that clinic was arrested.

But when they went in,

00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,541
Well... Anyone find
a baby or a girl there?

322
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,041
Nope... Must've been
some kind of crazy dream

323
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,666
from the high
fever you had...

324
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,541
Hey!

325
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,333
That's just a little
gift from me...

326
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,166
It's a must-have if you're gonna
be thinking about the ladies.

327
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,541
I'm sick
and delirious!

328
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,333
Why would I want
this stuff?!

329
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,791
♪ Ouri's a pervert!

330
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,708
♪ Ouri's a pervert!

331
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,041
No, I'm not!

332
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,958
Why does your brother
always pop up

333
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,958
whenever I'm out there
hunting Shikabane?

334
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,208
I wonder if he fell
in love with you.

335
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,875
You keep this up and he's
gonna learn about you some day!

336
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,708
And maybe he will...

337
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,250
But that's no reason to quit
being your contracted monk,

338
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,875
right?

339
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,750
I guess not!

340
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,041
We'll take custody
of the baby...

341
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,500
We have the facilities
for that sort of thing...

342
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,500
Now, doctor...
Let me go over this again.

343
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,166
Your wife was reaching
the end of a long battle

344
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,166
with her illness.

345
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,583
She was dying.

346
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,000
And in order
to extend her life,

347
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,375
you turned to experimentation
using Shikabane cells...

348
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,083
There must've been someone
who put you up to it.

349
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,666
And he must be
very dangerous

350
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,625
if he has knowledge
of Shikabane.

351
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,125
If you could just
tell me a name...

352
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:49,625

353

[Music]


363
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,916
Did you really believe
in that man...?

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,875
Truly and deeply believe
the one you call your brother?

365
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,375
Do you see?

366
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,791
Do you hear?

367
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,666
For we can now hear
the "Hymn of Tragedy"

368
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,000
that ridicules you...
