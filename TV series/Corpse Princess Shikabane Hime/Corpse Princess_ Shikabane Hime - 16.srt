1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,041
[Music]

2
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,458
You murdered him!

3
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,291
You're the ones
who killed Keisei!

4
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,833
I no longer
do this for me.

5
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,791
I don't carry these guns
for my family, either...

6
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,916
I carry them for Keisei!

7
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,375
I'm not like you!

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,625
I never will be!

9
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,375
Okay, you two...

10
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,041
Better go change into
your new training outfits.

11
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,708
I didn't think we'd get
dressed in the same place.

12
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,916
Not good...
Definitely not good.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,916
She's taking off
her clothes

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,958
without giving it
a second thought.

15
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,833
Am I the only one that
has a problem with this?

16
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,041
Is everything okay, Ouri?

17
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,541
I'm fine.
I just figured

18
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,208
since our training is
about to get intense that...

19
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,333
I'd get myself super
psyched up, you know?

20
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,458
How optimistic.

21
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,708
What?

22
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,625
With everything
that's happened,

23
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,625
I thought you'd be sad.

24
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,541
I was...

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,250
I mean, I am sad.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,791
When it happened...
I cried like a baby.

27
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,333
No matter what I did...
I couldn't stop. ...

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,583
It wasn't pretty.

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,833
My nose wouldn't
stop running.

30
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,958
You know, you might
wanna try crying more...

31
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,333
It could make you
feel better.

32
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,000
No matter
how much I cry...

33
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,166
It only makes me
feel worse.

34
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,333
Oh, wow... That was
painful to watch.

35
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:29,125
Who's there...?
Show yourself.

36
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,208
I'm Saki Amase.

37
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,500
But most people
just call me Saki.

38
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,125
My name is
Rika Aragami...

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:45,291
I'm a Gon-Sojo as well as
Saki's contracted monk.

40
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,833
Your brother and I trained
together under Sojo Takamine.

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,041
I guess you could say
we were classmates.

42
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,875
May I ask why you're here?

43
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,166
We're making sure you don't
try anything funny with Makina.

44
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,916
Keep those hands
to yourself.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,958
Anything funny...?
What do you mean by that?

46
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,666
It's obvious what
I meant by that.

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,375
You said you have
feelings for her.

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,541
What? I never said
anything like that.

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,666
I'm just trying to protect
and care for her

50
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,125
the way Brother did.
That's all!

51
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,791
We heard everything from
outside the Shikabane's trench.

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,958
You were listening in?

53
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,541
You're one nosy kid,
you know that?

54
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,791
Kid?! Who do you
think you are?!

55
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,083
Why does the brother of Keisei
Tagami still have a contract

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,708
with the Hoshimura girl?

57
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,083
The Seven Stars have
made it abundantly clear.

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
We've become
targets, gentlemen.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
We have to strengthen
our defenses.

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,791
The defiled ones
in question

61
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,875
not only entered the
purification chamber,

62
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,708
but the grounds surrounding
the head temple...

63
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,041
The fault lies
with your people.

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,750
As if that weren't
bad enough,

65
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,291
the Seven Stars escaped from
the contracted monks you sent.

66
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,333
Not shocking... Shikabane
Hime are just as defiled

67
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,750
as the ones they
have sworn to fight.

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,458
I say we must find a new way
to try to save the lives

69
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,791
of innocent civilians without
the use of Shikabane Hime!

70
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,916
That's enough!

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,916
We don't have time
for this discussion!

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,291
Explain to us what
happened to Umehara.

73
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,250
How could such a respected Sojo
be responsible for this blunder?

74
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,666
I permitted him.

75
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,250
Whether Makina Hoshimura
forms a strong bond

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,541
with her new contract
monk is irrelevant...

77
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,666
As is her ability to
return to the philosophy

78
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,958
of the Kougon Sect.

79
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,583
Umehara was ordered by
me to see it through.

80
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,375
If Makina returns
to the fold...

81
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,375
then Ouri Kagami...

82
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,750
Shall keep his
contract with her,

83
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,375
be accepted into
the Kougon Sect

84
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,916
and granted the title of
Dai-Sozu or a similar ranking.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,125
But sir...! There is
no precedent for that!

86
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,916
Instead of relying
on Shikabane Hime,

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,041
we have to consider
our other options!

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,083
I find it hard to believe
that one little girl

89
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,333
can fight these Shikabane
all by herself!

90
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,916
His Grace Dai-Sojo has
given the ordinance.

91
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,458
From this point on...

92
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,125
We're going to focus on training
you in battle scenarios.

93
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,791
As far as your weapon; you
wanted a monk staff, right?

94
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,291
Yes... Just like the
one Brother used.

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,708
I hope you know
it won't matter

96
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,625
how much or
how hard you train.

97
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,875
You'll never defeat a Shikabane,
let alone the Seven Stars.

98
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,250
Destroying Shikabane
isn't your responsibility.

99
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,500
If you get hurt,

100
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,208
your Shikabane's life
is put in danger.

101
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,125
Think of yourself as a battery
for your Shikabane Hime.

102
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,291
If Umehara was really a
battery, he'd be an N,

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,250
one of the smallest
batteries on the market.

104
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,791
You shut your mouth?

105
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,500
How would you know
what size I am?

106
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,083
An N battery, really?!

107
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,916
My point: the job
of a contracted monk

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,708
is to not get killed.

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,416
Getting you to master
the basics of combat

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,000
is a good way to do that.

111
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,708
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,208
Makina, however...

113
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,291
Will be undergoing a
different type of training

114
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,666
before she's able
to join you.

115
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

116
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,333
The bond with her previous
contracted monk...

117
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,833
Must be broken.

118
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,166
Looks like you'll
be the first one up...

119
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,458
Enjoy yourself.

120
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,708
All right!

121
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,750
Just don't forget;
the boy is mine.

122
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,708
Oh, you mean her
contracted monk?

123
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,166
I'd love to...

124
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,291
But even though he doesn't
particularly inspire me

125
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,166
to create a painting
or write a symphony...

126
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,208
I can't promise...
that I won't kill him.

127
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,333
Don't tell me that you're
really going to send Ena alone?

128
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
You have a problem
with me going alone?

129
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,541
If Makina Hoshimura is indeed
an enemy of the Seven Stars,

130
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,875
you should find a
way to defeat her.

131
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,291
Believe it or not,

132
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,750
our actions the other night
served their purpose...

133
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,958
But this time,
it will be different...

134
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,041
I will defeat Makina, using
a method I find suitable...

135
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,458
This isn't just a game for
you to act out your desires.

136
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,916
Seven Stars This
is just his nature.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,916
Nature?

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,291
As I've said before...

139
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,041
Obsessions are
for lesser beings.

140
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,833
The Seven Stars are
more highly evolved.

141
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,708
Within the depths of the soul
there lies a hidden potential,

142
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,083
one that cannot
be controlled.

143
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,125
A person is defined by
it; it is their nature.

144
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,875
What humanity suppresses...

145
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,166
We embrace and are
thereby vastly superior.

146
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,708
Ena, for example, has an
undeniable yearning for beauty.

147
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,083
He is compelled to rescue
people from obscurity

148
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,125
by making their
deaths significant.

149
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,541
It is his nature
to create beauty.

150
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,125
Do you get it now?

151
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,333
We act because it is
the right thing to do...

152
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,416
Following our nature
is worth everything...

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
Even if it results
in our death.

154
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,583
Just stay out of our way.

155
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,958
Akasha... Do you
really believe

156
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,958
you'll be able to lure the
daughter of Hoshimura

157
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,000
and the others out?

158
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,250
I'm acquainted
with a Shikabane...

159
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,708
A useful fellow whom I
haven't sealed in my casket

160
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,333
for one reason; he
gets the job done.

161
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,083
He's the perfect bait for
those surrounding Hoshimura.

162
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,625
I understand...

163
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,625
If she comes out, she'll be
playing right into our hands.

164
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,666
But if she decides
to stay behind,

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,000
her friends won't be
there to protect her...

166
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,791
It's a win-win situation.

167
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,083
Hokuto... I've got
my eyes on you.

168
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,333
Don't underestimate
these arrows...

169
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,791
If one hits you,
it'll hurt!

170
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,958
You're Makina's current
contracted monk, aren't you?

171
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,125
Other bonds will be nothing
more than obstacles

172
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,625
when she exerts her
strength and energy.

173
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,000
There's no need
to worry, Ouri...

174
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,541
Breaking the bond doesn't
mean she'll forget

175
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,333
what she and your
brother shared.

176
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,250
It'll just be harder for her
to recollect certain things...

177
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,708
This will help her let go
of the past and move forward.

178
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,208
Makina feels there
isn't a reason

179
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,750
to break the bond
with Keisei,

180
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,291
so she'll try to keep
it no matter what.

181
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
That's the curse.

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
It's hard to look
at the bond

183
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,166
between Makina and
Brother that way.

184
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,083
Though you showed us how
tremendous your power can be...

185
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,250
That power is a curse.

186
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,875
I'm sure you know that a curse
can give you the ability

187
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,708
to turn regret or
obsession into strength.

188
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,083
But regardless
of the reason,

189
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,500
if a Shikabane Hime
is performing curses...

190
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,583
That tells us she's
only a step away

191
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,958
from reverting
into a Shikabane.

192
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,833
Not to mention that she
puts those around her,

193
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,125
including her contracted
monk in danger.

194
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,041
The cause of your
curse is obvious.

195
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,875
You have regrets toward your
previous contracted monk.

196
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,875
Breaking your bond to him is
the only way to purify the Rune

197
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
that rots within.

198
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,708
Understand?

199
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,125
Do you really think you
can do this, Makina?

200
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,250
I will defeat
the Seven Stars.

201
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,166
For as long as I can remember,
that's all I've wanted to do...

202
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,875
And I know Keisei
is counting on me.

203
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,750
Let's get this over with.

204
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,083
Come now. You know this
isn't what you really want.

205
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,750
Be honest.
You still miss him.

206
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,958
This isn't real...
It's just an illusion...

207
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
A hallucination brought
on by exhaustion.

208
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
If you give up your
ties with Keisei...

209
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,500
What will be left of him?

210
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,166
Turning away from
such a sacred bond...

211
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,833
Shouldn't that be
out of the question?

212
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,375
But I died and
became a Shikabane...

213
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,500
My family and I were murdered in
cold blood by the Seven Stars.

214
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,250
It's my duty
to destroy them.

215
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,000
And what of him?

216
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,583
Ever since Keisei was
murdered before your eyes...

217
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:10,250
No... Long before
his passing...

218
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,333
Having him by your side was the
reason you fought these battles.

219
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,750
He meant absolutely
everything to you.

220
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,750
You're right...
I cared for him...

221
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,250
And I couldn't protect him.

222
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,791
But I have to do this.

223
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,541
If I'm going to avenge him, I
don't have any other choice.

224
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,916
You're not going to
break the bond...

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,208
You know you won't.

226
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,500
I owe it to him...

227
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,958
Who do you think is responsible
for all of this...?

228
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,750
Look deep inside
yourself, Makina.

229
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,791
Me... It's me.

230
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,666
Makina?

231
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,041
Everything is exactly
how it should be.

232
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,125
You finished
breaking the bond?

233
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,333
Saki! Wait a minute!

234
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333
Stop right there!

235
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,625
The Kougon Sect tells
us it's our duty

236
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,125
to kill as many Shikabane
as possible, right?

237
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,916
Saki!

238
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,083
Saki?

239
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,958
Sorry...

240
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,833
I couldn't do it.

241
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,250
Don't tell me it
wouldn't bother you.

242
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,083
What if you were to die and
I had to break my bond with you?

243
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,708
I don't think I have
what it takes to do that.

244
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,833
A traffic accident?

245
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,458
Yep... The truck just came
out of nowhere and bam...!

246
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,333
I died almost instantly or at
least, that's how I remember it.

247
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,041
But... Well, then...

248
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,125
How did you have time
to remember anything?

249
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,791
I asked myself that question
a lot in the beginning.

250
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,166
I was told that having regrets
or obsessing over something

251
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,958
turns a person
into a Shikabane.

252
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,708
But before I died, I was
just an ordinary teenager.

253
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,833
All I cared about was...
Candy and ice cream...

254
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,958
Nothing else
really mattered.

255
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,958
Now I know my reason for
coming back to this world.

256
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,375
Oh yeah?

257
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,333
I never got the chance to
do anything with my life.

258
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,708
You know, like go to college,
take a roadtrip with friends,

259
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,291
fall in love -
that kind of stuff.

260
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,708
To experience new,
exciting things...

261
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,875
To find something they
view as priceless.

262
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,416
These are things that
people feel they need to do

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,666
before they die...

264
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,250
And I never got
to do any of them.

265
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,458
So that's my regret.

266
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,000
An ordinary teenage girl who
was told to fight against things

267
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,208
that go bump
in the night.

268
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,750
I was so afraid.

269
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,875
I begged and pleaded
with the Kougon Sect

270
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,750
to give me a contract with
the strongest monk available.

271
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,291
You're Takamasa
Sougi, am I right?

272
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,416
What?

273
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,833
The heir to the
strongest warrior monk

274
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,458
with the Genpaku title?

275
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,333
Yeah... Do I know you?

276
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,708
May I see your hand?

277
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,333
Why did you bite me?!
Look at the blood!

278
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,208
Why would you do that?!

279
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,000
We are those
who have lost awareness

280
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,916
and we require your help
in finding salvation.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,583
We... need those who are
familiar with the philosophy.

282
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,250
There... Now we
have a contract.

283
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,916
From this point on...

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,208
You are going to be
my contracted monk.

285
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,583
'Kay...

286
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,833
I may not be the strongest
Shikabane Hime out there,

287
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,208
but I will do everything in
my power to protect you...

288
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,583
Promise...

289
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm sorry. But what exactly
are you talking about?

290
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,208
His father died without ever
telling him about this world...

291
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,416
He was just a
high school student

292
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,000
that had never
been in a fight.

293
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,416
That is before I came
into the picture anyway.

294
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,833
You must have
felt so stupid!

295
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,375
How funny!
Good job, Itsuki!

296
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,875
You really know
how to pick 'em!

297
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,875
I get the feeling
she's being sarcastic.

298
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,708
[Laughter]

299
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,708
Checking the restoration
levels of Shikabane Hime

300
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,666
is an important
duty of any Sojo...

301
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,791
Dirty job, but
someone's gotta do it!

302
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,958
When Rika said

303
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,500
that Makina was going to break
her bond with Brother...

304
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,000
I knew that it was going
to be difficult for her...

305
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,791
The two of them were
really close after all.

306
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,208
Honestly...
I know it sounds awful,

307
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,416
but I was relieved.

308
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,041
I know there isn't a chance
I could ever have a relationship

309
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,416
with her like the one
she and Brother had.

310
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,666
I've got some big shoes
to fill, that's for sure.

311
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,375
Breaking their bond
makes it easier...

312
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
For everyone...

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
I think things will
start to get better now.

314
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,666
Takamasa!

315
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,041
Have you told Itsuki that you're
madly in love with her yet?

316
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,583
Ouri...

317
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,625
It seems that you're forgetting
a very important thing.

318
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
You have to understand that the
girl standing in front of you

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,750
is a Shikabane Hime.

320
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,708
She's no longer
a human being...

321
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,083
She's merely an aberration that
exists only to kill Shikabane...

322
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,375
Nothing more... No matter
how much you think otherwise.

323
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:30,041
Aberration?

324
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,375
These are part
of the price I paid

325
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,125
when I couldn't
comprehend that fact.

326
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,333
And take my word for it,

327
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,708
I was not the only one
to pay that price...

328
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,125
Not by a long shot.

329
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,666
Shikabane Hime
are aberrations...

330
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,125
They became
powerful by dying.

331
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,916
But their power comes at the
expense of their humanity.

332
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,750
Almost doesn't seem
worth it in my opinion.

333
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,791
What is it that you want
from your Shikabane Hime...?

334
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,208
Is it power...?

335
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,333
Maybe love?

336
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,458
Unfortunately, you'll
never acquire both.

337
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,208
I'd consider myself lucky
if I was able to get one.

338
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,458
So you're saying if I want
to harness Makina's power...

339
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,250
You need to let go of whatever
is in your heart now...

340
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,791
Before it's too late.

341
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,833
Oh, gross!

342
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,875
What was that?
What's going on?

343
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,583
Itsuki and Flesh must have
caught Master sneaking

344
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,125
around the
ladies room again.

345
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,458
They'll think of something
to even the score, I'm sure.

346
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,583
I just hope they don't
cause any permanent damage.

347
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,583
What do you mean
by permanent?

348
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,750
He's hopeless...

349
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,166
Well, I better go get him.

350
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,750
Okay...
That was weird.

351
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,166
Perhaps you have more in
common with that poor girl

352
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,375
than you think...

353
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,708
Nothing would surprise
me at this point.

354
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,541
Why is it so wrong
for me to see Makina

355
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,833
as just a normal girl
and not a monster?

356
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,541
I wouldn't be so careless
in labeling people...

357
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,416
Maybe you're the monster.

358
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,291
What is that
supposed to mean?

359
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,000
Come back, please!

360
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,000
Ouri Kagami... There's
something you should know.

361
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,708
Makina?

362
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,166
I'll just say it...

363
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,958
You're not
my contracted monk.

364
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,416
What? Why?

365
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,833
You lack ability.

366
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,666
But if you don't have
a contracted monk...

367
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,875
You'll die or
become a Shikabane!

368
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,541
I have a contracted monk.

369
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,166
Keisei is still with me...

370
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,541
The curse he left me keeps
the two of us connected.

371
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,625
But it is for me
alone to endure

372
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,666
You don't...
I can help you!

373
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,583
You're nothing but
a burden to me...

374
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,875
And I'm a burden to you.

375
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,583
The only reason you
fight is because of me.

376
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,000
It's not necessary.

377
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,125
Stop it!

378
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,916
You're not getting
it, are you?

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,666
If something were to happen
and you got injuries

380
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,041
you couldn't recover from,

381
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:55,125
they wouldn't accept you
as a contracted monk.

382
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,500
No.

383
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,583
I see.

384
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,708
Then you leave
me no choice.

385
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:08,541
Zadan technique,
Golden Claw!

386
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,166
These strings are an extension
of my nervous system.

387
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,166
They can trace even the
subtlest of movements...

388
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,666
I can control my opponent's body
down to each individual muscle.

389
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,916
You're not getting
away this time!

390
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,333
How long do we have
to keep her like this?

391
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,041
I don't know.

392
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,333
But if she continues
harboring this curse...

393
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,541
Her days as a Shikabane
Hime are numbered.

394
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,458
This is the one
from four years ago.

395
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,375
It's been verified.

396
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,791
Are absolutely
sure about that?

397
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,541
Fine.

398
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,708
Takamasa?

399
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,250
After four long years...

400
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,041
Where are we going?!

401
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,500
We just got information
of Shikabane activity

402
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,833
in our district.

403
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,041
The two of you can handle it.
Makina needs me.

404
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,166
You saw it,
right...?

405
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,000
Makina Hoshimura's
aberration?

406
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,625
I told you...

407
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,875
I realized that my Shikabane
Hime is an aberration...

408
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,958
And accepted it.

409
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,166
Where we're going...

410
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,875
I'll be able to
prove it to you.

411
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,708
You should...
You need to see this.

412
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,541
Dammit!

413
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,458
What? The Seven Stars
aren't enough...?

414
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,666
Now this Shikabane?

415
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,416
Takamasa.

416
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,416
[Music]

417
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,083
The lips that once
whispered love...

418
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,083
Now scream...

419
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,333
"Don't look at me!
Stay back!"...

420
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,750
Over and over again.

421
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,458
Even so, you find it
difficult not to look at...

422
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,666
"Itsuki's Form."
