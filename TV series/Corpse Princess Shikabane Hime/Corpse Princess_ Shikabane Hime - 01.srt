1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:55,416
[Mew]

2
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:24,666
[Music]

3
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,208
You there, brother?

4
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,791
What happened to you?

5
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,875
She's cold!

6
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,416
She's dead...!

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,375
I mean, she's passed on...

8
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,125
Did she die from some kind
of an accident or something?

9
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,583
And why is she
here all alone?

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,125
You must stop this!

11
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,708
Guardian, please!
You can't!

12
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,333
Guardian, there's nothing
you can do in your condition.

13
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,333
The bond has
already been broken.

14
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,500
I recognize that man.

15
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,041
He's the one who comes from
the head temple sometimes.

16
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,166
His name is
Shirae, I think.

17
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,625
And that other guy was
calling brother 'Guardian?'

18
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,750
Where did he get
those injuries?

19
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,458
And just who the
heck is that girl?

20
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,333
Curious, aren't you?

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,291
She's Shikabane.

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,666
What?!

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,375
Something you will
become fascinated by...

24
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,416
soon enough.

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,333
Guardian Tagami...

26
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,500
It's my lack of skills

27
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,500
that caused the bond
to begin to break...

28
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,375
Still, it's not too late!

29
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,625
You'd be better off
to wait for a new one.

30
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,041
She's not an
object, Honda.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,916
Keisei...

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm sorry...

33
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,458
I'm certain that
she was dead.

34
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,291
Hagino... right?

35
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,666
You know, back at your home,
we found seven corpses

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,416
you tried to hide
inside a closet.

37
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,208
Those are the women who used
to live with you, aren't they?

38
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,958
What would you cops
do if you found

39
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,958
that your subordinates got
together and committed a crime?

40
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,833
There's only one answer.
You'd punish them.

41
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,625
Well, it's the same
for those women.

42
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,875
I just punished them.
That's all.

43
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,500
Then tell me what crime
those women are guilty of?!

44
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,416
They disobeyed my
instructions...

45
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,666
And that's a felony.

46
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,750
Ah!

47
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,875
Stop!

48
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,291
Hey!
He's getting away!

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,291
We gather for
this meal today, again,

50
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,708
thanks to the
protection of Buddha.

51
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,708
Hey... What're you
doing, Keisei?!

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,041
Don't call me Keisei, Shouta,
it's Mr. Head Monk to you.

53
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,333
And it's okay for a
Buddhist monk to steal food?

54
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,416
Listen, kids, this
is a strange world,

55
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,666
and in it there are many
people who seem respectable

56
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,791
but in truth are
consumed by evil.

57
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,250
Don't let anyone's
public appearance

58
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,750
or personality fool you.

59
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,333
You must see
through these individuals

60
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,708
to find the truth.

61
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,125
Yet another valuable lesson
taught to you by me...

62
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,791
What're you trying to teach
them this time, Tagami?

63
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,958
You see... As the man
in charge of this place,

64
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,875
I was seeing
to the kids' well being.

65
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,291
The land we're on may
belong to the Sekuu Temple,

66
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,375
but I am still the director
of this facility...

67
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,041
I want all of you to forget
what he just said, okay?

68
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,458
Instead, we're going to
divide Tagami's breakfast

69
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,833
equally amongst
the rest of us!

70
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,000
Come on!!

71
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,666
Yeah!

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,208
Excuse me, Director,

73
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,875
but is it okay if I leave
this stuff at the front for now?

74
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,333
You're moving out tonight?

75
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,583
Yeah, and I'm gonna ask my
friends at school to help me.

76
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,583
No, Hanagami!

77
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,666
You can't seriously
be moving out?!

78
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,500
My name's not Hanagami...!
It's Kagami, Kagami!

79
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,208
No...!
It's Hanagami...!

80
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,458
Hanagami!!

81
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,083
Owww.

82
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Are you gonna take
all those with you?!

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,166
It was you, wasn't it?!

84
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,166
You put all these
magazines in with my stuff!

85
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,666
I don't think so.

86
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,500
That's your name written
across the front.

87
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
Maybe so, but it's written
in your hand writing!

88
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,791
I did it out of
parental love.

89
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,333
I thought you'd
enjoy them much more

90
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,875
once you started
living by yourself.

91
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,208
I'm fine on my own!

92
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,833
Besides, you're not
my parent, are you?!

93
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,333
You're right...

94
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,375
After all, you grew
up here same as I did.

95
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,916
Look, I'll always think of you
as a brother no matter what.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,375
I don't understand why
you wanna leave us, Ouri.

97
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,125
Hey, I'll be close...

98
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,916
I'll be stopping by for
dinner all the time.

99
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,125
Sure, but
it'll cost ya!

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,875
See ya later!

101
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,333
Once school is over,
I'll come back.

102
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,541
So just hold on to my
stuff until then, okay?

103
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,833
Thanks!

104
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,083
He said he'll be working
two part time jobs.

105
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,583
He's that age where he needs
to feel independent...

106
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,625
Let him give it a shot.

107
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,333
Did you notice...?

108
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
He started saying he wanted
to live by himself

109
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,916
only when he saw
you laid up

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,291
after that injury you
received last year.

111
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,208
That's when it started.

112
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,375
I had no idea.

113
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,458
I know how often you vanish
and then reappear all messed up.

114
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,500
I've gotten used to it
over time, but Ouri hasn't.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,666
So the Dai-Rin House is
actually closer to the school?

116
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,166
Yeah, but the rent here can
be higher than you'd imagine.

117
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,000
Which is why I'm not so crazy
about living by myself.

118
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,833
The real reason you
bailed is that the cemetery

119
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,833
behind your house just plain
creeped you out, right?

120
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,625
I've got enough
respect for the dead...

121
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,375
not to be scared by them.

122
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,333
Didn't you tell
me before...

123
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,625
that sometimes you've
seen dead people?

124
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,458
Yeah, since
it's a temple...

125
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,916
But it's never
frightened me or anything.

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,208
Which I think is what
the problem is...

127
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,041
So you guys gonna
help me move, or what?

128
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,583
Hey! Where are you going?!

129
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,083
Uh, I forgot, I've
got club activities.

130
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,916
And I don't wanna
do physical labor.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,041
Oh, crap!
We better hurry!

132
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,500
I am!

133
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,583
Inuhiko, hi.

134
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,125
I told you not to call me
by my first name, right?

135
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,458
I hate it...
Anyway, so did you hear?

136
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,791
Hear what?

137
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,250
You know, about
the harem criminal.

138
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,000
A Harem...?!

139
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,166
I'd love to have a harem,
just for one day!

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,166
So... you must be talking
about that guy

141
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,333
who lived with all of those
women who turned up missing,

142
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,750
I heard about him.

143
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Of course! It's all they talk
about on the TV news.

144
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,833
And last night they said
that after the police

145
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,000
executed a search
warrant on his house,

146
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,583
they found seven corpses
hidden inside.

147
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,666
Corpses...

148
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,541
So he really did
kill some of them!

149
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,583
Well, at least the police
have him in custody.

150
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,833
Actually he
slipped away...

151
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,875
The student council sent
a warning out to all of us,

152
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
since the cops said
it's more than likely

153
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,166
that he's lurking around
this area of town.

154
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,541
I guess your window of
opportunity to move has closed.

155
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,375
But, today's the only day
that I can take off

156
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,583
from either of my jobs.

157
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,500
This guy's house is near the
next train station, isn't it?

158
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,750
It just seems so unreal,

159
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,208
those corpses
being so close to us.

160
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,791
Yeah...

161
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>The suspect is said to have</i>
<i>lived with several women...</i>

162
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,208
Normally, the Shikabane
of vicious criminals

163
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,000
like this guy don't appear
in town all that often.

164
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,250
Even with death row inmates,
when they become Shikabane,

165
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,166
they're taken care of within
the prison, secretly.

166
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,625
And the whole idea
of them getting shot

167
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,416
and killed by
the cops is rare enough

168
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,166
that I can't recall
it ever happening.

169
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,416
Regardless, this guy
became a Shikabane.

170
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,458
The police're hiding this.

171
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,208
But it happened...

172
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,291
He jumped off the 20th floor
of a building yesterday.

173
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Alive... I'm alive!

174
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,333
I can't die!

175
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,041
I am immortal!

176
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,666
Shikabane are simply
corpses that reanimate,

177
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,208
due to intense regrets
and obsessions.

178
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,791
Both local police
and the government

179
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,833
as a whole
deny their existence.

180
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,291
But this guy
became a Shikabane.

181
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,041
And Shikabane kill humans.

182
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,958
Let's not forget that the
Shikabane of vicious criminals

183
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,083
sometimes have odd powers.

184
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,000
That's precisely why
we're asking you.

185
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,125
You're the Guardian.

186
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,583
I'll be the inspector,
as I always am.

187
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,500
And I'm on my own.

188
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,875
That's the entire reason

189
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,541
why we've bothered
to take in someone like you.

190
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,208
Honda!

191
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,333
Not like any of your
answers will change my job.

192
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,416
I'm gonna find this guy
and I'm gonna kill him.

193
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,875
Did you see that?
Is it a bird?

194
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,791
Mommy! Check it out!

195
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,750
Oh, my goodness!
What was that?!

196
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,375
Who would rent you
this rickety old thing?

197
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,916
Rent. This thing was free.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,458
You know I was watching
the news earlier...

199
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,208
Yeah. The harem criminal.

200
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,208
Don't worry.
He's only after women.

201
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,041
I know.
Just be careful, will you?

202
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,000
Director... I don't
know what to say...

203
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,291
You've been so good to me.

204
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,416
Stop it.

205
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,666
Well then...
See you guys.

206
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,791
It was a woman from
Hagino's harem?

207
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,291
Yes, I saw her enter the
building on her own

208
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,625
a few minutes ago.

209
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,208
I guess Hagino
summoned her here.

210
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,083
The police are also
looking for her,

211
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,166
so we should hurry before
they catch wind of this.

212
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,083
What the hell
are you doing?!

213
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,875
I died and then
I returned to life...

214
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,250
I have become a
vampire immortal...

215
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,875
the chosen god to
reign over mankind...

216
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,541
Bullshit... You're nothing
but a Shikabane.

217
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,708
But how...?!

218
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,333
A Shikabane creating
another Shikabane...

219
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:20,375
I told you, my life
is now that of a vampire.

220
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,250
And these are my
faithful servants.

221
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,541
Are these women
Shikabane, too?

222
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,666
Or is he using some kind
of hypnosis on them?

223
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,708
Maybe you want
to serve me too!

224
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,791
Well well... You're not
human, either, are you?

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,833
Makina!

226
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,750
Dammit...

227
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,750
I gotta find
someone to help...

228
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,666
But what if everything I own
is stolen while I'm gone...?

229
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,125
Could it be?

230
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,291
She looks the same.

231
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,125
Of course she does...

232
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,041
Because it's her.

233
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,083
What happened?

234
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,583
She's dead...

235
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,000
again!

236
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,958
But you don't feel yourself
being scared, do you?

237
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,916
Instead, you're
fascinated by her.

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,333
You're unable to feel fear
when it comes to death,

239
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,166
and it scares you
that you're like this.

240
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,958
What are you doing?

241
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,583
This is what Brother
did when I saw her last.

242
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,541
That's a corpse
you're holding.

243
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,125
A Shikabane.

244
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,708
I know that.
I have to try.

245
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,708
Help...

246
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,791
me...

247
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,291
What are you doing?

248
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,250
Your heart wasn't
beating, so I helped.

249
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,208
Forget you saw me.

250
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,375
Your heart's
still not beating.

251
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,708
Knowing that... aren't you
scared in the least?

252
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,083
Not really...
You're alive.

253
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,333
Hey, hold on!

254
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,458
Makina!

255
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,375
How's your body?

256
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,250
It got revived...

257
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,708
and you're with me
now, so I'm good.

258
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,333
Shirae and the others are
watching the Shikabane...

259
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,666
Can you go?

260
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,708
Yes.

261
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,125
Just make sure that
whatever you do,

262
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,833
you don't attack the women.

263
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,541
Shikabane can't pass
their condition on.

264
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,416
We don't think those who
were attacked by Hagino

265
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
necessarily
become Shikabane.

266
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,250
Then, that means...

267
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,208
They're either
hypnotized somehow,

268
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,458
or they've admired Hagino's
charisma from the beginning

269
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,750
and fell prey to that.

270
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
Of course
it's also possible

271
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,500
they convinced themselves
Hagino is an actual vampire.

272
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,833
Either way, they're alive.

273
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,375
And I don't have the right
to kill living people.

274
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,833
No one has that right.

275
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,458
Not a living person
or a Shikabane!

276
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,583
What about the seven corpses
found in Hagino's house?

277
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,333
Do you think he killed
them all by himself?

278
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,375
I'm unsure.

279
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,625
It's possible that
he made those women

280
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,916
in the harem
kill each other.

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,125
But in any event,
it doesn't matter.

282
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,375
I know, I know.
Those women are alive.

283
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,708
And me... I'm dead.

284
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,458
You fell from twenty floors
up and yet here you are.

285
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,791
So I was right...

286
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,708
From time to time,
there's a corpse like you

287
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,000
born in the world...

288
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,041
You're dead,
but your will remains,

289
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,250
your body functions,
and you kill humans.

290
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,375
You're called Shikabane.

291
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,125
There's another
kind of Shikabane.

292
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,833
With the sole purpose of
killing those like you...

293
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,333
Out of fear,
pity, or ridicule,

294
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,250
people like to refer
to us by one name only...

295
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Shikabane Hime!

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,958
Didn't you tell me
not to attack them?

297
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,416
All I did was help
them evacuate safely.

298
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,083
Come over here,
Shikabane Hime.

299
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,041
You and I are the
same, you know that?

300
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,750
We both feast on humans
and we live forever.

301
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,500
You and Makina
aren't the same...

302
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,875
what an absurd statement!

303
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,291
Wait, Makina!
It's too dangerous!

304
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,750
Dangerous?!

305
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,916
You should know by
now, I fear nothing!

306
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,416
There's only one way
to kill a Shikabane...

307
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
You gotta destroy
the brain.

308
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,125
Look at that...
You're scared of me now.

309
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,458
You lose!

310
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,375
Looks like...
they had fun.

311
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,541
I smell Shikabane...

312
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,375
[Music]

313
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,250
People have forgotten that
death lies close to them...

314
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,666
Because if they
ever remembered it,

315
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,500
they'd go
completely insane.

316
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,041
But soon they'll remember.

317
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,541
