1
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,750
I must admit
I'm curious,

2
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,208
do you know
what they truly are?

3
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,125
They fight only to
fulfill a contract.

4
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,666
If they succeed in
destroying 108 Shikabane...

5
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,875
they can make it
into heaven.

6
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,916
Into heaven?

7
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,750
Itsuki,
you're all right!

8
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,166
C'mon!

9
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,458
Itsuki, no...
You too?

10
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,250
She murders
her own kind.

11
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,000
I am Takamasa
Sougi, Genpaku...

12
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,583
I am a contracted monk.

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,708
Don't move.

14
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,916
Umehara's
favorite disciple

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,750
is the new Genpaku
if I'm not mistaken.

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,916
For generations,
those in the Sougi family

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,041
that have become Genpaku have
proven to be fierce warriors.

18
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,000
According to tradition, Takamine
belongs to the Shuhou faction.

19
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,833
However, Umehara doesn't
work for the Shuhou

20
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,166
or the Shujou faction.

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,250
So he was the one sent in
to investigate Keisei, huh?

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
If that's the case, we
can just leave everything else

23
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,125
up to Genpaku and
see what happens.

24
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,291
We're aware of the fact
that Ouri Kagami...

25
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,958
has appeared during several of
the last Shikabane encounters.

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,916
I don't get it.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,083
What about
the traitor monk?

28
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,458
Akasha Shishidou has
been sighted in the area.

29
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,125
If Sho-Sojo Tagami has anything
to do with the traitor monk...

30
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,041
The actions of his brother
may mean something.

31
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,208
According to our
extensive research...

32
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,833
Akasha shared a room with
Sho-Sojo Tagami years ago.

33
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,291
Your research
is misleading.

34
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,000
Tagami wasn't his
only roommate.

35
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,958
I shared
that room as well.

36
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,208
I am aware of that.

37
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:47,083
I see then...
I gotta find Akasha now.

38
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,083
If Keisei and Ouri
are working with him...

39
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll take care of
both of them as well.

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,250
Although there are nearly
100 Shikabane Hime...

41
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,666
Yours remains to be
the only one permitted

42
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,958
to terminate human beings
as well as Shikabane.

43
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,583
I'm counting on you.

44
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,708
Have things really
come down to this?

45
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,916
What are
you talking about?

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,250
As of right now,
Sho-Sojo Mee-bu might have to...

47
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,500
If he is to discover that they
have been in communications

48
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,000
with the traitor monk...

49
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,291
More than likely, he will
neutralize Sho-Sojo Tagami.

50
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,208
Everything... Is for the
survival of the Kougon Sect.

51
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,291
From what
I know about Ouri,

52
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,041
he doesn't seem like the type
to get mixed up with Akasha.

53
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,541
But you'll kill him,
won't you?

54
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,250
You ready?

55
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,500
Itsuki is a
Shikabane Hime?

56
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,250
More than one Shikabane
Hime can exist?

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
Well...

58
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,458
I think there are more of us
than you think there are,

59
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,416
does that make sense?

60
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,166
What's that
teacher doing here?

61
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,791
I guess you could say...
He's like an added bonus.

62
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,541
Or a babysitter!

63
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,875
He's a contracted monk.

64
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,708
You didn't think your big
brother was the only one?

65
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,041
How the hell do you
know my brother?

66
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,333
We have a history...

67
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,541
He was even there
on the day...

68
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,583
Don't try to
interfere in this...

69
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,875
I have to...

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,291
Did you just
pistol whip me?

71
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,375
I'm not the
one interfering!

72
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,416
What?

73
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,875
The rental car...

74
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,041
He used it to gather all
of those people together...

75
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,833
Forcing them to
kill one another.

76
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,583
And do you
wanna know why?

77
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,625
To produce Shikabane!

78
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,041
The two of us can
take this guy down...

79
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,250
There's nothing you can do,
so stay out of it!

80
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,416
Run, Ouri! Get the
hell out of here...!

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,166
Go!

82
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,041
Such a shame...

83
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,208
Things were just starting
to get a little interesting.

84
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,250
At least, now we know he
isn't working with you.

85
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,333
Finding a way to handle it is
a problem for the Kougon Sect.

86
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,750
I've heard of you...

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,625
The monk who betrayed
his calling...

88
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,791
attacked the head temple,
stole ritual scriptures...

89
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,833
And murdered his
own Shikabane Hime.

90
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,750
Stop,
I'm blushing...

91
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,916
Looks like my reputation
has proceeded me.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,083
Allow me to
introduce myself...

93
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,125
Former head of
Gon-Sho-Sojos...

94
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,208
I am Akasha Shishidou.

95
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,875
I just have to know...

96
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,458
Why would you kill your
own Shikabane Hime?

97
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,791
And why on earth would you be
trying to create Shikabane?

98
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,958
Well... I would hope
you were smart enough

99
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,708
to figure it out
on your own.

100
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,833
Then again... Your brain
is probably just as dead

101
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,750
as the rest of your
walking corpse.

102
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,791
I may not be the hero of
this story, sweetheart.

103
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,458
But that doesn't
make me a Shikabane.

104
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,750
Can you, a simple
little Shikabane Hime,

105
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,791
really take a human life?

106
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,125
I find it hard
to believe

107
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,041
that the Kougon Sect
would allow such a thing.

108
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,000
She will do whatever
she needs to do

109
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,125
in order to bring you to
the head temple, Akasha.

110
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,125
Defiled.

111
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,041
You gonna cry?

112
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,833
How dare you touch me with
those cold, dead hands of yours.

113
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,166
What's that?

114
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,916
It's a shame to waste this
on someone like you...

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,208
But you must
learn a lesson...

116
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,833
For laying a hand on me.

117
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,083
Open...
My zadan technique!

118
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,875
No, a zadan
technique?

119
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,125
On-Jiri-Chei-Sowaka...

120
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,250
Itsuki!
Move away!

121
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,875
I can't!

122
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875
Lotus Flower!

123
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,958
There's nothing you can do,
so stay out of it!

124
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,166
Stay out of it...
Heard that before.

125
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,166
If you really want to help,
don't get involved.

126
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,833
What the hell
am I doing here?

127
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't see the
Shikabane's brain.

128
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,458
If you don't
wanna die, beat it!

129
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,500
That girl said
the same thing.

130
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,875
Itsuki?

131
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,500
You know her,
don't you...?

132
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,583
Because you're both
Shikabane Hime?

133
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,041
I've seen her
around before...

134
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,416
That's all you
need to know.

135
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,250
Why were you
with her?

136
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,500
You... Said if
I got involved

137
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
that it would end up
hurting my brother.

138
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,083
What did you
mean by that?

139
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,916
Not sure if you'd
noticed, Ouri...

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,416
But this really
isn't the best time...

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,166
Answer the question!

142
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,916
When someone has a duty
to protect a person...

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,708
They can exert an unusual
amount of strength...

144
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,875
Years ago...
A monk ended up dying

145
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,125
because he was
betrayed by someone

146
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,041
he was trying
to protect.

147
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,250
Are you saying that
Brother might die

148
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,916
if I keep
getting involved?

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,666
If you were
to step in,.

150
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,791
the scar inside Keisei's heart
would be larger than ever.

151
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,416
Do you understand...?

152
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
That's why I don't want you
to come closer to our side.

153
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,583
It's not for
Brother's sake...

154
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,833
It's for your own,
isn't it?

155
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,166
Killing 108 Shikabane,...

156
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,208
Gets you into heaven,
isn't that right?

157
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,875
You're right... That's
the contract I agreed to.

158
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,625
Do you care about
anything else...?

159
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,625
Or is earning
your wings it?

160
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,000
If you wanna die,
go right ahead and die...!

161
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,000
But don't take my
Brother with you!

162
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
I do care.

163
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,125
Makina!

164
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,583
It's gone!

165
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,083
Keisei...

166
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,916
Do it!

167
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,875
Brother!

168
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,916
What're you doing?!

169
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,791
I made a promise.

170
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,375
What do you
mean a promise...?

171
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,833
A promise that puts your life
on the line for some girl...?

172
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,958
And makes it okay for you
to chop her arm off?

173
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,083
Please tell me,
what kind of promise

174
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,916
could be worth
all of this?

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,916
She doesn't do
this for rewards...

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,541
Not even for Heaven.

177
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,666
From the moment she was
resurrected as a Shikabane...

178
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
She has
only two choices.

179
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,875
She can either violate
the world of the living,

180
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,541
acting on her regrets
as a Shikabane.

181
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,208
Or attempt
to keep her humanity

182
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,625
by being a Shikabane Hime
and kill all Shikabane.

183
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,000
The price tag on either
of them is too great!

184
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,125
True... but she lives
with her choice.

185
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,666
My choice...
my promise...

186
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,375
is to stay by her side.

187
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,916
Keisei...

188
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,958
There it is.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,166
I trust everyone else

190
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,583
in the rental car
made it out all right?

191
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,375
There was one other person,
but I haven't seen her.

192
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,541
Now, you're sure he called
himself the traitor monk?

193
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sure... he knew
about you as well as me.

194
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,583
Akasha...

195
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,500
Who is that,
Keisei?

196
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,750
Wait, don't!

197
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,833
Just an ordinary Souma...

198
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,333
The Kougon Sect's
special elixir.

199
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,416
If it really is him...

200
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,750
But what about...

201
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,625
Doesn't it have a
strong side effect?

202
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll be fine.

203
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,583
Brother...
Makina...

204
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,291
I understand why your promise
is so important now...

205
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,375
Brother...

207
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,291
All I need is for you to
promise me this one thing...

208
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,041
Promise me you won't die.

209
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,750
Do not seek death...

210
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,250
but do not
fear it either...

211
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,916
There cannot be
life without death.

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,875
It is inescapable.

213
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,375
I'm sorry, little brother...
I can't promise that.

214
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,166
Itsuki...

215
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,583
Genpaku...

216
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,833
When did you become
in charge of this district?

217
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,000
Senior Tagami...
I'm sorry, I was sent here.

218
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,166
I see... You're here
investigating Ouri and me.

219
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,916
Akasha...

220
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,625
Its been a long time,
Senior... Hasn't it?

221
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,916
Makina!

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,958
You can't do anything
with your wounds.

223
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,000
He's using
a zadan technique.

224
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,375
A zadan technique?

225
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,333
Just like
Shikabane Hime...

226
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,666
Zadan is a technique
that's meant

227
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,875
to symbolize
the Kougon Sect.

228
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,666
You make yourself head monk
within the ceremonial altar...

229
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Open a scripture using
a holy instrument...

230
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,541
This causes a miracle with
the help of the stars...

231
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,875
and infinite power.

232
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,250
That's a miracle?

233
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,625
Five years ago...

234
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,916
Sadahiro and I were the
only ones with the ability

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,375
to perform the
zadan technique.

236
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,916
This is the first time you
or that vestigial Genpaku...

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,208
have seen such an
advanced zadan, isn't it?

238
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,750
They are...
Shikabane.

239
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,666
Yes... I gave
their lives purpose.

240
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,375
They were fortunate enough
to become Shikabane

241
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,583
after killing one another
in the rental car...

242
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,416
I trapped them
in my zadan.

243
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,166
Their regrets... He's using the
Shikabane like a damn battery!

244
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,000
How is this any different
from the Kougon Sect

245
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,333
using the power
of Shikabane Hime?

246
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,625
I don't allow my Shikabane to
keep their pathetic feelings...

247
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
They're used
simply for power.

248
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,000
Take it from me,

249
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,583
they suffer much less in
such an unenlightened state.

250
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,500
You're wrong!

251
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,083
You murdered those kids,
not once but twice.

252
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,041
Making them kill each
other off in cold blood

253
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,250
to create Shikabane.

254
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,666
And the second
they resurrected,

255
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,666
you used them to create
that forsaken zadan.

256
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,166
You always had a soft spot
for the young ones, Senior...

257
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,916
If you love your walking
corpse this much...

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,458
it's only a matter of time
before you love Shikabane, too.

259
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,500
Makina!

260
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,916
In order to open a zadan
of that level,...

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,583
he'd need a powerful
holy instrument.

262
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,166
I don't know if it's
a holy instrument...

263
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,291
But he put out
a dark-red box.

264
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,625
We're gonna have to cut
nap time short, princess.

265
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,625
Makina, were you able to
patch things up with Ouri?

266
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,250
You're hilarious...

267
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,541
Stop kidding around and help
me break this zadan technique!

268
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,625
Don't try
to order me around.

269
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,208
Your bullets are useless.

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,833
Guns aren't necessarily
used for shooting.

271
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,625
That's it.

272
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,125
Brother!

273
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,666
Senior!

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,916
Keisei!

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,375
If you don't have
the mediation...

276
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,916
Going after the mediation
was a wise decision.

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,416
As you can see, this casket
is no ordinary instrument.

278
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,666
It's the blood of 108 people
at the end of their lives.

279
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,208
Brother!

280
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,208
Even just one person's regrets
can have great power

281
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,458
when they transform
into Shikabane.

282
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,416
And he said 108 people.

283
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,708
Simply touching the box
would cause spiritual trauma.

284
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,125
Any average person

285
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,541
would have been knocked
immediately unconscious.

286
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,166
Come on, Senior...

287
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,916
You must have known that
this was bound to happen

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,958
because of your
love for her.

289
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,875
You would know better
than I about a love

290
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,958
for Shikabane Hime,
Akasha.

291
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,250
Is that why...?

292
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,666
You betrayed everyone
within the Kougon Sect?

293
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,958
Because you couldn't stand
to look your Shikabane Hime

294
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,333
in the eyes
for one more second?

295
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,666
Know this, Senior...

296
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,791
With everything
that I have done,

297
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,708
I never betrayed
the Kougon Sect.

298
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,708
They are the deceivers.

299
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,333
The Kougon Sect
betrayed me.

300
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,833
He couldn't
have moved!

301
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,000
Souma!

302
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,500
Idiot...! Do you realize
what you've done?

303
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,583
The blood inside
will flow out!

304
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,958
Resulting in the regrets
and obsessions of 108 people

305
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,708
to fall on us.

306
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,083
If you suffer
a spiritual trauma,

307
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,875
your body is going
to be greatly affected too.

308
00:19:58,958 --> 00:19:59,916
What can I say?

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It seemed like a
good idea...

310
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,583
Sorry.

311
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,375
My trauma
doesn't compare...

312
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,916
The pain and suffering will be
much worse for you, old friend.

313
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,458
What...? That was
no ordinary bullet...

314
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,000
It had a zadan technique!

315
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,166
Of course.

316
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,750
Do you have
to stand so close?

317
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,083
Not much choice
in the matter...

318
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,125
I need to be this close
in order to use my zadan

319
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,791
with your bullets.

320
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,958
Sadahiro.

321
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,375
This is far
from over, Senior.

322
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,708
My Shikabane will triumph in
annihilating the Kougon Sect...

323
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,916
Until next time.

324
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,958
Is he okay?

325
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,750
Keisei used Akasha's mediation
as some sort of shield,

326
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,416
he knew that he would
suffer spiritual trauma.

327
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,166
At least, now we know
he isn't in alliance

328
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,500
with the traitor monk.

329
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,791
Are you relieved?

330
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,791
Then... There's no problem

331
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,083
reinstating Keisei Tagami's
position as Guardian?

332
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,958
Yes.

333
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,125
And as for, Akasha...

334
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,000
Will he...
be okay?

335
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,916
Since Keisei
refuses to do so,

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,625
I'll make the promise
in his place.

337
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,041
I won't let Keisei die...

338
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,416
I will always protect
him, no matter what.

339
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,541
[Music]

340
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,625
Humans can understand each
other because they use words?

341
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,500
What a joke.

342
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,625
Humans always get confused
by their meanings.

343
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,000
They're controlled by

344
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,041
"The False Power of Words."
