happened up there?

This girl right here...

00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,333
She didn't live very
far away from us.

4
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,458
Used to stop by all the time
to play with the other kids.

5
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,208
She looks familiar,
I may have seen her.

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,041
I don't think that any parent
would want their children

7
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,958
spending their free time hanging
around a place like this.

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:34,041
But Hikaru still dropped
by here as much as she could.

9
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,791
Looks like Shouta's
pretty upset about it.

10
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,041
He chased her
all the time.

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,208
To think the poor thing died
in an accident like that...

12
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,541
We're orphans.

When people are nice to us,
it means the world,

14
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,500
which could be
how he saw her.

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
See... It's kinda like how
I've always thought of you

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,166
as my mother.

17

Do you wanna
go with me?

20
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,041
We should say goodbye.

21

22
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,125
What did you call me?!

23
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,500
It's a big story!

24
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,583
The place'll be crawling
with news crews!

25
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,500
But you want us to
show up as her friends

26
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,916
so the whole
world can see

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,291
that Hikaru hung around
with loser orphans!

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,750
I don't want her to be
remembered that way...

29
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,541
I'm not like you.

30
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,666
I can see the
bigger picture.

Perfect timing.

I found these ZENBU NOSE figures
if you wanted to take some.

00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,041
or a funeral, the
incident report is made

to the Kougon Sect regardless
of the sect or religion.

you didn't know

80
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,250
that our part-timer just
happens to be Keisei's brother.

81
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,000
What...? But I thought
his last name was Kagami.

82
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,583
Well, the kid was actually
taken in by Keisei.

83
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,958
If he was given the last name
Tagami he'd be obligated

84
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,750
to follow the rules
of the Kougon Sect.

85
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,500

by one character.

is here, working with us?

The other kids.

138
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,833
We've heard that two more of
their bodies have disappeared.

139
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,625
But unlike with Hikaru,
there weren't any witnesses.

140
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,208
They became Shikabane and
slipped out of their coffins...

141

probably waited
until after dark.

Where do you wanna go?

163
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,541
The newspaper said

164
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,041
she had broken bones
and ruptured organs.

165
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,500
How could...

166
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,875
Come on.

167
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,458
What do you
think that means?

168
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,791
Often, the regrets that
drive a child Shikabane

169
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,458
are grounded in
the simple desire

170
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:19,500
to keep playing and remain
on Earth forever.

171
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:29,833
to keep playing and remain
on Earth forever.

172
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,541
Play nice...

173
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,708
Let me go.

174
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,166
What's wrong with you?

175
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,375
They're Shikabane.

176
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,833
Shikabane?

177
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,458
Someone who dies full of
intense regrets can gain

178
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,916
an immortal body and turn
back into an active being.

179
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,041
They're called Shikabane.

180
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,791
She died in that accident
that was all over the TV,

181
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,875
but she doesn't have
one scratch on her.

182
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,333
You telling me you didn't
think that was strange?

183
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,375
Yeah, but I've watched you
go from dead back to life

184
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,666
and then get up and talk.

185
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,875
Does that mean
you're Shikabane?

186
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,916
A Shikabane is
death itself.

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,208
That's why they bring
death upon others.

188
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,458
I'm someone who fights
against that death...

189
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,416
An immortal who
kills the immortal...

190
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,458
Shikabane Hime!

191
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,541
We're gonna play...

192
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,750
We're gonna play...

193
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,958
We're gonna play...

194
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,166
We're gonna play...

195
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,125
We're gonna play!

196
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,916
And Shikabane...

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,791
They won't die until
their brains are destroyed

198
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,833
or their bodies are
completely shredded...

199
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,125
So are you ready for it?

200
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,625
We're gonna play!

201
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,958
This is it...?

202
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,000
This is what
they call playing?

203
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,000
My doll...
I'm gonna play...

204
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,333
I'm gonna play
with my pretty...

205
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,833
I see...
I get it now...

206
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,791
why three kids who
died in the same accident

207
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,416
became Shikabane...

208
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,416
All three of you
had the same regret.

209
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,791
You wanted to play more.

210
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,500
That's what any
kid would want.

211
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,000
So you found a way to keep
playing with your friends.

212
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,416
The three of you were one
Shikabane from the start.

213
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,625
Hikaru, stop!

214
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,833
Why don't you
just play with me!

215
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,083
There's something
I wanna give you!

216
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,208
What're you doing...?
You puttin' on a show?

217
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,250
You can pretend to be
a baby all you want...

218
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,625
Nothing will stop me
from finishing this!

219
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,416
Good.
Nice work Minai.

220
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,958
Makina, are you alright?

221
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,333
I'll finish off the rest.

222
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,875
Hikaru...
It's yours...

223
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,958
Hand the Shikabane over.

224
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,875
Did you not see
what just happened?

225
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
She's a monster.

226
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,041
Aren't you
a monster, too?

227
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,666
Yeah, I am.

228
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,958
Now let me have her.

229
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,458
Thanks, Makina.

230
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,958
So what is that you have
in your hand... a letter?

231
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,583
A friend of hers asked me
to put this in her coffin.

232
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,208
I just wanted to
do the right thing.

233
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,291
When the Shikabane sensed
what you had there,

234
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,166
it stopped moving...

235
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,750
What is that?

236
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,208
Follow the boy, Minai...

237
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,041
He knows too much, we're
going to have to watch him.

238
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
That won't be necessary.

239
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,875
But we can't simply
leave him alone.

240
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,750
He's not alone...
He's my brother.

241
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,916
You mean you didn't
know about that?

242
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,375
Then why did you try
so hard to protect him?

243
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,625
Because he's
a regular kid.

244
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,458
Yeah, he is...

245
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,041
Well, anyway, I'll keep
a close watch on him...

246
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,000
After all, I know almost
everything about the boy,

247
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,791
even what pinup girl
poses he's fond of.

248
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,125
There's this one...

249
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,375
And this.

250
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,708
Then he's all yours.

251
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,750
Thank you...

252
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,666
You don't have
to say that.

253
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,791
It's just that... Your
brother thanked me...

254
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,333
After I had finished
off the Shikabane...

255
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,166
I wonder why...

256
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,250
Maybe because
you had the gun

257
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,375
when you told him to hand
the little girl over to you.

258
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,000
You were a threat.

259
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,666
If you hadn't had
that kind of authority,

260
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,208
that kind of a
presence over him,

261
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,750
he probably wouldn't
have given her to you.

262
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,541
Even though he knew
she was a monster,

263
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,750
he couldn't have.

264
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,166
He still saw her as...

265
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,750
a little girl.

266
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,166
That's why he
thanked you.

267
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,416
For giving him
a way out.

268
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,958
He's just that
kind of guy.

269

Ouri... You just can't forget
about that woman, can you?

279
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,125
Her eyes...
her lips...

280
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:42,000
Or is it the sour scent
of death that she wears...

281
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,625
Now...

282
