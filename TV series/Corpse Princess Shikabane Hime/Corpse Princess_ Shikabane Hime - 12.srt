00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,541
Ouri?

3
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,916
Brother...

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,375
There's something
happening.

5
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,958
Yes...

6
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,458
Never mind that...
why are you here?

7
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,958
You should have...
fallen asleep.

8
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,166
Falling asleep...
isn't an option.

9
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,916
Tonight...

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,333
Just got very...
Interesting.

14
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,000
Something's wrong...
Keisei's rune.

15
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,541
How long does it take
to break a bond?

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,375
I've heard that
a Shikabane Hime

17
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,833
is connected to her
contracted monk by a bond...

18
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm dying to know
if this is the truth.

19
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,083
So tell me, can you feel
your monk's life slipping

20
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,333
through the cracks?

21
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,583
It's not true!

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,458
His body...
I can't get a shot.

23
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,416
The monks have had their fun,
now it's my turn...

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,291
It'll be just like
the good old days.

25
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,666
It would appear that
the founder, Ooyatsuka,

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,833
was a Shikabane himself.

27
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,875
And to think that the Seven
Stars were a step ahead of us.

28
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,541
The first to arrive on the scene
were killed almost instantly...

29
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,375
Even the followers.

30
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,125
Looks like they made a point not
to leave even a single survivor.

31
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,416
Sojo!
Come quickly...

32
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,083
Outside!

33
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,291
What is this?

34
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,625
This is a trench.

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,541
This is the curse
of a Shikabane...

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,083
A dimension used to
capture their prey.

37
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,375
But not to worry.

38
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,416
A trench of this immensity
isn't strong enough

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,625
to confine us
for very long.

40
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,083
Our enemy is conveying that
they don't want us to interfere.

41
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,125
Which means we
aren't their target.

42
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,750
Senior Tagami
and Makina!

43
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,916
Trapping them was
entirely too easy.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,333
Perhaps we should
kill them now.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,625
My apologies,
big brother...

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,083
I had intended on killing
you with a single stab.

47
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,458
It's hard to control a
body I'm not familiar with.

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,791
He's possessed...
The Seven Stars did this.

49
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,291
However. If at first
you don't succeed...

50
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,333
I'd be careful
if I were you.

51
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,625
You wouldn't want to
hurt your little brother.

52
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,625
No, I wouldn't.

53
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,083
Which is why I won't...

54
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,250
Allow you to turn
Ouri into a murderer!

55
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,500
Katsu!

56
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,833
Bastard!
Brother.

57
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,125
Don't resist!

58
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,958
What ha-...?
No!

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,041
Just as I thought,

60
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,250
the spirit of a living being
can put up quite a fight.

61
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,125
I can't wait to see
what happens next.

62
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,166
Brother!

63
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,541
Welcome back...
You had me worried.

64
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,166
You're hurt.

65
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,166
Then I wasn't dreaming
earlier, it really happened.

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,208
I can't believe
I actually stabbed you.

67
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,541
I don't know
what to say.

68
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,333
You don't have to
say anything, Ouri.

69
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,166
The stab wound won't
affect me in the slightest.

70
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,625
Not while I have
the Souma elixir.

71
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,875
Senior.

72
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,208
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,250
Ouri, get back!

74
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,916
Ouri!

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,916
I knew it...
You're weak.

76
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,083
It would seem...

77
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,708
To be the end
of the line, old friend.

78
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,166
That's it...
I've had enough!

79
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,958
What would you
like me to do, sir?

80
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,541
Educate...
Teach them a lesson...

81
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,041
Show them why we call
you the Sword Princess.

82
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,958
All right...

83
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,625
Will do.

84
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,333
The strongest Shikabane Hime
within the Kougon Sect.

85
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,000
The trench won't
last much longer.

86
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,625
However... It was
more than enough time.

87
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,791
I'm surprised you
still have the energy

88
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,708
to continue this
pointless charade.

89
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,625
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining.

90
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,041
I've always enjoyed
your company.

91
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,416
Your monk must be putting up
one hell of a fight.

92
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,708
Not that it
really matters.

93
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,291
Do you think you'll cry
when the bastard dies?

94
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,333
You don't seem to be
getting it, sweetheart.

95
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,375
I'm not your average Shikabane,
I'm different...

96
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,833
How do you plan to kill...
what you can't shoot?

97
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,041
I don't have a body to break
into pieces or a brain

98
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,458
that you can destroy.

99
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,125
Being a member of the
Seven Stars allows me

100
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,833
to take the form
of whatever I choose!

101
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,625
I can go anywhere
I please.

102
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,333
Did I neglect to mention
that I can freely change

103
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,458
the properties
of my body, too?

104
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,875
You don't
stand a chance.

105
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,500
I am an
unstoppable force.

106
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,958
All this time
I've wanted...

107
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,125
To kill every
last one of you.

108
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,583
That obsession...
Made me become a Shikabane.

109
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,958
It isn't...
Enough...

110
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,875
My obsession
isn't enough!

111
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,916
Great idea! Let's add
more flames to the fire!

112
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,500
Keisei.

113
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,625
The eye of a contracted
monk is one thing...

114
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,875
But being exposed

115
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,333
to the contents of my
casket is another.

116
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,916
It makes this eye
incredibly valuable,

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,833
more powerful than
the blood of dozens.

118
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,750
You're not worthy
to touch me.

119
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,291
No...

120
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,375
Keisei... Get up!

121
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,875
The lost little
girl routine

122
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,500
doesn't seem to suit
you all that well.

123
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,458
Maybe if you were a human
instead of a Shikabane.

124
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,833
Your contracted monk
should see

125
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:21,041
what you really are
before he leaves this world.

126
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,833
Tagami...!
Impossible!

127
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,916
Keisei.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,125
So here's where
you've been hiding!

129
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,416
We're not finished yet!

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,750
Makina!

131
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,083
Let's see how you do
when you can't breathe!

132
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,833
What's...
Happening?

133
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,250
How did...
What'd you do to me?

134
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,375
Shikimi is a poison

135
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,500
that circulates
through your whole body.

136
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,500
You fool...! By putting
that in your mouth,

137
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,541
you've just sealed
your own fate!

138
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,250
I've had more than enough
of your nonsense...!

139
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,958
Instead of talking...

140
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,208
Perhaps you should
have realized...

141
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,833
That the both of you
are well with my range!

142
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,291
Open now, my zadan!

143
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,000
Those are scriptures!

144
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,583
He can hurt Shikabane.

145
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,500
But at the risk of
sacrificing himself.

146
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,291
His eye...!

147
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
That's the eye of someone
who's accepted their own death!

148
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,958
Keisei... What are
you doing...?

149
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,958
Keisei. What's
happening to me?

150
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,625
Senior, wait!

151
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,625
Stop and I'll tell
you the truth...

152
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,625
Don't you
want to know?

153
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,458
Save your breath!
Senior!

154
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,333
Your kind of truth leads
to the death and destruction

155
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,708
of innocent people...!

156
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,916
And it caused you to murder
your own Shikabane Hime!

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,958
I don't ever
need to know!

158
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,625
No!

159
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,833
Keisei.

160
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,791
That was stupid,
Keisei.

161
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,458
This is all
your fault.

162
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm sorry... This is all
my fault... If I hadn't-...

163
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,916
Shut your mouth!

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,666
Don't tell me
you're sorry...

165
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,791
If you do...

166
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,041
I'll kill you
where you stand.

167
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,750
Keisei knew what
he was doing...

168
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,375
None of this
is your fault.

169
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,666
He fought for those
that he swore to protect...

170
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,375
And his family.

171
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,541
This was
never about you!

172
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,875
Makina... I never intended
to screw things up so badly.

173
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,625
Ouri... I have
a favor to ask.

174
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,583
I need you to help...

175
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,375
Makina and the
others in my place.

176
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,541
I don't...
understand.

177
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,583
You can't... You can't transfer
the contract... You promised.

178
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,125
I know.

179
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,708
I refuse to...
I won't let you do this.

180
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,333
You'll always be...

181
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,583
My one and only
contracted monk.

182
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,916
I'm sorry, Makina.

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,333
I can't continue on...

184
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,625
Deep down...
I know you understand.

185
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,583
I wish I had time
to explain...

186
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,208
To give you a reason to accept
what I'm asking of you.

187
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,333
You may even resent me.

188
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:28,208
But you saw what
happened... to Minai.

189
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,375
A Shikabane Hime without
her contracted monk

190
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,750
either dies instantly or
becomes just another Shikabane.

191
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,666
I don't wish that
to happen to Makina.

192
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,333
I don't care what
happens to me!

193
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,500
What does it matter
if I die...?

194
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
I'm dead already.

195
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,041
Okay... I'll do it.

196
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,000
Mantra...

197
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,250
Even if my body
is destroyed...

198
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,583
The wisdom it
carried is not.

199
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,083
My palm holds
my philosophy.

200
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,791
Spirit... of great
awakening and power.

201
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,583
I implore you to shine
your graceful light upon him

202
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,375
as you did me.

203
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,541
Flesh...!
I must have flesh...!

204
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,166
You have to give
me your Shikabane!

205
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,416
Yes... It's yours.

206
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,333
Every last
one of them...

207
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,791
Will die at the
hands of Kowaku!

208
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,458
When he comes to,
the transfer will be complete.

209
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,500
Get Ouri
to a safe place.

210
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,791
Don't take me...
Take Ouri.

211
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,666
I'll contact
the head temple...

212
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,500
And get you
to a hospital.

213
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,916
Makina.

214
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,041
I can't do this...
I just can't do it.

215
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,291
I can't just
leave you here...

216
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,000
To die.

217
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
You don't have
a choice in the matter.

218
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,583
Your place is at
Ouri's side now.

219
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,583
No, it's not.
I belong with you, Keisei.

220
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,708
I'm sorry... Makina.

221
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,625
I couldn't...
Keep my promise.

222
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,458
Your promise?

223
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,250
I promised that together
we would fight.

224
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,541
I don't care...

225
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,125
That promise means
nothing to me now!

226
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,666
You have to live...
I need you to live.

227
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,083
You won't have to fight
anymore... Understand?

228
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,708
Thank you, Makina.

229
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,541
Spending my days
fighting alongside

230
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,250
you means
everything to me.

231
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,791
The impact we made
is worth all of this...

232
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,291
And more.

233
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,625
Please don't cry.

234
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,416
In my last moments,
I want to see you smile.

235
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,125
Kei...

236
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,500
Smile for me... Makina.

237
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,416
If you smile...

238
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,666
I'll feel as though
I was able save you

239
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,541
from this hellish place...

240
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,500
Even if it's a lie.

241
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
Obsessions...

242
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,333
Regrets right
before death.

243
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,250
Dwelling on a regret...

244
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,291
Would force Keisei
to turn into a Shikabane.

245
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,458
Even so...

246
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,000
At least he'd
still be alive.

247
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,833
Keisei.

248
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,791
Look at me.

249
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:43,833
[Music]


250
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:53,875
[Music]


251
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:03,875
[Music]


252
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:12,375
[Music]


253
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,208
Keisei...

254
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,500
No.

255
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,208
We have to get to Senior
Tagami immediately!

256
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,416
No time to waste!

257
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,708
You feel it,
don't you?

258
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,625
Sadahiro... I thought
you went to bed already.

259
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,083
We're heading back.

260
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,500
What...? If Keisei Tagami
finds out we're still in town,

261
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,083
there's gonna be trouble.

262
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,958
Well... Something tells me we
won't need to worry about him.

263
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Not anymore.

264
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,666
Where is she?

265
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,125
Where is his
Shikabane Hime hiding...?

266
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,125
Answer me!

267
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,000
Over here!

268
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:21,625
[Music]


269
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,625
I will destroy you...

270
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,708
And every other
Shikabane...

271
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,541
I'll kill every
last one of you!

272
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,833
Don't be too sure,
brat...!

273
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,041
I'm even
stronger than before!

274
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:37,458
[Music]


275
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,416
Disappear...

276
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Get out
of my sight...

277
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,291
And out of my memories...

278
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,291
Leave this world!

279
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,541
Where could she be getting
this kind of power...?

280
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,833
She's acting like a
completely different person!

281
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,875
Wait a minute!

282
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,375
I can't tell...

283
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,291
If the girl standing
before me...

284
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,958
Is really Makina.

285
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,125
She's performing a curse.

286
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,750
Even though she's
a Shikabane Hime,

287
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,500
she still has the ability
to curse like normal Shikabane.

288
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,375
Damning all Shikabane
of the world is her curse.

289
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,708
However.

290
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,666
It's her all right.

291
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,375
My hands...
They're burning...

292
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,875
Its feels like
I'm on fire.

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,458
The power is
overwhelming him.

294
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,083
Keisei.

295
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,708
It was foolish to make
this impulsive decision...

296
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,000
Your Shikabane Hime

297
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,208
is shortening her new
contracted monk's life...

298
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,125
And turning it into power.

299
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
There's no way anyone
without the proper training

300
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,958
could bear this burden.

301
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,208
Soon...
He'll die.

302
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,875
Makina...

303
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,875
Is this everything
you'd hoped for, Ouri?

304
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,833
Take your hands
off of me!

305
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,208
Seems you have a
brain after all.

306
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,000
It's just in a different
form than others.

307
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,416
Stop... Please...
I'll do anything!

308
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,625
I want to keep living...!
It doesn't matter in what form,

309
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,166
I want to live!

310
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
Allow me to repeat what
you said two years ago

311
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,625
before you killed me.

312
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,833
How ungraceful.

313
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,166
Wait... You're... planning
on keeping the kid?

314
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,666
My temple... has
a child welfare center.

315
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,041
You want to raise him?

316
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't have a choice...
Besides...

317
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,791
I've come
to care for him.

318
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,833
I still have
lingering emotions.

319
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:44,041
Never again...
This is the last time.

320
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,208
The day dawned.

321
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,958
The morning of my
16th birthday...

322
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,916
The long night's
madness had ended.

323
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,583
I lost... my father...
My brother...

324
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,708
And my best friend
