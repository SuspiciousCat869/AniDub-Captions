1
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:12,458
[Music]

2
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,541
What is this place?

3
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,791
You wanted to talk
to me in person.

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,875
I figured it'd be a little
too much of a problem

5
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,416
for both of us if we were
seen near the head temple.

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Don't you think?

7
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,583
There's a Shikabane Hime
that I need you to evaluate.

8
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,250
Now why would you be concerned
about one of them?

9
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,875
It's the daughter
of Hoshimura.

10
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,375
You mean Keisei's
Shikabane Hime...

11
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,125
I heard word that she's ill.

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,916
Those in the Shuhou
faction, like Takamine,

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,166
are all against
getting rid of her.

14
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,041
Is this your way of saying you
want us to take care of her?

15
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,750
After your evaluation,

16
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,208
if you see no chance
of rehabilitation,

17
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,000
well...

18
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,125
I wouldn't say that
he expresses it exactly,

19
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,208
but you know, he loves you
ladies more than anyone else

20
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,750
on this planet.

21
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,416
Yeah, so much he
wants to kill us.

22
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,250
You can't do this!

23
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,916
Why are you stopping us?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,333
Akasha, you're the one who
wished that we, the Seven Stars,

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,916
establish the Kougon
Sect as our enemy.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,375
Right, and for
that purpose,

27
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,500
we've spent the last 6 months
killing contracted monks.

28
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,625
But why now are you just
going to suddenly attack

29
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,625
the head temple?

30
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,250
Out of our way, tiny man.

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,875
If we don't hurry,
our toys will die.

32
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,375
We're just going so we can
examine that one Shikabane Hime.

33
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,083
Examine her...

34
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,166
You mean Keisei's
Shikabane Hime?

35
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,916
Have you forgotten...?

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
We are the ones who made
the Shikabane Hime

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,750
known as Makina Hoshimura.

38
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,958
I have sensed that her
life is about to end.

39
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,250
And it won't be fun for us if
she dies in her current state.

40
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,958
Are you saying
that Makina is

41
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,666
some kind of special
Shikabane Hime?

42
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,583
That's precisely
what I want to check.

43
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,916
Hokuto...

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,375
Those drops...

45
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,541
You're always producing
that kind of water...

46
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,791
Water...

47
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,875
Hokuto,
don't do that...

48
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,916
Please...

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,125
Oh, look. A bug.

50
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,375
What was that about?!

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,875
To Hokuto, everything about the
world you live in is abnormal...

52
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,000
See, her life was
ended before she ever

53
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,125
had the opportunity
to commit sin.

54
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,583
It's like she
was born to die.

55
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,750
To her, everything from this
world that touches her

56
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,250
is like a serrated blade
reaching to inflict pain.

57
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,458
You mean, she's never even
held hands with anyone?

58
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,125
She has an uncontrollable
power that breaks

59
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,958
the boundaries of the bond
with her contracted monk.

60
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,083
Any Shikabane Hime
possessed by that curse

61
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,916
needs to be purified before
she turns into a Shikabane.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,208
Normally, something like that
shouldn't even take a month.

63
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,041
And seeing as we are
into the sixth month

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,375
of dealing with this,

65
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,250
Gon-Dai-Sojo is talking
about getting rid of her.

66
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,833
If we can avoid
killing her,

67
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
personally,
I would prefer that.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,166
It's not right that
she's been stuck

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,541
in that purification
chamber for 6 months!

70
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,041
But the fact remains the curse
upon the Shikabane Hime

71
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
has yet to be removed.

72
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,583
I'm a doctor,
if you couldn't tell.

73
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,291
I need to examine her.

74
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,500
A Gon-Sojo should not
enter a place like this.

75
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,750
Who are you, pal?

76
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,958
The name I am known
by is Kurai...

77
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,375
I am an Inspector
for this region.

78
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,916
His Grace Gon-Dai-Sojo put
me in charge of this case.

79
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,583
Saki!

80
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,541
What are you doing
with that thing?

81
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,583
I know just what that mark
on your face means,

82
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,750
so you should also know

83
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,291
if you get involved
with Shikabane Hime,

84
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,375
your Enlightenment gets
that much further away.

85
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,750
So... what is
Heaven like?

86
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,333
What do you mean?

87
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,666
It's not that I'm
that interested.

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,375
But the other Shikabane Hime

89
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,875
are all doing what we do in
order to get into Heaven, right?

90
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,166
Yeah, that's what
it seems like.

91
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,958
The paradise or Heaven
we refer to is not a place

92
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,666
but rather when one becomes
unified with everything

93
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,583
by attaining Enlightenment,
thereby arriving at a world

94
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,083
with no grief or worry.

95
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,666
We as monks have
to perform virtuous deeds.

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,583
You, on the other hand...

97
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,833
A Shikabane Hime can't
attain this Enlightenment

98
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,375
until she destroys
108 Shikabane.

99
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,208
That's right...

100
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,833
But if Enlightment
requires us to leave

101
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,166
behind family
and friends,

102
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,708
the people we really care
about, then if you ask me

103
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,416
it would seem to make the
whole ordeal rather sad.

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,250
Wouldn't you agree?

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,083
Yeah...

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,083
Rika...

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,708
Rika, look down there!

108
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,916
I can't believe
the Shiryou gained entrance

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,458
to the head temple!

110
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,041
Shiryou is the form taken by
those who couldn't even attain

111
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,833
the level of regrets that
a Shikabane has, right?

112
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,625
They're eating whatever that
stuff is that's coming out

113
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,750
of Makina's body!

114
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,416
We have to do something
about this, Saki.

115
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,083
This black ink...

116
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,500
I've heard that this stuff is
supposed to weaken our power...

117
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,875
This'll be a tough fight!

118
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,708
The Shiryou are trying
to take on physical form!

119
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,791
Hold on, Saki!

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,000
Kamika...

121
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,708
Those Shiryou are
feasting on the Rune

122
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
that's leaking
from Makina's body.

123
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,750
This is all we can do.

124
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,500
Isn't Rune
in the Shikabane Hime

125
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,833
like the blood that
circulates in our bodies?

126
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,375
But it's giving power to the
Shiryou when they eat it.

127
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,041
Just sounds weird.

128
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,458
Rune is life energy,
which is purity itself.

129
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,500
It's provided to the Shikabane
Hime by a contracted monk.

130
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,208
But no matter how
pure something is--

131
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,291
if it stagnates,
it will begin to rot.

132
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,625
The problem we're dealing with
now is that rotting old Rune

133
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,666
is an invitation for Shiryou.

134
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,000
Meaning that it's
Keisei's Rune...

135
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,750
that's coursing through her.

136
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,875
Makina has strong regrets
regarding what happened

137
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,875
to her contracted monk...

138
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,083
Whether or not she knows it,
she's storing his Rune

139
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,500
and allowing it
to rot inside of her.

140
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,166
But she's got a new
contracted monk now.

141
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,500
If she received Ouri's Rune,
she would be fine.

142
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,458
The boy hasn't received
enough proper training

143
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,916
in these matters yet.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,666
But, more importantly,
it doesn't matter

145
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,291
who the contracted monk is,

146
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,375
if Makina doesn't want
to accept his Rune,

147
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,833
this will end the same.

148
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,125
Then what are
we going to do?

149
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,208
If this continues, her own
Rune will be devoured...

150
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,041
and she will die.

151
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,125
Oh, I see now!

152
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,166
This is serious!

153
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,791
Who goes there?!

154
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,750
Sir?

155
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,541
Don't bother with it.

156
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,875
That's not our enemy.

157
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,833
Umehara...

158
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,500
Oh my goodness!

159
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,083
I dropped my specially-made
master detective coat

160
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,541
and hat back there...

161
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,916
I can't live the life of
a detective like this!

162
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,833
So he still
isn't back yet?

163
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh... no...

164
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,500
It's been six months,
hasn't it?

165
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,541
What's this here?

166
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,125
Wait a minute!

167
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,833
Looks pretty tasty...

168
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,791
You know you could make good
money if you tried selling

169
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,125
a few of these to Ushijima.

170
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,625
Just kidding...

171
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,583
But you know, I didn't
have the slightest clue

172
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,833
that you were
so serious about Ouri.

173
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,166
Well, I just know
him a little.

174
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,250
We've talked
here and there.

175
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
That's all...

176
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,791
I mean, the
only thing I know

177
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,250
is that he took
a trip out of the town

178
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,541
shortly after his
brother passed away.

179
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,500
Seriously,
what an idiot.

180
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,958
The dreams he could be
realizing with Ms. Boobs McGoo

181
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,416
if he was just here now.

182
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,666
What dreams...?

183
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,291
And who on earth
is this Boobs McGoo?

184
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,208
You mean
you don't know...?

185
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,416
Ouri may look like
this innocent teenage boy,

186
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,750
but all he wants to do is
fondle girl's big ol' breasts!

187
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,916
Nooooo!

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,583
You don't have to hate
me as much as you do.

189
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,750
Would you just
get over here?

190
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
How's it been going?

191
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,625
Oh boy...
what a sad face.

192
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,875
I haven't had any luck...

193
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,125
Master Umehara says
that if I track the rabbit

194
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,375
by using the bond
tied between it and me,

195
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,208
then catching him
will come to me easily,

196
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,208
but I don't know...

197
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,208
Master may appear
the way he appears,

198
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,083
but don't let
that deceive you.

199
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,250
His warrior skills are tops
among all monks of our sect.

200
00:11:55,333 --> 00:12:00,166
Tell me, Takamasa, in what
way do I appear exactly?

201
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,791
Why don't you take a
look at yourself, Master?

202
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,500
I found these on the ground.

203
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,416
Someone must've dropped 'em.
Pervy perverts!

204
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,333
Bet they're wandering
around here somewhere...

205
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,666
This is Mt. Goryo.

206
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,583
Even monkeys
don't come here.

207
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,208
He's such
a hopeless adult.

208
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,500
Reminds me of someone
I used to know.

209
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,541
Now... Try this again.

210
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,583
Tell me, what is a bond?

211
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,250
A connection that ties
one person to another...

212
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,791
I was thinking maybe
it's something like fate?

213
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,083
Sure, fate is a good
way of labeling it--

214
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,666
a connection divined
by the stars in the Heavens...

215
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,583
But the word 'bond' should
give you the feeling

216
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,083
of something more tangible...

217
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,958
Your hands.

218
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,416
Now a bond has been formed
between you and the rabbit.

219
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,791
All you have to do now is find
the light the bond shows...

220
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,333
Go ahead.

221
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,041
I'd like to find it, but
I don't see anything.

222
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,958
Just go.

223
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,416
Okay.

224
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,333
I wonder if it's
difficult for him...

225
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,666
he's been at this
6 months now.

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,958
Light is not the easiest thing
in the world to seek out

227
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,541
if you don't know
what you're doing.

228
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,541
That boy has been
so blessed in his life

229
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,041
that he's never had to seek
out the light on his own.

230
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,875
That's all this is.

231
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,833
Nooo!

232
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, not again.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,541
I'm so sorry!

234
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,083
And here I was thinking
that young Japanese boys

235
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,083
are all shut-ins and only
interested in the 2-D universe,

236
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,250
but you're actually a fairly
aggressive pervert, huh?

237
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,583
I'm not!

238
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,125
Too bad for you, perv!

239
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,791
'Cause the only thing I'm
interested in is 2-D stuff, too.

240
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,833
I mean, check out all the
killer books I picked up today!

241
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,833
I had my suspicions that
the city bookstores

242
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,708
would have all the coolest
stuff and I was right!

243
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,333
Coolest stuff!

244
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,458
Yeah...!
Isn't it exciting?

245
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,291
There's the
moe-moe dojinshi,

246
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,875
"Zenbunose Puchitto" Summer
Festival limited editions!

247
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,583
You don't have to explain it
to me, Ms. Half Naked Chick!

248
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,666
I'm not half-naked,
and my name is Flesh,

249
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
if you don't mind, Mr. Plum!

250
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,666
You don't like "half-naked?"
Fine, then your name is Mud!

251
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,041
You got that? Mud!

252
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,833
I gave you money to buy
the Zenbunose figure,

253
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,458
Kinky version,
limited edition!

254
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,708
And you show back up here
with these filthy things!

255
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,333
Look, commercialism just simply
ruins any official products.

256
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,708
The real fans out there only
love the dojinshi magazines.

257
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,666
There's no redeeming
qualities to any of that smut!

258
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,916
I'll have
to confiscate them!

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
No!

260
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,125
They're my special friends for
tonight, thank you very much!

261
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,083
Special friends...

262
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,750
Seriously, I never should've
even considered contracting

263
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,750
with someone who died
in a plane accident

264
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:14,458
while she was on her
way to Akihabara...

265
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,541
If you keep acting mean to
me, then I'm gonna tell Touma.

266
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,333
Touma?!
Wait, please!

267
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,041
Not that!
Anything but that...!

268
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,500
Please?

269
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh, Touma.

270
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,375
She's Master Umehara's
Shikabane Hime...

271
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,625
She's just taking
herself a little break.

272
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,375
Is she a scary person?

273
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,166
"Scary" might not
be the right word...

274
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,875
Then again...

275
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,416
I didn't know
a monk could contract

276
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,916
with two Shikabane Hime.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,958
Contracting with two means
he has to give out twice

278
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,166
as much Rune.

279
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,583
Normally, a monk's
body can't handle that.

280
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,125
But Master can do it.

281
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,250
Which just indicates how
much training he puts himself

282
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,875
through regularly.

283
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,208
Probably a good thing
that I only have Makina,

284
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,750
considering how forcibly my
Rune was absorbed from me.

285
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,166
That's because of the curse.

286
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,208
Have you heard any word
on how she's doing?

287
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,416
If something happens to her,
if her condition changes,

288
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,708
then you should feel it.

289
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,250
You're her contracted monk.

290
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,916
Are you sure?

291
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,583
I can't even see the
bond with a dumb rabbit.

292
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,708
I knew Ouri had some kind
of feelings for her...

293
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,166
Noooo!

294
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,458
Sorry, Master, but Itsuki is
my Shikabane Hime, not yours.

295
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,708
And I'm gonna tell Touma.

296
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,541
I came here to tell you
guys something important.

297
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,166
Give me a break.

298
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,416
Sounds like another
load of crap to me.

299
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,875
Actually, it's true.

300
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,750
It's about Makina.

301
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,500
What...? You've
got news on her?

302
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,916
Yeah, but your going there might
not make much of a difference.

303
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,583
That said, would you
like to go see her?

304
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,750
Intruder!

305
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,208
Get him!

306
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,500
Traitor monk!

307
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,708
I'll see you
again someday.

308
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,916
Perhaps in the
land of the dead.

309
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,791
Don't move!

310
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
What do you think
you're doing,

311
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,000
bringing in that
defiled thing?!

312
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,500
You've got something here
that's defiled, too,

313
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,291
don't you, Sadahiro?

314
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,666
Shikabane can't normally
enter the head temple,

315
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,291
but by using your zadan, you
can certainly lead them here...

316
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,625
I guess it's true that you've
decided to join hands

317
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,791
with the Seven Stars.

318
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,166
Sadahiro,
you talk too much!

319
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,625
I guess you
know everything.

320
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,208
Why do it?!

321
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,250
"Why"?

322
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,750
Hazama...

323
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,125
of the Seven...

324
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,833
He's the one who killed
your Shikabane Hime!

325
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,208
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but Hazama didn't kill her...

326
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,708
I did it.

327
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,166
You what?

328
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,791
Get your damn
hands off of me!

329
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,750
Shikabane Hime...

330
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,958
They're defiled...!
Unforgivable--

331
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,708
You bastard!

332
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,791
He's after Makina!

333
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,625
To think he became
a Shikabane...

334
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,458
It would seem the Kougon
Sect's monks are lacking

335
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,583
Enlightenment...

336
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,166
Time to invite the Seven
Stars to the party...

337
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,833
Hope they're ready.

338
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,166
'Kay... It's here.

339
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,458
From monk
to Shikabane...

340
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,416
Shikabane Hime...

341
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,708
You defiled
Shikabane Hime!

342
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,333
That's it...

343
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,833
That's the regret
you carried away...

344
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,166
Leave her alone,
you bastard!

345
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,875
Makina!

346
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,583
Ouri...

347
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,083
He's a Kougon Sect monk!

348
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,583
Why would a monk bust
in here to attack you?

349
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,541
Because she is defiled.

350
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,625
But the Kougon Sect are
the ones who created her

351
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,708
and everyone like her!

352
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,291
They were made
to fight the Shikabane

353
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,166
and save people's lives!

354
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,500
They are defiled!

355
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,083
And if we stay
in contact with them,

356
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,041
we will become
defiled, as well!

357
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,208
And then I will never
attain Enlightenment!

358
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,333
But I won't
let that happen...

359
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
I will not
become defiled!

360
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,625
Trying to kill Makina because
you don't wanna become defiled.

361
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,041
What's wrong with you?

362
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,291
You're the filthy
one and you know it!

363
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,500
Listen, Makina...

364
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,750
They said...

365
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,833
They said that you
refuse to let Brother go.

366
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,916
Forget it!

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,250
For now, just right now,
take my Rune--

368
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,416
do whatever
you have to do!

369
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,791
If you don't,
you'll die!

370
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,500
But, Ouri,
I'm already dead!

371
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,500
Don't come near me!

372
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,833
The Shiryou
will attack you

373
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,333
if you don't stop
right where you are!

374
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,791
This is it...

375
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,916
I finally
see the light.

376
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,333
Ever since he died, the
two of us have been lost...

377
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,750
No one could forget someone
who was precious to them.

378
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,083
And when you don't,
it turns into regrets.

379
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,000
If remembering is the thing
that makes me defiled,

380
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,083
then I guess
that's what I am...

381
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,875
'Cause we're the same.

382
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,833
Makina,
are you all right?

383
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,083
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,958
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect Keisei.

385
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,083
I've been waiting
all this time...

386
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,125
Just to say that.

387
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:58,166
[Music]

388
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,875
Your arms and legs
were torn off

389
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,833
and still you
couldn't die.

390
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,958
On that day,
you cried

391
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,791
and begged for forgiveness
in a sea of blood.

392
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,833
Welcome, "my enemy."

393
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,541
Now, let us
kill each other.
