[Music]

2
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,500
Please bless this food.

3
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,875
What are you saying?

4
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,750
You don't really think
I'd give you bad food?

5
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,333
Both the miso
and seaweed were...

6
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,791
Is that Ouri?
I wanna talk!

7
00:01:58,875 --> 00:01:59,958
<i>But the taste</i>
<i>just isn't right...!</i>

8
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,666
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it should be this salty.</i>

9
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,166
Salty...?

10
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,291
Um... Ouri...

11
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,750
You rinsed off
the seaweed, didn't you?

12
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,625
Rinsed off?

13
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,125
But...
I thought...

14
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,166
Isn't this the same stuff
Brother used to use?

15
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,125
Yes, and Keisei always rinsed
the excess salt off first.

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,958
He actually paid attention
to things like that?

17
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,041
Well, not originally,
I'll admit,

18
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:27,375
but once you came here to stay,
he most certainly did.

19
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:31,208
You know, you really haven't
come by to visit for a while...

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,833
Hey,Hanagami...!

21
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,000
Who are you trying to kid,
you can't cook!

22
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,875
Says you!

23
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,875
Did you and Keisei
have a fight?

24
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,750
I don't want you to fight,
it's not nice!

25
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,666
I, uh... I know,
you're right...

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,041
Senior Tagami, please!

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,791
You can't just
walk out...

28
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,708
They- They haven't
finished your tests.

29
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,458
Please get back in bed!

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,375
That old man stuck me in here
without even bothering to listen

31
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,708
to my side
of the story!

32
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,625
Would you please...
cut it out!

33
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,791
Eh? What's that...?
"Saki,...

34
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,250
Will you do
that again?"...

35
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,250
Got it!

36
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,666
No, Saki,
I said no such thing!

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
What is all
this fuss about?

38
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,125
Shikabane Hime Minai...

39
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,708
An Inspector went through
the appropriate channels

40
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,583
in dealing with Minai.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
My little brother must
have seen what happened.

42
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,000
No harm was done
to your brother.

43
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,041
Your idea of harm might
differ from mine...

44
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,583
None of this is making
any sense to me...

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,041
How could an
inspector have...

46
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,750
Makina and the others
didn't have enough time

47
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
to locate her...

48
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,416
Who could have gotten
to Minai so quickly?

49
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,500
I see you don't have
an answer for me then...

50
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,291
Well, perhaps I'll
find someone who does.

51
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,833
How could he get
so worked up

52
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,125
about his stupid
brother like that?

53
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,833
I'm so jealous!

54
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,000
Hey... She
did it, not me...

55
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,333
I wouldn't have said
something like that!

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,958
Please, Guardian!

57
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not allowed!

58
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,083
You must go back!

59
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,541
Please!

60
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,958
Guardian Tagami...

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,458
You are interrupting
His Grace, Gon-Dai-Sojo.

62
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm aware of that.

63
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,750
I beg your pardon,
Your Grace...

64
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,291
But there was a
Shikabane Hime

65
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,916
who was killed by
an inspector the other day...

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,625
It is not permitted,
Guardian...

67
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,333
To speak of defiled
ones before His Grace.

68
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,625
Defiled,
you call them...?

69
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,041
I think
I must disagree...

70
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,083
I am aware that you
of the Shujou faction

71
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,583
tend to think
of them that way...

72
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,291
However...

73
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,958
for the Kougon Sect they
are absolutely essential...

74
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,041
the very instrument
of our philosophy!

75
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,708
Guardian Tagami!

76
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,875
Gon-Dai-Sojo...
Minai was-...

77
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,041
You should probably
stop right there...

78
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,958
Sho-Sojo Tagami.

79
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,416
I cannot oppose
a Shikabane Hime.

80
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,708
It's...
The D ai-Sojo...

81
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,875
He is here.

82
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,625
The Kougon Sect's number one and
number two are here together.

83
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,208
Dai-Sojo was meditating
close by here...

84
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,000
You have disturbed him!

85
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,416
Sho-Sojo Tagami...
Your work...

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,000
as a Guardian...
is appreciated.

87
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,250
Know that Sho-Sojo Isaki...

88
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,750
And his Shikabane Hime
will never be forgotten...

89
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,250
Tell me this...

90
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,666
Wasn't it your
younger brother

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,166
who led Minai right into
the hands of the Inspector?

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,333
Yes, it is true,
Your Grace.

93
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,416
Peace be with you.

94
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,541
Ahhhhhh!

95
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,833
You're looking a lot
less pale than before...

96
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:12,833
Ouri.

97
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,416
Is that right?

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,125
Did something
good happen?

99
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,416
No, something totally
AWESOME happened...

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,083
Isn't that right,
Ouri!

101
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,666
I don't know
what you mean.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,083
Ouri!

103
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,833
Breast Goddess!

104
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,166
Nozomi...

105
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,500
I really need
to ask you something...

106
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,625
Got a minute?

107
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,500
Sure.

108
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,916
What's going on...?

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,541
Are you and Ouri
dating or something?

110
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,541
No, we're not.

111
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,500
I thought everyone knew that
Ouri was in love with Makina.

112
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,375
What...?
No, I...

113
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,125
With Makina?

114
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,458
Really? First time
we've heard about that.

115
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,333
I can't stand it,
I can't stand it!!

116
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,291
How are
you doing this?!

117
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,208
You must be releasing special
pheromones or something

118
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,750
to attract
all these women!

119
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,833
That's it,
isn't it?

120
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,041
Some secret cologne?

121
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,041
Where'd you get it?!

122
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,208
Mail order?
Internet?

123
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,708
Free sample in the back
of some magazine?

124
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,666
Ouri!
Come back here!

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,750
I have to know!!

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,875
Here it is.
Look at this.

127
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,333
I hear that this is really
becoming a popular religion

128
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,458
with a lot of celebrities
and rich people.

129
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,833
Ahhh... You know magazines...
they'll print anything.

130
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,500
You should really
read this article.

131
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,583
I think
you'd like it.

132
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,750
"Devout followers witness
this extraordinary ritual,

133
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,625
in which a young monk
walks deliberately

134
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,375
into the center
of a raging inferno."

135
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,916
"Flames completely
engulf the monk's body...

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,708
Though it seems impossible
for him to survive...

137
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,916
In a matter of minutes
his burns disappear...

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,291
And he stands
alive and unhurt."

139
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,541
"Founder Ooyatsuka
calls this...

140
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,583
'the Power
of Immortality."

141
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,791
Dying, and then
coming back to life...

142
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,250
Doesn't that
sound like Makina?

143
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,666
Shikabane...

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,708
What?

145
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,791
Uh... nothing...

146
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,750
Why are you
showing me this?

147
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,333
If I could join
this religion...

148
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,958
They might have a way
to make me just like Makina...

149
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,458
Right?

150
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,500
Hey, Ouri...
Wanna join them with me?

151
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
Join them...?

152
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,041
You're not
serious, are you?

153
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,333
Somehow I thought you
might understand... Guess not.

154
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,333
Why don't you
forget about her...?

155
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,916
Let it go and move on.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,666
I know I should...

157
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,166
But I...
I can't do it.

158
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,791
No one seems to want
to talk about this stuff...

159
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,375
That life doesn't last,
we could all die tomorrow.

160
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,333
When I think about all
of these strange things...

161
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,583
I can't seem to stop myself
from wondering about Makina.

162
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,083
I wouldn't worry...
If you ask me...

163
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,875
I think you're way
too beautiful to die, Nozomi!

164
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,583
Damn you, Ouri!

165
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,208
He's having a good time
with Breast Goddess...!

166
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm so jealous!

167
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't stop thinking
about that article...

168
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,250
What if Ooyatsuka's religion
really did find a way

169
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,291
to save Shikabane...?

170
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,791
Maybe it's something
that the Kougon Sect

171
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,916
just doesn't know about...

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,416
It could save Makina
and all the others.

173
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,916
Um, Mr. Sougi?

174
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,875
I'm sorry I caused
problems for you, Genpaku.

175
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,208
I must admit I did
enjoy school life.

176
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,291
You've been released from your
temporary Guardian assignment.

177
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,583
Where will you go?

178
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,250
I'm thinking about
going to Mount Goryo.

179
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,875
Goryo?

180
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,166
Up in the Kougon
mountains?

181
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,958
Monks have trained there
for hundreds of years...

182
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,791
And now I would like
to retrain myself...

183
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,125
I need to work on perfecting
my own zadan technique.

184
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,791
I guess great minds
really do think alike.

185
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,083
Aren't those
zadan scrolls?

186
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,250
I stole them from old
man Takamine's office...

187
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,958
But being that I've never
been seriously trained

188
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,000
in the zadan technique...

189
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,208
It'll just be a quick fix.

190
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,458
Then... You think the
traitor monk will show up again?

191
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,625
I think this mass
outbreak of Shikabane

192
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,791
is only the beginning...
Don't you?

193
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,041
Don't you want to see
Ouri before you leave?

194
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,166
No... I'm going to the
cafe where he works.

195
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,583
A cafe?

196
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,833
Ouri told Makina that he
tried to hide Minai someplace.

197
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,208
I don't think
he could have known

198
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,833
that many other places
besides the Café Parthenon.

199
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,541
Some place the Inspector
was able to reach

200
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,250
before anyone else...

201
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,916
The Inspector had probably been
watching Ouri for some time.

202
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,208
Where is she?!

203
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,166
There's supposed
to be a daughter.

204
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,375
Where did she go?!

205
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,541
We can't find her!

206
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,041
We found her!

207
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,083
Please...!

208
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,791
Beautiful Life...

209
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,291
Eternal Life...

210
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,250
It radiates
like this fire...

211
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,666
And yet it can
never be consumed.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,083
Isn't it beautiful...?
Not scary at all.

213
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,958
There, you see?

214
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,041
A beautiful life is
the true miracle...

215
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,000
Even more precious
than gold.

216
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,625
Gold!

217
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,916
The Founder's sweat
turned into gold!

218
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,250
Isn't it wonderful...?

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,916
You'll live for eternity...
and be rich forever.

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,041
If you were to
become a member...

221
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,083
One day soon you would feel
that same kind of power!

222
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,666
You do want to join,
don't you?

223
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,541
Ahhh... could I meet
the Founder before I decide?

224
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,791
Oh, the Founder rarely
appears in person,

225
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,541
but if you join,
of course...

226
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, yes! If you
become a member...

227
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,750
Uh... I'll have
to think about it.

228
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,083
Interesting little
religion you've got here...

229
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,375
Seems familiar somehow...

230
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,625
Shikabane...
You can burn them...

231
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,333
beat them to death...
and they come right back.

232
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,875
That's pretty handy for
an immortality cult...

233
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,208
Pretty lucrative as well.

234
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,333
Poor little puppet.

235
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,458
The show is over.

236
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,541
Fire...!
Flame high!!

237
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,375
Trees!
Trees take them!!

238
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,708
It's a curse,
isn't it?

239
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,916
Fools...! You thought
I was a mere human...?

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,041
I am a Shikabane...!
And I have a curse

241
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,958
that causes anything
I say to come true instantly!

242
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,833
It was the perfect
choice for me,

243
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,625
since I never
said anything true

244
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,916
while I was still
among the living.

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,125
Your obsession is
with words, huh...?

246
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,750
Fascinating.

247
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,416
I see...

248
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,083
Your curse must be how you've
been controlling this Shikabane.

249
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,750
I am well aware of
who you people are...

250
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,958
You're with the
Kougon Sect...

251
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,333
Don't you realize

252
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,500
that Shikabane are the
earthly equivalent of gods,

253
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,291
humans don't
even come close!

254
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,458
[Laughter]

255
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,958
What's so amusing?

256
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,125
He thinks we're
the Kougon Sect!

257
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,833
I can't say for certain that
the Shikabane are gods...

258
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,291
but I do know
they're made for killing,

259
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,416
for following the obsessions
they had when they were alive.

260
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,333
I also know that pretending to
be human in order to make money

261
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,833
is the ultimate folly.

262
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
Not to mention
that you would take

263
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,125
another Shikabane's
freedom away from them.

264
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,750
Who are you?

265
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,916
It just... Wasn't what
I thought it would be...

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,750
So vulgar somehow...

267
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,666
Do you think there are
any Shikabane here?

268
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,083
Now die!

269
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,916
By the power of my curse
I'm commanding you!

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,833
Be dead!!

271
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,791
Such a pity...
Since we're already dead...

272
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,875
that command is
rather useless!

273
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,875
All of you are...
Shikabane?

274
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,333
Well that
was overkill...

275
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,208
It was necessary.

276
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,708
If we're going to make our name
known and feared once again,

277
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,666
people must know
that Shikabane

278
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,666
are more than just regrets
and obsessions ...

279
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,375
that indeed,
we are Death itself.

280
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,375
Hello?
Anyone there...?

281
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,083
I'm a relative
of Ouri Kagami.

282
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,333
He works
at this cafe.

283
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,958
Sorry, pal...
We're not open.

284
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,833
Your voice...
I believe I recognize it...

285
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:34,583
I was under the impression that
you'd gone missing overseas.

286
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,583
I said we're closed.

287
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,750
It is you, isn't it...?

288
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,458
Please listen to me...

289
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,208
When I became a Contracted
Monk, I swore two sacred oaths.

290
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,583
One was to dedicate my life
to fighting evil

291
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,125
at the side of a
Shikabane Hime...

292
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,958
And the other...

293
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,500
Was to keep my brother
Ouri far, far away

294
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,875
from the work I had
chosen for myself...

295
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,541
I know now that they
contradict one another.

296
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,750
Even so... Maybe?

297
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,541
I'll keep it in mind.

298
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,875
Thank you.

299
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,583
Wasn't that...
Keisei Tagami?

300
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,625
Start packing up.

301
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,083
What?

302
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,708
Contracted monks aren't
supposed to know about us.

303
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,250
Remember? It's time
for us to go.

304
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Awww! Just when things were
getting pretty interesting.

305
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,541
High time if you ask me.

306
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,375
We still have to find
that traitor monk.

307
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,125
Oh... What should we
do about our employee?

308
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,583
We have no choice...

309
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,750
The kid just worked without
pay this week, that's all.

310
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,541
Cheapskate.

311
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,000
What a pleasant surprise.

312
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,666
To think that you would
appear before us...

313
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,583
Better yet...

314
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,708
That you would
appear before me.

315
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,041
So tell us...

316
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,583
What do we get in return
if we sign on with you, monk?

317
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,208
You're Shikabane...

318
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:25,041
Acting on your desires is all
that you know how to do...

319
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,750
However... There are those that
would deny their true nature.

320
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,375
You mean Shikabane Hime,
don't you?

321
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,083
Precisely...

322
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,958
I desire to erase every last
one of them from this world!

323
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,166
Well... I think we might be
able to come to an arrangement

324
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,458
as long as we can agree
to annihilate the Kougon Sect...

325
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,166
We'll join you.

326
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,458
This here is Hokuto...

327
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,291
The brightest sun
of the Seven Stars.

328
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,208
I thought you were the leader
of the Seven Stars, Hazama.

329
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,833
The Seven Stars only exist
to allow her light to shine...

330
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,416
Hokuto is Shikabane itself,

331
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,708
and the very embodiment
of the world's nature.

332
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,750
Hokuto...

333
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,583
So you went
to work today and...

334
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,375
It was freakin' closed...!

335
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,500
They just closed the place

336
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,208
without saying a
freakin' word to me...!

337
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,916
And I was supposed to get
freakin' paid today!

338
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,333
How unfair...!

339
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,166
Here, you need
some more.

340
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,375
[Phone ringing]

341
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,583
Oh... Yes, the Order
of Eternal Life Research.

342
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,500
We knew that Founder
Ooyatsuka was a Shikabane...

343
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,708
but under pressure from
a certain political party,

344
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,583
we'd done nothing so far
but keep an eye on them...

345
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,375
but now...

346
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,791
Who did it?

347
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,083
It was seven Shikabane.

348
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,791
The security cameras
captured them perfectly.

349
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,875
Seven Shikabane...

350
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,083
Are you saying...

351
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,208
it was the Seven Stars?

352
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,333
I call her arms!

353
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,833
Legs!

354
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,416
Please! Why are
you doing this?

355
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,833
I haven't done
anything to you!

356
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,250
Please don't hurt me!

357
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,458
Please don't hurt me!!

358
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,833
How ungraceful...
daughter of Hoshimura...!

359
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,041
What a poor little
pathetic human...!

360
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm afraid this is
the end of the line!

361
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,916
Seven Stars...

362
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,541
[Music]

363
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,750
Happy Birthday, Ouri...

364
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,333
I have a wonderful
birthday present for you...

365
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,500
It's a story...

366
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,208
But it's also
a very sad story...

367
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,541
a story all about
what happened...

368
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,000
"One Night."
