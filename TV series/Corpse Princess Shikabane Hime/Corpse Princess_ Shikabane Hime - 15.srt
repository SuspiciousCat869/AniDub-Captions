1
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:15,916
[Music]

2
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,375
'Kay, it's here.

3
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Makina,
are you alright?

4
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,708
I'm sorry.

5
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,041
I'm sorry.

6
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:24,041
What?

7
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:27,500
I'm sorry for not being
able to protect Keisei.

8
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,625
Ever since that night,

9
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,625
I've wanted
to say that to you.

10
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:39,375
I am...
So sorry.

11
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,625
Please don't cry...
It wasn't your fault.

12
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:44,041
There's no need
to apologize.

13
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:48,666
Here. Dry your eyes...

14
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,666
Crying doesn't really
seem to suit you.

15
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,833
I'm not a fragile
little girl.

16
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,166
What are you doing here?
And what's with your clothes?

17
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,625
What the hell
were you thinking...?

18
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,000
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

19
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,083
What do you mean...?

20
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,791
Takamasa was
helping me train

21
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,666
so I could get better
at this whole monk thing.

22
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,333
When I got word that
you might be in trouble,

23
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:12,791
I left as soon as
possible... to save you.

24
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,208
Keisei did everything he could
to keep you out of harm's way!

25
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,500
But here you are...

26
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:24,833
Sticking your nose where
it doesn't belong again!

27
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:26,541
I don't understand...

28
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,125
You and I are supposed
to work together!

29
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,250
We didn't have much of a choice
when we made this arrangement.

30
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

31
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:37,500
Keisei will always be
my contracted monk.

32
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,250
If you don't
let me help you...

33
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,958
You'll die.

34
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,333
I died a long time ago.

35
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:52,250
Tell me... Why did you
become a contracted monk?

36
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,541
What?

37
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,208
What's your reason
for fighting?

38
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,875
My reason...?

39
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,375
You know why...

40
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,375
It's because my
brother asked me to...

41
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,041
He asked you to?

42
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,625
You would put your
life on the line

43
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,583
just because someone
asked you to?

44
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:09,375
No... You're taking
it the wrong way...

45
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,000
I...

46
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:14,041
I did it for you, too.

47
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,541
Hey! What are
you doing here?!

48
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:21,791
How'd you
get in here...?

49
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:22,958
This isn't
the kind of place

50
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:25,416
where you can come
and go as you please.

51
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,583
Kurai...?
What happened to you?

52
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,708
You two... What did you
do to Kurai?

53
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,000
Let me explain...

54
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,416
We had to stop him...

55
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,500
Don't you move!

56
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:55,833
How on earth did he enter the
purification chamber so easily?

57
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:57,541
He's a Shikabane...

58
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:00,750
He is the brother
of the late Gon Sojo Tagami.

59
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:07,083
I am Honda, an Inspector.

60
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,583
What the hell
is he doing?

61
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:18,291
Open, my zadan technique...!

62
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,166
On-Jiri-Chei-Sowaka...

63
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,833
That crazy bastard!

64
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,666
He's summoning
more Shikabane!

65
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,541
Sadahiro!

66
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,666
What...?!

67
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,916
Lotus Flower!

68
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,625
So this is the backyard of
the Kougon Sect's head temple.

69
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,958
The air appears to
be tense somehow.

70
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,458
Yes, I sense it, too...

71
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:24,375
A purifier used
to exorcise defilement.

72
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,000
We mustn't stay here
for too long,

73
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,791
we're incapable
of fighting it off.

74
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,708
What do you mean, Isaka?

75
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,166
He means that we'll
be unable to move...

76
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,000
Pretty boy...

77
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,125
Isaka is correct...

78
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,041
Every one of you is at risk.

79
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,416
Nothing like this has
ever been attempted.

80
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,666
Maybe we're
being reckless.

81
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,833
Well, we'll just
have to leave

82
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:51,750
before things become
too dangerous for us.

83
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:59,208
I can see the mirror...
It's broken...

84
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,916
I want the mirror.

85
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,250
It seems that Hokuto
has already found her.

86
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:13,125
Zadan technique.

87
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,125
Get out of here!

88
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,125
Isaka!

89
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,125
Eyes of Asura!

90
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,458
They disappeared...?

91
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,333
We had'em!

92
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,583
They escaped
into a trench!

93
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:47,250
Stop it...! What are
you doing to her?

94
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:49,958
Purifying the defilement
of this Shikabane

95
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,041
is no longer an option.

96
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,750
That's not true!

97
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,750
Murdering one of our own
is simply... Unforgivable.

98
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:57,916
We have no choice
but to kill her.

99
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,458
He wasn't one of yours!
He was a Shikabane!

100
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,208
Monks within
the Kougon Sect

101
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,375
abandon petty regrets
and obsessions...

102
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,208
They become enlightened!

103
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,708
They never become Shikabane!

104
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,916
You're really gonna pretend like
this has never happened before?

105
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,875
Stay right there.

106
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:26,583
What is the meaning of this?

107
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,583
Please allow my fellow
disciple to come with us...

108
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:31,583
His Shikabane Hime as well.
The two of them are innocent.

109
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:35,000
Your fellow disciple?

110
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:37,625
Ouri Kagami has been
training with my master...

111
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:40,416
Over the past several
months if you must know.

112
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,250
His Grace Sojo Umehara?

113
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:44,666
I'm sure you're aware...

114
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,333
That the contract
between the two of them

115
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,000
is only a temporary one.

116
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:51,333
Temporary or not, Ouri does
have a contract with her.

117
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:52,583
What?

118
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:56,041
By the way, Makina...
Congratultions...

119
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:59,708
You just love to hear the sound
of your own voice, don't you?

120
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,375
Here...! Catch!

121
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:08,208
Unbelievable!

122
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:10,083
I'm shaking in my boots.

123
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:12,333
You know it wouldn't kill
you to say thanks, Makina.

124
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:14,291
I found her.

125
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,791
What is this?

126
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,250
Looks like a trench...

127
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:41,208
A space created
by a Shikabane.

128
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,833
Is there a way in?

129
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,958
This is the work of
a powerful Shikabane.

130
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:49,125
Whoever's responsible knew how
to infiltrate this sacred place.

131
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,125
Where are we?

132
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,875
What do we do now?

133
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,291
Don't panic!

134
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,500
Well, well.

135
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
I wasn't expecting
so many guests

136
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:58,875
for such a
small gathering...

137
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,416
But that's okay.

138
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,583
Akasha...
The traitor monk.

139
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,708
Before we get started, allow
me to introduce our hosts

140
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,166
for the evening.

141
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,416
These people are indeed
enemies of your pathetic world

142
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,000
and all who
dwell within it.

143
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,750
They are the Seven Stars!

144
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,416
It's been a long time...

145
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,916
Daughter of Hoshimura.

146
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,541
I wonder if you remember.

147
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,125
You begged and
pleaded in puddles

148
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,791
of your own blood that day,

149
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,625
wriggling on the
floor with what was left

150
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,666
of your arms and legs,
asking to be forgiven.

151
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,958
She doesn't remember.

152
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,583
Her fear has
made her forget.

153
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,875
Makina!

154
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:12,541
Where do you
think you're going...?

155
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:15,708
Just sit back
and enjoy the show.

156
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,416
What's the matter,
daughter of Hoshimura?

157
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,333
I thought you were
going to destroy us?

158
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:26,458
Every one of you...

159
01:11:26,541 --> 01:11:29,000
Played a part in killing me.

160
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,041
And my family...
They're dead...

161
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,833
I'm dead.

162
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:35,458
Destroying every last
one of you is my goal...

163
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,333
And I will
accomplish it...!

164
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,041
I'll kill all of you!

165
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:40,791
Destroying the Seven Stars...?

166
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,375
This is your obsession?

167
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:48,250
You're so ridiculous.

168
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,625
There's no way
you can destroy us

169
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,416
with such a meager
and petty obsession.

170
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,291
Why can't she defeat you?

171
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,750
Say what you want...

172
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,416
But you came back to this
world because of your regrets!

173
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,833
You're just Shikabane!

174
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:01,666
That's where you're
wrong, my boy.

175
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,583
Our actions aren't
based on regrets.

176
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:08,333
Those in the Seven
Stars act this way...

177
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:11,583
Because it is our nature.

178
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:18,125
What...? The Seven Stars are
near the purification chamber?

179
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,208
Our sources have
confirmed it, yes.

180
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:22,958
Sojo Takamine...

181
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:27,208
I hope you understand why we
cannot permit you to leave.

182
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,500
The purification chamber
is a short distance

183
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,333
from the head temple.

184
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:34,708
It is our responsibility
to protect Dai-Sojo.

185
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:38,125
May I remind you that Makina
Hoshimura is in the chamber...

186
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,583
As are many
of our soldiers.

187
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:43,583
We can't simply
abandon them!

188
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:53,291
Flesh, what
are you doing...?

189
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:54,583
Explain yourself!

190
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,750
I'm so sorry!

191
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,708
I am! Umehara
threatened me!

192
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:58,916
He told me that if
I didn't help him

193
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,458
that he'd make me eat
a whole tree frog!

194
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:03,333
She's a liar! Don't listen
to a single word she says!

195
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:05,083
I'm not lying...!

196
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,291
Why are you throwing
me under the bus...?

197
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,500
You're the liar!

198
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:10,875
What can I say...?
I'm a man, Flesh.

199
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:11,958
That's just
how we're built.

200
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:14,250
Can't fight mother nature.

201
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,791
Umehara...

202
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:18,166
You are supposed to be on
assignment in the mountains.

203
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,583
I was... But it would seem
I'm needed elsewhere.

204
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:23,458
So... Should the two
of us pack our things

205
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,000
and head back
to camp...?

206
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,583
Or go greet
the Seven Stars?

207
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:27,875
Umehara!

208
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,375
There's something I'm
gonna need to borrow.

209
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,541
I promise I'll get it back
to you as soon as I can.

210
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,958
I need the tool
for exorcisms.

211
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,750
You can't...! Its too
important to our history,

212
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:39,750
his Grace Dai Sojo even
sealed it himself.

213
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,166
Now, now. No need
to get snippy.

214
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,125
Besides, I'm the only
one who can handle it.

215
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:45,750
It'll be fine.

216
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,833
Nature is a scream from
inside the heart...

217
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,708
It yearns to be set free.

218
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,875
It's a person's
true spirit.

219
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,416
True spirit?

220
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,958
Regrets are nothing more
than the subtle obsessions

221
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:03,000
that occur right before someone
exhales their last breath.

222
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,791
Nature is a feeling that has
been growing and festering

223
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:09,416
inside a person's soul from the
moment they entered this world.

224
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,708
This isn't something
they can just control...

225
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:14,458
It's a part of
who they are.

226
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,500
Every human suppresses it.

227
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:20,208
They live in denial
of their true nature.

228
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:24,083
But we, the Seven Stars,
released that nature.

229
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:27,625
We live according to it.

230
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,500
By accepting what lies
within our hearts

231
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:32,291
and not denying
who we are...

232
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:35,083
we're the true humans.

233
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,375
Witnessing this hollow
attempt at vengeance,

234
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,458
pitifully based on regret...

235
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:45,583
Makes me think we
were wrong about her.

236
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,125
I'm not gonna let
you kill Makina!

237
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:02,041
That poor little girl has been
dead for quite some time...

238
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,208
She's nothing more
than a Shikabane.

239
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,708
Even so, I will
protect her.

240
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,041
Do you have feelings
for that Shikabane...?

241
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:13,458
She's nothing more than a
carcass with guilt, right?

242
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:16,500
You're so quick to fight for
her, even in an unfair battle.

243
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:19,375
But there isn't
a reason for it.

244
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:23,458
I find this all incredibly
fascinating, young man.

245
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,750
Perhaps,
this is your nature?

246
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:29,041
In the depths of your heart
you feel it, don't you?

247
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:32,375
You could be a Shikabane
with this nature.

248
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:46,125
I'm sorry for not being
able to protect Keisei.

249
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:00,416
I can't thank you enough for all
that you've done for me, Makina.

250
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,250
Spending my days
fighting alongside

251
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,708
you means everything to me.

252
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:06,458
The impact we made is
worth all of this...

253
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:09,500
And more.

254
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,708
Please don't cry...

255
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:18,916
In my last moments,
I want to see you smile.

256
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,541
Smile for me... Makina.

257
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,583
No.

258
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,666
That's not it.

259
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:38,208
I...

260
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,041
I couldn't...

261
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,500
I...

262
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,291
Keisei...

263
01:16:50,166 --> 01:16:51,583
Keisei...

264
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,500
Keisei...

265
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,333
Keisei...

266
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:03,791
Keisei...

267
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,125
Keisei...

268
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,875
Keisei...

269
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:16,000
Keisei!

270
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,875
Well...
This is a twist.

271
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:30,583
Have you awoken...?
Daughter of Hoshimura?

272
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,500
Keisei...

273
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:36,375
My, you have so such strength
for such a puny regret.

274
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,291
Keisei.

275
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,708
I'll admit I'm impressed.

276
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:41,041
You murdered him!

277
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:44,000
You're the ones
who killed Keisei!

278
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,625
What incredible form...!

279
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:05,500
She's casting a
powerful curse.

280
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:08,000
I no longer do
this for me.

281
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,916
I don't carry these guns
for my family, either...

282
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,458
I carry them for Keisei!

283
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,208
I'm not like you!.

284
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,791
I never will be!

285
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,916
Die!

286
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,291
The mirror.

287
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:41,375
It's still broken...
The mirror.

288
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,333
She was able to knock down
a cursed Shikabane Hime

289
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:59,333
with a single blow.

290
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:01,333
Hokuto is such a mystery.

291
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:04,500
It's safe to say you don't
want to piss the girl off.

292
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,708
Not if you value your
existence, that is.

293
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:08,375
Unlike any other Shikabane,

294
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:11,708
she doesn't act on regrets,
obsession, or nature.

295
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:14,375
Her life came to
an end too abruptly,

296
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,916
and now, as a Shikabane...

297
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,250
Connecting with others, being
involved with other people...

298
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:22,625
In her eyes,
this is as important

299
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,333
as learning
the meaning of life.

300
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:28,666
However, her way of connecting
means killing those people.

301
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,250
She is the epitome
of death itself.

302
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,791
Show it to me.

303
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:36,500
This is exactly why she's
the symbol of the Seven Stars.

304
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:49,916
She's why... They exist.

305
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,750
Sorry to crash the party...

306
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:06,250
So this is what passes for a
strong trench these days, huh?

307
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:10,333
How could a half-witted mortal
break the barrier of my trench?

308
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,583
There's no need to resort
to name calling, Wrinkles.

309
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:24,458
Looks to me like this
game is over, Seven Stars.

310
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:31,208
Akasha!

311
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:32,666
Perfect timing.

312
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,750
Who is that?

313
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,166
Maybe a monk...?
But I don't know him.

314
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,208
He looks familiar.

315
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,250
It can't be...
Sadahiro!

316
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,500
What the hell...?

317
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:44,083
I hadn't planned on
an impromptu reunion.

318
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,833
Unfortunately...

319
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:52,541
Being in such close proximity
to the purification chamber...

320
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,958
Makes it near impossible for the
Seven Stars to use their power.

321
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,500
Not to mention...

322
01:20:57,583 --> 01:21:01,541
The presence of the youngest
Genpaku of the Kougon Sect.

323
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:04,958
A descendant of one of the
Ten Great Holy Families.

324
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:07,708
The only living Sojo
capable of handling Acala,

325
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:09,833
the divine sword
of exorcism.

326
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:12,500
And, of course,... The man
who more than likely possesses

327
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,666
the strongest
zadan technique.

328
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,916
If we are to fight
against them...

329
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,416
We must fight their
Shikabane Hime as well.

330
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,333
The Seven Stars
must prepare themselves

331
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:22,125
to make difficult choices.

332
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,333
Makina Hoshimura...

333
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:25,833
From this day forward...

334
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,041
We, the Seven Stars will
view you as an enemy.

335
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:32,166
Our malevolent
and beloved enemy.

336
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,916
But I feel
I should tell you...

337
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,291
This outcome was our desire
from the very beginning.

338
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,541
The mere fact that
you stand before us...

339
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:42,458
Proves that your existence is
part of the Seven Stars plan.

340
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:44,250
Remember that.

341
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,916
Upon our next encounter,

342
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,791
we hope you'll realize
what that truly means.

343
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:49,916
Mark my words,

344
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,125
I will annihilate
every last one of you.

345
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,375
You took everything
I had away from me...

346
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,708
The least I can do
is return the favor.

347
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:59,458
I am Makina, a
Shikabane Hime...

348
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:01,708
And I will destroy you!

349
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,958
[Music]

350
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,958
Would you say you're
in love with her?

351
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:42,875
Are you aware of what lies
underneath her tough exterior?

352
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,291
Go ahead...
Don't dry yours eyes,

353
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:47,083
sit and cry for her...

354
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,833
She's your
"Beloved Aberration."
