3
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,666
Why are you just
sitting there, Minai?!

4
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,916
It's your job
to destroy the Shikabane!

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,583
As Deputy Guardian,
I demand you carry out your job

6
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,750
as Shikabane Hime!

7
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,458
If I allow a Shikabane Hime

8
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,083
in the process of regenerating
her body to assist us,

9
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,916
then Guardian Tagami
will have my hide.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,250
Besides... all your actions
here are forbidden...

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,875
a Shikabane Hime cannot
destroy a Shikabane

12
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,250
without her contracted
monk present.

13
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,875
Minai...

14
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,541
There's no way you can hold
your own against that thing!

15
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't do it!

16
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,583
If I can break
his concentration,

17
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,916
I can take him down before he
has a chance to use the curse.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,666
And I'm not doing this
because I was ordered to.

19
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,958
Minai!

20
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,750
You're just a monster...
but I am justice...

21
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,916
Do you hear me...?
I am justice!

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,458
It's time to die!!

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,583
Mitsu... Yoshi?

24
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,416
Mitsuyoshi,
are you there?

25
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,583
I had no idea you knew Ouri,
but thank goodness you do.

26
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,708
I'm so relieved.

27
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,958
How are you?

28
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,958
You know I've been reading
your blog lately

29
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,250
and it got me
kinda worried.

30
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,166
You need to answer your phone
once in a while, mister.

31
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,250
At least for your friends.

32
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,958
Sho Men!

33
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
Sumitori...

34
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,541
Hello?

35
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,916
Mitsuyoshi,
can you hear me?

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,791
Are you practicing
kendo anymore?

37
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,708
You should.
You were good at it.

38
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,750
It's been too long, man,

39
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,500
why don't we get together and
check out the new Kendo Dojo?

40
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,750
Sumitori...

41
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,625
Are you even there?

42
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,083
Mitsuyoshi,
can you hear me?

43
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,083
Guess not.

44
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,166
Ouri?
Our--...

45
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,416
Sumi...
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,333
If you don't wanna feel
the way you're feeling...

47
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,083
you shouldn't get involved
in the first place.

48
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
Are you okay,
Minai?!

49
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,541
He acts like you two
are long lost friends.

50
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,708
Minai...
we're going back...!

51
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,875
Right now!

52
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,791
I'm gonna be fine...

53
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,833
And I think I'm done with
considering the wounds

54
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,291
on my body as punishment.

55
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,541
Punishment?

56
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,791
I'm not human...
I'm Shikabane Hime...

57
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,625
I know now
why I fight...

58
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,791
Even if it means that
I could get injured...

59
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,000
I promise that
I will do everything

60
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,250
I can to protect people.

61
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,750
I... I can do this...

62
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,166
I can take pride in myself
even though I'm not human.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,708
Thanks for coming
all this way.

64
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
Don't even mention it...

65
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,916
I hope your wounds
are healing properly.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,708
And also... if you need anything
at all, don't hesita-...

67
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,125
And if you didn't know it,
bending over and licking my feet

68
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,125
will heal
you up just fine.

69
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,458
Would you stop talking
like a streetwalker?!

70
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,791
If that's how
you want it,

71
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,958
then I'll keep all of your
true feelings to myself.

72
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,875
Those are certainly
not my true feelings!

73
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,500
Senior, what do you
think you're doing?!

74
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,875
Self healing...

75
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,333
I'm in pretty
bad shape, you know.

76
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,583
Go on, let the poor
guy lick your feet.

77
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,500
Thank you very much.

78
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,291
Would you stop that?!

79
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,916
It's disgusting and you're
really creeping me out!

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,666
Sorry for serving
what you brought,

81
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,875
but this is
all we have.

82
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,250
I knew you didn't
have anything here,

83
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,250
so I picked out
what I wanted to eat.

84
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,750
I reported the traitor monk's
case to old man Takamine.

85
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,416
It's his
decision now...

86
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,125
I'm assuming that you came
here for the other case today.

87
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,458
That's right...

88
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,291
And I wanted to talk to
you about your brother.

89
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,875
He's just been sticking his
nose where it doesn't belong.

90
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,833
He's your brother,
why don't you just have him play

91
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,916
'follow the leader' and
join you in the Kougon Sect

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,041
as another contracted monk?

93
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,708
It could be fun for you.

94
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,541
Minai could work with him after
she cuts her bond with Isaki.

95
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,083
No...
I won't do it...

96
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,833
I can't let him get
any closer to our side.

97
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,208
Nice idea...

98
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,458
But you're a contracted
monk attached to Makina...

99
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,958
Keeping him away will be hard
with your attention divided.

100
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,083
True. But I've
made up my mind.

101
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,083
I'm going to keep my
promise to Makina...

102
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,708
But what I won't do...

103
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,041
is allow Ouri any closer...

104
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,291
They're both important to me
and that's the best I can do.

105
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
Sure...
Mr. Cool Sunglasses

106
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,041
Indoors guy
has some feelings...!

107
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,333
More like, you screw up
again and you're toast...

108
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,541
At least that's
what you told me...

109
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,708
Right, Rika?

110
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,791
She's crazy! I didn't
say anything like that!

111
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,875
Ouri!

112
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,875
You never told me what happened
with you and Mitsuyoshi.

113
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,958
Oh, yeah...
But... it's...

114
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,083
a little hard to
explain right now.

115
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,500
Any word on how
he's doing?

116
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,916
Gotta run... I'll fill you
in the next time I see you!

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,833
I guess you will...

118
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,958
I just hope
Mitsuyoshi is okay.

119
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,583
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

120
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,416
Because you accessed
that Shikabane blog

121
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,875
using your cell phone...

122
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,416
I'm going to have
to confiscate it

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,250
as evidence in a
Shikabane case file.

124
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,291
Isn't that an
inspector's job? .

125
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,916
I mean, why did you come all
the way here by yourself?

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,125
I thought it was
an urgent matter...

127
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,458
I also had some business
to attend to in the area.

128
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,000
I really don't mind
you taking my phone...

129
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,750
but I'm out of luck if I need
to call or text someone.

130
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,958
Don't worry. We'll
get you a new one.

131
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,250
I'll even pay for it.

132
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,958
If it's okay with you,
of course.

133
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,791
See you after school?

134
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,666
Hey, Ouri!

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Can I help you,
Mr. Sougi?

136
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
I don't say this
as your teacher...

137
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,958
but as a colleague of
your brother, Keisei.

138
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,583
I probably don't need
to tell you this,

139
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,208
but Shikabane Hime are
not human in any way...

140
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,458
No matter how cute they may
seem, they're dead flesh.

141
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,375
You didn't have
to put it like that.

142
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,875
[Phone ringing]

143
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,750
Dammit, Minai,
where are you?

144
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,791
[Phone ringing]

145
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,833
I'm not like
those others!

146
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:27,375
[Phone ringing]

147
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,875
Ah...!

148
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,875
Stop!

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,083
It's you!
I remember you!

150
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,416
Let me go!

151
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,875
It's all yours now.
The new one works fine...

152
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,250
Thanks for coming here
to get me a new one.

153
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,916
Sure.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,916
What about you?
Do you have a cell phone?

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,458
Of course...

156
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,791
I have to use it to keep in
touch with my contracted monk.

157
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,666
You think you could
give me your number?

158
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,083
It's just... Makina isn't
the easiest person to talk to,

159
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,041
especially when it comes
to my brother, you know?

160
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,125
I think that'd be great.

161
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,208
Do you want to put it
into your new phone?

162
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,041
Minai!

163
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,208
Minai...
What's wrong with you?

164
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,875
What is it?

165
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,708
Please tell me
you're okay.

166
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,291
I can't...
Can't be...

167
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,541
But I am...

168
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,666
So it's true.

169
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,583
Inspector Honda has just
arrived at the site.

170
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,166
He confirmed
that this afternoon

171
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,416
Shuuji Isaki has
passed this life.

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,083
He's joining the other holy
monks in the spirit realm.

173
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,375
The witnesses said
that he was arguing

174
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,958
with two young men around
this area earlier today...

175
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,541
Then he showed up
here stabbed to death.

176
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,666
There are bad
people everywhere.

177
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,916
No matter who asks,
we're classifying this death

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
as 'in the line of duty.'

179
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,208
Now bring in
the burial cloth.

180
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,875
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,500
So, where's
Isaki's puppet?

182
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,500
Puppet?

183
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,125
His Shikabane Hime.

184
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,041
She shouldn't have
been too far away.

185
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,833
Saki?

186
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,083
Itsuki's coming...
and I'm sure he'll be alone.

187
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,208
Alone?

188
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,500
We can't show anyone...

189
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,666
what the two of us
are about to do...

190
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,750
Contracted monks are tied
to their Shikabane Hime

191
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,958
through a bond
stronger than those

192
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,041
you know in the
physical world...

193
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,500
and a contracted monk's death
directly leads to the death

194
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,250
of his Shikabane Hime.

195
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,875
However,
if that doesn't happen

196
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,916
and she continues to live
on past the monk's death,

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,958
she becomes just
another Shikabane.

198
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,208
That's why...
on this day...

199
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,833
Shikabane Hime must
kill one of their own.

200
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,208
Makina!

201
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,583
No time like
the present...

202
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,125
A Shikabane Hime
is about to die.

203
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
Why?

204
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,916
Minai, slow down.
What's going on with you?!

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,958
Just tell me what's the matter.
You can talk to me!

206
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,833
Shut up!

207
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,500
Oh, Ouri...

208
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,500
I'm sorry...

209
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm sorry...

210
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,625
Minai...
I'm sorry...

211
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,666
Don't worry about it...

212
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,666
It's okay.

213
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,500
No, it's not!

214
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,791
Stop...!
You might think

215
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,708
I'm nothing more than
an irritating 10 year old...

216
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,916
But... my contracted
monk is Rika Aragami,

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,875
a member of the
Great Holy Families!

218
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,291
Descendants of the ten
senior disciples...

219
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,291
are obligated to become
con-tracted monks

220
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,958
to Shikabane Hime.

221
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,791
No Shikabane Hime
can beat me!

222
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,291
Please, no...

223
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,833
You know it.

224
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,666
You felt it
when it happened.

225
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,416
Your contracted
monk is dead!

226
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,791
It's true... They said
it was an accident.

227
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,333
Well, Minai...

228
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,125
You followed up murdering
somebody by killing yourself.

229
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,000
You thought your job
as a Shikabane Hime

230
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,958
was a way of atoning
for your sins.

231
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,208
But it's over now!

232
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,250
How'd she stop it?!

233
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,666
Why are the Shikabane
Hime fighting each other?

234
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,083
Whenever a contracted monk dies,
the bond is severed...

235
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,375
Unless his
Shikabane Hime dies...

236
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,916
She becomes...
just another Shikabane.

237
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,375
I don't wanna die... please.
Are you stupid...?!

238
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,666
We're not alive.
We're already dead!

239
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,958
But he thanked me...
He thanked me!

240
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,750
So thank you.

241
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,083
I thought what I was
doing was just atonement.

242
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,291
But things are
different now.

243
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm changed, and I understand
now that being a Shikabane Hime

244
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,125
wasn't punishment.

245
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,708
And I wasn't some
kind of monster!

246
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,541
I can save people...
I can help!

247
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
I've never felt
this way before.

248
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,416
But I finally figured out what
it is I'm supposed to do...

249
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,916
Shut... up!!

250
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't do it.

251
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,041
We're getting
out of here!

252
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,500
No, Ouri...! Minai is
already a Shikabane!

253
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,791
There's nothing
you can do!

254
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,916
Come on!

255
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,666
Ouri, stop!

256
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,958
He's such a jackass!

257
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,625
Makina...

258
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,041
I mean the Shikabane Hime
are mostly just a shield

259
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,791
for contracted monks.

260
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,541
So they're usually dead
well before the monks croak.

261
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,250
Sounds like one hell
of a crappy life.

262
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,000
I suppose things like this
happen every once in a while.

263
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,083
But I gotta say,
I think it's the first time

264
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,000
I've heard of a monk
being killed by punks.

265
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,583
We don't have
to go, do we?

266
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,958
They're not our targets.

267
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,458
If we run into
them by accident,

268
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,416
in town or something,
we'll do what we have to do.

269
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,583
But honestly, I want
to stay out of this mess

270
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,583
as much as possible.

271
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,541
I couldn't agree
with you more.

272
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,875
Sorry, guys...

273
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,500
but I was wondering
if my friend could stay here

274
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,791
for a little while...

275
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,333
like until later tonight?

276
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,625
She won't bother you.

277
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,750
They're not the nicest
people in the world,

278
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,250
but I think
you'll be safe here.

279
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,666
Where's Minai?

280
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I don't think so!

281
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,458
You've hid her,
now what...?

282
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,583
You gonna be her
decoy forever...?

283
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
What a hero.

284
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,666
I don't get it...

285
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,916
Why do you have
to kill her?

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,083
Because a Shikabane Hime
who lost her monk...

287
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
Is just a Shikabane.

288
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,500
Are you sure...?

289
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,208
Because she said she
wanted to help people.

290
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,041
You think that's her
acting righteous...?!

291
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,541
It's an obsession
driving the Shikabane.

292
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,333
If she wants
to help people...

293
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,916
She's already
exhibiting regret...

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,666
This is what a
Shikabane does, Ouri.

295
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,125
They obsess...

296
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,416
Like it or not, Minai
isn't someone worth saving.

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,791
Do you understand?

298
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,250
I just don't think
that's right.

299
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,666
There's no right or
wrong to any of this...

300
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,625
If she's obsessed
with anything...

301
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,500
she's no different
from a Shikabane.

302
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,875
Now where is she?

303
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,583
You should probably know
that Shikabane Hime

304
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,583
can sense
their own kind...

305
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,833
we'll find her
sooner or later...

306
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,333
So it's no use
hiding her.

307
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,375
Why does it
matter to you?!

308
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,291
What are you
fighting for?!

309
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,250
You don't have a reason,
do you...?!

310
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,583
I know...
But at least Minai does...

311
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,833
I didn't know that
you knew about us.

312
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,916
Just a little.

313
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,208
They're secret
and imperfect,

314
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,333
but the Kougon Sect
has a few ideas on this...

315
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,875
The chance of success
is small but we can try.

316
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,833
First thing we gotta do is
find a monk to replace Isaki.

317
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,583
And we have to do
that like now...

318
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,500
If you can sever the
bond you have with him...

319
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,583
And tie
as strong a bond

320
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,000
to whoever we find
to replace him...

321
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,583
we might be able to keep
you as a Shikabane Hime.

322
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
The big question is

323
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,541
"can you find this kind of
contracted monk in time?"...

324
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,208
One who already
has a certain level

325
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,875
of spiritual ties
to this plane...

326
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,708
Who already
has ties to you.

327
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,166
Ouri is Keisei's brother,
why not him...?

328
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,125
I mean I've never seen the kid
more worried about anything...

329
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,375
so he's already connecting
to you in the way you'd want.

330
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,583
No...!
He's just a kid!

331
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,166
He isn't even in
the Kougon Sect.

332
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
I know that, but I can skip
that whole process

333
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,458
if I mediate the contract
between them myself.

334
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,875
Thank you...
Thank you so very much.

335
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,375
Yo, Ouri.
Check this out.

336
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,416
It's just crazy, man!

337
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,666
What happened?

338
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,625
Someone said that a monk
was stabbed to death

339
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,583
in that parking lot
over there...

340
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,916
They also said the killers
are the same age as us.

341
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,333
Sumi thinks he might've
went to middle school

342
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,666
with a couple
of those guys.

343
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,000
A monk was
stabbed...

344
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,458
Oh, no...

345
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,375
Ouri!
Chill, man!

346
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,416
What's your
freaking deal?!

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,166
Cut it out!

348
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,291
Ouri?!

349
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:43,500
I am... the Shikabane Hime
of Shuuji Isaki.

350
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,166
Well done...

351
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,958
Did you sustain
any injuries?

352
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,041
Not at all.

353
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,625
Then I guess,
we can transfer her now.

354
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,791
Hold up... What about
the burial cloth?

355
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,416
The cloth is for monks above
the Gon-Sho-Sojo level

356
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,958
or those who died in
the line of duty...

357
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,625
So, of course,
we didn't bring one.

358
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,833
But she died in the
line of duty, right?

359
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,416
And for the sake
of the doctrine.

360
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,708
You actually brought
one with you?

361
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,375
Yes... Senior Tagami said
the same thing earlier,

362
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,000
so I thought I
should be prepared.

363
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,666
Alright...

364
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,375
She might've survived
if you'd have made Ouri

365
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,291
her contracted monk like
you said you would...

366
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,291
She didn't have to be loyal
to Isaki to the death.

367
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:48,333
[Phone ringing]

368
00:21:48,416 --> 00:22:00,250
[Phone ringing]

369
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,541
[Music]

370
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,333
Suddenly, you want
to die for no reason.

371
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,041
Time will stop forever.
Because youth is beauty.

372
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,916
And once you become an
adult, you're defiled.

373
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,916
"Set Your Heart Aflutter."
