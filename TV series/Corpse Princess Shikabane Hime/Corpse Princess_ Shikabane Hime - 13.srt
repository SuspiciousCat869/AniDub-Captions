1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,458
[Music]

2
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,666
I still have
lingering emotions.

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,250
Never again...

4
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,375
This is the last time.

5
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,250
Gas expwosion?

6
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,875
Explosion.

7
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,708
Why would
Mr. Keisei want

8
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,583
to have a gas expwosion
for himself?

9
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know.

10
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,791
How come?

11
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,333
I promise you, dear...

12
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:18,333
I have no idea why he--

13
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,208
It's your fault, Hina!

14
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,500
No, it's not!

15
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,250
I wanna see
Mr. Keisei now!

16
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,166
We should go.

17
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,208
We don't have
to go yet.

18
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,625
The wake won't
be until tonight.

19
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,083
But it looks like
it's already started.

20
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,375
Some of the people from his
temple are praying for him

21
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,083
before the actual
ceremony begins.

22
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,125
Hi, there.

23
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,041
You're from the Kougon
sect, aren't you?

24
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,958
Come on inside.

25
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,625
I'm fine right
where I am.

26
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,541
We'll all be just
fine out here.

27
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,375
We'll all...? I...

28
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,958
Ouri Kagami...

29
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,416
You and I may have met on
a few other occasions...

30
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,250
My name is Rinsen Shirae...

31
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,416
I've been appointed as the Head
Inspector for this district.

32
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,458
Head Inspector?

33
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,916
The Inspector's job is
to support soldier monks

34
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,750
who busy themselves with
the fight on the front lines.

35
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,625
I'm also in charge of the
funeral arrangements for those

36
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,458
known as martyrs.

37
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,791
I feel it my place to thank
you for your understanding

38
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,416
with regards to holding our
ceremony before the wake.

39
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,958
No problem.

40
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,958
I mean, ultimately it's, well,
it's really just a funeral

41
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,000
for my brother's other
identity, right?

42
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,041
I should tell this to you
before anything else...

43
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,833
Sho-Sojo Keisei Tagami
was not remotely suited

44
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,791
to a transformation
into Shikabane Hime.

45
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,458
And the reason for this is
that he was called to Heaven

46
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,708
without becoming a Shikabane.

47
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,625
You understand
this, don't you?

48
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,708
Because sometimes the
surviving families make a fuss.

49
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,541
They ask us to do things like
bring back their lost ones.

50
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,916
Excuse me...

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,416
Hm?

52
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,541
I'm Sougen Takamine...

53
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,250
Sojo of the Kougon Sect.

54
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,000
I see.

55
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,583
Keisei...

56
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,208
He was my first disciple, and
he was always special to me...

57
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,750
Like a clumsy son whose heart
is in the right place...

58
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,583
And to honor him I feel
implored to tell you

59
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,375
a few things about us...

60
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,625
You know people die...

61
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,708
But it's not as simple
as that all the time.

62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,666
Deaths affect
individuals, societies,

63
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,791
and ultimately they influence
the entire world.

64
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,666
In some ways,
you could say,

65
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,333
people become a part
of the world by dying.

66
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,333
They have to die.

67
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,125
However, in certain
circumstances an existence

68
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,916
which goes against
that nature is born

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,916
when people who died full of
intense regrets and obsessions

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
come back to life
as living corpses.

71
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,291
With a will of their own.

72
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,541
We call them Shikabane.

73
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,416
Shikabane have two
major characteristics.

74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,791
One is that due to their
nature as corpses,

75
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,208
they have the ability to
regenerate their bodies,

76
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,166
which makes them
nearly immortal.

77
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,791
It's the transformation of
their regrets and obsessions

78
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,500
into power that changes
these people into monsters.

79
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,458
The other is even
more sinister.

80
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,125
Although they have a
human consciousness,

81
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,375
they have deep hatred
toward the living.

82
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,583
It's a prejudice they act
on at any moment,

83
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,250
never hesitating to kill.

84
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,041
Shikabane have
superhuman powers.

85
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,125
The only ways to defeat them
are to either break them

86
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,541
into so many pieces that
regeneration is impossible,

87
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,750
or destroy the brain.

88
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,291
And the only ones capable
of that are Shikabane Hime.

89
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,416
These are the Shikabane

90
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,916
who accepted the Kougon
Sect's doctrine.

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,958
They can fight as a human
against Shikabane

92
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,833
in accordance with the
secret ritual doctrine.

93
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,791
They are the ultimate weapons
for killing Shikabane.

94
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,583
A precision instrument
for the job, if you will.

95
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,916
I don't know.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,750
That might be a
bit of a hyperbole.

97
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,833
Each Shikabane Hime is
accompanied by a soldier figure

98
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,000
known as a
contracted monk.

99
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,750
His role is to provide
life energy called Rune

100
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,875
to his Shikabane Hime.

101
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,500
This is to assist in
keeping the dead girl

102
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,333
among the living.

103
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:48,208
Of course he also supports his
Shikabane Hime during battles.

104
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,750
The contracted monk and his
Shikabane Hime are connected

105
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,375
through a very
significant bond.

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,875
There are over a hundred
contracted monks

107
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,166
currently posted
throughout the country.

108
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,833
The one who unifies
the contracted monks

109
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,291
in each district is
called the Guardian.

110
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Keisei Tagami was the
Guardian in this district.

111
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,625
The one at the very top of the
Kougon Sect is the Dai-Sojo.

112
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,583
The Gon Dai Sojo handles
administrative tasks.

113
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,416
Under him, there are six
Sojo who unify followers

114
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,833
throughout the country...

115
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,000
I am one of them.

116
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,666
Below them, there
are Gon-Sojo,...

117
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,791
Sho-Sojo,
Gon-Sho-Sojo...

118
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,875
And Dai Sozu...

119
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,666
This is how the
ranks continue.

120
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,666
Although Keisei
was Sho-Sojo,

121
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,083
he became Gon-Sojo once he
died in the line of duty.

122
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,375
We feel what happened
was during a battle,

123
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,333
although not in
the heat of it.

124
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,791
When the bond is broken and
Rune is no longer provided,

125
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,541
most Shikabane Hime
die immediately.

126
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,208
However, occasionally it has
been known that there are some

127
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,208
who can survive.

128
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,666
When this happens, we have no
choice but to deal with them

129
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,083
as the Shikabane they are.

130
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,166
However, this type of death for
a Shikabane Hime is very rare.

131
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,958
Every one of them is fighting
in order to get into Heaven.

132
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,208
Destroying
108 Shikabane...

133
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,541
This is the virtuous deed
that is necessary

134
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,208
for Shikabane Hime
to complete.

135
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,416
They couldn't accept
death and became defiled.

136
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,291
This deed is their
way to purification.

137
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,666
When they achieve it,
they will finally be set free

138
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,541
from this world
into the next.

139
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,208
We're by no means
using them.

140
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,458
Rather,
we are saving them.

141
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
I understand how
difficult the work is

142
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,750
that the Kougon
Sect is doing.

143
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,666
I'll admit that there were
times when I was sure

144
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,333
that those in the Kougon Sect
were forcing Shikabane Hime

145
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,333
to do awful things...

146
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,541
But even though I don't think
that anymore, I feel lost.

147
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,916
Let us take some time.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,208
I will discuss
it with you.

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,291
What do you say we get
right to the point?

150
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,416
We need to discuss
transferring your contract

151
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,583
with Shikabane Hime
Makina Hoshimura

152
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,791
to a new contracted monk.

153
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,291
A new contracted monk?

154
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,833
Yes...

155
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,791
Once the Kougon Sect decides
who the new monk will be,

156
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,041
we will break the bond
between you and Makina.

157
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,125
Hold on just a second.

158
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,666
My brother entrusted
me with the contract...

159
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,125
He'd want me to stay
true to my word.

160
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,375
Are you actually telling me
that you'd like to continue on

161
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,541
with your duties as
her contracted monk?

162
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,500
Yes.

163
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,250
Even if you continue,
you can't do anything.

164
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,750
Have you forgotten?

165
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,708
You almost died because your
Rune was forcibly absorbed.

166
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,875
You're lucky
to even be alive.

167
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,958
And let's not
forget the fact

168
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,375
that you're not even
a monk to begin with...

169
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,166
You're not one of us.

170
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,833
There's no way you
could handle this.

171
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,125
I need to know
where Makina is...

172
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,958
Is she even going
to come to the wake?

173
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,083
She's under our
surveillance...

174
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,333
Shikabane Hime are beings
that go against nature...

175
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
They're defiled
as you know.

176
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,000
Therefore, they're not allowed
to participate in services

177
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,750
such as a funeral.

178
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,000
I get it.

179
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,541
They're all Shikabane Hime.

180
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,708
All of those girls.

181
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,750
Keisei...

182
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,000
Why'd you leave me...?
Keisei.

183
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,375
I wasn't really...
his younger brother.

184
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,708
When I was about three,
he found me and took me in.

185
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,333
I don't have memories
of life before that.

186
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,708
And what I remember clearer
than everything else

187
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,708
is the time my kitten
was hit by a car.

188
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:54,250
Since that day, death has
been a part of my life.

189
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,125
It's made me incapable
of fearing death, though.

190
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,291
For reasons
I can't understand,

191
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,875
I get this feeling as if death
is something close to me.

192
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,791
Everything changed
two years ago.

193
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,250
They took the daughter
of the Hoshimura's

194
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,083
and turned her into
a Shikabane Hime.

195
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,791
Brother knew Makina,
he knew the family,

196
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,875
so he became her
contracted monk.

197
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,625
To think I was there
the whole time

198
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,750
and knew none of this
was happening.

199
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,666
All I seemed to be able
to worry about

200
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,708
was Brother
always showing up

201
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,083
with such painful
looking injuries.

202
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,125
I started getting
involved in the battles

203
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,125
between the Shikabane Hime
and Shikabane...

204
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,833
It's like I was
drawn to them.

205
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,500
Even when I, with
my ignorant eyes,

206
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,125
realized Makina
was a Shikabane Hime,

207
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,750
a living corpse, I never
felt that it was unnatural.

208
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,541
She was just an
ordinary girl to me.

209
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,541
And I remember something
she said about Brother...

210
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,291
She said something about
him being her comrade...

211
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,416
He was very
special to her...

212
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,833
Close.

213
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,208
And he fought alongside
her valiantly...

214
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,291
But I always knew
that he was more to her

215
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,666
than just another
soldier in the field...

216
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,000
That he was as precious
to her as he was to me.

217
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,500
The world didn't change.

218
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,500
Time kept moving forward.

219
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,625
But when Brother died...

220
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,666
Makina and I both lost something
of ourselves that day.

221
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,791
Are you gonna take
all of those with you?!

222
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,500
It was you,
wasn't it?!

223
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,791
You put all these
magazines in with my stuff!

224
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,916
I don't think so.

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,916
That's your name written
across the front.

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,833
Maybe so, but it's written
in your hand writing!

227
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,583
What the hell is this?!

228
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,750
Hey now, settle down!.
Hear me out!

229
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,416
Consider this the friendly
kick-in-the-pants

230
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,208
I know you could use.

231
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,875
Feast your eyes!

232
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,083
"Moe Warrior
Zenbunose Puchitto!"

233
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,625
All incredibly rare,
limited edition memorabilia

234
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,750
that you can't find anywhere!

235
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,250
Then you put 'em up
in your own room...!

236
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,958
Get outta here!

237
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,166
Oh! You want
some privacy?

238
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,500
Say no more.

239
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,958
I understand, my man,
you want me to go

240
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,333
so you can enjoy them
all by yourself.

241
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,375
I'll kick your ass!!!

242
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,916
The reason we fight?

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,041
Maybe you should sit down.

244
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,708
Have you ever thought about
what happens when someone dies?

245
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,250
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

246
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,166
They can't realize their
death has any meaning...

247
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,625
So they cling to
their past life...

248
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,875
holding regrets and
obsessions toward this world.

249
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,500
Becoming monsters
called Shikabane.

250
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,166
What if something horrible
were to happen to you...?

251
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,750
What if you died?

252
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,916
If that does happen...

253
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,750
burn some incense for me.

254
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,208
If you're gone, what's gonna
happen to the Dai-Rin House?!

255
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,916
What are we all
supposed to do...?

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,708
Think about everyone
you'd leave behind

257
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,666
if you got
yourself killed?!

258
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm sorry, Ouri...

259
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
but quitting is out
of the question.

260
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,625
I became a contracted
monk for Makina's sake.

261
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,375
You have to understand
I'm the only one she has.

262
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,958
Brother entrusted me with the
only thing he left behind...

263
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,333
Her.

264
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,166
Yo, Ouri!
Wassup?!

265
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,791
No!
Cut it out!

266
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,166
Hello, Manager.

267
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,416
Why did you
come here?

268
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,291
And what's with
your clothes?

269
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,416
I knew your brother...
a little.

270
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,458
What? Well, I should
invite you inside.

271
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,750
Please.
You, too, Akira.

272
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,250
I think I'll
pass on that.

273
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
Why?

274
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,291
I'm gonna pass, too.

275
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,916
Don't tell me...
She's a Shikabane Hime.

276
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,666
Hey, Manager, just
wanted to let you know

277
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,625
our part-timer is useless!

278
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,916
Hello?

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
They said one of those
kids came back to life.

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,958
Sorry, guys...
but I was wondering

281
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,125
if my friend could stay
here for a little while...

282
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,583
like until later tonight?

283
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,791
She won't bother you.

284
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,458
Not again...

285
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,208
I'm sorry... I think my
mind was kinda wandering.

286
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,458
Thinking about that
girl again? You know--

287
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,833
Look, you left her with us,
but she said she had to leave.

288
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,083
I didn't use my best
judgment and I let her go.

289
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,625
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,666
I'll be fine.

291
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,750
Guess that makes you
her contracted monk.

292
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,625
I've already chanted
a Buddhist sutra...

293
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,541
See you later.

294
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,791
Please,
you can't go...!

295
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,916
If you're part
of the Kougon Sect,

296
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,416
would you tell me?

297
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,000
I want to be a contracted
monk...! No forget that!

298
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,958
My brother already transferred
the contract to me...!

299
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,291
And this is a
role that I know

300
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,250
I have to become
worthy of inhabiting!

301
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,375
I just can't let...
Don't take her away!

302
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,208
Have you heard
of Mount Goryo?

303
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,250
Sadahiro!

304
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,041
All soldier monks
used to train there.

305
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,416
I'm really sorry
about Minai, kid.

306
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Let's go, Akira.

307
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:28,541
[Music]

308
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,000
Once something is broken,
it can't be unbroken.

309
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,500
But you're struggling,
writhing to get it back...

310
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,625
You're desperate.
So desperate.

311
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,791
Can you see the
"Path of Light"?
