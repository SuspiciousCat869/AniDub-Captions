2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,791
Emi, I think it's
time we headed back.

3
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,375
You're still
chickening out?

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,500
We're already here, so there's
nothing you can do about it.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,208
Nozomi, stop dragging
behind, would you?

6
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,125
Ah, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,458
It happened about
two months ago...

8
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,208
A friend of mine from
middle school talked me

9
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,625
into going out
to this old building

10
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,625
that everyone believed
to be haunted...

11
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,750
And that's
when I met her.

12
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,708
Hey, Takatoo...

13
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,333
Yeah?

14
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,958
Is this place really haunted
or is it just an empty building?

15
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,083
This place is
haunted all right...

16
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,333
I have it on good authority
that 3 years ago,

17
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,875
a gang of bank robbers used
this place as a hideout.

18
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,958
But when the cops were
catching up with them,

19
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,750
one of the members freaked out,
thinking they were done for.

20
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,791
The fire spread
in an instant.

21
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,166
And they weren't the
only people here.

22
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,916
Some people were
burned to death.

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
Others died jumping
from the windows,

24
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,541
trying to escape
the blaze.

25
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,250
Not too long
after that,

26
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,875
a strange rumor
started going around

27
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,958
that some kids who went
to play in the scorched ruins

28
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,375
never came out.

29
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,000
And when some adults
went in to look for them,

30
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,541
they didn't
come out, either.

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,625
Everyone vanished.

32
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,583
Soon, companies started
turning down orders

33
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,416
to demolish
what was left.

34
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,625
After a while, some people
gave the building a name

35
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,541
they thought it deserved.

36
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,125
They call it "the
man-eating building."

37

[Screeming]

38
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,041
You guys have
to be careful.

39
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,666
I'm used to being
in this kind of environment,

40
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,791
but it can be
dangerous in here.

41
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:03,875
Okay.

42
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,791
Hey, man. I'm guessing
this is the room

43
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,875
where the bank robbers hid
and ended up biting the dust?

44
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,375
Yeah... You can
feel it, can't you?

45
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,333
Such incredible energy.

46
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,333
Really?

47
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, really.

48
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,500
You should be leaving now.

49
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,500
This place is dangerous.

50
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,041
I'll just stick
with you...

51
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,541
Wait up!

52
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,833
No...

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,791
What's wrong?

54
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,083
I thought I saw
a dead body right there.

55
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,291
No you didn't...

56
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,250
They cleaned all
that out a long time ago.

57
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,583
Well, look at that...

58
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,833
It's just a dummy.

59
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,458
Must be some kind
of practical joke.

60
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,958
I'm not a spiritual guy,

61
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,458
but this has gotta be
disrespectful to the dead.

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,583
That looks like
real cash, man.

63
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,208
Who would joke
with real money?

64
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,083
It's fake.

65
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,291
Don't!

66
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,666
Put the money back and
step away from there!

67

Hey, you're that chick.

68
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,250
Give it back...

69
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,083
Give it back...

70
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,291
It's mine...

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,041
My money...

72
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,333
Give it back...

73
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,750
Give it back...

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,666
Give it back!

What're you doing?!
Get outta here!

76
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,083
Just keep running to
the end of the hallway!

77
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,500
It'll get you
outside...! Go!

00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,750
The bastards
stole my money...

And I'm gonna
kill them...

00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,625
Hold on to me!

81
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,083
We gotta hurry.

82
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,625
This is my money!

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
What happened...?!
Are you okay?

84
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,791
She's dead?

85
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,708
Oh, no!
She's dead!

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,291
I'm gonna kill you all.

87
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,041
You're not getting away!

88
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,666
And now you die
like the rest!

89
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,041
When someone dies with strong
regrets, they become Shikabane.

90
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,875
They're corpses
who curse living people

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,083
and set their sights
on killing them.

92
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,666
I've heard talk
that there are people

93
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,708
who want to get rid of us
using other Shikabane.

94
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,791
Which must be what you are!

95
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,750
One who tries
to kill immortals?!

96
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,500
Damn you...!
If I knew you weren't human,

97
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,583
I would've skipped
those other worthless kids

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,458
and killed
your ass first!

99
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,083
In that moment,
I was calmly amazed

100
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,833
that it wasn't fear
or surprise filling my heart.

101
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,500
I was captivated.

102
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,916
Held tight in the wake of beauty
left behind that fighting girl.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,208
People have said from the
beginning of humanity

104
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,958
that death is something
of which to be frightened.

105
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,958
I've thought that perhaps
that's not entirely true.

106
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,791
Because death releases
people from this world.

107
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,875
And yes, her beauty
is the beauty of death.

108
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,041
The beauty of release.

109
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,541
Since that day,
I've wanted more than anything

110
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,500
to see her
just one more time.

111
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,750
I wonder why.

112
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,000
No matter
how hard I searched,

113
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,791
I could never
find a Shikabane.

114
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,750
More importantly,
I could never find her.

115
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,166
I can't believe it!
It's her!

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,083
I've told you
over and over again... .

117
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,083
Do not get
involved with us!

118
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,583
I know
what you've said...

119
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,791
But I have to know
where Minai was taken...

120
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,333
Why can't you
just tell me that?

121
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,083
Minai...?
Who's that?

122
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,791
Come on... You know
who I'm talking about!

123
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,000
Actually,
Ouri, I don't.

124
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,958
Did you kill her?!

125
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,875
I don't know anything because
we didn't do anything.

126
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,750
Keisei said it was resolved,
which is good enough for me.

127
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,791
It should be good
enough for you, too.

128
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,166
Don't lie to me...!
Where did she go?!

129
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,166
Give me
a straight answer!

130
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,833
Thanks...

131
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,291
I think
I remember him...

132
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,625
Hi there.

133
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,375
Are you a
friend of Ouri's?

134
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,958
Um... Well...

135
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,916
I guess you
could say that...

136
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,458
Bye!

137
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,833
What a weird girl.

138
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,500
I don't know, Ouri.

139
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,750
Maybe you'll know what
I'm talking about

140
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,333
when I tell you this.

141
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,166
But when I heard about the
senior dying in a strange way

142
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,833
and another stabbing
someone, I felt...

143
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,041
sorry...

144
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,708
For them.

145
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,541
Yo! What's with the
gloomy faces, losers?!

146
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,250
I wonder what's
gonna happen

147
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,875
to the Student Council's
assistants... Now?

148
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,375
You're the only member
of the student council.

149
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,875
But I let you guys
help me, don't I?!

150
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,416
For I, Mizuki Inuhiko,
manage the 10th grade

151
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,750
and you're positioned
beneath me; learning, growing.

152
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,958
But next year,
I'll be the president

153
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,500
and you will
all be my staff.

154
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,708
We'll carry out
glorious reformations!

155
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,583
We alone will craft a golden
era for Ikai High School...

156
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,083
Hey...! Pay attention
when I'm talking to you!

157
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,416
While it looks like you

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,541
two suckers are busy
riding the depression train,

159
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,208
I'm gonna show
you something today

160
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,208
that will instantly make all of
your problems a distant memory.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,791
Okay...
That's just Kasuga.

162
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,541
So what...?
She's not that hot.

163
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,375
What do you
mean so what...?!

164
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,333
It should be obvious.
That woman is a Breast Goddess!

165
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,750
Breast Goddess?

166
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,666
See? I mean,
would you look at that!

167
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,375
There's nothing wrong with
focusing our infatuations

168
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,166
on hot models or TV stars
or anime voice actors

169
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,583
or even transfer students.

170
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,833
But I thought I'd go back
to when it all began for me.

171
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,375
The goddess who's
drawn my attention

172
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,125
since I started
high school.

173
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,875
And she's bigger than
that transfer student!

174
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,416
Isn't she hot?
Don't you feel better?

175
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,750
Aren't your
worries gone?

176
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,333
It's him.

177
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,083
So... have you
talked with Ouri

178
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,458
since everything
happened the other day?

179
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,416
No...
How about you?

180
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,458
Nope... He's completely avoided
any kind of contact with me.

181
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,333
I heard that the Inspector
took care of Minai.

182
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,208
But as far as Ouri
is concerned,

183
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,791
he thinks
we killed her.

184
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,291
Right. But if he stays
away because of this,

185
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,625
things will work out...

186
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,083
Don't you think?

187
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,708
They should.

188
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,250
I wonder what's gonna happen
between him and Makina.

189
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,791
He'll probably avoid
her the most...

190
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,500
He seems to think,
for whatever reason,

191
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,750
that Makina is his
brother's girlfriend.

192
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,208
Would he be close to
the truth on that?

193
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,000
No, not a chance...

194
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,625
although I don't know how
Makina feels about it.

195
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,125
She's a Shikabane Hime.
She knows.

196
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,416
Yeah, I guess...

197
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,583
Ouri...

198
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,875
Ouri...

199
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,458
What's wrong with you?!

200
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,375
Hello.

201
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,250
Ouri, I would like
to introduce you

202
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,166
to my lovely
breast goddess.

203
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,250
Breast, what?

204
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,375
I'm sorry to spring
this on you...

205
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,583
Don't worry about it.
What's going on?

206
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,875
When I asked Ushijima,

207
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,458
he said the two of you
were good friends,

208
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,708
so I thought...

209
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,416
We're friends...
I don't know how--

210
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,208
It doesn't matter. Just let
me get right to the point,

211
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,333
if you don't mind.

212
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,875
Of course.

213
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,500
I want you to give up on that
girl you've been chasing.

214
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,000
What girl do you mean?

215
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,708
You were waiting for her
in front of a temple.

216
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,458
She has long hair.
She's beautiful.

217
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,458
She's talking about that
Shikabane Hime, Makina.

218
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,541
Makina Hoshimura?

219
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,541
Really,
that's her name?

220
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,500
Makina?
Makina Hoshimura!

221
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,625
It's simply beautiful!

222
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,125
Yeah...

223
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,833
but I think it'd be better
if you stay away from her.

224
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,583
I don't understand. Why?

225
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,500
It's complicated...
Because...

226
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,208
Shikabane Hime attract
those who admire death.

227
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,125
I wonder if this woman is
also fascinated by death...

228
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,666
Just like you.

229
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,458
Uh... is something wrong?

230
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,708
It's nothing, sorry.

231
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,833
In the same way
you're drawn to death,

232
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,333
you're also drawn
to Shikabane Hime.

233
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,166
You can no longer
get out of it.

234
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,208
Shut up!

235
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,958
Uh...

236
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,083
Oh, no... I was just
trying to catch...

237
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,041
a... cat.

238
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,416
You pervert! There's not
a cat anywhere around us!

239
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,375
I swear there was a cat...

240
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't know anything!

241
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,375
You're just chasing her around
like every other brainless man!

242
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,916
How dare you lie to me just to
fulfill your dirty fantasies!

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,833
I only said that because
I'm concerned about you.

244
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,208
I'm not some jerk.

245
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,583
I'm going to make sure
Makina never has to deal

246
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,000
with this kind
of crap from you!

247
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,125
No one else
can see me...

248
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,625
Because I am you...

249
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,375
Here, I'm finished.

250
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,083
If you can do this
kind of work...

251
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,375
your arm has
regenerated well.

252
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,750
Isn't there a better
way for you to test

253
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,666
if my arm's up to speed?

254
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,416
I want you to know that
if Ouri comes to see me,

255
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,666
I'll ask him to help.

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,375
But it looks like
he's pretty mad.

257
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,541
Who is Ouri anyway?

258
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,791
You said you found him
one day and took him in...

259
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,833
But it seems like the Inspectors
know a lot more than that...

260
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,500
So what kind
of child was he?

261
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,125
He was an ordinary kid.

262
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
You're wrong.

263
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,958
He's always been
a strange one.

264
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,500
I mean, when he knew
my heart wasn't beating,

265
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,708
it didn't faze him.

266
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,125
Almost like
he expected it.

267
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,541
And even with Minai.

268
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,708
He knew she was
a Shikabane Hime,

269
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,250
but he treated her as if
she was an regular girl.

270
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,541
I find it hard to believe

271
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,250
that there's an
ordinary kid anywhere

272
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,583
who could do all of that.

273
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,750
If I remember correctly...

274
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,500
he was about three
when he came here.

275
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,625
Such a sad
and useless child.

276
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,041
He didn't know how to put on
clothes, how to use tableware.

277
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,000
The kid didn't even know
how to use the toilet.

278
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,458
Nothing. Forget about any
emotional understanding.

279
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,166
But one day,
something in him changed.

280
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,666
He was different.

281
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,791
What do you mean
you adopted him?

282
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,791
Well, he was on the
riverside, crying.

283
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,958
I had to do something.

284
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,958
And bringing him
home was the answer?

285
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,458
Don't listen to him.
I think it's great...

286
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,166
He's your
friend now, right?

287
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,541
Ouri had never
shown any interest

288
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,708
towards other
kids up until then.

289
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,708
Or anything for
that matter.

290
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,166
And the very
first thing in this world

291
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,250
that caught his attention
was a small, helpless life.

292
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,958
You couldn't say he
was a good caretaker.

293
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,500
He was much too clumsy
and short-sighted.

294
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:20,000
But it seemed the kid was coming
back to life little by little.

295
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,333
The poor thing.

296
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,875
We'll hold a memorial
service for him.

297
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,500
Riko, would you mind
grabbing a set of work gloves

298
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,791
and some incense?

299
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,833
I'll get the shovel.

300
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,291
Ouri stared for
hours at that cat,

301
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,958
marveling at how it changed
from a life into an object.

302
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,625
Ouri...

303
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,958
Why did you bring him
to a place like this?

304
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,875
This is where I found him.

305
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,416
I know he'll start crying
again if he's here.

306
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,791
I know he will!

307
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,250
Ouri...

308
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,875
The best thing
we can do for the dead

309
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,583
is remember them
for who they were

310
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,208
and shed tears
for the loss.

311
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,208
A monk's obligation isn't to
put the dead on a pedestal...

312
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,000
but to help guide the tears
of those who are left behind.

313
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,750
So, Ouri...

314
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,333
It's okay...

315
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,000
You can cry now.

316
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,166
I think that was the first
time he ever experienced

317
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,750
a real emotion.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,666
In everyday life, people
forget about death...

319
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,375
And when they're reminded

320
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,458
because someone close to them
died, they soon forget again...

321
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,083
But I think it's harder

322
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,916
for Ouri than it is for
everyone else out there...

323
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,166
For some reason he thinks
he shouldn't forget.

324
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,708
But why...?

325
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,416
It'll just make him suffer
more than he already does...

326
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,708
There's nothing
to gain there.

327
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,875
It's time...

328
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,541
I should be leaving now.

329
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,291
Where're you going?

330
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,750
I gotta show my face at the
head temple once in a while.

331
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,041
Ouri...

332
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,750
Ouri...

333
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,708
Ouri...

334
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,708
Ouri...

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,416
Ouri...

336
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,083
Have you already
forgotten?

337
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,833
About little ol' me...?

338
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,041
But you...
You're dead.

339
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,250
Ouri, what's
going on in here?

340
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,666
It's the cat...

341
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,041
I know you're sad,
but stop crying...

342
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,333
Go to sleep.

343
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,125
What's wrong?

344
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,750
I'm only visible to you...

345
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,416
Because I am you.

346
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,083
Have you forgotten
about me...?

347
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,250
About us...?

348
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,708
Not again...

349
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,750
I'm sorry... I think my
mind was kinda wandering.

350
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,541
Thinking about
that girl again?

351
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,125
You know--

352
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,375
Look, you left
her with us,

353
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,000
but she said
she had to leave.

354
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,833
I didn't use my best
judgement and I let her go.

355
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,041
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,291
You still don't know
where she is, do you?

357
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,833
I'll be fine. I gotta
clean this mess up now.

358
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,708
Excuse me...

359
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,000
Is your name Makina?

360
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,791
Depends on who's asking.

361
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,041
I'm Nozomi Kasuga, you saved
me from that man-eating monster.

362
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,666
I came by because wanted to say
thank you for saving my life--

363
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,958
For the good of you and
everything you care about...

364
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,750
you should forget about
that night and me.

365
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,333
But Makina, there's
no way I could.

366
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,458
Go home, kid.

367
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,041
I don't want to...

368
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,708
Ouri couldn't possibly
understand you

369
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,750
or what you are
the way I can.

370
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,875
He's no good for you and he
doesn't get any of this...

371
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,208
He doesn't understand
anything about you or death.

372
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,458
Death?

373
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,916
Death is forever
and it's something

374
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,541
only the chosen can
approach without fear...

375
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,125
Death is beautiful...

376
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,125
That's why I'm drawn
to you... I get it.

377
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,041
You get nothing.
Death is death.

378
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,333
It's as simple as that.

379
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,583
But...

380
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,083
You don't know
anything about Ouri.

381
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,625
You're not familiar
with death at all.

382
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,708
He is.

383
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,625
And with you, too?

384
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,791
Sorry about that.

385
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,166
I don't know
how it happened,

386
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,041
but she seems to have gotten
the wrong idea about me.

387
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,041
So what...? I thought you
were gonna stop coming here.

388
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,125
I only see him with
you some of the time...

389
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,916
Do they not allow
cats at your place?

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,291
What?

391
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,916
Wait, you can see him?

392
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,791
It's not so dark that I can't
see a cat in front of me...

393
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,166
And if you're here
to see Keisei,

394
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,708
he's at the
head temple.

395
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,625
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

396
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,416
Is it about Minai?

397
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,625
Yeah... Whenever I try
to think about her...

398
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,250
I realize that I don't
really know that much.

399
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,416
Would you mind telling me a
couple of things about her?

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,791
What was she like?

401
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,166
All we can do for the
dead is remember them...

402
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,291
And cry for the loss
when they're gone.

403
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,416
Brother told me something
along those lines

404
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,041
when I was younger...

405
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,208
But with Minai...

406
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,625
I don't know enough about
her to remember who she was.

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,291
All I have
to drink is tea.

408
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,791
Huh?

409
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,750
Thank you.

410
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:07,333
[Music]

411
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,875
Stars shine in the sky while
people writhe and struggle

412
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,333
on the ground.

413
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,666
But in this backwater place
where the living and dead

414
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,708
have seemed
to switch places,

415
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,500
even "Stars on the Ground"
can begin to twinkle.
