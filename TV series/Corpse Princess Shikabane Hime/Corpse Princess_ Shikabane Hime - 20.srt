00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,416
I loved Keisei
so very much,

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,541
and I love him
even more now.

What's the matter?

00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,208
Don't worry about it.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,125
Nozomi...

00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,458
Uh... What are
you doing?

00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,875

00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,250
Will you kill me...
please?

Please, Ouri...

11
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,958
Nozomi, stop this!
What are you saying?!

12
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,500
That you...

13
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,333
That you're the only one who
can help me find my happiness!

14
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,291
You're talking like
some kind of crazy person!

15
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,833
I just want
to be happy!

16

Your eyes aren't
playing tricks on you.

You again!

Ouri!

Quit fooling around.
Open your eyes.

You mean
you can see it?

22
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,958
Beautiful, huh...?

23
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,416
But it's more than
just a balloon...

24
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,708
This is my
happiness, Ouri.

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,041
Huh?

26
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,333
As I get happier,
it gets bigger and bigger.

27
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,125
Soon it will bring the
ultimate happiness - my death.

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,833
That's what you want?
Death?

29

Oh, yes...
it's my dream...!

30
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been waiting
my whole life

31
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,583
to feel this
kind of ecstasy.

00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,125
Why did you do that?

I don't know what's
going on here...

35

your crap together...!

Stay away from me.

00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,125
I'm not kidding around,
what's wrong with you...?

39
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,208
You've been acting
so weird...

You're not hurt,
are you?

00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,875
From the moment
you left town,

47
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,833
it seems like everything
she's done has been about you.

Are you still talking
about that...?

49

Inuhiko, there is nothing
between Nozomi and me...

concept for you...

Doesn't love you back.

I don't expect you
to understand.

55

It's just something that...

were supposed to be going over

We haven't been able
to reach them, either.

Yes...

I know I have to stop him.

Get to the school as quickly

Having lost two
of their members,

92
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,750
there's a very
real possibility

that the Seven Stars could

protection to Ouri and Makina.

I'd advise you not to get
too close to Hokuto...

105
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,666
If she happens to take
an interest in you...

106
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,958
she will kill you.

107
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,916
I'm aware of that...

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,708
In order to understand someone,
she has to destroy them...

109
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,541
It's all she's capable of.

110
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,916
It's the way...

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,125
that she herself met
with her own destruction.

112
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,916
The Scripture on
Shikabane Hime laws -

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,583
did you find
it interesting?

114
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,541
The pieces of the puzzle are
starting to make sense...

115
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,458
You attacked the Hoshimuras in
order to steal the scripture...

116
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
You wanted to learn
about Shikabane Hime.

117
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,958
I have no reason
to deny it.

118
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,500
We needed that Scripture

119
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,583
so we could better
understand Shikabane Hime.

120
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,958
But there was another,
more important reason...

121
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,833
Creating a Shikabane out of
Makina Hoshimura, correct?

122
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,083
We needed a Shikabane...
to be Hokuto's enemy.

123
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,791
We needed a reason for her to
want to crush the Kougon Sect.

124
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,000
It hurts... it hurts...
it hurts...

125
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,666
it hurts... it hurts!

126
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,708
Hokuto has no obsessions.

127
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
Nor any regrets.

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,791
The child is simply what
she is: a pure Shikabane...

129
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,125
... which makes her perfect to
be the symbol for our crusade.

130
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,375
And it is your intention
to use this symbol

131
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,333
to annihilate
the Kougon Sect.

132
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,041
Is that not
your goal as well?

133
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,541
Well, the boy is gone.

134
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,583
I turned my back for a moment
and he just disappeared.

135
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,125
You mean Hizuchi?

136
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
He's always been hopeless.

137
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,458
I must agree.

138
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,208
He certainly doesn't like
Toya's way of doing things.

139
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,958
Just let the boy be.

140
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,166
He can no more fight his own
nature than the rest of us can.

141
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,750
How can you be so
relaxed about this?!

142
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,166
That's not your concern.

143
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,041
You just focus on
deciphering that Scripture.

144
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,708
That girl...
that's Nozomi Kasuga.

145
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,458
Makina, it's you!

146
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,375
You really shouldn't go
into the school right now.

147
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,625
There's something bad
going on inside there.

148
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,583
There's nothing bad...

149
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,416
It's just that everyone
is becoming happy.

150
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,125
Nozomi, do you know
something?

151
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,375
I know this... I've always
admired you, Makina...

152
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,375
That's a very
foolish thing to say.

153
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,083
... and when I asked
myself why...

154
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,125
the answer was
you were so beautiful...

155
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,750
Then I thought...
well of course...

156
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,000
of course
she's beautiful...

157
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,375
She's already dead, she's
eternal, how could she not be?

158
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,000
I realized then that's why
Ouri was attracted to you.

159
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,166
Ouri...? What does he...
have to do with any of this?

160
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,750
But that's alright.

161
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
Soon, I'll be dead too.

162
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,666
I'll be eternal!
Just like you!

163
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,958
Now watch!

164
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,541
How is it...?
Don't you feel happy?

165
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,083
The balloon takes your
happiness and swallows it

166
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,458
and just gets
bigger and bigger.

167
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,666
Just you wait...

168
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,416
Makina!

169
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,791
Are you all right?!

170
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,291
That...
that girl there.

171
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,958
You have to hurry
and catch her.

172
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,958
She wants to be...
a Shikabane.

173
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,625
The Seven Stars have
been using her...

174
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,625
But what about you?

175
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,666
Go! Hurry!

176
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,041
She wants you,
she's waiting for you.

177
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,416
Why do you struggle
like that?

178
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,583
You're so close to
being truly happy.

179
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:11,500
[Music]


180
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:21,541
[Music]


181
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:28,916
[Music]


182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,750
You eat the
happiness of others...

183
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,083
I get it now!

184
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,125
That's not very nice.

185
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,041
Now what?

186
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,250
[Laughter]

187
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,541
Wonderful!
That was perfect!

188
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,625
Everyone died happy!

189
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,708
You bastard!

190
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,875
It's all right.

191
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,791
It was just a matter
of time, anyway.

192
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,500
Because once the monster called
"happiness" starts to grow,

193
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,291
it eats and eats and eats
until there's nothing left.

194
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,333
And you call
that happiness?!

195
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,083
Of course.

196
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,416
What could be better than
being allowed to die

197
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,250
at the very peak
of one's happiness?

198
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,416
What's so great...
about being murdered?

199
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,125
You've started feeling
happy, haven't you?

200
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,625
As you keep feeling
happier and happier,

201
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,916
so too will it grow...

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,958
the monster within.

203
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,958
Nozomi, stop!

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,833
[Laughter]

205
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,041
Nozomi, please!
Snap out of it!

206
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,375
You're just being
used by a Shikabane!

207
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,333
I'm happy!

208
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,958
So happy...

209
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,166
Ouri. I'm going
to be a Shikabane Hime.

210
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,375
What?!

211
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,500
I'm going to die and
become a Shikabane Hime,

212
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,500
just like Makina.

213
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,291
Then I'll be able to
be with you forever!

214
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,416
You don't know
what you're saying!.

215
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,666
Stop talking like that!

216
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,041
Forever, you and me.

217
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,375
I have had enough!!!

218
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,416
Ushi!. Sumi...!

219
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,250
What did you
do to them?!

220
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,666
They just want
happiness too, Ouri...

221
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,333
the same as me.

222
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,291
Are you insane?

223
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,166
It's not happiness you're
talking about, it's death!!

224
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,583
No, please!!

225
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,916
Nozomi...

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
If the balloon
breaks...

227
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,041
I'll die.

228
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,208
Nozomi, you've got
to snap out of it!

229
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,458
Ouri...?
What did you say...?

230
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,583
I can't think...

231
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,458
I don't know what
just happened.

232
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,125
But I'm happy...

233
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,833
I'm so happy because you're
here with me right now.

234
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,208
So...

235
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,875
so...

236
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,791
Oh, Ouri...

237
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,750
I want to stay
like this.

238
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,208
I don't want
to die, yet!

239
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,166
I'm not ready to die!

240
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,041
Oh! What's the matter?

241
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,416
And we were having
so much fun...

242
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,791
Stop!

243
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,083
I'm not finished
with you!

244
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
Oh no, what a shame!

245
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,458
It would have gotten
so much bigger!

246
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,500
Well, it's still big enough
to devour you, I suppose...

247
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,583
That's right.

248
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,083
When you were little,
you could just play

249
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,958
and not have to worry
about anything.

250
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,000
That's the kind of happiness
you're looking for, right?

251
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,583
You want to go back to that
simpler time, don't you?

252
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,125
You want to know
the truth?

253
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,416
It's possible...

254
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,708
that I might feel
happiness again...

255
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,250
Oh yes... once you and
your pals are all dead!

256
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,083
I think you stayed a little
too long at the fair!

257
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,416
What are you?

258
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,708
Lady... is happiness
the same thing as death?

259
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,375
I don't...
Understand.

260
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,333
I heard she came from
a poor lower-class family.

261
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,416
In her whole life she never
even had one decent meal.

262
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,833
Then one morning her
parents suddenly decided

263
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,208
they'd all go to an
amusement park for the day.

264
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,500
Daddy! Mommy!

265
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,833
[Laughter]

266
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,250
Hurry up, Mommy!

267
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,541
C'mon, Daddy!

268
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,708
Over this way!

269
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,083
We rode all the rides and
ate all the delicious food.

270
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,833
We had so much fun!

271
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,500
That was the first time I ever
played with my Mommy and Daddy

272
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,458
all day long!

273
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,291
I was so happy!

274
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,416
I thought that's what
happiness was: having fun!

275
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,208
I wanted it to never stop,

276
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,083
so I've been having more
fun ever since then.

277
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,166
It's my happiness.

278
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,625
And then, in the happiest
moment of her life,

279
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,875
her parents poisoned her
and themselves...

280
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,708
She still doesn't have
any idea she's dead.

281
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,000
That's why,
to her child's mind...

282
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,875
happiness and death are
exactly the same thing.

283
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,750
That's insane...

284
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,458
Death isn't happiness!

285
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,125
Insane, huh?

286
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,458
You died and became
a Shikabane Hime...

287
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,750
how else would you have
been able to fight us?

288
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,250
Isn't that happiness?

289
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,500
No, it isn't!

290
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,875
Surely you must know, deep
down in your heart of hearts...

291
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,333
that for most of us

292
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:38,791
there can be no higher form
of happiness than dying.

293
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,750
Hazama wants her, right?

294
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,125
Take her with you, Toya.

295
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,416
I have to go now...

296
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,125
I have business to finish.

297
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,083
[Crying]

298
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,458
I thought that you'd
want me to be with you...

299
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,666
if I could just become
a Shikabane Hime.

300
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
I thought
you'd look at me...

301
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,875
the way you
look at Makina.

302
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,250
Oh God...!
What have I...

303
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,916
I want to be alive
with you, not dead!

304
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,208
How could I have
been so stupid?!

305
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,291
Is that what...
my happiness looks like?

306
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,541
Nozomi,
we have to run!

307
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on!

308
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,875
Brother, please
help me one more time!

309
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,125
Zadan technque!

310
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,375
Zadan technique,
you say?

311
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,625
You really think the gods
would allow you

312
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,791
to create a miracle
like that?

313
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,708
It's not possible...

314
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,041
You are the child
of a Shikabane.

315
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,791
Quiet, you.
This boy belongs to me!

316
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,083
Time to go now.

317
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,041
Nozomi!

318
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,041
Nozomoi! It's gonna be
all right now!

319
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,666
That balloon was her
happiness in physical form.

320
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,875
It was her second self.

321
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,416
Once it's disappeared, she
has nothing left to live for.

322
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,625
Nozomi!

323
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,166
Nozomi!!

324
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,375
Ouri, I...

325
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,541
please...

326
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,625
I want...

327
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,208
to be a...

328
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,750
a Shikabane Hime so...

329
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,958
So that we...

330
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,625
[Music]

331
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,000
You're beginning
to remember now,

332
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,291
aren't you...?

333
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,916
The Shikabane of your
dearly departed brothers.

334
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,583
Is it despair or joy
inside your scream...?

335
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,375
"My Mother Was Defiled."
