[Music]

2
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,583
Ouri, it's you!

3
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,125
Makina!

4
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:49,291
Hey! Makina!
Where are you?

5
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:52,500
That injury...
it should've killed him.

6
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,708
No, you can't
take him on!

7
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:02,208
I know
I can do it.

8
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,666
How about this...?

9
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,208
Which Brother do you
like the most, Ouri?

10
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,250
You think a little
too much of yourself, kid...

11
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,750
To actually inflict
some harm on me...

12
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:42,250
a human like yourself would
have to use a surprise attack.

13
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,625
Ouri!

14
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,166
Makina,
don't do it!

15
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,833
It's disgraceful...

16
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,791
I know this is nothing
more than the illusion

17
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:51,083
of Brother's face,

18
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,125
but I can't help
the way I feel about it.

19
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,333
And like I said before,

20
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,541
no one else should have
to deal with this!

21
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,041
Ouri, listen...!

22
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,833
Don't just toss
that thing...!

23
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,708
Focus your attention
on the tip of the staff!

24
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,750
You're just sad
little humans

25
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,583
confined in your small,
weak bodies.

26
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,916
I almost feel
bad for you.

27
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,750
Not bad enough
to let you live.

28
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,458
Ouri...

29
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,291
That was a
Zadan technique...

30
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,833
It's a fighting style the
Kougon Sect's contracted

31
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,875
monks learn during
their training...

32
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,375
So when he beat
Ena earlier,

33
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,125
it wasn't because
he caught him off guard.

34
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,375
But how can Ouri do that when
he hasn't even completed

35
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,083
the full training?

36
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:12,166
A Zadan technique isn't the
power of the monk himself...

37
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,875
It's the act
of borrowing power

38
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,083
from the stars and the gods,
those who protect him.

39
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:22,333
Looks like this kid here is
receiving a lot of protection...

40
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,708
from a lot
of different places.

41
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,125
Oh, please...

42
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,041
Would you stop hiding
and come out to play...?

43
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,541
You want to be happy,
don't you?

44
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:06,458
Happy...? To be
killed by you?!

45
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:10,208
The greatest happiness is
to die happy, of course.

46
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,000
All should
understand this.

47
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:15,666
For can anything else
truly be called happiness?

48
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,000
So you think those like me
should have just stayed dead?!

49
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,958
Don't let him get
to you, Saki...

50
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,541
He's with
the Seven Stars

51
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,833
and knows how to
manipulate people's minds.

52
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:44,875
I guess all these guys
are just the puppets.

53
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,333
Ouri!

54
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:52,625
No puppet here, you brat...!
This one is the real me!

55
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:55,250
Seven Stars...!
I thought Ouri had killed you!

56
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,250
[Laughter]

57
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,166
I can't be killed...

58
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,750
That's precisely what the Seven
Stars are, you foolish thing.

59
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:05,375
Ena manipulates corpses
and transfers his soul

60
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:07,000
into each one of them.

61
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,833
You can consider
all of them his spare bodies.

62
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:12,083
Spares?!

63
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,291
He's right. Mine
is a free existence.

64
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,041
I'm not confined to a body
like the rest of you!

65
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,750
[Laughter]

66
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,583
Then I'm just gonna have
to kill all the bodies

67
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:28,041
that you're planning
on switching to.

68
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,166
That's a smart move, kid!

69
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,041
Th-they're crazy!

70
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,958
They're all out
of their minds...

71
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:47,500
Don't your hearts ache seeing
the faces of these people?

72
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:48,958
No!

73
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:57,541
Say what you want to because
you're out of spare bodies now!

74
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:03,541
Toya...! What are
you waiting for?!

75
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,583
I was only
waiting to see

76
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:11,750
how long you planned
on fooling around, Ena.

77
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:14,666
I have brought
a present for you.

78
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:21,083
Thank you so much, Toya.

79
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,833
Darn... I didn't
wanna use this body.

80
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,500
It just that I like
it so very much...

81
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:41,458
I'd hate for it
to get damaged.

82
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,666
Don't act...
innocent...

83
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:47,625
That body's just stolen from
another corpse someplace, right?

84
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,208
Your words are
so very hurtful to me...

85
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,666
I think I'll
punish you first.

86
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,458
Take... this!

87
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,208
Sadahiro!

88
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,958
That looked like

89
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:07,083
it was gonna be more than
just a punishment to me.

90
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,333
[Laughter]

91
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,208
In order to achieve
a more beautiful,

92
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:14,083
more perfect existence,
I myself created this body

93
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:17,291
through the gathering and
use of many, many corpses.

94
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,500
This body really
is the best.

95
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,375
You might not think much
of my curse's power now...

96
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:25,125
But I swear I won't
miss this time.

97
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,458
Let me take this...

98
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,958
You're my
contracted monk...

99
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:37,125
You call me Makina
and we work together.

100
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,583
Look at that.

101
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:40,791
Such a beautiful friendship
between a dead person

102
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,416
and a living one...

103
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,291
I'm telling you, you should
abandon everything too,

104
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,833
like I did.

105
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:48,041
You can evolve into
something more beautiful.

106
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:51,500
Something so much
stronger than this.

107
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,750
You think the dead
need to evolve?

108
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,500
Makina!

109
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,750
Your regrets are a useless
match for my curse...

110
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,625
What do you say
we test my theory.

111
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:19,500
Seven Stars!

112
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:31,666
Makina...

113
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,916
No, no, no!
That's a useless attack...

114
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,833
This high-speed spinning
will grind your fingers

115
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:38,541
until you have nothing
left but your palm.

116
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:39,958
I wonder
if you'll push

117
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,750
until it strips you all
the way down to your wrist.

118
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,916
I will say that kind of
destruction would be perfect

119
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
for recreating you and giving
you to Hokuto, though.

120
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,541
Are you okay, Ouri?

121
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,958
His Rune is being absorbed.

122
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:02,000
What?! She actually stopped
the spinning for a moment?!

123
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,083
How can that be?!

124
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,458
Are her fingers
regenerating faster

125
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,791
than they can
be scraped away?!

126
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,208
No Shikabane can
regenerate that fast...

127
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,416
It's as if she has an ability
to regenerate infinitely...

128
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,208
I get it!
I know what this is!

129
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,333
It's my curse!

130
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,375
This isn't
an ordinary curse.

131
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,791
My power comes from
two regrets, not just one!

132
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,375
Beautifully...

133
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,625
Beautifully...

134
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,000
More beautifully...

135
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,083
The true beauty...

136
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,750
This isn't me.

137
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,458
This isn't me.

138
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,625
It isn't me!

139
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:59,625
The real me is...
The real me is gone!

140
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:08,666
Stop it! Stop it!

141
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

142
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,833
You thought if you
abandoned your body

143
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,875
you could become
someone else.

144
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,916
This isn't me.
It's not even not.

145
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,833
And you think that this is a
beautiful, perfect existence?!

146
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,125
No... No... No...

147
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:23,166
No... No... No...

148
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,208
I will never abandon
myself to anything...

149
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,416
not 'til the day I destroy
every last writhing one of you.

150

[Gun firing]

151
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,333
Makina? Ouri?

152
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:03,166
Good evening,
mademoiselle.

153
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:08,500
What does
death mean to you?

154
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,625
Go on...

155
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,708
It's the most beautiful
thing imaginable.

156
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:18,041
The greatest
happiness we can feel.

157
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,375
That's precisely correct.

158
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:24,750
It seems I've finally met
someone who shares my sentiment.

159
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:28,125
I see how beautiful
Makina Hoshimura is,

160
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:29,250
and I've
begun to realize

161
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,000
there's only
one reason for it:

162
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,541
she's dead...

163
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,166
Death is beautiful.

164
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:37,958
I adore it.

165
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,750
I don't want to live
this ordinary life.

166
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,458
I should be special.

167
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,708
Like Ouri and Makina.

168
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,875
They get to be
on the other side.

169
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:51,083
Why do I have to live this
ordinary, boring existence?

170
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,958
You don't. I'll give you
something wonderful.

171
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,791
Now...

172
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:58,875
become... happy.

173
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,833
You're capable
of anything now.

174
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:07,333
And at the peak of your
happiness, you'll die.

175
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,250
This is ecstasy...

176
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:15,583
[Laughter]

177
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,208
Don't push yourself.
You need to rest a while.

178
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:23,416
How are you feeling?

179
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,791
I think I'm all right...

180
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,125
I have to get used
to this kinda thing.

181
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,625
My name's Akira Tooka.

182
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,166
Are you my senior?

183
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,541
I think so. I've been with
this guy here for 3 years

184
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,541
working on everything
under the sun.

185
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,666
Sounds like you're a little
unhappy with that, Akira...

186
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,916
I guess you've gotten close
to your hundred and eight.

187
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,916
I hope you'll be making
it up to Heaven soon.

188
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,500
Ouri!

189
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:52,166
Makina?!
Are you out there?!

190
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,750
It's better if you didn't
tell anyone you saw us here.

191
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,833
And we won't tell anyone
about your curse, either.

192
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,416
We're after the
traitor monk right now,

193
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,000
so we better go...

194
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,708
Later!

195
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,875
If they're after Akasha...

196
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,833
then when it comes
to humans...

197
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,500
Can she kill them?

198
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:21,083
The Seven Stars are different
from the normal Shikabane

199
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,833
we're used
to dealing with.

200
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,250
They have a clear intention
behind their actions

201
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:27,875
and always work
in a group.

202
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,208
It is quite clear
that their purpose

203
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,833
is to harm
the Kougon Sect.

204
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:37,375
While they are
the Seven Stars...

205
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:40,750
You must remember that they
are nothing but Shikabane...

206
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:43,666
like all the others
you have faced.

207
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,541
Two stars out of seven
have fallen.

208
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,958
Now we are to set up
a defense perimeter

209
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:51,041
around this head temple

210
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,500
and wipe out
the remaining Stars.

211
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,166
Begin preparations.

212
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,041
This is an imperial ordinance
from his Grace Dai- Sojo.

213
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,041
Excuse me...!

214
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,375
Ouri!

215
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:04,125
Whoa! Ouri's
got some guts.

216
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,666
Blurting that out when he just
joined the sect... impressive.

217
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,666
I hope he's not scolded
in front of everyone.

218
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:10,791
I don't think
that their goal

219
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:14,041
is just to come
after the Kougon Sect.

220
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:16,833
It has to be something bigger,
but the question is what?

221
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:19,541
Restrain yourself,
Dai-Sozu Kagami...!

222
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,833
Remember you're only here due
to extraordinary circumstances.

223
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,375
But I've actually
crossed paths

224
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:25,875
with the Seven Stars
more than once...

225
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,833
and with that traitor monk
running around with them...

226
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:30,708
Restrain yourself!!

227
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:33,375
Dai-Sozu Kagami...

228
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,041
My apologies,
your Grace.

229
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,500
I am curious as to what you
perceive to be the true goal

230
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,458
behind the Seven Stars.

231
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:43,125
The Dai-Sojo is
talking to me...

232
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,625
You can't answer,
can you?

233
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,541
The Seven Stars
consider us their enemy.

234
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:50,041
It's as simple as that.

235
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,208
I don't have an answer.

236
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:56,166
Are you perhaps suggesting
that we should not fight them?

237
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,250
No. We will
destroy them...

238
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,083
as it is our wish.

239
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,916
Check him out...
"As it is our wish"...

240
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:17,833
I broke into
a cold sweat...

241
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:19,583
Thought I was
gonna pass out.

242
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:21,000
Did I do something wrong?

243
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:24,166
I mean after all I was
only voicing my opinion...

244
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,708
Are you brain dead?!

245
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:27,708
An imperial ordinance
is an order.

246
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,083
Once it's issued we
just have to obey it...

247
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:32,833
We're not allowed to pose
questions or defy the order.

248
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,833
You mean it's like this
was passed down to us

249
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:36,041
by God or something?

250
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,166
Exactly. The Dai-Sojo
is equal to God...

251
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,416
That's the way it is.

252
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,916
That's the way
it'll always be...

253
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,916
And don't forget he's also
the only person in the sect

254
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,333
who can carry out the code
to create Shikabane Hime

255
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:47,291
in a complete manner.

256
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,875
That's...

257
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,333
It's something
Keisei left behind.

258
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,833
Wouldn't you
like to keep it?

259
01:16:56,916 --> 01:16:58,625
As a memento?

260
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,791
Oh, no. I don't think that's
what he would have wanted.

261
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:05,208
I think he would have
preferred you to keep it.

262
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:06,541
Which makes sense,

263
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,125
because if you're
to learn a Zadan technique,

264
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,875
you're going
to need a catalyst.

265
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,666
But I don't know...

266
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,958
Just take it, Ouri.

267
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:13,958
What?

268
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,541
She's right.

269
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,833
You put that robe on and who
knows, you might just end up

270
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:19,166
being a little less
of a burden to everyone.

271
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,750
She didn't mean that...!

272
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,666
I mean, come on, that's not what
you were saying right, Makina?

273
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,541
Oh, whatever...

274
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,125
What's going on?

275
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:42,916
No way, that's...

276
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:46,250
That's the Breast Goddess?!

277
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:52,458
It's amazing... I went
to see her earlier, too.

278
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:54,000
Yeah, well,
good for you...

279
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,000
Why are you sulking
around like a big baby...?

280
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:59,041
I just never realized that
she was this beautiful before.

281
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:01,166
That's not the Breast
Goddess, Sumitori.

282
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,625
What do you mean?

283
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,083
It's not the craziest
thing in the world

284
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,458
when a girl
comes back to school

285
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,541
after the holiday break
looking totally different.

286
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,583
I can't explain it.
She's different...

287
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,708
My Breast Goddess just
wasn't as full of confidence

288
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:14,291
as she is now...

289
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,375
I liked her because she was
fragile, like she always seemed

290
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,583
to be the slightest
bit troubled by things.

291
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,250
Damn... Where
the hell is Ouri?!

292
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,541
He should've been here!

293
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:24,291
Don't know. I never know
what that guy is up to.

294
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,625
I'm done.

295
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,041
What? What're you
talking about, baby?

296
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,375
We were just getting
warmed up here.

297
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:40,375
I've never done this kind
of thing with a boy before...

298
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:43,083
And I thought it would
make me feel happier...

299
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,791
This isn't good...

300
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,583
I have to become
happier and happier.

301
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:50,291
What are you?
Some kind of tease?

302
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,875
I want you to
become happy, too.

303
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,458
What?

304
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,583
This is ecstacy, Nozomi...

305
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,500
Thank you so mu-...

306
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:20,208
It's so wonderful...

307
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:22,083
Nozomi! What
happened to you?

308
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:23,375
Where have you been?

309
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,333
I feel unrelenting
happiness now.

310
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,958
Like any wish
I make will be granted.

311
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,291
Happiness?

312
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:35,250
Do you want me
to make you happy, too?

313
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,791
Is it your time?

314
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,166
Lock the door
behind you.

315
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,708
What...? Then it's
okay if I come inside?

316
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,291
'Course it is...

317
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,375
It's not like there're things
in here I don't want you to see.

318
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:01,625
So, I'll just come on in.

319
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,750
Is this the only kind
of stuff you eat?

320
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:12,583
The truth is it doesn't matter
if I eat or not since I'm dead.

321
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:13,833
But I get hungry.

322
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,541
From time to time.
Like anyone.

323
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:19,583
It's strange,
isn't it?

324
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:24,000
But I didn't realize that the
contracted monk has to pay

325
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:27,541
for all your stuff.

326
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:30,583
Providing for your Shikabane
Hime is part of your job.

327
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:32,750
Do you feel
like quitting now?

328
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,583
Of course not!

329
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,583
Are you serious
about all of this?

330
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:49,333
Accepting my curse
and contracting with me?

331
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,708
If I use my curse, your body
is going to get weakened,

332
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,500
and in the worst case...

333
01:20:57,583 --> 01:21:00,125
The worst possible scenario
is that you could die.

334
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:03,250
I've made up my mind!

335
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,625
Uh...

336
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:05,791
I mean... Uh...

337
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,916
I... I've made
my decision.

338
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,833
I loved Keisei so very much,
and I love him even more now.

339
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:27,625
Uh...

340
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,791
Don't worry
about it...

341
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,916
Nozomi...

342
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,541
Uh...

343
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,833
What are you doing?

344
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:58,333
Say, Ouri...

345
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,500
Will you
kill me... please?

346
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:11,791
[Music]

347
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:40,416
I know you've known
it for a while.

348
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,458
It's such a simple thing
that it leaves no room

349
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,625
to misunderstand it...

350
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:47,583
But you are the
only one who can grant it...

351
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,291
her "Mundane Wish."
