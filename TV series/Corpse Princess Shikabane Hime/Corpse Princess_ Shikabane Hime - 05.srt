1
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,166
I'm leaving.

2
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,125
Hold on...
I'll take you.

3
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,333
You should probably take
that brother of yours home.

4
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,041
Oh, no.
I'm fine.

5
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,500
You're the one
who's hurt...

6
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,125
Why don't you let
him take you home?

7
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,833
I've already healed...

8
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,291
I am a Shikabane after all.

9
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,208
You two should
have a talk.

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,708
Should we follow--

11
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,875
She won't listen once
she's made up her mind.

12
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,625
Women like
that are trouble.

13
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,958
What are you
talking about?!

14
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,250
There's
nothing in here.

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,625
So...

16
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,083
Are you gonna tell
me everything?

17
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,708
Did I say you could
take my stuff?

18
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,000
Well I can tell you, but
it definitely won't be cheap.

19
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,125
1,000 for the bust alone;

20
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,750
2,000 more if you want
the waist and hips.

21
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

22
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,541
After all,
it was a lot of work

23
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,333
checking her
measurements you know?

24
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,166
Who said I wanted to know
Makina's measurements?!

25
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,541
Who said
they were Makina's?

26
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,333
Well if they're Zenbu Nose's,
I really don't want to know!

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
Now tell me!

28
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,791
The reason
why we fight...?

29
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,916
Maybe you
should sit down.

30
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
Listen Ouri...

31
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,083
Have you ever thought about
what happens when someone dies?

32
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,625
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

33
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,333
There is meaning
in a persons death...

34
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,583
every death has the potential
to affect individuals,

35
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,250
society, or even
the world around us.

36
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,166
So you see, death is
by no means a bad thing.

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,125
Yeah but...

38
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,125
I don't see why-

39
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,791
Listen...!
There are those...

40
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,333
Who refuse to
accept the truth.

41
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,250
They can't realize their
death has any meaning.

42
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,541
So they cling
to their past life...

43
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,875
holding regrets and
obsessions toward this world.

44
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,958
Becoming monsters
called Shikabane.

45
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,750
But how can...

46
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,541
Something like
that exist?

47
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,041
There are numerous theories

48
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,000
as to the reason behind
the transformation...

49
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,208
But we still don't
have any answers.

50
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,916
The philosophy of salvation
has been passed down

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,375
through the Kougon Sect
since its founder...

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,833
It states that we are to
return all Shikabane to death

53
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,625
in order to keep
this world safe...

54
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,916
Do you
understand, Ouri?

55
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,916
Yes. This my job and
none of it concerns you...

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,958
Can you do me a favor
and stay out of trouble?

57
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,541
Hey, wait up!

58
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,250
So all of those times
you came home injured?

59
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,791
It wasn't because of
your motorcycle, was it?

60
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,083
Well...

61
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,583
Sometimes I did
actually fall...

62
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,333
Then how can I
not be concerned?

63
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,416
Don't sit there and tell
me I shouldn't worry!

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,333
What if something horrible
were to happen to you...

65
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,250
What if you died.

66
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,666
If that does happen...
Burn some incense for me.

67
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,500
If you're gone, what's gonna
happen to the Dai Rin House?!

68
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,208
What are we all
supposed to do?

69
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,041
Think about everyone
you'd leave behind

70
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,916
if you got
yourself killed.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,041
I'm sorry, Ouri...

72
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,666
But quitting is out
of the question...

73
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,458
I became a contracted
monk for Makina's sake.

74
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,625
What?

75
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,041
You have to understand
I'm the only one she has.

76
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,250
I think this is it...
It looks like the car.

77
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,333
Sweet dude,
it's not beat up at all.

78
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,833
Wait a minute,
so whose car is this?

79
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,833
You don't need to worry
about it, just hop in.

80
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,125
Please...
It'll be okay.

81
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,333
The rumor's were true...

82
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,333
Keys are in the ignition.

83
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,791
I had heard about this rental
company from a friend...

84
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,708
They do all their business
under the table...

85
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,541
Renting out cars to people
without a license.

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,125
A rental company?

87
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,000
So... we're paying
for this?

88
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,250
According to the rumor

89
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,333
I'm supposed to leave
the money on the dash...

90
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,750
But I think we can all skip
that part, don't you?

91
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,333
I'm down, why don't we
just take the car and run?

92
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,791
Good idea, but apparently
there are consequences.

93
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,375
That's enough!
What are you doing?!

94
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,375
Nothing...

95
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,208
I'm not steering!

96
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,083
What the...
is this a joke?

97
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,250
Our Kun-chan is dead...

98
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,833
why?!

99
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,125
It's not like
you knew her.

100
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,083
I think she must have
been pushing herself

101
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,750
too hard yesterday
by trying to go on

102
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,250
with the live
performance.

103
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,166
Oh, she really loved her fans,
why did she have to die?!

104
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,791
A couple of friends
were saying

105
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,750
that she was
connected to Yakuza.

106
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,041
You shut your face
about Kun-Chan!

107
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,666
Hey Ouri...
why are you so quiet?

108
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,166
All right...

109
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,083
I know you deliver papers
in the morning but seriously.

110
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,291
Settle, today
I would like your help

111
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,250
in welcoming a new student
to our classroom.

112
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,541
Her name is Itsuki...

113
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,875
Yamagami.

114
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,375
Ouri she's an angel...!

115
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,625
A freakin' angel
is in our classroom!

116
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,291
I thought you were
in love with Kun Osaki?

117
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,750
Hey...
look over here.

118
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,166
Ouri!

119
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,000
Tell me...
how did you do it?

120
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,833
Hey there.

121
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,916
You're Ouri Kagami,
aren't you?

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,958
Yeah.

123
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,583
Sorry about earlier.

124
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,875
You remind me of a dog I used
to have a long time ago.

125
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,458
So I waved
on accident.

126
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,083
Oh... I see.

127
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,708
But... Maybe it was fate
that made me wave to you.

128
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,916
What do you say
we be friends?

129
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,208
Sure.

130
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,375
Why should you care...?

131
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,916
So what if she happens
to know Ouri?

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,625
It's just
unbelievable!

133
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,250
I find it hard to believe

134
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,500
that a girl would smile
at a guy like Ouri before...

135
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
She'd smile at me!

136
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,333
Listen dude...
It's nothing against Ouri,

137
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,125
I just think that
spunk is a commodity

138
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
that the girls in
our class tend to lack,

139
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,625
and when you
find a gal...

140
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,166
Ladies, there's enough
Ushi for everyone.

141
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,666
I guess
the word is out.

142
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,125
The new health teacher
must be starting today.

143
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,041
You think
he's good looking?

144
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,083
I guess
he must be.

145
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,541
And that ends
our demonstration.

146
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,083
There may not be much
I can teach you,

147
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,666
but I promise
to do my very best.

148
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,833
It was nice
to meet you all.

149
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't understand...

150
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:32,250
Are you telling me that I will
no longer be the guardian?

151
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,375
That's not what
Sojo's saying.

152
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,083
You're taking it
the wrong way.

153
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,208
Look, the Kougon
Sect is well aware of

154
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,000
how I came
to take in Ouri.

155
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,083
That's not the... uh?

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Now, it was my understanding
that your brother

157
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,291
was never to know of your
work as a contracted monk.

158
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,208
That was the condition
we agreed on, wasn't it?

159
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,375
It was.

160
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,000
We'll follow the head
temple's orders

161
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,625
as to how we deal
with Ouri Kagami...

162
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,333
Got that?

163
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,208
Until further notice, you are
to cease all duties as guardian.

164
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,666
[Disconnect tone]

165
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,500
Thank you very much, Sir.

166
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,291
Was it you,
Inspector Honda,

167
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,541
who went through all the
trouble of letting His Grace,

168
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,541
Gon Dai Sojo,
know about this incident?

169
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,583
Yes. I do believe that it was
well within my jurisdiction.

170
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,541
So tell me, do you really think
we can't trust this boy...?

171
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,791
Honestly.

172
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,708
I am suspicious
of everyone.

173
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,666
It's one of the more difficult
parts of being an Inspector...

174
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,500
No exceptions.

175
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,250
In my personal opinion there
are times when Keisei Tagami

176
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,583
treats his Shikabane Hime
as if she were human.

177
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
Well...

178
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,500
Makina is the only surviving
member of the Hoshimura Family.

179
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,541
Treating defiled corpses as
human is against our philosophy.

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,000
I see...

181
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,416
But it could become very
dangerous if a Shikabane

182
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,625
were to attack while
Keisei is still off duty.

183
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,375
I'll go there
if I'm needed...

184
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,458
I know the district isn't
too far from the head temple.

185
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,625
I don't think it's necessary
to send the strongest

186
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,208
of the Shikabane Hime,
do you?

187
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,750
It's taken care of...

188
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,541
I have already spoken to Genpaku
about picking up the slack.

189
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Very well...

190
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,500
I believe that I've
heard of him...

191
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,750
Are you sure?

192
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,416
I am certain.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,958
He is the youngest to become
a contracted monk in the history

194
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,083
of the Kougon Sect.

195
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,375
What do you think?

196
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,833
You know
as well as I,

197
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,166
contracted monks are to tell
no one about their job,

198
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,583
not even their family.

199
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,333
The less people who know
of the Shikabane's existence.

200
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,333
The better off this world
will be for it, Kamika.

201
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't think that's
the only thing Honda's after.

202
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
I have to agree...

203
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,666
They seem to think Keisei
has some connection

204
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,583
to the traitor monk.

205
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,791
But I've already...

206
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,083
I've already
investigated it.

207
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,833
There are rumors about
an unlicensed rental car.

208
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,416
And I can't find
anyone who's rented it.

209
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,416
Well to be precise,
I can't find anyone

210
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,583
who's still alive
after renting it.

211
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,750
Trapped by a Shikabane...

212
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,500
But I've been ordered
not to work by the temple.

213
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,291
Isn't it our duty
to protect...?

214
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,333
To prevent even
a single human life

215
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,541
from falling victim
to this world?

216
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,125
You and I have made a
mistake by telling Ouri.

217
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,458
The head temple is
already suspicious

218
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,291
that he's somehow connected to
the recent Shikabane attacks.

219
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,750
Why?

220
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,083
Let it go, besides we have
plenty of time to relax now.

221
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,833
Going for a drive?

222
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,625
Yeah, I was asked out but...

223
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,833
It was so sudden
and I'm kinda scared.

224
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,208
You mean of the guy
who asked you out?

225
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,541
He said there's this rental
car company renting out to kids.

226
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,208
Could you come along...?
It would really mean a lot.

227
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,166
I would...

228
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,875
But I...
I gotta work tonight.

229
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,000
Please Ouri...

230
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,041
Later.

231
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,333
Why is it you...?
Why couldn't it be me?

232
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,416
I think I've heard of this
unlicensed car company

233
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,708
renting out to kids.

234
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,250
Rumor says...

235
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,083
Anyone who rents a car from
them, ends up disappearing

236
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,541
without a trace
of evidence.

237
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,708
Do you think
he'll show?

238
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,166
What man in his right mind
would turn down a girl like you?

239
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,416
No man except
for you, right?

240
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
Now that just
isn't true...

241
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
Remember to be careful.

242
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,500
Makina.

243
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,875
A shady rental company
where people disappear...?

244
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,333
Sounds like
Shikabane to me.

245
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,875
Brother told me...
I shouldn't get involved.

246
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,791
But Ouri...
You're already involved.

247
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,791
I finished taking out the trash,
so I'm gonna head out.

248
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,416
Oh good you came...

249
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,375
I was so afraid
you wouldn't.

250
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,416
Hey listen to me Itsuki...

251
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,666
Someone told me...

252
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,083
About this rental
company and it's cars.

253
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,000
They're involved in
some pretty shady stuff.

254
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,125
What are you doing here?!

255
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,791
I knew it.

256
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,541
You two know
each other...?

257
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,708
Great... Why don't we all
go out for a drive together?

258
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,958
Um, hey there,
Itsuki?

259
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,750
You do have...

260
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,666
A driver's license
don't you?

261
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,666
Can't say
that I do.

262
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,916
So what's up with that
guy who asked you out.

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,500
The truth is I lied...

264
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,958
I just really wanted to spend
some time getting to know you.

265
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,500
But if...

266
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,791
You have a girlfriend,
I guess it's a bad idea.

267
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,666
She thinks I'm
your girlfriend?

268
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,583
So you aren't then...?
That's good to know.

269
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,833
Yeah...
Go right on ahead.

270
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,458
I'm not gonna
put up a fight.

271
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,250
Very funny!

272
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,750
Why are you here?

273
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,416
I figured I'd
see you again...

274
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,166
As long as I kept
following strange events.

275
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,083
Thought you were told
to stay out of it?

276
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,375
I can't just
stay out of it.

277
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,083
Not as long as my
brother's in danger.

278
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,958
Don't you get it?
You're a liability.

279
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,875
Your presence here puts your
brother in more danger

280
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,416
than you fail
to realize...

281
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,166
If you really want to help,
don't get involved.

282
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,666
I hope you know he
became a contracted monk

283
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,875
for your sake
and not his own.

284
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Hey, Itsuki,
watch out!

285
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,291
You're going a little fast,
don't you think? Slow down.

286
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,375
But... I'm not the one in
control of the wheel anymore.

287
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,125
What about the breaks?

288
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,958
It's not working.

289
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,125
One Passenger?

290
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,791
What in the world is this?

291
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,458
It wants us
to kill each other?

292
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,000
What're you
talking about?

293
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,666
That's what it wants,
isn't it?

294
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,333
We kill each other here.

295
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,041
It won't stop until there's
only one of us left,

296
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,666
that person lives.

297
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,250
We'll find
another way out.

298
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,500
No. We won't...

299
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,416
I don't want to die.

300
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,208
Regrets!

301
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458
If people were forced
to kill each other...

302
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,916
They would most likely leave
this world with regret.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So a person who
dies in this car,

304
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,083
has a greater chance
of becoming a Shikabane.

305
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,125
Then... the car was made
to create Shikabane?

306
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,833
What are you saying...?

307
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,291
There's, no other way
out of this car.

308
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,708
Makina, wait!

309
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,250
That's not fair.

310
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,916
Humans tend to struggle more
when they don't wanna die...

311
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,500
Like it or not,
it's gonna happen...

312
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,291
Remember that!

313
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,333
Quite an impressive disguise,
you've been hiding behind...

314
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,291
but it's not them who will
be doing the killing tonight.

315
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,625
It'll be me.

316
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,875
Time to die,
Shikabane.

317
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,541
Makina!

318
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,583
You get out too!

319
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,333
Tell me does your friend
always look so angry

320
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,833
or is this just one
of those nights?

321
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,041
Do you see him too...?
What's the matter?

322
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,458
Ouri...
Stay away from him.

323
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,000
Now, now...

324
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,208
I don't appreciate having
my conversation interrupted.

325
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,791
Tell me
who you are.

326
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,041
Aren't we
the curious one...?

327
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
They call me
the traitor monk...

328
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,041
I turned my back
on the Kougon Sect...

329
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,250
My time
is now spent

330
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,125
destroying all the
pathetic little puppets

331
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,750
they've created to
protect themselves.

332
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,916
Do you mean...
The Shikabane Hime?

333
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I must admit
I'm curious...

334
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,458
do you know what
they truly are?

335
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,416
They're the...

336
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Good Shikabane.

337
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,041
They kill other
Shikabane for a humans sake...

338
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,583
And that makes them
the good Shikabane?

339
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,416
Let me enlighten you...

340
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,791
They fight only
to fulfill a contract.

341
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,250
If they succeed in
destroying 108 Shikabane...

342
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,083
they can make it
into heaven.

343
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,083
Into heaven?

344
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,583
Shikabane Hime are those
who became Shikabane

345
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,291
without ever wishing it
upon themselves.

346
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,833
They quite simply don't
know how to die...

347
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,166
And the Kougan
sect uses them

348
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,666
as if they were nothing
more... than puppets.

349
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,750
Itsuki,
you're all right!

350
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,375
So...

351
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,583
It was you who was trying to
make Shikabane this entire time?

352
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,708
I create Shikabane.

353
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,750
This is just the first
of many necessary steps

354
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,416
if I'm to
achieve my goal.

355
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,708
I don't give a damn
about your goal...

356
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,583
C'mon!!!

357
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,416
Itsuki, no...
You too?

358
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,375
You see now
don't you...?

359
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,458
They're given a false life
for making a contract

360
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,666
with the Kougon Sect,
agreeing to destroy

361
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,458
one-hundred and eight Shikabane
for there own entry to Heaven!

362
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,166
She murders her own kind.

363
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,166
I am Takamasa Sougi,
Genpaku.

364
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,166
I am a contracted monk...
Don't move!

365
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:12,708

[Music]


374
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,166
You start running...

375
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,208
With the belief that
something good lies ahead.

376
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,333
But don't fool
yourself...

377
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,541
You're about to find
a new kind of despair

378
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,375
"At the End of
the Dangerous Run."
