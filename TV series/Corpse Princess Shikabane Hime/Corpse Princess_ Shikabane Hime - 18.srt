1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,458
[Music]

2
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,708
What?! Mount Goryo?

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,416
Are you serious?

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,875
Yes. He told me he was
going up there to train.

5
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,916
But, wait, Ouri called you
and told you this, didn't he?

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,666
Well, yeah. He said that he
needed to do it to become a monk

7
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
or something like that.

8
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,583
Didn't make much sense
but he sounded serious

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,958
about quitting school.

10
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,625
And about you and him...
I was just wondering...

11
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
You serious about Ouri?

12
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,625
Uh, what?

13
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,333
When Makina
saved my life,

14
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,541
it was then that I learned about
the existence of Shikabane.

15
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,166
I never knew about
any of that before.

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,083
Since then I've been
thinking a lot about death.

17
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,875
I've always thought
that death seemed scary.

18
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,250
But after all
this time thinking,

19
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,166
I've decided that there is
also a certain sweetness to it.

20
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,625
I wonder what it is
I'm searching for.

21
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,250
I'm rescuing you...
Makina...

22
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,708
We're not buying it.

23
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,166
Why not? They did a better job
on this one than the last.

24
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,625
You never told me what
that call was about earlier.

25
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,666
They said that a Shikabane
of Keisei Tagami

26
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,416
has appeared
somewhere nearby.

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,291
Is that possible?

28
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,416
It certainly isn't
in this case...

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,625
The guy was immune to
the kind of obsessions

30
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,916
that would cause
that to happen.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Then we're not gonna
bother with it, right?

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,500
I mean we still have to deal
with the traitor monk business.

33
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,833
Not quite...
We'll see...

34
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,541
I mean this obviously
has something to do

35
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,750
with Makina
Hoshimura's curse.

36
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,958
I don't want to, but
I have to say it...

37
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,708
Don't you think this
would work out better

38
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,375
if we walked away and
let Makina die...?

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,000
Because if we let things stay
as they are now, Ouri will--

40
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,833
Let the living worry about
the living, Akira...

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,875
We have only
one job to do...

42
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,375
And that's to kill
what we have to kill.

43
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,708
[Gun firing]

44
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,625
Oh, that's not nice.

45
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,750
You keep firing
your little gun...

46
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,625
You might
actually kill me!

47
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,500
So, Takamasa...

48
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:19,750
Tell me how I'm any different
from your beloved Itsuki here?

49
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,416
Word through the grapevine

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,291
is that this lovely young
lady died in a car accident...

51
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,291
Did you?

52
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,458
Yes, I did.

53
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,750
See, we're the same...!
I died in a car crash.

54
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,208
Did you know that,
by any chance?

55
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,666
Oh, I knew.

56
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,958
Then tell me something...

57
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,333
Why does she get to be
a Shikabane Hime

58
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,250
while I'm just put down
like a rabid dog?!

59
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,291
Answer me, Takamasa!

60
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,083
You are just another
Shikabane to me.

61
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,875
You should've made me
a Shikabane Hime...

62
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,291
or, I guess, a
Shikabane Prince!

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,083
[Laughter]

64
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,583
We can only make girls
within a certain age range

65
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,083
into Shikabane Hime.

66
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,583
It's a limited technique that's
been passed down among us.

67
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,583
Nothing more.

68
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,333
Well, it's not fair...

69
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,041
It's not fair
and you know it!

70
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,375
You're a murderer...
You've killed people...

71
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,250
That's why you're
being judged here.

72
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,958
And you're running around
killing all the Shikabane...

73
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,125
Who's gonna judge
you for that?

74
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,583
I couldn't forgive them
when it happened to me.

75
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,458
And I held this
grudge against anyone

76
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,833
behind the wheel of a car.

77
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,416
I followed my feelings.

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,291
That's all I did.

79
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,333
I mean, that's what you would
call someone's 'nature', right?

80
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,291
Everyone has his own nature.

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,625
I just followed mine.

82
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,583
You monks live hiding
your true nature,

83
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,583
which makes me
more human than you.

84
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,250
You can't deny it!

85
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,333
So I will be the one who
casts judgment today!

86
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,416
It's presumptuous of me
to call it my nature.

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,125
But yes, I have it.

88
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,750
And I do hide this strong
desire deep inside.

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,375
I don't know how many times I've
wanted to listen to my heart...

90
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,500
To do exactly
what it says.

91
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,916
That's what he's
talking about...

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,791
It's his own desire.

93
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,083
But I know
I can't give in...

94
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,250
so I suppress it.

95
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,750
I know that my heart isn't
the all or end of me.

96
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,708
This is how people live.

97
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,708
We all carry on while
resisting our nature.

98
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,375
That's what it
means "to live".

99
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,333
That's the point
behind it all.

100
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,791
You let your nature conquer
you, and you're no longer human.

101
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,041
Itsuki, kill him!

102
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,500
How could you
do this to me?

103
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,041
Tomoharu...

104
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,000
One day
I'll apologize...

105
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,750
when I join you in
the world beyond this.

106
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,583
Well, Takamasa...
How'd I do?

107
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,750
Just fine... And
you're pretty, Itsuki...

108
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,916
very pretty.

109
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,416
This is the truth behind
the Shikabane Hime, Ouri...

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,458
Know it.

111
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,833
Tomoharu has been
inactive for 4 years.

112
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,791
Someone must have
instigated him,

113
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,291
brought him
into the open...

114
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,875
Was it the traitor monk...

115
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,166
If so, that means the Seven
Stars are on the move...

116
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,541
Woo-hoo!

117
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,416
Look, it's my favorite
little pervert!

118
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,583
Ouri, hi!

119
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
Flesh...

120
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,000
You got Itsuki in your sights
for a little booby grabbing?

121
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,875
[Laughter]

122
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,791
Looks like the situation
here is all wrapped up.

123
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,375
Good -
we found you...

124
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,125
I wanted to let you know that
Makina has been taken back

125
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,583
to the head temple!

126
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,291
Because of what's
happening with her curse?

127
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,958
Yeah, but...

128
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,833
Honda left a message that a
Shikabane resembling Keisei

129
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,000
had appeared and some
monks went missing.

130
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,500
Then I'm going back
to Mount Goryo.

131
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,416
I'll ride with you.

132
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Ouri...

133
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,666
I don't know what's going on,
but Makina is a Shikabane Hime.

134
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,250
She isn't human.

135
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,583
Don't forget that.

136
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,500
Ever.

137
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,791
What's the matter, Makina?

138
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,458
Why are you running away?

139
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,375
Makina, come back
here, please....

140
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,625
Mother, I missed
you so much...

141
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,041
This ecstasy
is unreal...

142
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,750
Inspectors...?!

143
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,166
What is this?

144
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,541
Happiness...

145
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,541
Right now they're
all experiencing

146
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,416
their greatest happiness.

147
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,541
They get to experience
this emotion, relive it,

148
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,458
and then they die
when it peaks.

149
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,041
There's someone I know

150
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,375
who just adores the power of
release these people experience

151
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
during such moments.

152
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,583
Death is the
greatest happiness.

153
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:52,125
And I want to relive that
happiness as much as I can.

154
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,875
Don't worry, Makina...

155
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,958
That's not the one you
have to worry about.

156
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,750
Your opponent
out here... is me.

157
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,750
Makina,
what's wrong?

158
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,875
You're not Keisei.

159
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,125
Not true.
Of course, I'm Keisei...

160
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,125
I'm Keisei's
Shikabane.

161
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,291
Don't you recognize that?

162
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,458
You're a liar!

163
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,208
I understand.
You can't shoot me.

164
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
You're not Keisei.

165
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you want to know why I became
a Shikabane after I died...?

166
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,625
I know you do,
Makina.

167
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,375
It was my regrets...

168
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,583
My deep obsessions...

169
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,208
The desire
to see you...

170
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,625
You heard me
right, Makina...

171
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,375
I'm in love with you.

172
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,291
Don't come near me!

173
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,958
You're not him...

174
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,833
How beautiful it is...

175
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,500
something so strong
falling apart so swiftly.

176
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,583
Simply exquisite...

177
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,958
Makina... You can
always change, too.

178
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,416
Hey...

179
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,750
This fella's not
gonna be of any help.

180
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,666
Ouri...

181
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,166
Sadahiro... Akira...

182
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,291
Hey Rika...
This is them right?

183
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,666
What are you
two doing here?

184
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,000
You're Sadahiro Mibu.

185
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,583
Tagami and you contracted
at the same time...

186
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,625
But I heard that you had
left this all behind you

187
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,708
and returned
to secular life.

188
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,625
Then I'd appreciate you
keeping it that way.

189
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,166
I know Makina's gotta be
around here somewhere...

190
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,875
And I heard there was a
Shikabane of Brother...

191
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,000
No, he'd never
become a Shikabane.

192
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,166
But how do you know that?!

193
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,250
Listen to me, kid.

194
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,000
You just need to get out
of here...

195
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,083
Walk away. Forget everything
you've ever heard

196
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,375
about Makina Hoshimura
or the Kougon Sect.

197
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,416
Forget all of this
insanity you've seen...

198
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,458
It's not too late for you
to live an ordinary life.

199
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,208
That's impossible! I can't
forget the things I've seen!

200
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,333
Listen, you idiot! I don't give
a crap if you think you can't.

201
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,916
Just do it!

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
People live their entire lives
by focusing on one or two things

203
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,916
to motivate them...!

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,583
So just try to be happy
and live like that!

205
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,541
Worst advice
I've ever heard.

206
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,208
Go, Ouri.
You have to go now...

207
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,333
You can get
through to Makina.

208
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,500
I know you can
if you hurry!

209
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,416
Well, you're still her
contracted monk, aren't you?!

210
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,041
I have the feeling

211
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,125
you're misunderstanding
this situation, lady.

212
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,541
My name is Rika Aragami.

213
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,791
The granddaughter of
Aragami's old lady...

214
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,375
That certainly makes
this interesting.

215
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,041
[Gun firing]

216
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,083
Sojo Takamine believes that
some of the Inspectors

217
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,333
including Honda are taking
questionable action

218
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,750
under Gon-Dai-Sojo
Shiou's orders.

219
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,666
Gon-Dai-Sojo is trying to
eliminate the Shikabane Hime

220
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,250
in an attempt to retain
power for himself...

221
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,583
But he's keeping
one in particular

222
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,208
on a very tight leash.

223
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,500
As well as her contracted monk,
and not to kill Shikabane,

224
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,666
but to kill people!

225
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,958
You probably won't believe
me when I tell you...

226
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,916
but the only reason I'm here is
to kill the Shikabane of Keisei.

227
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,166
Look at that...
A pretty red balloon!

228
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,458
Don't touch that thing!

229
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,041
Uh, what?

230
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,875
Hold on!

231
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,458
This is one of the
Seven Stars' curses.

232
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,958
It grows as
it possesses humans

233
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,458
and collects
their happy feelings.

234
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,916
Akira...
we're leaving.

235
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,666
Saki!

236
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,250
Ouri, it's you!

237
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,833
Makina!
Where are you?!

238
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,208
Hey! Makina!

239
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,208
Where are you?

240
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,250
Stop all this nonsense.

241
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,666
Come on out of your
little hiding place!

242
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,458
I'll make you beautiful...

243
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,833
Like you've never known...

244
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,625
It's not Keisei...
It's not Keisei...

245
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,333
Makina!

246
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,416
Come out!

247
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,625
It's not Keisei...

248
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,125
It's not Keisei...

249
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,541
There you are...

250
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,833
And such an obvious place.

251
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,125
No...

252
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,291
I love you, Makina...

253
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,125
I always have...

254
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
I love you so much.

255
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,166
Please no, Keisei...

256
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,833
You son of a bitch...

257
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:29,250
You think I'll let you get
between me and my Makina...?

258
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,833
Don't stand there and
pretend to be my brother!

259
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,291
You alright?

260
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,000
Don't hurt him...

261
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,750
What are you
talking about...?!

262
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,041
Keisei would never
talk like that

263
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,416
and he'd certainly
never try to kill you.

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,625
This guy's probably just
one of the Seven Stars

265
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,000
who's pretending
to be Brother...

266
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,166
Don't you think
I know that?!

267
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,791
It doesn't matter to me.

268
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,500
I still can't hurt him...

269
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,291
I just can't...

270
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,416
I won't...

271
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,791
I can change.

272
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,083
I can...

273
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,000
I will continue
to grow more beautiful...

274
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,625
Now what do you fellas say we
get back to the task at hand?

275
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,375
Makina, stand up.
We should leave.

276
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,791
So you, uh...

277
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,166
You still consider yourself
to be my contracted monk?

278
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,083
I do.

279
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,458
Okay... And I assume this is
what you want out of life...

280
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,791
But I wonder if you still
do after I tell you this...

281
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,083
When Keisei was dying...

282
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,791
In those horrible moments
after he passed the bond to you

283
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,541
and you lost
consciousness...

284
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,041
He said something to me.

285
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,416
Please, please don't cry...

286
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,375
I want to see you smile.

287
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,375
In those fleeting seconds

288
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,375
I realized that
this was Keisei's regret.

289
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,916
I feared that
if I didn't smile,

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,333
the fact would twist
into his obsession;

291
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,083
that he'd
become a Shikabane.

292
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
So I smiled at him.

293
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,458
I gave him what he wanted...

294
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,208
I did what I had to do...

295
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,625
I wanted to keep Keisei
from becoming a Shikabane,

296
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,458
so I kept him
from living on.

297
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:11,416
In the end the one who
really killed Keisei was me!

298
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
It's okay...

299
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,250
because you wanted
to do it for him.

300
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,958
You loved him
that much...

301
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,416
Enough to send him
down the path he wanted.

302
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,458
I understand...
more than you know.

303
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,708
Maybe it's true...

304
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,458
Actually I know
it to be true.

305
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,000
I loved Keisei
so very much...

306
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,458
And I love him
even more now...

307
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,791
That's the one reason

308
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:54,166
that I couldn't accept the
contract with you, Ouri.

309
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,541
I know that
I killed Keisei...

310
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,041
but to forget about him

311
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,833
and move on to a new
contracted monk isn't in me...

312
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,625
I couldn't forgive
myself for that.

313
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,666
You don't have
to forget him.

314
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,916
If he's going
to live on...

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,541
then you and I...

316
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,291
Have to stay true to the memory
of his life, not his death...

317
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,250
A person's heart isn't the all
or end of who they are, Makina.

318
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,541
That may be true for people,
Ouri - but not for me.

319
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,083
Makes sense I guess...
I am a Shikabane.

320
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,791
You can keep
the bond with Brother

321
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,958
even while you're
contracted with me.

322
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,125
I won't tell anyone.

323
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,833
I'll hide your heart.

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,291
Sorry, kid, but
that's not possible.

325
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,916
Sadahiro...

326
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,166
Sadahiro... Didn't he
and Keisei know each other?

327
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,333
Unless she breaks the
bond with Keisei...

328
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,583
the stagnated Rune will
always remain within her.

329
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,375
Her regrets towards Keisei
will become a curse...

330
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,291
and that will
make you suffer.

331
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,541
Contracting with a cursed
Shikabane Hime is impossible.

332
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,333
It's not a curse, Akira.

333
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,791
And how's that?

334
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
It's just a tie between
Brother and Makina.

335
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,958
I won't let anyone
call it a curse.

336
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,791
Then what are you
going to do, Ouri?!

337
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,291
I'm telling you
it's not a curse.

338
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,875
It's their power!

339
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,166
Brother, Makina, and myself
all have these powers...

340
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,708
We put all of that together and
we can defeat the Seven Stars!

341
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,708
That's just how
I feel about it.

342
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,416
Hey, Makina,

343
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,583
where are you?!

344
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,500
Come on out!

345
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,083
He really does
a terrible Keisei.

346
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,750
That injury...
it should've killed him.

347
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,291
He's switched
bodies again.

348
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,708
The bastard's name is
Ena of the Seven Stars...

349
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,541
He has a curse that
allows him to switch

350
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,291
from one Shikabane's body
to another at his own will.

351
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,333
By doing this, he thinks
that he's achieving

352
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,166
some kind of beautiful
evolution.

353
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
No, you can't
take him on!

354
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,791
I know
I can do it...

355
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,500
I've stabbed
Brother once before.

356
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,541
I can do it again.

357
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,916
You were being
manipulated before!

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,208
That was
Ena's power then!

359
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,708
Every time I think of it,
it makes me want to throw up.

360
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,041
It'll be the same

361
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,666
even if it's a Shikabane
with Brother's face...

362
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,416
no one is going to have
to feel the things

363
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
that I'm forced to feel...

364
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,208
Makina and Sadahiro don't
have to know anything...

365
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,666
This is my burden
alone to bear.

366
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
Is that really
the case...?

367
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,875
I had no idea this face
meant so much to you...

368
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,750
Why don't I show you
a few more of them?

369
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,250
How about this...?

370
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,708
Which Brother do you
like the most, Ouri?

371
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,166
[Music]

372
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,250
In this world, there is
a certain kind of ecstasy

373
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,750
that can only be gained by
making some else miserable.

374
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:45,166
Everyone is possessed by
a "Monster Named Happiness."
