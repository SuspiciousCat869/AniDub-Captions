1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,458
[Music]

2
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,375
The two of you
can handle it!

3
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,708
Makina needs me!

4
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,958
You saw it, right?

5
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,583
Makina Hoshimura's
aberration...

6
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,250
I told you.

7
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,291
I realized that my Shikabane
Hime is an aberration,

8
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,125
and accepted it.

9
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,000
Where we're going, I'll be
able to prove it to you.

10
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,708
Dammit!

11
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,250
Takamasa!

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,666
Oh, my...

13
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,291
This isn't
really my taste...

14
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,750
but...

15
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,166
The beautiful, tortured look
on that Shikabane Hime's face

16
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,833
will be well worth it.

17
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,416
I'm really looking
forward to it.

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,916
Now then...
it's finished.

19
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,000
If I were to kill all of you
people, Keisei would feel sad,

20
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,083
so I'm being obedient.
That's all.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,208
Oh...
Ah, Umehara!

22
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,416
He's come
to pick you up.

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,208
Inspector Honda...

24
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,083
We'll send her to the
purification chamber again...

25
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,958
That's a direct order
from the Gon-Dai-Sojo.

26
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,166
It's the Dai-Sojo's
own handwriting.

27
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,458
It seals all forms
of defilement.

28
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,375
Defilement...?
Well, if you say so...

29
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,375
What're you planning
on doing with her...?

30
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,250
Are you gonna throw her out
with the trash this time?

31
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,958
You sure hate me,
don't you?

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Where's he taking Ouri
at a time like this...?

33
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,250
I sure hope the Genpaku
knows what he's doing...

34
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,416
I thought, that if the title
Genpaku is only given

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,375
to the strongest
monk then...

36
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,833
I should pick him
to be my contracted monk...

37
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,916
Seriously...?

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,166
You seriously
weren't told anything?

39
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,791
Is this about the
temple by any chance?

40
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,416
Unfortunately for her...

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,583
by then there wasn't time for
Itsuki to start looking around

42
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,708
for a new contracted monk.

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,458
Once you've been
given a contract...

44
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,333
It's an extremely difficult
matter to have it changed...

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,000
You know that.

46
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,166
Yes... You have to find a way
to break the bond between you,

47
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,791
just like with Makina.

48
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,583
I was thrown into
the whole thing...

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,791
before I had the slightest clue
about what was expected of me.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,833
What's the matter...?

51
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,000
You came
to kill me, right?

52
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,875
I can't help it...
This is my first time.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
What's wrong,
Shikabane killer?

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
So... how was that?

55
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,875
From now on,
this is what-...

56
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,666
Huh?

57
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,500
Hold on a second.
Try not to move.

58
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,000
Why would I try to move?

59
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
There! See?

60
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,666
See? I did okay. Right?

61
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,958
Your injuries are much
worse than mine...

62
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,166
I mean...

63
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,333
Don't worry. I told you
I died, right?

64
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,750
It was a bus accident.

65
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
You mean...
that was true?

66
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,291
Of course it is...

67
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,291
Even after I've taken all
that time to explain it...

68
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,166
You still have trouble
believing me, don't you?

69
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,541
Shikabane are corpses that,

70
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,708
because of intense
regrets or obsessions,

71
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,333
stay animate
even after death.

72
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,083
After that day
I became a Shikabane.

73
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,333
But the Kougan sect allowed
me to become a Shikabane

74
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,125
that hunts others
like me...

75
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,250
They made me what's
called a Shikabane Hime,

76
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,500
a killer of immortals.

77
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,458
One hundred and eight.

78
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,416
That's how many Shikabane I
have to kill to go to heaven.

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,250
And since I want to be
able to go to heaven

80
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
as soon as possible...

81
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,375
I chose the strongest
contracted monk.

82
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,333
Which means you naturally chose
the strongest warrior monk...

83
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,916
the Genpaku.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,375
I never imagined that you'd be a
rookie who didn't know anything.

85
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,916
I guess not.

86
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,291
You're not going alone...

87
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,333
I have to be the
one to kill him.

88
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,083
But... you still aren't
used to fighting?

89
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,458
No, but I know how
it feels to die.

90
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,750
How it felt when my bones
pierced my organs...

91
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,375
when my body began to get cold
because of all the bleeding...

92
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,166
I can remember
every detail.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,041
But... you're not
cut out for this.

94
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,083
I'm sorry I got
you involved.

95
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,791
This kind of life will
end up killing you.

96
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,416
What is this...

97
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,958
why aren't my...
legs moving?

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,041
Just couldn't stay
away, could you?

99
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,458
Do you really think
you can kill me?

100
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,791
What?

101
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,291
You're weak. You're just
an ordinary Shikabane...

102
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,625
I'll eat you.

103
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,958
I'll eat you.

104
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,333
I'll eat you!

105
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,208
I killed him...

106
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,333
My first...

107
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,333
My first one...

108
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,750
Die one more time!

109
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,500
When I chose to become
a Shikabane Hime,

110
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,541
I thought that I could
accomplish my goal quickly...

111
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,916
that I'd be able
to fight monsters

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,583
since I was
already dead...

113
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,291
But now...

114
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,958
faced with it again...

115
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,750
I'm scared.

116
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,583
What?!

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
Takamasa!

118
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
You son of a bitch!

119
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,166
Shikabane!

120
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,666
Over here!

121
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,375
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy, will ya...?

122
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,625
Not too hard...

123
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,916
This really hurts,
you know...

124
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,750
Of course, it does...

125
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,708
But it's gotta be
better than dying.

126
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,833
I didn't realize it
would be this painful...

127
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,541
but you've got a point...

128
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,166
I guess dying
would be worse.

129
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,583
What made you...
decide to help me?

130
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,875
I found my father's
old bow...

131
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,916
It makes me wonder if all
of this was the reason

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
for the archery and
Kendo lessons he...

133
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,000
made me take when
I was younger.

134
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,666
What...?

135
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,583
No, I was
referring to...

136
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,708
What else could
I have done...?

137
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,000
I couldn't just stand
there and watch you...

138
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,208
I couldn't let you die...

139
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,666
That's nuts... you know I'm
already dead, silly.

140
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,208
Yeah, well to me you still
look like just an ordinary girl.

141
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,208
Idiot...

142
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,375
Am I?

143
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,750
[Laughter]

144
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,583
Congrats on your
first victory...

145
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,166
Only one hundred
seven to go.

146
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,583
This was our first
victory together.

147
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,666
Hey, Takamasa!

148
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,666
You know that's
my hurt shoulder.

149
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,708
Look over there!

150
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,166
Hm?

151
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,375
Everyone, I'd like to
introduce Itsuki Yamagami...

152
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,500
She just transferred
to our school today.

153
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,041
Are you seeing this...?!

154
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,333
Okay, I've decided...

155
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,541
I'm TOTALLY gonna make
a move on this girl...

156
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,458
Oh, no, here she comes...

157
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,625
Every man for himself.

158
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,416
How are you today?

159
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,041
I'm Tomoharu Kishibe.

160
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,875
If you like, I'll fill
you in on this school...

161
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,125
The Kougan Sect creates
family registries for us

162
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,041
since there are times
when we'll need them...

163
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,833
like for example,
undercover investigations.

164
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,250
No. No, not that.

165
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,125
Why my school?

166
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,583
I heard that the bond becomes
stronger if I stay

167
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,541
at the contracted monk's side
as much as possible...

168
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,750
Is that a problem?

169
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,250
No, it's not going
to be a problem at all.

170
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,416
That's wonderful!

171
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Now we can work
hard together!

172
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,500
Come on, treat me
to some ice cream!

173
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,750
Why would I do that?

174
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,208
At first, while it might've
felt a little overwhelming,

175
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,458
I learned that life between
a Shikabane Hime and her

176
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,500
newly contracted monk
is exciting...

177
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,791
But between Itsuki and me, the
normal everday side of things

178
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,583
-especially after
she moved in with me--

179
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,500
was even better.

180
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,500
We were just a pair of kids,
enjoying life to the fullest...

181
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,125
I think I know now...

182
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,458
Hm?

183
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,458
Why I became a Shikabane.

184
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,000
Itsuki...

185
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,291
When I was still alive
I wasn't doing much of anything

186
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,875
with my life.

187
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,708
The fun-loving high school
girl life that you see

188
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,125
in books and
on television...

189
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,791
never seemed
to show up for me...

190
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,458
no matter
how long I waited.

191
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,083
I think...
I wanted...

192
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,750
just to be able
to live more.

193
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,083
And also...
to love someone...

194
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,416
What's that?

195
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,083
Never mind!

196
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,708
I'm sorry!
Are you okay, Takamasa?

197
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,041
Yeah...

198
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,166
Hey... Remember
how I said the reason

199
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,958
I chose you as my
contracted monk was

200
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,333
so I could get into heaven
as quickly as possible?

201
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,833
Uh-huh.

202
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,958
Well now, I feel like I actually
want to stay in this world

203
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,458
as long as
I possibly can...

204
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,875
That's kinda
strange, isn't it?

205
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,250
It seems to me that
all you're really doing

206
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,041
is bragging about
your love life.

207
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,791
Wrong!

208
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,333
You're just inventing things
in that head of yours...

209
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,708
I don't know whatever wild
fantasies your imagination

210
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,083
is coming up with, but I can
tell you they didn't happen.

211
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,916
What do you mean?

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,458
Around that time, I went into
seclusion up on the mountain

213
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,958
with Master Umehara...

214
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,583
He told me exactly
the same thing

215
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,375
that I told
you earlier, Ouri.

216
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,708
Which is...

217
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,333
The girl before
you isn't human.

218
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,708
She's a Shikabane Hime.

219
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,416
Are you done training
for the day, too, Itsuki?

220
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,791
Don't do it.

221
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,250
Master, it's you...
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,958
Did I not make myself clear
before, Takamasa...?

223
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,583
You are on
a dangerous path.

224
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,416
Itsuki is a
Shikabane Hime.

225
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,000
You must stop acknowledging
her as though she were human.

226
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,125
But Master... Why is that?

227
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,833
Shikabane Hime are
aberrations...

228
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,833
Even if they look human, that
is not their true nature.

229
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,958
A contracted monk who
cannot understand

230
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,291
that will certainly die.

231
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,791
But Itsuki is just
an ordinary girl...

232
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,541
I mean, at least she's trying
to live as an ordinary girl.

233
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,250
Isn't that her
true nature?

234
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,625
Listen, Takamasa... There was
once another contracted monk

235
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,708
named Akasha Shishidou...

236
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,791
He also...

237
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,166
Seriously?!

238
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,375
You seriously haven't told
her your feelings yet?!

239
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,208
It's complicated.

240
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,500
I don't know how long
I can be with her, either,

241
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,958
so...

242
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:19,000
She'll have to go
to heaven some day.

243
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,000
Then what better reason
to cherish the time

244
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,708
the two of you
have together now?

245
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,166
Hey, I don't know the
details of your situation...

246
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,333
but if you don't know how
much time you've got...

247
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,416
you need to tell her
how you feel about her.

248
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,083
But the Master
also said...

249
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,500
Master...? C'mon, you're
just making excuses.

250
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,208
What do you mean excuses?

251
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,291
The truth is that you're
afraid of being turned down

252
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,416
when you tell her,
aren't you?

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,458
Are you stupid or what?

254
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,625
Wha... What?!

255
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
Ah, dude, give
me a break...

256
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,750
You mean to tell me that
you haven't noticed

257
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,833
how often that girl
gives you the eye?

258
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,083
Huh?

259
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,583
Ever since the day she
came to this school...

260
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,541
You're the only one she
wants anything to do with.

261
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,750
So much so that I,
the master of love,

262
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,416
have had no effect on her.

263
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,708
Tomoharu...

264
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,916
Ah... good!

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,750
I thought you guys
had already gone home.

266
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,250
See, there's
the eye, dude...

267
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,291
What?

268
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,125
What? What is it?

269
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,875
Well, I hope the two of
you have a great weekend!

270
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,916
Did you say you were going
out of town, Tomoharu?

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Yeah, I'm going to my
parent's hometown...

272
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,208
Seriously, all
we're going to do

273
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,208
is visit all my ancestors'
old graves or something.

274
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,208
See ya.

275
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,041
That was the last
time I saw Tomoharu.

276
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,875
On his way to his
parent's hometown,

277
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,666
the car he and
his family were in

278
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,583
was hit by a minor
driving recklessly

279
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,416
and fell off a cliff.

280
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,458
Once they were found,

281
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,125
the bodies of all four family
members were unrecognizable.

282
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,333
Takamasa.

283
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,083
That's it!

284
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,666
Huh?

285
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,875
Shirae!

286
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,750
Inspector Shirae,
what happened?

287
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
What're you
asking him for...?

288
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,125
Didn't you just
see what happened?

289
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,208
Briefing us on the situation
is his responsibility!

290
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,833
Guardian Sougi...

291
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,583
[Coughing]

292
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,375
Our suspicions have
been confirmed...

293
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,875
It's the same Shikabane that
was identified four years ago

294
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
and went into hiding.

295
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,291
His ability to freely
manipulate car engines

296
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,666
using the curse
hasn't changed...

297
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,791
It's the Shikabane
of Tomoharu Kishibi.

298
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,791
Tomoharu... He's the one
you mentioned earlier...

299
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,750
He became a Shikabane
4 years ago.

300
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,000
First of all, the guys in the
car that caused his family

301
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,750
to get into an accident...

302
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,250
Were killed
one after another.

303
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,166
But it didn't end there.

304
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,375
Whenever he saw young
people behind the wheel,

305
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,750
he'd take control of their
car and steer it headlong

306
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,250
into a fatal collision -

307
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,208
one that echoed the crash
his family perished in.

308
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,416
But that was
4 years ago...

309
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,583
It's one after another
with you Kougan sect people...

310
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,250
You sure work hard.

311
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,875
But I have way too much energy
being that I've been asleep

312
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,083
for going on
four years now.

313
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,541
Huh?

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,833
Hey... Takamasa...

315
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,458
and if it isn't
little Itsuki...

316
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,458
Well, well.

317
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,125
Tomoharu...

318
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,375
The lovestruck contracted monk
and his Shikabane Hime...

319
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,208
This is quite the reunion,
wouldn't you say?

320
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,416
I gotta tell ya...

321
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,333
If I'd known back then
what I know now...

322
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:36,291
But thankfully I met someone who
gave me quite the education...

323
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,291
who told me about
the Kougan sect...

324
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,208
and about Shikabane Hime.

325
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,041
So, Itsuki... Since
you're a Shikabane, too...

326
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,000
that makes us the
same, doesn't it?

327
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,541
Tomoharu... Following
our philosophy...

328
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,000
I must kill you.

329
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,708
Do you think you
can this time?

330
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,375
What happened
to those scars?

331
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,125
The ones from
4 years ago...

332
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,125
This may be your last chance,
so don't screw it up!

333
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,583
What...
What is this?

334
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,833
What is he doing?

335
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,458
Takamasa...
Itsuki...

336
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,416
Tomoharu!
Stop this!

337
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,416
What... What happened
to me, Takamasa?

338
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,000
You died
in a car accident.

339
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,250
What are you
talking about, man?

340
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,666
That's crazy!

341
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,166
I was... in the car
with my parents

342
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,083
and my little sister
and we were all driving

343
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,666
to visit my
Grandma's house.

344
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,083
Then all of a sudden,

345
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,875
we saw a bright flash in
front of us on the road...

346
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,083
Wait... those idiots
drove right at us

347
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,916
and they were blocking
the entire road...

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,833
So Dad tried turning
the wheel and...

349
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,666
We were...
we were all killed...

350
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,875
by those idiots...
Stupid kids...!

351
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,708
They were driving
too damn fast!

352
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,625
None of that has anything
to do with these people!

353
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,625
They're not any different
than the others.

354
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,291
All they care about is how
fast they can drive...

355
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,291
And those bitches that like
to watch and cheer them on

356
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,833
are all the same.

357
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,000
It's more important
to them to show off

358
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,250
and try to make
themselves look cool...

359
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,666
no matter who else is on the
road It feels good to kill them!

360
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,416
Tomoharu, how could you...

361
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,375
Look... It's too late.

362
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,791
Takamasa!

363
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,291
What do you think
you're doing, Itsuki?

364
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,333
Takamasa,
give me the order!

365
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,000
The order? For what?

366
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,541
It was the same order
I had given to her

367
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,833
so many times before...

368
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,041
"Kill the Shikabane."

369
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,000
But I didn't
really understand...

370
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,583
Knowing that he was a
Shikabane, somewhere in my mind,

371
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,833
the reality of death
felt distant...

372
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,291
Takamasa!. Please...
give me the order!

373
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,375
Itsuki... I can't.

374
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,333
I won't... tell the girl that
I've fallen in love with...

375
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,208
To kill the only person that
I ever called my best friend!

376
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,250
Itsuki, please...
I just can't...

377
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,416
But...

378
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,875
I can't bring myself
to let you do that!

379
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,375
Takamasa...!

380
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,166
Why don't I just
kill the both of you?!

381
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,708
Watch out!

382
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,916
Itsuki!

383
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,916
Please don't look
at me, Takamasa...

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,041
I don't want you to
see me like this...

385
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,083
Itsuki?

386
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,708
You monster!

387
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,125
What the hell?!

388
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,958
Itsuki?

389
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,833
Help me!

390
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,500
Was it that I didn't want
Itsuki to kill Tomoharu?

391
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,583
Looking back at it now,
I'm sure that Takamasa

392
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:59,166
was simply incapable of seeing
me as Itsuki at the time.

393
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,833
In those moments,
her form...

394
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,791
My form...

395
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,708
Takamasa...

396
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,583
Takamasa!

397
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,333
Takamasa, I'm sorry!

398
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,083
It was all my doing...

399
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,333
That's not true...

400
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,666
The sins were mine
and mine alone.

401
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,875
I couldn't understand that
Shikabane Hime were aberrations.

402
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,291
I considered them
to be like humans.

403
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:32,125
It was nothing but a
punishment for my mistakes.

404
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,541
I can now say...

405
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,291
Itsuki,
kill Tomoharu.

406
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,750
Okay!

407
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,916
What's the matter?

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,250
Sir, look!

409
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,041
Tagami?!

410
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,416
[Music]

411
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,833
You know, contrary
to what you expect,

412
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,166
life as a human can
be most inconvenient...

413
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,541
Try as you might,
however you choose,

414
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,208
you can't escape them...

415
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,333
"Nature and Regrets."
