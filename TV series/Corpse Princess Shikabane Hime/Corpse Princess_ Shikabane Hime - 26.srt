[Music]

2
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,625
Cut it out, guys!

3
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,500
Hanagami's coming!

4
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,041
That's not my name...
It's Kagami!

5
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,041
That's enough.

6
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,625
Yaay! You
got in trouble!

7
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,416
You got in trouble!

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,875
Home sweet home!

9
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,500
I'd like to see you try...

10
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,166
But I think we both know
you'd be nothing without me.

11
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,875
You don't have what it takes
to make it on your own.

12
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,000
You think this
is a game...?

13
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,458
You think I like
repeating myself...?

14
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,583
Do you?

15
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,416
Please, just stop...
I said I'm sorry.

16
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,166
You belong to me...

17
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,791
I'll do what I want...
And I'll stop when I want.

18
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,708
The sooner you
learn that--

19
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,625
Bitch!

20
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,666
You're gonna let them
get away with it?

21
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,666
Shouta wrote "Hanagami"
in big black marker

22
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,416
on the back of my
favorite shirt...!

23
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,750
I'm so pissed...!
Its ruined!

24
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,958
You know how much
I love that shirt!

25
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,083
There's no way
I can wear it now!

26
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,625
I mean, would you wear
clothes like that?

27
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,875
Minai Ruo...

28
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,166
The man she murdered
was her boyfriend...

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,125
Afterward, she threw herself
off their high rise balcony...

30
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,166
However, this didn't
prevent her from walking

31
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,333
away from the incident.

32
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,125
This corpse still lives.

33
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,375
A Shikabane... right.

34
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,958
There is still some time before
her transformation is complete.

35
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:27,625
Keisei... It's my understanding
that you know this woman, right?

36
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,375
She looks familiar...
I don't know.

37
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,833
Well, think...

38
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,625
She worked at a store in front
of the train station...

39
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,208
uh... the place is...

40
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,333
A cosplay pub.

41
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,000
Cosplay...?

42
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,625
Oh, yeah. I haven't the first
idea as to what people ever do

43
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,000
at a place like that...

44
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,666
I can't say that
I've been to one...

45
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,333
I mean, what's
the point...?

46
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,291
It's a complete
mystery to me.

47
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,875
There's no use pretending,
we found this with her.

48
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,375
Tell me, Keisei...

49
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,541
Do you make it a habit of
leaving your business card

50
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,166
in these kinds of bars?

51
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,166
No... You've got this
whole thing wrong.

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,666
I was there on a social
studies field trip.

53
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,041
Yeah...

54
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,416
Wait...

55
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,750
I wonder if I have
met her before?

56
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,541
Whether you know
you have or not,

57
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,416
there's certainly
a bond between you two.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
What are you getting at?

59
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,291
My point is that
it's come time for you

60
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,666
to make a contract
with a Shikabane Hime.

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,291
I'm doing fine.

62
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,833
Without a Shikabane Hime
to fight alongside you,

63
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,958
your abilities
are limited.

64
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,666
Please...
I'm handling myself well.

65
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,666
Don't let what happened with
Akasha fuel your actions.

66
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,083
Have it your way then...

67
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,125
We have no choice but
to deal with this woman

68
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
like any other Shikabane.

69
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,916
Kamika, would you
perform the ritual?

70
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,666
No, don't do it!

71
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,083
Wait, Guardian Takamine...
Let me be the one.

72
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,333
Isaki...

73
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,041
I, too,
am a Dai-Sozu...

74
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,000
I can also make a contract
with a Shikabane Hime...

75
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,833
If I'm allowed to do
that with this woman,

76
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,125
we'll be of great use
to Senior Tagami.

77
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,666
Contracting with a
Shikabane is no easy task...

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,166
A monk must posses
a bond and great virtue.

79
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,791
But we already
have a bond...

80
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,041
She and I have spoken in
town before on a matter

81
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,833
very personal to her...

82
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,625
If I recall...
Correctly...

83
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,958
She asked for some advice

84
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,750
in dealing with the man
she was living with.

85
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,916
They weren't getting along...

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,583
She stopped me because
of my appearance,

87
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,750
thinking I was someone
she could trust.

88
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,208
I believe that's
how it went.

89
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,291
I was concerned so we met
several times to talk.

90
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,666
Very well...

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,458
To me it sounds like
you couldn't ask

92
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,250
for a tighter
bond with this girl.

93
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,833
Sir...

94
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,625
A contract
shall be created...

95
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,541
All right...?
Keisei?

96
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,875
Yes.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,250
My mind
is unlike others.

98
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,916
And my body is nothing
but that of a corpse...

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,916
Until either happiness
or death separates us,

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,458
my allegiance I pledge to
the decree and sectarian.

101
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,750
Contract.

102
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,583
Wake up, Minai.

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,625
What's for...
breakfast?

104
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,083
How stupid are you?

105
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,500
You're dead, remember?

106
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,083
What dead person
would eat?

107
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,916
What kind of skills
do you possess...?

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,958
Strength will only
get you so far...

109
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,166
If you're unable to
utilize a weapon...

110
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
You won't be of any
use in protecting me.

111
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
Protecting you...?
But why?

112
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,708
It's a Shikabane Hime's duty
to protect her contracted monk.

113
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,000
I guess...
I know some...

114
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,291
I can box a little.

115
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,250
Wait, are you talking
about boxercising...?

116
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,208
The weight loss program?

117
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
I got beat up a whole
lot when I was a kid...

118
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,041
I had to figure out how
to work my way out of it.

119
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,708
It's no surprise
you ended up with a jerk

120
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,666
that beat you senseless...

121
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,875
Show me some of these
boxercing skills.

122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,125
Do it.

123
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,333
Show me what kind of
punch you've got in you.

124
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,333
You won't hurt me.

125
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,541
Now, do it.

126
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,583
You...
You stupid bitch!

127
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,541
What are you
waiting for, Minai?!

128
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,083
Attack him...!
Do it already!

129
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,291
Take him down!

130
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,458
I can't...
He's a person...

131
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,541
That's not a person...

132
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,958
It's a corpse...
A Shikabane...

133
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,375
one who couldn't die when
he should have like you!

134
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,666
Not fair...
I had no choice...

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,375
What gives you the right?

136
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
Isaki, No...

137
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,125
I almost got killed!

138
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,041
What the hell do I have a
Shikabane Hime for anyway!

139
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,750
Dammit...! Are you
even listening?!

140
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,875
That's enough...

141
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,875
This was her first
time fighting...

142
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,416
Lesson one...

143
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,333
You can't stop a Shikabane
unless you destroy the brain

144
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,541
or shred the body so
that it can't rebuild.

145
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,541
Pay attention to that.

146
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,166
Would you shut
your stomach up?!

147
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,250
Tell me you've been eating.

148
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,541
Uh...

149
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,416
Why would a deal
girl need food...?

150
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,041
He said that
I didn't need to eat.

151
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,666
Well, he's not lying...

152
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,541
A Shikabane Hime
can survive fine

153
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,333
as long as she receives enough
rune from her contracted monk...

154
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,375
But I bet you still
get hungry, though.

155
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,500
What's rune?

156
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,125
It's hard to explain...

157
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,541
Try to think of it as
a kind of bio-energy...

158
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,958
It flows into you via the bond
from your contracted monk.

159
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,125
You should see the bond.

160
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,333
A Shikabane Hime can see
a light flowing towards her

161
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,750
from her contracted monk.

162
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,333
That's the bond.

163
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,625
Can you see it?

164
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,333
This woman can't
seem to understand

165
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,375
such a difficult concept,
Keisei...

166
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,000
I've been saddled with
an unbelievable fool.

167
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,250
I dunno. What you're saying
sounds kinda weird to me.

168
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,625
Gon Sho Sojo Tagami
can't feel it...

169
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,375
He's almost certain
there is no bond

170
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,833
between Dai Sozu Isaki and
his Shikabane Hime, Minai.

171
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,375
Why not...?

172
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,666
The two of them made
a contract, didn't they?

173
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,166
Correct. But
something is failing.

174
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,166
He said...
It would appear

175
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,666
that the Shikabane Hime
isn't receiving rune.

176
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,416
Yeah, alright...
But what's that mean?

177
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,833
It means that she's
not a Shikabane Hime.

178
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,083
She's just a Shikabane that
happens to be harmless

179
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,708
by his side at all times...

180
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,958
We can never know

181
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,750
when she's going to turn
violent and rampage.

182
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,291
I thought the two of you...

183
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,708
Could investigate this
matter and get some answers.

184
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,000
Why not? I mean, we're
not here to target Shikabane.

185
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,375
Our job is to keep an eye on the
Shikabane Hime and their monks.

186
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,458
Come on...

187
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,166
We just got to this town
and already we're working.

188
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,125
A motorcycle?

189
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,708
That's right...
Before I died,

190
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,750
I'd gotten my
motorcycle license.

191
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,250
If I have a bike,

192
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,833
I think that fewer Shikabane
would get away from me.

193
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,083
You actually thought I'd
buy you a motorcycle...?

194
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,625
How thick are you?

195
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,416
I can't spend that kind of
money on a Shikabane Hime...

196
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,208
A motorcycle, food...
Get out of your own head.

197
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,583
Sorry...

198
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,833
What is it?

199
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,333
A Shikabane...
I think that might be one.

200
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,833
Hey, you!
Quick, get her!

201
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,875
Go get her,
Minai...! Hurry!

202
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,291
Get out of here.

203
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,125
A Shikabane...

204
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,083
Not a chance...
I'm Shikabane Hime.

205
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,125
See here.

206
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,416
My contracted monk isn't
far away from me right now.

207
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,583
With the rune that
I receive from him...

208
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,791
Any injuries I have will
heal and vanish in no time.

209
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,291
Now look at you...

210
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
You were walking right
alongside your contracted monk

211
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,416
when I shot...

212
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,958
And yet that bullet
wound of yours

213
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,666
shows no sign of healing...

214
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,125
Some Shikabane Hime you are.

215
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't understand.

216
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,916
There isn't a bond between
you and that monk...

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,166
You're nothing but another
Shikabane to kill...

218
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,958
I can't sit idly by and wait
for you to go on a rampage...

219
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,375
I have to do this...
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,750
So this...
is punishment.

221
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,333
Minai, where are you?!
Dammit!

222
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,625
Go Isaki...!
Get out of here now!

223
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Well, what happened
to the Shikabane?

224
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,041
It got away from me.

225
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,625
What happened?

226
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
We should lay off of them...

227
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,666
At least for a bit.

228
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,916
Something is...
Not right.

229
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,291
You should have told me
the second that it happened.

230
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,208
Sorry... I...

231
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,333
Now are you sure she said
she was a Shikabane Hime?

232
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,458
Yes... She also
mentioned something

233
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,458
about my injury not
healing right away.

234
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,208
Well, if you weren't such a dim
witted fool it would have...

235
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,125
It's that simple.

236
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh...

237
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,333
I see...

238
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,416
I guess.

239
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,625
A Shikabane Hime...

240
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,541
I wonder...

241
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,166
Listen...

242
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,458
I'd just consider everything
she said as a lie.

243
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,291
Isaki, I'm curious...

244
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,291
About what?

245
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,500
It's just that...

246
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,958
I mean, you do
know me, don't you?

247
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,875
You told them I asked you for
advice on the street one day...

248
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,500
But I don't
remember doing that.

249
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,791
Even you're
beginning to doubt

250
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,458
that the contract between
the two of us is real...

251
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,166
Great.

252
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,416
It's not true.

253
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,833
I lied...

254
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,625
But the Guardian can never
learn of my deception

255
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,083
What would happen
if he did?

256
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,958
They'd separate us...
Who knows what else.

257
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,666
But before then...

258
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,833
Minai...
I need you.

259
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,833
Give me your hand.

260
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,375
You need me...?

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,583
What're you doing
here, Sadahiro?

262
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,625
Akira... Thought you
trusted me more than that...

263
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,541
I'm a little
disappointed in you...

264
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,541
Whatever.

265
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,041
Well, I don't...

266
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,500
So here's what we'll do...

267
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,333
You investigate Isaki

268
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,166
and I'll
investigate Minai...

269
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,666
Try not to get
them mixed up.

270
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
Just listen to me...

271
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,750
In this place, Isaki used to...
In this town, inai used to...

272
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,500
You'll understand why I lied
when I tell you why I did it...

273
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,250
There's a Shikabane I've had
my eye on for some time now...

274
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,791
He's been masquerading as a
monk at one of our temples.

275
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,625
Above all else, the Kougon
Sect fears scandal...

276
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,416
So they leave him alone...

277
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,291
Its time we stop him...

278
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,625
We're going to take care
of him on our own.

279
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,166
There.
He's in the back.

280
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,458
He's not here.

281
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,833
What do you mean?!

282
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,708
Shikabane...?

283
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,666
Wait a minute...
Shuuji...

284
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,333
Shuuji?!... What the hell
are you doing here?!

285
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,458
What are you up to?!

286
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,541
Hello, Brother.

287
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,083
It's exactly what
you think it is...

288
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,333
That was my
family's home...

289
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,833
That man was my
older brother...

290
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,916
I wanted you to do
what I couldn't...

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,458
I wanted you
to kill him.

292
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,125
He's nothing
but scum...

293
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,958
I hate him.

294
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,333
All he ever
thought about

295
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,250
was how to soak every last
cent out of our father...

296
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,583
He came up with a new
scam every time...

297
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,000
Money is the only thing
worth a damn to that bastard.

298
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,875
But my parents
didn't care...

299
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,500
No matter what he
did or said,

300
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,958
they always treated him
like he could do no wrong.

301
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,375
My brother inherited the
temple when our father died...

302
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,875
It wasn't long before he had
wasted the entire inheritance

303
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,666
to build that
ridiculous main hall...

304
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,166
I didn't have a choice.

305
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,500
Only a select few have

306
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,250
what it takes to become
contracted monks...

307
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,541
Don't you see?
I had to lie to them.

308
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,291
Still... You tried
to kill your brother.

309
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,750
I thought I could hide the whole
thing if I had you kill him...

310
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,041
I was going to report that
he'd become a Shikabane

311
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,083
after some kind of
tragic accident.

312
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,375
You've known this
entire time...

313
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,458
There is no bond
between you and me.

314
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,708
I had no idea who you were
before you became a Shikabane.

315
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,333
I needed a Shikabane Hime...

316
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,041
I thought that once
I'd become a contracted monk,

317
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,333
I'd take down one Shikabane
after the next...

318
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,333
I'd surpass Senior Tagami
and get a promotion...

319
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,375
I would rise to the
rank of Gon Dai Sojo

320
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,708
and finally be able to put
my brother in his place.

321
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,375
I know it wasn't
a perfect plan,

322
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,416
but I thought
I could do this...

323
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,208
If I lose you, I'll be stuck
where I am for rest of my life

324
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,500
with nothing
to show for it...

325
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,541
It was wrong of me
to send you after my brother,

326
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,041
but I was desperate...

327
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,541
I figured that I could at least
have that small victory...

328
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,375
Pretty pathetic, isn't it?

329
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,958
How long are you going to
continue standing there?

330
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,958
Just go already.

331
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,416
But, I...

332
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,083
You're not a
Shikabane Hime.

333
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,166
All you are is
another Shikabane.

334
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,375
You don't need rune.

335
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,041
Don't you get it yet?

336
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
Follow your regrets.

337
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,916
Go anywhere you want.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,166
Do whatever it is you
please. I don't care.

339
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,166
I'm still...

340
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,166
What?

341
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm still stuck...

342
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,958
Stuck here in the
middle of my punishment.

343
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,958
Punishment...?
How's that?

344
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,208
I did such a horrible thing...
I murdered someone.

345
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,625
This is my punishment...

346
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:24,250
You mean that being with
me is a punishment for you?!

347
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,916
What is it?

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can see.

349
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,291
See what?

350
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,333
I can see your face...
It's so clear.

351
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,250
It's dark where you're
standing but you look to me

352
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,916
like you're shining
brightly from within.

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,083
Are you serious?

354
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,208
There's a light that's
coming from you to me...

355
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,583
Could this...

356
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,750
be... the bond?

357
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,041
If I'm allowed to go
wherever I like...

358
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,125
then I choose to be by
your side from now on.

359
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,375
Why?

360
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,291
We're alike...
We need eachother.

361

This is great...! How did
you even know about this?

363
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,333
Know what?

364
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,125
I love Okonomiyaki...
It's my favorite.

365
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,625
I didn't about
know that...

366
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,500
This is the only
thing I can make.

367
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,083
Would you mind
passing me the sauce?

368
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,916
Yeah, sure.

About Isaki and his
Shikabane Hime...

372
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,375
there was a bond
between them.

373
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,416
Okay.

374
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,875
Although...

375
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,875
We do know the story Isaki
gave us wasn't the truth.

376
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,416
When Isaki was
a little kid...

377
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,875
he and his brother
didn't get along,

378
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,916
so he was left in
the care of a relative.

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,416
That relative ran an
Okonomiyaki restaurant.

380
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,041
Around that time,

381
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,708
Minai's family also happened to
be living in the same town...

382
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,416
Since both of her parents
were at work all day

383
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,750
and she was alone,

384
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,666
she came to that restaurant
by herself a lot.

385
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,416
The both of 'em
were just kids...

386
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,708
they probably don't
remember it very well.

387
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,208
But that bond
really existed.

388
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,541
The two of them were connected
and they never even knew it...

389
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,583
Sounds to me like this was
their fate all along...

390
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,750
So everything worked
out for the best, huh?

391
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

392
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,666
Wonder if the same
thing'll happen to me...

393
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,083
If I'll meet my fate?
