Do you know the
reason behind this?

34
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,833
The founder of
the Kougon Sect...

35
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,791
When he decided to resurrect
his daughter from the grave,

36
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
he had to use
a specific technique

in order to perform
the ritual.

38

The founder committed that
technique to scripture.

Those in the Kougon Sect can
only create Shikabane Hime

by following the
original scripture

But that isn't
the only reason why.

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,416
It is... You knew
my mother was a Shikabane.

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,916
But I'm human...
I'll never become Shikabane.

of my life...

into a Shikabane Hime.

141

Hibiki...

145

Hibiki and I had been best
friends since we were children.

146

Long before I started
training in the Kougon Sect...

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,791
We knew we had each other.

148
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,750
Neither of us
had any family.

149

Without even realizing it...

150
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,375
We'd gone from best friends who
were there for one another...

To lovers.

152
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,666
And then...

153
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,916
She suddenly
became very sick.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,666
Her illness didn't have a
cure, she was going to die.

Help me.

Not yet.

00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,375
And softly whispered
what she wanted me to do.

159
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,291
"If you make me into your
Shikabane Hime," she said...

160
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,458
"I'll always be by your side."

161
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,958
Akasha, stop it...!
Think about this...!

162
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,625
Akasha!

163
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,958
Do you really understand?

164
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,583
Shikabane Hime act as shields
for their contracted monks.

165
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,583
Do you really think you
can stand to see her hurt?

166
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,250
I don't think he
cares about that.

167
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,875
Sadahiro!

168
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,750
Hibiki... Has the
potential for this.

169
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,083
If I don't make her
my Shikabane Hime...

170
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,000
She'll become a shield
for another monk.

171
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,958
There's no way
I could stand that...!

172
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,833
She belongs with me...!
This is fate!

173
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
I will allow it.

174
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,250
Good.

175
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
I can be with her
a little longer...

176
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,791
All I need is more time.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,416
Together, Hibiki
and I were strong.

178
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,916
Some people even said that
one day we would exceed

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,416
Sojo Takamine and his
Shikabane Hime, Kamika.

180
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,666
The only thing I ever
wanted to do was save her...

181
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,500
And I knew that if she
killed 108 Shikabane...

182
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,000
she would go to heaven.

183
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,916
Then... Came
that fateful day.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,875
There had to have been
more than 200 Shikabane.

185
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,166
They were gathered
in one place...

186
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,958
But we never thought they
would attack as a group.

187
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,166
Due to a delay in
communications...

188
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,583
Only a few
contracted monks

189
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,666
with their Shikabane
Hime responded...

190
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,250
Including
Hibiki and myself.

191
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,666
Such a small band...
Isn't that right...?

192
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,500
Hazama...
He planned it.

193
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,916
We were sure that
we could defeat them.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,333
No matter how many
Shikabane there were.

195
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,583
Tell me, are you the
leader of these Shikabane?

196
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,416
Answer the question!

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458
Why this.

198
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,791
That's when she said...

199
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,291
I counted...

200
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,625
I can't believe
I did it...

201
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,125
I killed 108.

202
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,125
108.

203
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,041
That's not surprising...

204
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,250
She was always fighting
in the front lines.

205
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,583
And she jumped into
a swarm of Shikabane.

206
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,583
You couldn't handle it,
could you...?

207
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,500
Even though, she died at peace,
you didn't want her to leave.

208
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,500
You think she
died at peace...?

209
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,500
Why the hell would
she die at peace?

210
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,333
Akasha...! Enough!

211
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,625
Far from it...
Instead she...

212
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,958
Do you feel different?

213
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,708
Are you going to
Heaven...? Hibiki?

214
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,333
Hibi... ki...?

215
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,375
What are you doing?

216
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,625
Hibiki...

217
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,708
Stop it!

218
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,041
I said stop!

219
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,291
How could
that have happened?

220
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:38,041
Everything... I knew
to be true was a lie.

221
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,875
Those that destroy 108
Shikabane go to heaven...

222
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,625
What a beautiful lie.

223
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,625
Are you that determined to keep
me from talking about this...?

224
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,083
You're a little
late for that.

225
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,750
Ouri Kagami...
You must leave this place.

226
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,333
There's nothing
either of you can do...

227
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,458
Get going... Now!

228
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,458
We can't.

229
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,875
Gon Dai Sojo...

230
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,916
You're wasting
precious time...

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,375
Your pathetic zadan is
no match for Hokuto.

232
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,000
My catalyst was weak
before, Akasha...

233
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,000
But things have changed.

234
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,541
Using your own blood
as the catalyst...

235
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,250
Quite impressive.

236
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,375
The life of a Gon Dai Sojo...!
It's more than sufficient!

237
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,791
Listen... Ouri Kagami!

238
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,666
A Shikabane Hime will lose
control of who she is...

239
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,000
But only if she kills 108!

240
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,291
She'll live with neither
regrets or obsessions...!

241
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,458
She will become a
Destroyer Shikabane!

242
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,416
Your Shikabane Hime isn't the
only one to end up this way.

243
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,583
This is...
This is just fate.

244
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,791
It was all a lie...

245
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,083
She was never going to
earn her way into heaven.

246
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,625
Why do you think
we have Inspectors?

247
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,458
Shikabane Hime that reach
108 suffer this fate.

248
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,500
Normally we take them in secret
from their contracted monks...

249
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,041
And bring them here.

250
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,000
As far as their monks
are concerned...

251
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,625
We tell them they've earned
their place in heaven.

252
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,708
Why...? Why do this?

253
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,250
Would you both have fought
if you'd known the truth...?

254
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,125
Do you think any
monk or Shikabane Hime

255
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
could fight
knowing all of this?

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,000
Hibiki...
What will happen to her?

257
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,625
She will awaken
completely regenerated...

258
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,583
Not as the girl you knew...

259
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,750
But as a Destroyer
Shikabane.

260
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,541
This kind of Shikabane...

261
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,583
Is impossible to kill.

262
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
She will live forever...

263
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,958
That is why we must break the
bond between you and seal her.

264
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,000
The coffins... Do I
dare ask what's in them?

265
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,458
Shikabane Hime...

266
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,791
They've been hidden here
since the very beginning...

267
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,791
This is how we prevent them from
becoming Destroyer Shikabane.

268
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,166
The founder's power
makes their freedom

269
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,166
from this
place unattainable.

270
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,375
Hell... You damn them to live
as monsters for eternity.

271
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,833
I know this is difficult...

272
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,166
As I said before,
it's fate.

273
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,541
I understand.

274
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,666
No, Akasha!

275
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,791
I said I understood,
didn't I?!

276
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,166
My Hibiki...
Hibiki became a Shikabane

277
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,125
because she wanted
me to save her!

278
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,375
And you're telling me
I can't do anything!

279
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,875
She's cursed to live this
way because she had regrets!

280
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,833
Hibiki...
I will save you!

281
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,541
This is...

282
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,208
"This is the Kougon Sect

283
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,375
that I dedicated everything
in my life to?"

284
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,791
Those were the last words he
spoke before his betrayal.

285
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,541
You knew, Honda...

286
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,541
You knew this
entire time.

287
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,125
I'm one of the few Inspectors
that knows about this...

288
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,416
It's something that
is passed down

289
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,125
only by the Gon Dai Sojo
Shiou's bloodline.

290
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,916
You hate us...
I'm sure of it...

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,666
But remember.

292
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,916
This is exactly why Gon
Dai Sojo never liked

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,625
using Shikabane Hime in
the first place...

294
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,875
It's not that
he hates them.

295
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,333
Many believe he thinks of
Shikabane Hime as a curse.

296
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,916
When in reality...

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,916
He is saddened that they have to
live in a hellish state forever.

298
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,541
You heard him!

299
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,125
The Kougon Sect...

300
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,000
Has been deceiving you
from the very beginning!

301
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,125
My brother is dead...

302
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
He's dead because of you!

303
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,875
Now that the bonds

304
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,541
between Shikabane Hime
and contracted monks

305
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,125
have been broken...

306
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,750
There's no way any one of you
stand a chance against us.

307
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,708
Kamika?

308
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,375
Don't worry about me...

309
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,333
I'm not done
fighting just yet.

310
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,208
Remember that you aren't
receiving my Rune anymore...

311
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,625
You won't
last much longer.

312
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,000
I actually
feel refreshed.

313
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,125
I'm happy the bond
with that pervert

314
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,500
I called my contracted
monk is broken...

315
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,625
I'm finally free!

316
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,458
Who you calling
a pervert?

317
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,083
Takamasa...
Don't look at me.

318
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,416
I won't look away...

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,250
It doesn't matter
what form you take on...

320
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,500
Deep down, I know who
you really are, Itsuki.

321
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,250
Saki...! Maybe you
should slow down.

322
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,125
I'd never forgive myself
if you were to get hurt.

323
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,125
Why do you think this
is happening to us?

324
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,291
I've been told that the catalyst
that ties the Shikabane Hime

325
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,375
to their contracted monks
is in a secret location...

326
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,833
near the head temple...

327
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,416
It's possible that someone
got to the catalyst

328
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,916
and destroyed it.

329
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,916
Really...?
That's it?

330
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,458
Rika... Do you know
what we really are now?

331
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,875
Of course, I do...

332
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,166
A contracted monk
and a Shikabane Hime.

333
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,708
No, that's not it...!

334
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,875
Tell me what we are!

335
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,750
Friends...

336
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,500
Friends through
thick and thin.

337
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right...!

338
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,791
No matter what, you and
I will always be connected.

339
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,583
Whatever does or doesn't happen
to that stupid catalyst...

340
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,541
Nothing will ever
change that!

341
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,375
Your wounds are healing...

342
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,958
How...? You shouldn't
be receiving a Rune

343
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,083
from anyone now!

344
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,500
What's the big deal if our
bond gets broken...?

345
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,125
We don't give up so easy.

346
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,416
What?

347
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,875
Forget what you know...

348
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,875
Ouri and I don't
need a damn catalyst!

349
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
As long as our
hearts are joined...

350
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,708
We can reconnect our
bond over and over!

351
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,833
If you really loved
your Shikabane Hime

352
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,208
as much as you
said you did,

353
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,250
I'm pretty sure you'd
know that already!

354
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,583
We can do this... Ouri.

355
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,833
I need you...

356
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,208
I can't do this
without you!

357
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,166
Right!

358
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,333
[Music]

359
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,833
They never wanted
to rest in peace...

360
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,500
All they desired was
pain and suffering.

361
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,375
Everyone needs to be
reminded that they're alive.

362
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,541
I must see it through
to the end...

363
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,541
If I'm ever to find out
what's "Beyond the Dead."
