[Music]

3
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,416
Is that what...
my happiness looks like?

4
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,291
Nozomi, we have to run!

5
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,083
C'mon!

6
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,875
It's not possible...

7
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,625
you are the child
of a Shikabane.

8
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,125
Time to go now!

9
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,875
Nozumi...

10
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,833
Nozumi, it's gonna
be alright now!

11
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,000
Ouri, I...

12
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,583
please...

13
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,791
I want...
to be a...

14
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,125
Shikabane Hime, so...

15
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,291
So that we...

16
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:29,458
[Music]

17
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,208
Nozomi is dead...

18
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,541
She will not be coming
back to us again.

19
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,750
Even wanting
it so badly...

20
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,250
Wasn't enough for her
to become a Shikabane.

21
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,875
It just wasn't
her destiny, Ouri...

22
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,541
may she find peace.

23
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,750
Hokuto!

24
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, finally
up and about.

25
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,125
I was worried that
Hokuto might start getting

26
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,958
a little impatient before you
had a chance to wake up...

27
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,041
fortunately that
didn't happen.

28
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,625
Why haven't you killed me,
why am I still alive?!

29
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,000
Why do you think?

30
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,208
What reason could we have
for keeping you alive?

31
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,083
I am your enemy...

32
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,291
am I not...?

33
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,083
Shikabane Hime...

34
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,625
what reason could
you have not to kill me?

35
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,750
I'd say you have a bit
of a mystery on your hands,

36
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,125
don't you...?
daughter of Hoshimura...

37
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,083
But in the final analysis,

38
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,833
the reason is hardly
important, isn't it?

39
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,541
You're here, and that's
all that really matters,

40
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,291
wouldn't you agree?

41
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,708
Let's focus on what's in
front of us now, shall we?

42
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,916
You're so right...

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,041
it's a golden
opportunity...

44
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,708
no one to bother me...
while I eradicate you!

45
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,166
The Seven Stars
welcome you,

46
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
fight us to your
heart's content!

47
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,583
You mean kill you...
to my heart's content!

48
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,916
Who are you...?

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's too bright...
It's too hot.

50
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,375
Lady... go away...

51
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,166
Hm?

52
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,500
You wish to say
something?

53
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,833
I'm merely curious

54
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,250
as to what the point
of all this is, Hazama.

55
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,625
All I'm doing is trying
to make up for your failure

56
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
to decipher the scripture.

57
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,000
I did not fail...

58
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,958
The information you desire
simply doesn't exist...

59
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,333
Creating a Shikabane Hime
from someone like Hokuto

60
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,958
has never been done...

61
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,666
She's been a Shikabane
for too long.

62
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,875
But regardless of that,

63
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,250
she's already the
strongest Shikabane...

64
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,666
She's a being
far greater than Shikabane.

65
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,833
Yet, you have her fighting
a mere Shikabane Hime...

66
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,708
What could you possible
hope to gain from this?

67
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,250
A mere Shikabane Hime...?

68
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,208
Did you learn anything
in the Kougon Sect

69
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,416
or did you just waste
you time chanting sutras?

70
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,041
This daughter of Hoshimura...
her blood is dark and cloudy...

71
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,875
wonderfully so.

72
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,291
She's still shining...

73
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,208
Enough!

74
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,333
A moment, please...

75
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,083
this isn't what
it seems to be...

76
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,583
I was just...

77
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,041
Please, Gon Dai Sojo...

78
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,166
He should probably rest.

79
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,875
A powerful curse is causing him
to lose control of his body...

80
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,375
it's obvious to
anyone watching him.

81
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,875
I'm sorry...
it's Makina...

82
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,208
it's my Shikabane Hime...

83
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,458
She must have just used
her curse for some reason...

84
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,000
We have a strong
connection between us...

85
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,583
She's in danger,
I can feel it.

86
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,375
I have no time for
this right now.

87
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,375
She needs me,
I have to go and help her.

88
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,666
Have I not
explained this to you

89
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,166
on more than
one occasion...

90
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,125
Sojo Takamine...

91
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,333
I will no longer stand for this,
the boy is defiled.

92
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,416
Breaking the bond...?
Ouri is a Shikabane...?

93
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,208
That's just ridiculous!

94
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958
I didn't know
anything about it...

95
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,416
But it would appear that Sojo
Takamine as well as other monks

96
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,791
in the Kougon Sect
knew that this outcome

97
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,916
was a distinct possibility.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,083
Perhaps... Maybe this
could be a good thing for him.

99
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,708
We both know Senior Tagami
never wanted Ouri

100
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,208
to become involved in this work,
or even know about it...

101
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,791
If it's not too late...

102
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,916
Maybe Ouri still
has a chance to go back

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,750
to the kind of
life he deserves.

104
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,375
Perhaps we should have done
what we neglected to do

105
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,875
all those years ago...

106
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,291
Kill the child born
of a Shikabane.

107
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,375
What's that?

108
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,416
Are you unaware...

109
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,250
That the woman who gave
birth to you was a Shikabane?

110
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,750
No, I...

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,958
[Music]


112
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:12,000
[Music]


113
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:22,916
[Music]


114
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,041
Due to your origins...

115
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,291
The Kougon Sect
took pity on you...

116
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,458
That's why severe
measures were never taken.

117
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,291
The battle with the Seven
Stars is on the horizon...

118
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,208
We cannot afford
any mistakes...

119
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,625
I will see to it that
your contract is dismissed...

120
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,708
Your bond is hereby broken.

121
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,875
The rest I leave
to you, Guardian.

122
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,458
Sir!

123
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,166
Listen to me,
please...

124
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Takamasa...
tell them!

125
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,875
All right,
come with me!

126
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,208
You mustn't do this...!
Listen to me please...!

127
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,833
Makina's in trouble,
don't you understand?

128
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,125
I have to help her,
she needs me!

129
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,791
Takamasa, stop!

130
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,708
Am I really the child
of a Shikabane...?

131
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,041
Does that make me
a Shikabane too?

132
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,500
Please you have to
let me help Makina!

133
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,375
Itsuki!

134
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,083
Come on...!
This way!

135
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,083
But I...

136
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,958
huh?

137
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,250
Go!

138
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,375
Inspectors!

139
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,083
Have you gone crazy...?
How could you...?

140
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,666
Why are you doing this?

141
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,750
The ritual items...

142
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,291
Are they for breaking the bond
between Ouri and Makina?

143
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,458
Of course, Ouri can't do it
by himself, can he...!

144
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,333
The both of you are supposed
to be part of the ritual too...!

145
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,083
You know that, so what
do you think you're doing?

146
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,291
I'm sorry!

147
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,833
No, Ouri!

148
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,791
Stop right there!

149
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,625
So sorry...

150
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,458
but I can't
let you do that.

151
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,416
Don't be stupid, Itsuki!

152
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,625
What are you doing?

153
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,666
Stop this now!

154
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,375
Senior Sougi...

155
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,333
Aragami...
Please...

156
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,791
Just give them
a little more time.

157
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,541
Seriously?!

158
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,625
You don't understand...

159
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,875
idiot! If he quits, if he's
not a contracted monk anymore...

160
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,916
he might just
be better off!

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,916
I know that...
but we...

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,666
I thought Ouri... might
be able to find the answer.

163
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,000
The answer to what?

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
Can a Shikabane...

165
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,916
and a human love
one another?

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,500
The question that we have been
asking ourselves all this time.

167
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,208
The answer...
has always been the same!

168
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,500
Who's there?!

169
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
Throwing stars?

170
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,833
Only one person uses
such preposterous things.

171
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:44,541
They're not preposterous...
they are totally traditional!

172
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,000
Man,
I hate you.

173
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,583
Flesh ninja technique!

174
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,291
Big throwing
star skill...!

175
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,083
Wonderful!

176
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,666
If the both of you
don't stop fighting,

177
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,458
I'll show
no mercy next time!

178
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,208
Settle down, Flesh.

179
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,583
Master!

180
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,875
Shame on you,
Takamasa...!

181
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,125
In the head temple,
of all places.

182
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,375
Letting two Shikabane
Hime fight each other!

183
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,833
You're right...
of course...

184
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,875
Grace Dai-Sojo!

185
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,083
That is enough...
Stop this at once...

186
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,625
Umehara, we have
no time for this.

187
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,250
Ouri Kagami was never
part of our plan.

188
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,458
He is of
no consequence.

189
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,666
Sir...
Takamasa...

190
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,916
you're to come
at once...

191
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,500
a decree
has been issued.

192
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,791
We can't allow the Seven Stars
to act freely any longer...

193
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,625
it's time to put
an end to this.

194
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,541
What am I doing?

195
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,541
How can I save anyone when
I don't even know what I am?

196
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,916
Are we ready?

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,125
We're ready.

198
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,125
Destroy Ouri Kagami.
Do it now.

199
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,541
Once the daughter
of Hoshimura

200
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,666
has lost her precious
Contracted Monk...

201
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,041
she will lose her
very soul...

202
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,583
and become just
an ordinary Shikabane...

203
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,750
and Hokuto will
achieve her destiny.

204
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,833
It would appear that
the Kougon Sect

205
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,333
is increasing
its activities.

206
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,875
Perfect.

207
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,166
They're concentrating
Shikabane Hime

208
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,041
all around the head temple
and surrounding areas.

209
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,458
A most formidable
barrier, to be sure.

210
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,791
That is,

211
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,041
they certainly
must imagine it to be so.

212
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,791
Pitiful fools... they're
behaving exactly the way

213
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,291
we intended them
to all along!

214
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,833
Quite so.

215
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,500
The newly created Shikabane
will completely defile the city,

216
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,625
allowing Hokuto to awaken
from her dream state

217
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,000
and fulfill the glorious
destiny prepared for her.

218
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,875
The prize we've been
waiting for, for so long.

219
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,833
... the total destruction
of the Kougon Sect.

220
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,958
Toya?

221
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,833
Isaka... never mind,
just take her.

222
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,916
At long, long last!

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,750
The hour has finally come
for this world to face a Hell

224
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,500
it has never imagined...
a day of reckoning...

225
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,166
And for the first time,

226
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,083
the dead will pass
judgment on the living!

227
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,416
Everything I wished

228
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,875
for is finally about
to come to fruition...

229
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,041
and yet...
Hokuto...

230
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,500
My mind keeps
coming back to her...

231
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,333
Why does a Shikabane...

232
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,833
Fill my head
with such thoughts?

233
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,458
Who are you?
Please tell me.

234
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,416
Who are you?

235
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,375
Let go!

236
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,583
Let go of me...!

237
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,458
Die! Die! Die! Die!

238
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,583
Die, die, die,
die, die, die!

239
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,458
I'm not done with you!

240
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,375
[Laughter]

241
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,583
Who are you?

242
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,916
I'm someone you killed!

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Who? Who?

244
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,166
Tell me!

245
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,333
Tell me!

246
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,541
Tell me!

247
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,750
Is it possible that
she doesn't remember?

248
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,875
That she doesn't
even know who she is?!

249
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,125
Makina!
And you are Hokuto...

250
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,333
We are mortal enemies!

251
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,916
Enemy! Enemy!

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,250
Enemy!

253
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,166
I... am... your...

254
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,208
enemy!

255
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,333
Enemy!!

256
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,750
Enemy!!!

257
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,875
Enemy!!!!

258
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,250
Can there really
be nothing here?

259
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you doing?!

260
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,333
I didn't know
you were home.

261
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
Ouri...!

262
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,916
What did you
hit me for?

263
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,333
When I saw you,
I got upset for some reason,

265
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,208
so I hit you by mistake.

266
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,000
Mistake?!

267
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,583
I'm starting to think
you've been back in town

268
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,666
for a while now...

269
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,791
For several days!

270
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,041
And yet... you haven't
even stopped by.

271
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,416
Sorry.

272
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,416
You know...
Dinner's in an hour...

273
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,958
Why don't you
stay and eat?

274
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,000
The kids are out
playing right now...

275
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,666
but I bet they'd be
thrilled to see you.

276
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,375
Okay.

277
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,416
Now then... tell me
what you were looking for.

278
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,166
What...?
Oh, yeah.

279
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,541
Did brother...

280
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,000
happen to leave anything
that could tell me about...

281
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,208
that day?

282
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,166
The day you came here?

283
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,916
I know it's
been years...

284
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,541
but I have
to know...

285
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,333
Did I ever
have a family?

286
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,958
Why was I brought here?

287
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
Oh, dear...
To be honest,

288
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,750
I don't really remember
much from that time...

289
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,541
I do know that a lot of the
children brought here...

290
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
Have either suffered the
loss of their parents...

291
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,416
Or came from some kind of
unstable environment at home...

292
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,458
Oh!

293
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,750
What is it?

294
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,833
You know, there were
quite a few cases

295
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,208
involving missing children
around that time.

296
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,500
Missing?

297
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,250
Yes, I remember now.

298
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,916
A number of children from
this area disappeared back then.

299
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,208
Some people thought
they might have been kidnapped,

300
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,291
but no one was ever
arrested for it.

301
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,625
I wondered...

302
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,333
Though I never confirmed
my suspicions with Keisei.

303
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,875
I began to think that you
could somehow be connected

304
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,041
to those cases.

305
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,583
But then I realized,
if you had been kidnapped,

306
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,208
Keisei would have taken
you back to your parents.

307
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,125
Why does this all
seem familiar?

308
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,916
Riko! It's Hina,
she's... Ouri!

309
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,541
What happened to Hina?

310
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,958
Somebody took her...!

311
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,666
A crazy guy with
really wierd eyes!

312
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,333
He's calling you, Ouri...

313
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,958
He's waiting for you.

314
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,166
Who is?

315
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,416
Who...?

316
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,750
Our brother!

317
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,166
There you are, brother!

318
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,916
I thought this might
help you remember...

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
it's exactly
the same as last time.

320
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,500
The same as last time...?

321
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,916
Yeah, remember?

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,833
Same situation, right?

323
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,250
Just like the time when
your mother killed us!!

324
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,416
We all died, brother!

325
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,250
So why are you...

326
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,583
just you...

327
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,708
still alive?!
