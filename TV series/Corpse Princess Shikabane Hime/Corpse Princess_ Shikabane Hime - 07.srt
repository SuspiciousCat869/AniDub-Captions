1
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,333
[Laughter]

2
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,833
Stop distracting me!

3
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,333
What're you doing?

4
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,791
You play that stupid game,
it annoys everyone around you.

5
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,791
Including me.

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,666
Whatever!

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,541
You're such a pain,
dude. Seriously.

8
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,708
I'm a pain?
Okay then, give it to me!

9
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,916
Shut up!

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,041
Hey!
Huh?

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,791
Dude,
I'm so bored.

12
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,083
Then you'll just have to
see me later, sweetheart.

13
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,916
What the hell
stinks so bad?

14
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,416
Get the hell away
from me, man!

15
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,208
Walk much...?
What's your deal, bro?

16
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,916
Hey... Don't I know you
from somewhere?

17
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,958
What's funny?!

18
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,083
Transform!

19
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,125
How is Senior
Tagami doing?

20
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,833
From what I've heard,
he's unable to move at all.

21
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,000
Its capabilities as a catalyst
have been greatly increased,

22
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,791
just as
you asked for.

23
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you
very much...

24
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,250
for doing this yourself,
Gon-Sojo Aragami.

25
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,875
I'm sure you can
understand your request

26
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,208
for a new catalyst
has raised my suspicions.

27
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,875
My intention is...

28
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,750
to open my zadan
in the next battle.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,958
Itsuki and
Senior Tagami...

30
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,333
were injured because of me
and my lack of experience.

31
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,666
Senior Tagami destroyed
the traitor monk's catalyst

32
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,916
and in doing so,
received its curse...

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,666
This concerns me.

34
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,625
Isaki shall be assigned
as the deputy Guardian

35
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,625
in that district.

36
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,958
However,
we will continue

37
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,625
to have Sho Sojo Sougi
work there as well.

38
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,708
At least
for the time being.

39
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,416
Very well,
Takamine...

40
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,000
His Grace, the Dai-Sojo shares
my opinion on this matter.

41
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,208
According to witnesses,
Gon Dai Sojo...

42
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,875
Akasha was defeated
by a sniper unknown to us...

43
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,416
And we're having difficulty
identifying who they are.

44
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,458
For many years now, rumors and
whispers have circulated...

45
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,375
It is believed that
within the Kougon Sect,

46
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,750
there are those that not only
kill Shikabane, but humans, too.

47
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,666
Regardless of what
you've heard...

48
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,708
Our teachings don't
include killing people.

49
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,208
It happened...
five years ago.

50
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,250
One day, a group led by a
powerful Shikabane appeared.

51
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,416
This resulted in the formation
of a suppression unit.

52
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,916
Akasha was
in that unit.

53
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,208
All who knew of them believed
that they were impeccable.

54
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,416
However, this all changed when
the unit was suddenly unable

55
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,208
to be reached.

56
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,125
Along with an
inspection team,

57
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,083
additional contracted monks
rushed there in quite a hurry.

58
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,916
They weren't prepared
for what they witnessed.

59
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,833
Every contracted monk
had been annihilated,

60
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,791
as well as
their Shikabane Hime,

61
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,583
with one exception.

62
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,291
His Shikabane Hime
had been torn in two.

63
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,250
He stood there, just
holding her body together.

64
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,791
Carrying the depths
of hell in his eyes,

65
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,791
Akasha was
the soul survivor.

66
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,583
Even after investigating,
we still couldn't figure out

67
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,000
what the hell
had happened.

68
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,750
Before I knew it,
I was forced to resign

69
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,375
from the inspection team.

70
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,041
However...

71
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,666
A week later...

72
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,958
while he was in the process
of restoring her body,

73
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,833
he killed his own
Shikabane Hime.

74
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,833
Many monks were
killed that night.

75
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,916
Akasha also stole secret ritual
scriptures before he ran off.

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,625
When I found out...
I wasn't really...

77
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,791
shocked by the any of it,
strangely enough.

78
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,291
Are you telling me you
sympathize with a man

79
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,875
who murdered his
Shikabane Hime?

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,083
[Phone ringing]

81
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,333
Hello.
This is Parthenon.

82
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,791
Hey there,
boss...

83
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,541
Oh, hey, Ouri.
What's going on?

84
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,041
I hate to do this to you,

85
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,375
but my brother
has the flu or something.

86
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,916
Would it be cool
if I took the day off

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,333
so I could
take care of him?

88
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't see why not.
Its not like we have customers.

89
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,458
No problem.

90
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,041
I hope that your brother's
injuries aren't too serious.

91
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,208
Something wrong?
Are you okay?

92
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,791
Everything is fine.

93
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
Tell your brother
to get well soon.

94
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,625
[Disconnect tone]

95
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,708
I don't think I told him
that Brother got hurt.

96
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,625
Did somebody
get hurt, Ouri?

97
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,750
Uh... yeah,
Brother did.

98
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,416
Anyway, what is this thing
you wanted to show me?

99
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,625
Good job,
Einstein.

100
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,833
Out of all the places,
the ribs?!

101
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,458
A blog?

102
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,458
Yeah.

103
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,791
In middle school,

104
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,125
the both of us were in
the kendo club together.

105
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,250
You got hurt again?

106
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:20,125
Oh, yeah... I fell off my
bike doing my paper route.

107
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,375
So... is this page loaded up,
the blog you're talking about?

108
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,833
Uh... yeah.

109
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,500
In the middle
of 8th grade,

110
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,666
he just started blowing off
assignments and then he just...

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,875
stopped showing up.

112
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,875
He ditched?

113
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,250
There was this 9th grader

114
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,666
who teased the crap out
of the lower graders.

115
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,916
I see...

116
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,791
Well... This looks
more like an epic poem...

117
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,208
Than a blog.

118
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,166
He used to just talk
about playing video games

119
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,541
and watching shows before.

120
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,708
But now,
he's completely obsessed

121
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,041
with constantly
updating it.

122
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,833
Here's where all this
starts to get weird.

123
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,041
"My birth"...

124
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,083
"It's just natural that those
in school and the kendo club,

125
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,875
as well as my parents
and relatives,

126
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,166
couldn't understand me."

127
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,708
"Now that things
have come to this,

128
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,750
I can't help but
feel pity for them."

129
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,500
"They did not get chosen."

130
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,375
"I will use this power
to better the world."

131
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,791
The other day,

132
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,333
one of the seniors in our
kendo club passed away.

133
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,333
What...? It was the bully you
were talking about, wasn't it?

134
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,416
I heard that he
was run-over by a train...

135
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
But I'm sure that was
just a coincidence.

136
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,125
I called... Mitsuyoshi a couple
of times to tell him about it...

137
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,500
but nobody answered.

138
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,833
Why are you telling me...
about all of this stuff?

139
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,375
Ouri... do you remember
when Inuhiko was telling us

140
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
about Shikabane?

141
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,041
According to the rumors,
a person that dies,

142
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,375
but can't move on will become
a monster called a Shikabane.

143
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,291
From what I can tell,
it's just an urban legend.

144
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,250
But have you ever heard
of something like that?

145
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,750
Can't say that I have...

146
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,000
You should just give
it a rest, sounds dumb.

147
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
You're right.

148
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,833
Besides, there's no way
Mitsuyoshi could be dead.

149
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,875
From what it sounds like,
the guy writing the blog

150
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,666
got killed by some
sort of electric shock

151
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,833
and became a Shikabane.

152
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,750
But he hasn't realized
that he's different yet.

153
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,916
Why are you lying
to those around you?

154
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,416
I lied...

155
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,541
About my injury...
and Shikabane...

156
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,041
I lied in the same way
that Brother did to me.

157
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,291
But I only did it
to protect Sumitori.

158
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,625
Perhaps he's not the only
one that needs protecting.

159
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,708
I know to leave the Shikabane
to Brother and Makina,

160
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,458
that's what
they're here to do.

161
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,291
I can't help them
in any way.

162
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,250
There's nothing for me.

163
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,083
I know what you
said is true.

164
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,916
Keisei is being dragged
into something

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,375
that has nothing
to do with him.

166
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,125
It's too late
to change things.

167
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,166
Is this all because you
want to get into heaven

168
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,291
or is it something else?

169
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,958
I'm not sure what all
Keisei has told you...

170
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,625
But I'm looking for the
Shikabane responsible

171
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,083
for the death
of my family.

172
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,458
My reason for being is simply
to kill those that killed me.

173
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,375
So don't get
the wrong idea.

174
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,166
We're not heroes or
champions out for justice!

175
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,791
Keep following me
around and you'll die.

176
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,708
And Keisei will die, too.

177
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,291
There's just...

178
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,166
I've been meaning to ask you
this particular question.

179
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,625
Are you and my brother,
uh... well...

180
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,291
are you two dating?

181
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,875
Wow, I was not
expecting that.

182
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,916
Makina definitely isn't one for
holding back when she's upset.

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,833
I couldn't have talked
about that blog right now.

184
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,208
Not with everything
else going on.

185
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,875
Are you dead?

186
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,916
Mitsuyoshi?

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,041
Now that you mention it,
I think I've seen him.

188
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,208
I haven't seen you.
You interested, baby?

189
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,583
No... I want information
on Mitsuyoshi.

190
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,041
You don't seem
sure about that.

191
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,416
What is it, monk?

192
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,333
Looking for your
collection plate, dude?

193
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,416
You lousy simpletons.
How dare you!

194
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,166
Bastard!

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,541
Isaki! Be careful,
it's dangerous.

196
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,500
Don't give me an order.

197
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,250
Let them live
their idle lives,

198
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,041
while we continue
to surpass them.

199
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,333
Isaki...

200
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,333
It's Deputy Guardian.

201
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,625
What?

202
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,166
Until Senior Tagami
has recovered,

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,958
I am acting
as the Deputy Guardian.

204
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,583
Understand? This is
my chance to be promoted.

205
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,541
Deputy Guardian... Yes.

206
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,000
You taste sweet.

207
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,208
Some idiot left a comment
in Mitsuyoshi's blog.

208
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,541
Destroying the Shikabane should
be easier than we thought.

209
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,666
We will need to kill at
least three more this month.

210
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,291
What did you mean?

211
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
I wasn't sure you'd show.

212
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,791
You're Mitsuyoshi, right?

213
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,000
Why did you ask
me if I am dead?

214
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,708
No one else will
show up, we're alone.

215
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,208
I'm not trying
to cause any trouble,

216
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,541
but I need you
to listen to me.

217
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,333
If I'm not
mistaken, he's-...

218
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,833
Senior Tagami's brother.

219
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,375
He can't stay off our radar
and out of our business.

220
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,875
The head temple still hasn't
cleared their suspicion of him.

221
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,333
This is a good opportunity to
see how things will play out.

222
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,208
But he...

223
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,208
You know Sumitori...
don't you?

224
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,250
Sumi... tori...

225
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,833
He talks to me...

226
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,875
He's really
worried about you...

227
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,375
Because...

228
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,000
Of all the strange things
you've written on your blog.

229
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,083
There's no way he
would worry about me.

230
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,416
Sumitori wasn't
any different.

231
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,541
He ignored me like
all the others did.

232
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,750
No, Mitsuyoshi.

233
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,000
You said...

234
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,500
that you were a hero, if you
were telling the truth...

235
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,833
There has to be
another way for you

236
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,750
to carry out
what needs to be done.

237
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:53,875
[Screaming]

238
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,875
Mitsuyoshi!

239
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,416
I...

240
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
I... I...

241
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,083
Mitsuyoshi!

242
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,916
Transform!

243
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,708
Shikabane!

244
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,958
And who do we have here?

245
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,333
I kill corpses whose regrets
keep them from dying.

246
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,333
I'm Shikabane Hime!

247
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
You, too?

248
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,583
So in other words,
you're pure evil.

249
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,208
Evil?

250
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,208
I'm not... what you
call a Shikabane.

251
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,916
I gained this new life

252
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,166
and became a hero in order
to do what is necessary.

253
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,625
Minai!

254
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,666
What are you doing?!

255
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,333
Hurry and
attack it already!

256
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,541
Yes, Deputy Guardian.

257
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,666
I will not forgive evil.

258
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,333
I will not forgive those
who make people suffer.

259
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,333
And you dare turn your
fist toward me in anger...

260
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,333
Evil!

261
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,833
The Shikabane...

262
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,041
Are contrary to all that
is good in the world!

263
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,958
I am different...
I am justice!

264
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,833
Minai!

265
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,416
He must be cursed.

266
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,291
Cursed?

267
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,083
When he became
a Shikabane,

268
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,208
his body wasn't the
only thing that changed.

269
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,583
His curse functions beyond
the laws of physics.

270
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,250
This is proving to be...

271
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,458
More difficult than I
originally thought it would.

272
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,250
The two of you know...
My brother?

273
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,750
Out of my way.

274
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,833
What's the matter, Minai?

275
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,041
Please give her a minute!

276
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,208
She's taken on
a lot of damage.

277
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,375
At the rate she's
going, she could...

278
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791
Silence!

279
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,375
If you had just kept his
attention long enough,

280
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,333
she would have killed
him with one hit...

281
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,458
Damn layman!

282
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,666
Get up, Minai!

283
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,375
Please!

284
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,250
What's the matter...?

285
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,583
Why don't you attack me?

286
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,083
Not a single one
of your attacks

287
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,125
has even the
slightest effect on me!

288
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,208
I am immortal!
You are pure evil!

289
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,916
That's it!

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,333
Cursed or not,
I'll kill him!

291
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,500
I think I understand.

292
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,666
He can return all the
damage to the same place

293
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,500
on his attacker's body.

294
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,666
So that's the curse!

295
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,708
Minai!

296
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,833
Don't get
the wrong idea.

297
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,333
We're not heroes or
champions out for justice!

298
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,750
Keep following me around...
And you'll die.

299
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,750
That was reckless, Ouri.

300
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,041
Please stay out of sight.

301
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,583
Try and hide in
here for a while.

302
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,125
Isaki and I...

303
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,083
We'll take care
of everything.

304
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,791
Why do you listen
to someone like him?

305
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,208
Because this is how my
atonement is achieved.

306
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,083
What?

307
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,958
Before I died...

308
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,791
I murdered someone
close to me.

309
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,500
I was going to die
with him...

310
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,791
But to my surprise...

311
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,916
I didn't die...
I couldn't.

312
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,625
That's why
I have been sentenced

313
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,583
to live this
hollow existence.

314
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,708
You think being a Shikabane
Hime is a punishment?

315
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,208
What that Shikabane
said could be the truth.

316
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,458
Maybe he's
really justice...

317
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,791
And we are the evil
ones here after all...

318
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't believe that...

319
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,875
No way.

320
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,416
That guy tried to use
me as a decoy...

321
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,916
But you rescued me.

322
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,708
Well I couldn't just stand
there and watch you get hurt.

323
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,750
So thank you.

324
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,875
Hiding is pointless.

325
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,833
Minai!

326
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,208
Just as I thought...

327
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,875
Makina!

328
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,208
Since I'm missing
my right arm,

329
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,916
I had no damage
when I attacked his.

330
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,333
This is the
first time I'm happy

331
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,125
that my body
is still regenerating.

332
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,250
How did you find us?

333
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,500
The head temple contacted us
with some questions

334
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,125
about your cell phone...

335
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,250
They said that Isaki
was investigating...

336
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,166
Why do you still keep
getting involved?

337
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,458
You weren't worried
about me, were you?

338
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,208
What?

339
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,041
You saved us.
You're my hero.

340
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,916
[Phone ringing]

341
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,208
Get it?

342
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958
Man, I hate you.

343
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:07,583
[Music]

344
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,416
Who are you shedding
those tears for?

345
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,583
From this world, one of
the defiled has departed...

346
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,208
What more do you
need to know?

347
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,958
It's time to celebrate...
her "Serenity."
