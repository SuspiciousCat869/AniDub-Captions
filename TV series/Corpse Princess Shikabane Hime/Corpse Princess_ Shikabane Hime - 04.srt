00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,916
so you can dissolve it.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,916
Be careful, Makina.

168
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,833
Hello.
I have a delivery

169
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,416
for someone in
Kun-Osaki san's office.

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,583
Oh, yeah. Fifth floor
conference room -

171
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,083
got a big entourage.

172
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,958
Guess she thinks she
needs that many people.

173
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,458
Thanks.

174
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,500
Big entourage?

175
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,541
Excuse me, ma'am did
somebody order a--

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,375
What'd she do?
From that distance!

177
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,708
So you're the one who's
trying to kill our product.

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,041
We've heard
so much about you.

179
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,625
Move back!

180
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,458
Move back!

181
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,666
How did you know
I was coming?

182
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,375
Somebody...
called us!

183
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,291
It doesn't matter
who called.

184
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,750
Would you like me to sing
for you, my biggest fan?

185
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,875
But you're dead, Osaki.

186
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,916
Eh, obviously not.

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,583
As long as I sing, I live.

188
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,833
Song's over.

189
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,166
Dead girl.

190
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583
Get her!

191
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
Hold it right there buddy.

192
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,833
We know you're working
with the woman upstairs.

193
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,416
Who, little ol' meeee???

194
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,125
I'm not a wussy!

195
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,791
Hey!
You wussy boy!

196
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,500
No, I'm not, I'm not!

197
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,583
Wussy boy! Wussy boy!

198
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,125
All right, kids;
that's enough!

199
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,750
Stop annoying Ouri;
you know he doesn't like it.

200
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,708
We can't have any
fun around here!

201
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,291
So, did you find anything?

202
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,250
Well, as
I understand it...

203
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,541
Mr. Hoshimura had some
connection to our temple here.

204
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,250
What?
The Kougon Sect?

205
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,791
When my father died,
Mr. Hoshimura visited me

206
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,083
after the funeral.

207
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,458
I think he may have
been Keisei's senior?

208
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,875
I'm not sure.

209
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,708
But I never heard that
his house had burned down.

210
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,416
Is there an address,
or landmark I can go by?

211
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,541
Why don't you ask Keisei?

212
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,125
Keisei...
can't know about this.

213
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,958
The temple...

214
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,333
Hey! What the hell!

215
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,708
Get her!

216
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,125
Keisei!

217
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,541
There she is!

218
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,708
She's still alive?!

219
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,416
Hold it!

220
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,333
Hey! C'mon!
Get her!

221
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,250
Be quiet back there!

222
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,875
I'm sorry for
all the trouble.

223
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,458
We need Sojo Takamine

224
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,041
with the prefectural
police to get involved.

225
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,416
They can take
it from here.

226
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,708
The prefectural?

227
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,166
That's right. They're
the only ones allowed

228
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,291
to know anything
about Shikabane.

229
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,500
And they're also the ones
who most frequently deal

230
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,500
with the yakuza.

231
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,333
Understood.

232
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,208
My apologies.

233
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,541
It's ok.

234
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,958
We're sworn to protect
and defend you, Sho-Sojo.

235
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,875
I'm just doing my job.

236
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,541
Yes, but it doesn't make
things any easier for you.

237
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,000
I know how hard it must be
for you to have to attack

238
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,833
a living human being.

239
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,083
Hey, hey, hey!

240
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,250
There is some crazy
shit happening!

241
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,708
Ushi?

242
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,750
Ya hear? Kun-Chan's performance
has just been cancelled!

243
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,541
Something about a fight
between yakuza groups?

244
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,958
Nobody knows anything,

245
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,708
but somebody's saying
that Kun-chan was shot!

246
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,833
What? Someone
shot her?

247
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,708
Now they're saying the
hit-man was a woman?!

248
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,958
I just hope
Kun-chan's alright.

249
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,000
Things are getting crazy
in front of the CD shop.

250
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,583
I'll call you again later.

251
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,041
[Disconnect tone]

252
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,250
Makina...

253
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,458
Hoshimura...

254
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,500
So you can read.

255
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,750
Yes.

256
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,750
Me and my
entire family.

257
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,916
This is where
we're buried.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,458
It's true?

259
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,083
It was a massacre,
when we died.

260
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,333
When they burned my
family in the temple.

261
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,250
But as a Shikabane Hime...

262
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,750
I'll have my
vengeance one day.

263
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,500
If you got that...

264
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,250
then please respect it

265
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,708
and don't ever show
your face to me again.

266
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,250
Why?

267
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,416
Why?

268
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,875
Of course. I want
to know more about you.

269
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,875
We are the dead.

270
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,916
We are defiled.

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,708
It's immoral for humans
to get close to us.

272
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,666
If you get
anymore involved--

273
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,958
[phone ringing]

274
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,708
Hello?

275
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,750
Are you okay?

276
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
Where are you?

277
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,166
I'm fine.

278
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,208
I'm taking care
of everything.

279
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
Were you hurt at all?

280
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,458
Who's that,
who're ya talking to?

281
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,916
Don't worry!

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,541
Okay?

283
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,500
To tell you the truth,
I was running away.

284
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,958
I had no plan.

285
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,916
I didn't even know
where I was going.

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Or how or why
I ended up here at all.

287
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,791
I just found myself here.

288
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,833
Makina...

289
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,583
Tell your friend,
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,583
Huh?

291
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,166
About the concert.

292
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,958
I was only trying
to protect them.

293
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,916
You mean you're the
one who attacked Osaki?!

294
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,333
You should be resting.

295
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,416
I just tried
to murder a rock star.

296
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't stay here.

297
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,833
Both the police and the yakuza
will be after me for that.

298
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,208
But.

299
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm not about to leave
you here all by yourself.

300
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,541
It's just that Brother
sort of took me in

301
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,833
when I was three.

302
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,041
And had nowhere
else to go.

303
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,458
He said that he
couldn't leave me alone.

304
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,208
We may not really
be related...

305
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,083
but we're brothers.

306
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,791
Come on Kun, we have to
get you to a safer place!

307
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,500
I wanna sing.
I wanna sing!

308
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,833
I wanna sing!

309
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,250
Of course.

310
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,583
Even up until now, those
who you killed were even--

311
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,041
I didn't kill them!

312
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,583
Uh, yes, of course.
Certainly not Kun...

313
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,041
Those people interfered
with my song.

314
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,500
They interfered!

315
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,458
They interfered!

316
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,541
They interfered!

317
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,000
Kun-chan!

318
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,166
What a terrible song.

319
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,375
But it'll sound great
when you sing it in Hell...

320
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,541
it's just the living
who can't stand it.

321
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,375
That's really harsh!

322
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,458
You got smacked
by a dead girl!

323
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,958
Why are you with her?!
After all she's done.

324
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,958
She's the strongest
being I've ever seen.

325
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,916
Certainly more
so than you, little brat.

326
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,333
Well, damn.

327
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,708
What are you
still doing here?

328
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,083
I'll be just fine.

329
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,041
Like hell, you're fine!

330
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
Look at you!

331
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,250
...your wounds are getting
worse by the minute...

332
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,666
When I saw you before,
they started healing right away,

333
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,083
but now...

334
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
Shut up.

335
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,291
Each Shikabane Hime has
an emotional and physical bond

336
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,416
to a specific human.

337
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,250
And anytime that
human is nearby...

338
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,333
She receives his Rune,
or life energy.

339
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,583
With her body regenerated,
she is once again

340
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,291
able to utilize her abilities
to their fullest extent.

341
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,958
That specific human being
is referred to as...

342
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,791
a contracted monk.

343
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,250
Uh, Brother!

344
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,916
So you're "just
fine," are you?

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,541
I told you not
to come, remember?

346
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,458
What else could
I have done?

347
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,541
Of course I came,
I'm your contracted monk.

348
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,125
Stay here,
I got this.

349
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,291
Makina, hold her
back by using this.

You couldn't accept
your fate as a human,

359
