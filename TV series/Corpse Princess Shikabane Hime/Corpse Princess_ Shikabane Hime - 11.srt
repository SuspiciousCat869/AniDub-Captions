00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,416
[Music]

2
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,750
The Seven Stars...

3
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,583
You're familiar
with them, correct?

4
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,916
If I'm not mistaken,

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,291
it's a group consisting
of several Shikabane.

6
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,166
Shikabane exist because of the
regrets and obsessions people

7
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,416
have as they die...

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,791
They stay here to act
on their desires, right?

9
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,208
But these Shikabane
decided to start a club?

10
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,750
Saki!

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,791
I understand that
this seems impossible.

12
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,416
Regardless of how
unlikely the case,

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,541
these Shikabane have
banned together.

14
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,750
Here's what we
know so far...

15
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,208
Each member has seven stars
carved into their skin...

16
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,916
Their plans don't
necessarily include

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,041
just killing
human beings...

18
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,458
They also have been known
to target other Shikabane

19
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,416
that cross their path.

20
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,750
I don't get it.

21
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,875
If they're not just
in it for the kill,

22
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,083
what else could they
be trying to do?

23
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,416
I don't know,
but we'll figure it out.

24
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,791
Make sure to give these
pictures to Keisei.

25
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,500
Yes, sir...
May I ask why?

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,375
Now is not the
time to explain...

27
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,041
He will understand
what needs to be done

28
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,916
once he receives them.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,958
Kamika!

30
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
I'll just be
a moment, sir.

31
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,875
A few scriptures appear
to be unaccounted for.

32
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,166
See to it later.

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,833
Right now, the Seven Stars
pose a bigger threat

34
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,791
than missing scriptures.

35
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,750
There's Shuhou and Shujou
factions of the sect?

36
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,208
Yes.

37
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,958
These factions have been
created within the Kougon Sect.

38
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,958
The second in command,
the Gon Dai Sojo,

39
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,666
is part of the
Shujou faction.

40
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,041
He has an opposition
to the manner

41
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,291
in which Shikabane Hime
are implemented.

42
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,041
Does he really think
they stand a chance

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,666
without the help of their
indentured corpses?

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,666
He thinks they are capable of
creating a world without regret.

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,000
[Laughter]

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,625
Let me see if I'm
understanding this correctly...

47
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,708
The Shujou is about
to assume the lead.

48
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,083
With the Shuhou
losing control,

49
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,666
Shikabane Hime will
no longer be a threat?

50
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,541
Our focus should be on
targeting contracted monks

51
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,041
and their Shikabane Hime.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,958
The Shuhou faction
will suffer.

53
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,750
You seem to have
done your homework...

54
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,791
Better than expected
of a traitor.

55
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,416
Being that you lost
your precious casket,

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,666
what else do you
have to offer us?

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,583
I can create
another casket.

58
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,708
We have one condition.

59
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,750
Not only do we know little
of your true intentions,

60
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,125
but you're a human...

61
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,250
We have no reason to
believe we can trust you.

62
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,625
What can I do?

63
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,666
You must prove yourself...

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,416
Convince us that you have
abandoned your trivial emotions.

65
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,333
What is this...?
This water drop?

66
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,541
Hands off!

67
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,000
You're not worthy...

68
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,791
To touch Hokuto
of the Seven Stars.

69
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll show all of you
what a mere human can do...

70
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,500
All that remains of my
emotions is the desire

71
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,208
to annihilate
the Kougon Sect!

72
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,291
[Laughter]

73
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,291
He's here!
Let's go!

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,625
Ouri's here...!
Hurry up and hide it!

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,958
Oh, there
he is! Run!

76
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:24,041
So it looks like the kids
don't like me anymore.

77
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,291
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Ouri.

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,541
Yeah, right.

79
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,791
Did you think we'd
forget your birthday?

80
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
Oh... Yeah,
I see.

81
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,000
Incredible.

82
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,166
It's a zadan technique.

83
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
Being that I never
practiced it seriously...

84
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm not sure if
this is any good.

85
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,291
You can get a pretty good
defense with Shikimi

86
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,000
and spirit threads.

87
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,833
Overall, the scriptures appear
to be woven in superb accuracy.

88
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,250
Looks good enough to
rival a Level 3...

89
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,208
Maybe even a Level 2
class Buddhist instrument.

90
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
Good to know.

91
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,541
Isn't the traitor monk's
casket pretty strong...?

92
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,291
Wouldn't it work
just as well as this?

93
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,083
Where did you find all
of these scriptures?

94
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,333
Please don't tell me you took
Sojo Takamine's scriptures!

95
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,416
I may have pilfered
through them the other day.

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,583
Senior! That place
holds scriptures,

97
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,958
some of which are
known to be priceless!

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
For the most part,
I selected them at random.

99
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,041
Just a few might be
considered national treasures.

100
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,041
I assume...

101
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,375
You're planning to use
this as a catalyst

102
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,125
for your zadan technique?

103
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,625
Actually... Can you hold
on to it for a while?

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,083
It's insurance...
Just in case.

105
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,791
Senior...

106
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,458
Saki...
Aragami.

107
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh, great...
She's here.

108
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,083
I asked her
to come here...

109
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,000
I thought it was best if the
two of us saw them together.

110
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,708
Okay... Here's the medicine
for the spiritual trauma.

111
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,250
Take this one
before eating...

112
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,583
After meals...

113
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,958
And this one
before bed.

114
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,666
Great...
Thanks.

115
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,708
Takamine said you'd know
what to do with these.

116
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,750
Are you sure it's them?

117
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,166
Keisei... Are they
the next assignment?

118
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,250
Yeah... Probably.

119
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,708
So...

120
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,666
I've been waiting
for you, Seven Stars.

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,791
Still pretending you're
not getting involved?

122
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,250
I'm not... All I was
going to say is that

123
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,500
I remember seeing that
girl the other day.

124
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,833
You saw her...? Where?

125
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,500
At that Order of Eternal
Life Research place.

126
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,208
Why would you go
to such a place...?

127
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,500
It's a front for some
kind of religious cult.

128
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,458
I was just curious
about it...

129
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,083
I thought another religion
might have a way

130
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,583
to save people like you.

131
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,666
What are you talking about?

132
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,291
I know you could have
become a Shikabane...

133
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,708
Working as a Shikabane Hime was
the only alternative for you...

134
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,916
But that's just led you
down the path of despair.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,375
Despair...?
Far from it...

136
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,875
This wasn't forced on me,

137
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,666
I asked to become
a Shikabane Hime.

138
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,541
You okay?

139
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,625
I think you're putting more
than enough meat in that...

140
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,208
Don't you?

141
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,666
Think I got this big and strong
by being a vegetarian...?

142
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,375
Meat is good...
And good for you.

143
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,208
What about
all those spices?

144
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,625
Why are you
using so many?

145
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,875
A long time ago, I got into
the habit of experimenting

146
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,708
with all kinds of
spices and seasonings.

147
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,625
Didn't really
have a choice.

148
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,666
Someone was very
picky about food.

149
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,875
Are you talking...
about me?

150
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,833
Now let me think.

151
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,375
I believe I've told you
that I was very young

152
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,041
when my parents died.

153
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,416
There were people who helped
me out during that time...

154
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,916
They were the head family,
the Hoshimuras.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,708
Hoshimura?

156
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,666
Once I completed my training
at the head temple...

157
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,375
I left the
Hoshimuras' house.

158
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,041
After leaving...

159
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,208
I only went back there
every once in a while.

160
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:29,291
[Music]


161
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,708
I was soon sent to
the Sekuu Temple...

162
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,333
Where I met Riko
and her mother.

163
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,958
The temple...

164
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,875
And the Dai-Rin House were in
pretty terrible shape then.

165
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,750
Restorations...

166
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,041
Took quite a lot
of time and money.

167
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,416
Soon, you entered
into our lives.

168
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,541
For ten years,

169
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,625
it seemed as though everything
was how it should be.

170
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
That all changed
when I received news

171
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,583
that Shikabane murdered
the Hoshimura family.

172
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,041
The ones responsible were
a group of Shikabane.

173
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,333
We realized soon after that
it was the Seven Stars.

174
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,958
Are they the ones I saw
in the pictures earlier?

175
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,708
Keisei...

176
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,750
Old man... Why?

177
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,250
The daughter of Hoshimura
possesses the talent.

178
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,208
You're to become her
contracted monk immediately.

179
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,666
She's out of control.

180
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,375
Her experiences have left
her full of anger and hatred.

181
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,416
We have her restrained,
it's the only way to stop her

182
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,666
from becoming a Shikabane.

183
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,583
If we do not create
the contract now...

184
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,083
All that she was
will cease to exist.

185
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,416
Wait... I can't!

186
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,208
There's already a connection
between the two of you...

187
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,500
A contract with you
is the only way.

188
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Makina, I...

189
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,708
Keisei... Please...!
Make a contract with me!

190
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,625
Do you completely
understand...

191
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,833
What becoming a
Shikabane Hime means?

192
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,500
I'll do anything...

193
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,208
Keisei, I need you
to fight by my side.

194
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,000
The monsters that
did this must pay...

195
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,041
Avenge my family and me!

196
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,166
Before, you told me that Makina
didn't become a Shikabane Hime

197
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,083
in order to earn
her way into heaven.

198
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,916
The Seven Stars aren't
your average Shikabane.

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,333
Try not to get
involved in this one.

200
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,416
But... You're involved.

201
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,041
I made her a promise...

202
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,708
To fight by her side.

203
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,416
I understand now,
Brother.

204
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
When I first found out,
I just wanted to stay mad at you

205
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,833
for keeping
such a big secret...

206
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,208
But that was before I really
knew about this world...

207
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,333
You know?

208
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,791
Yeah.

209
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,958
I know the Kougon
Sect killed Minai.

210
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,625
Trusting them is impossible...

211
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,291
But you're different.

212
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,958
You're still
the exact same person

213
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,416
I've known all these years
and I can trust you.

214
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,333
You told me monks are here
to protect the living...

215
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:24,041
And that their purpose isn't to
try and save those already dead.

216
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,500
Sorry.

217
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,458
Hearing that really
makes me happy.

218
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,125
Ouri... I'll make sure
you get a very special gift

219
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,250
for your birthday tomorrow.

220
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,291
A limited edition Zenbunose
Puchitoo life-sized figure!

221
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,708
Tomorrow.

222
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,541
Sorry, sir!

223
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,208
Here you go.

224
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,666
Thank you
so much, mister!

225
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,333
You're really sweet!

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,041
I'd say Ena is quite the
theatrical performer.

227
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,791
Once he reveals his true nature,
he's rather intolerable.

228
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,791
My god, Regardless, he
was able to create a bond

229
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,625
between himself and Ouri.

230
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,250
Now all we have to do
is wait for nightfall.

231
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,625
Yes.

232
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,000
Now... This
is going to be fun.

233
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,958
Keisei...

234
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,750
Keisei.

235
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,208
Everyone in the
area is asleep.

236
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,916
Doesn't that seem
a little odd?

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,666
Must be a
Shikabane's curse...

238
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
But you'd think
they'd realize

239
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,500
that it won't have an effect
on either one of us.

240
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,875
They do know.

241
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,833
It's a challenge,
they're calling us out.

242
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,458
Looks like they wanted
minimal distractions.

243
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,291
Job well done.

244
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,708
[Mew]

245
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,875
Crap!

246
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,541
[Mew]

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,750
What is it?

248
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,833
What do you
want from me?

249
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,500
Are those...
Bruises?

250
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,875
And to think that
Shikabane have the guts

251
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,500
to attack us directly.

252
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,208
It just shows you the
level of intelligence

253
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,708
we're working with.

254
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,541
The Seven Stars.

255
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,916
Or... The traitor monk.

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,833
Would the two of you like
to venture another guess...?

257
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,750
You're both so close.

258
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,166
The Incredible
Lotus Flower.

259
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,208
Is that the Hoshimuras'
little girl...?

260
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,875
How time flies.

261
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,125
You really do have a knack
for making foolish choices...

262
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,333
I see that your arms and
legs have grown back.

263
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,250
Remember how you begged and
pleaded for your life

264
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,375
with those bloody stumps?

265
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,500
It was so cute.

266
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,541
Seven Stars.

267
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,500
I am Kowaku!

268
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,083
Akasha...

269
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,791
Has your desperation really led
you to consort with Shikabane?

270
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,333
I would hardly call this
an act of desperation,

271
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,041
my dear old friend.

272
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,458
What's your purpose here?

273
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,791
To rid the world
of the Kougon Sect

274
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,750
and their pitiful
Shikabane Hime.

275
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,250
I figured I'd start off
with the two of you.

276
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,791
You and I grew up together,
we studied at the same temple...

277
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,375
We were friends.

278
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,041
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

279
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm a different
person now, Senior.

280
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,875
Our history doesn't
concern me in the least...

281
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,708
I may have walked
in your shadow then,

282
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,500
but that's all
in the past.

283
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,083
You hadn't even the
slightest indecision.

284
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,541
We are not
to seek death...

285
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,500
Nor are we to fear it.

286
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,708
That is the only way to save
the distraught masses.

287
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,416
You have become a great
contracted monk.

288
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,791
The two of you
should really think

289
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,875
about becoming
contracted monks also.

290
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,541
Having a powerful Shikabane
Hime to fight alongside

291
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,125
doesn't seem
like a bad idea.

292
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,208
The second the
opportunity comes around,

293
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,875
I'm going to make
a contract with one.

294
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,708
Making a contract is
serious business...

295
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,416
I don't think I have
the stomach for it.

296
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Why is that?
It takes a lot to ask

297
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,250
these little girls to put
their lives on the line.

298
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,958
Besides... I'm better off
fighting alone for a while.

299
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,666
Perhaps someday...

300
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,958
I might be willing
to risk it.

301
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,958
I believed what you
said that day...

302
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,833
Deep down a part of me
felt you were right.

303
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,333
Which is why...
When I learned the truth...

304
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,333
I simply couldn't
accept it.

305
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,791
Accept what...?
The truth?

306
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,000
I must shed my last
threads of humanity.

307
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,833
My transformation will be
signified by your dying breath.

308
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,500
I shall be reborn...

309
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,125
I will subsist by
accepting death.

310
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,041
I find it very amusing
how much human beings rely

311
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,333
on conversation.

312
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,791
Your outfit...

313
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,291
You were a monk before
you became a Shikabane?

314
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,791
How perceptive...

315
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,541
That is how I know...

316
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,916
Monks are just humans
who want to play heroes...

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,750
But the thing is they
can't save anybody.

318
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,750
Admit it. You're trying to
rescue your damsel in distress.

319
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,416
All you're doing is taking
her from one hell to another.

320
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,916
Monks are nothing more
than cheap illusionists.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,666
Though I'm sure you try
to convince yourselves

322
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,208
that you're
making a difference.

323
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,708
Do you ever shut up?

324
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,708
Just as I expected...

325
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,208
You haven't had the chance
to perfect this casket

326
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,416
as your catalyst.

327
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,083
He couldn't have captured

328
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,833
another hundred and eight
regrets so quickly.

329
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,458
If I use my zadan technique,
I should be able.

330
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,000
First thing you learn in battle
is to hide your weaknesses...

331
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,500
Fortunately, I'm familiar
with your Achilles heel.

332
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,583
Your reason for leaving
the safety of the building

333
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,083
and coming out into
the open is simple.

334
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,500
People that you made an oath
to protect lie asleep

335
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,416
within those walls.

336
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
What are you
waiting for? Go!

337
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,416
You may need me.

338
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,875
Don't worry about me.

339
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,208
I finally found
myself a decent fight.

340
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,041
You can't let
him get inside!

341
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,625
Looks like it's
just the two of us.

342
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,375
Die, Kowaku!

343
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,500
The barrier
is still intact.

344
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,291
I made it.

345
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,291
Ouri?

346
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,083
Brother... There's
something happening.

347
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:42,166
Yes... Never mind that...
why are you here?

348
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,625
You should
have fallen asleep.

349
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,791
Falling asleep...
isn't an option...

350
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,291
Tonight...

351
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,000
Just got
very interesting.

352
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:07,291
[Music]

353
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:37,250
The long night that
seems to go on forever...

354
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,125
The tears you thought had
dried up begin pouring out...

355
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,708
Go ahead and cry.

356
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,375
The dawn is still in
the distant future.
