[Music]

2
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,250
I thought you might remember
the whole thing better

3
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,250
if I fashioned
the same situation.

4
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,166
Situation?

5
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,458
Look, I don't...

6
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,958
I don't know
what you mean.

7
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,250
But if I'm
the one you're after,

8
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,458
you should let
the children go!

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,708
Oh really...

10
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,083
You think so?!

11
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,208
How about now?!

12
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,708
Is this better?!

13
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,166
This a little
more familiar? !

14
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,791
Cuz it should look like
the same time and place

15
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,541
when your mother
killed all of us!

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,708
You get it now!?!?

17
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,458
Now you remember.

18
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,916
It's clear.

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,333
That monster...

20
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,166
It was...
It was my mother?

21
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,333
That's right, Ouri.

22
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,416
It was.

23
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,833
This way.

24
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,000
No survivors...?

25
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,000
Sad.

26
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,291
Senior Mibu,
Senior Tagami!

27
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,875
This kid...
He's still alive.

28
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,625
It happened more
than ten years ago.

29
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,083
There was an incident.

30
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,458
Small children from all
over were kidnapped.

31
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,791
They were kept for some time and
never given any food or water.

32
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,833
Eventually, every
one of them died.

33
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,125
Then Ouri is one of them?

34
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,500
Not exactly.

35
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,666
There was a woman,
nine months pregnant.

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,208
She died in a hit
and run accident

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,833
and became a Shikabane--

38
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,625
one that was going
to be a mother.

39
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,666
So, it gave birth...
to Ouri.

40
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,791
A child born
of a Shikabane...

41
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,166
But wouldn't that make
the kid a Shikabane, too?

42
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,000
No.

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,500
But it kept that mother
from ever knowing Ouri.

44
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,833
The Shikabane's regret was not
being able to hold her child

45
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,166
in her arms.

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,541
So it abandoned Ouri

47
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,791
and went to kidnapping
children one after another,

48
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,958
seeking to fill
her regret.

49
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,833
But no matter how many she took,
she couldn't find her own child,

50
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,875
who was right
in front of her.

51
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,500
That hellish scene must
have gone on and on.

52
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,375
Poor Ouri.

53
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,583
He had to watch
all of that.

54
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,791
Yes... But he survived
with his amazing vitality.

55
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,750
Among all of those
babies she let die,

56
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,291
there was only one of them
who became a Shikabane.

57
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,666
A Shikabane...?
But how could...?

58
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,916
"All he wanted
to do was eat... "

59
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,416
"And eat..."

60
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,458
"And eat..."

61
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,000
After being ripped from
the arms of his mother

62
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,333
and then left to die,
he came back to life

63
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:36,000
with the single regret
that he died hungry.

64
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
That kid was you...
You're that Shikabane...

65
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,458
It wasn't just me...

66
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,916
All of those other kids that
died because of your mother

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,166
have been following you
around as a mass of Shiryou!

68
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,083
Ouri...

69
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,916
Ouri...
He's right...

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,375
It's us.

71
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,750
Has it sunk in yet?!

72
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,291
Every last one of us was
killed by your mother...!

73
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,708
Why the hell were you the
only one who got to live?!

74
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,458
You think you can fight?!

75
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,041
The kids who were killed because
of you want a shot at revenge!

76
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,208
That's the body
you wanted, right...?

77
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
Then go take it!

78
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,625
I'm not simply
gonna kill you.

79
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,291
I wanna give you a taste...

80
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,875
Just a tiny taste of
the hell I went through!

81
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,083
[Laughter]

82
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,250
That's right!
Eat! Eat it!

83
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,875
I had to eat it too!

84
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,500
I ate and ate...

85
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,875
I ate every single one
of my dead friends!

86
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,375
I don't understand why you've
kept this from me all this time.

87
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,000
That was Keisei's wish.

88
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,833
When all of this happened,

89
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,041
Akasha, Mibu, and Tagami
killed that Shikabane.

90
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,750
It was Senior Tagami
who petitioned

91
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,541
to spare the life of Ouri

92
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,041
because he was
the sole survivor.

93
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
His promise was that he
would never allow Ouri

94
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,916
to get involved
with the defiled.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,875
Why would he do that?

96
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,583
He must have figured

97
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,416
while it was just another
Shikabane to them,

98
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,750
they still killed
this boy's mother.

99
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,458
Hold it!

100
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,041
I'm just gonna find Ouri.

101
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,791
There's a massive operation
in progress at this time...

102
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,375
Both of you must
stay on task...

103
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,583
We need your help to strengthen
the head temple's defenses.

104

105
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:55,416
[Chanting in Japanese]

106
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
[Laughter]

107
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,833
Dammit... Why?

108
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,500
Why can't...
I beat you?!

109
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,583
Enemy... mine...

110
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
Because I'm your enemy!

111
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,541
I hold more
than one regret...

112
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,458
Not just to destroy
the Seven Stars...

113
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,125
I also have Keisei.

114
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,875
He was killed and now
I hold his regrets with me.

115
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,208
That's two regrets...

116
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,500
And it should be enough!

117
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:38,541
I shouldn't lose to you...
Or any Shikabane!!

118
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,416
I'm your enemy.

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,875
And you're mine.

120
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,916
Do you want me
to tell you?

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,916
I know the reason
you can't win.

122
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,208
Hokuto
of the Seven Stars...

123
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,833
Has no regrets or any
nature of which to speak.

124
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,333
Someone like that
can't be a Shikabane.

125
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,708
You're wrong...
It is possible...

126
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,583
You all start out human...

127
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,541
I mean... Before
you became Shikabane,

128
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,208
you were alive, right?

129
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,291
So was anyone.

130
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,125
It is all in the
joys and sadness...

131
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,708
You loved people and
were in turn loved...

132
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,083
Sometimes you may have
even felt hatred...

133
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,375
As one of the living,

134
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,666
you must have experienced
all of those emotions...

135
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,125
The chance to live life
was taken away from Hokuto.

136
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,708
She was born and raised
to be a human sacrifice.

137
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,208
And she was without regrets

138
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,333
and without any semblance of
her nature when it happened.

139
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,666
The fact is she
was born to die.

140
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,833
It was only in that
moment of her death

141
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,291
that Hokuto became free.

142
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,625
She was finally able to make
contact with others

143
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,791
and know their existence.

144
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,583
Hokuto harms people, yes,

145
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,916
but she does not do this
out of regret.

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,208
This is not nature.

147
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,583
Her existence itself is one
that destroys the living.

148
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,000
It's outside
of her own desires.

149
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:02,291
Do you not yet understand
what this creature is?

150
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,208
Hokuto is... death.

151
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,916
Death?

152
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,875
The living unconsciously
try to keep death at bay.

153
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,958
They try so hard
to forget it.

154
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,291
However, it exists.

155
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,958
That is a certainty, and
there is no escaping it.

156
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,375
Hokuto's is an existence
that embodies death itself.

157
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,583
Precisely why she sits at
the top of the Shikabane...

158
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,458
And no one can defeat her.

159
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,916
Death?

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,750
How is that?

161
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,250
I am happy to know
her existence...

162
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,416
She's, special.

163
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,250
But... You have
to tell me one thing...

164
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,166
How do I know
her memories?

165
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,166
That's just natural.

166
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,416
What?

167
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,291
There was a family that managed
the human sacrifice custom

168
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,041
of Hokuto's village...

169
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,458
This family embraced
the Kougon Sect...

170
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,000
But only after coming
to know about Shikabane.

171
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,833
And the name of that
family... is Hoshimura.

172
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,708
Your ancestors
created Hokuto.

173
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,958
She was a daughter
in your family.

174
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,875
Both of you have the same blood
running through your veins.

175
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,208
This is why Hokuto
became your enemy.

176
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:24,916
Because for the first time
Hokuto has been given a meaning.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,958
She is your enemy now.

178
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,833
That is to say, she has become
an enemy of the Kougon Sect.

179
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,708
Hence, naturally her power
will be used to destroy them.

180
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,375
We share the same blood...

181
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
That's why you wanted me?

182
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,916
So you'd have some way
to control Hokuto...?

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,458
Is that why?!

184
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,375
And for that...
We are grateful.

185
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:59,208
It's me!
I am your enemy!

186
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,916
Death...

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,833
Death...

188
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,166
Humans die
no matter what.

189
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,125
The Shikabane go
against our philosophy

190
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,500
and we are charged
with killing them.

191
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,375
But no one can
defeat death itself!

192
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,500
I can't...

193
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,416
I can't
defeat her...

194
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,625
I just can't do it...

195
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,708
I'm sorry...

196
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,125
Keisei...

197
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,625
I thought I told you
not to get near her.

198
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,208
You said you'd set all
the Shikabane Hime free.

199
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,875
It'd better not be a lie...

200
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,375
You know what would
happen to you.

But no one can

All of the regrets should
have been completely severed!

I still have a
reason to fight.

208

There's someone in this world
who's crying out for my help!

209
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,791
This must be the base
of the Seven Stars.

Damn it! It's the
Kougon Sect!

211

There's so many of them!

212
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,166
We'll take that
Shikabane Hime back!

213
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,875
And then after that...
We're gonna kill you!

off their escape.

You guys made me your
decoy to find them!

00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,041
I didn't know
anything about it...

218
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,291
Now, we've got this...
Leave it to us.

Shikabane Hime's job,

but he's such
a pain in the ass!

222
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,166
This has to be about more...

223
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,208
Something bigger than the regret
you have with the Seven Stars.

Whoa! Where
are you going...?!

Don't tell me...

Could it maybe
be a date?!

are you going?!

you're a Shikabane...!

No point in trying
to aim for suicide!

Ouri... Is this what
you really want?

I don't know.
Kill me.

Cause I don't know
what else to do. I'm lost.

nothing else I can do.

of a Shikabane...

Now, am I going
to die as a Shikabane?

what I am...

Am I human?
Or a Shikabane?

a little reminder.

forget this, Ouri.

denying the fact!

Not like anyone came
back to rescue me...

could be up to a hundred
thousand people dead.

If just a small fraction
of victims become Shikabane...

314

there could still be
a few hundred of them.
