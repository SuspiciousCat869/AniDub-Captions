1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,291
[Music]

2
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,166
Now then...
Time to destroy you!

3
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,250
Because...

4
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,833
I will live
as a human!

5
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,583
Don't think you can die,
without my permission.

6
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,500
Because...

7
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,708
Because
I need you, Ouri.

8
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,750
Ouri!

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,791
It's gonna crash!

10
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,750
Late-breaking
news this hour.

11
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,458
We have at least
two confirmed reports

12
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,541
of aircraft engine failure.

13
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,750
No word yet if there
are any survivors.

14
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,166
This just in, planes crashing
within minutes of one another.

15
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,333
We'll keep you
updated with details

16
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,208
as soon the story unfolds.

17
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,958
The area surrounding
Ikai Station

18
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,375
appears to have caved in,

19
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,958
resulting in the damage
of buildings nearby.

20
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,583
Due to the emissions
of natural gas,

21
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,208
access has been restricted
to the general public.

22
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,000
This was the Seven
Star's plan all along...

23
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,875
Could we have
foreseen this?

24
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,750
Where are the
Seven Stars now?

25
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
They appear
to have vanished...

26
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,875
We haven't the slightest
clue where they are.

27
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,083
I gave the retreat order
as soon as I received word

28
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,125
of the crashes.

29
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,833
Now is not
the time to argue.

30
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,166
Everything they've done over
these past few months,

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,375
even the death of Senior Tagami,
has been to accomplish this.

32
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,250
The Kougon Sect made us believe
they were just challenging us.

33
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,416
We've been too busy with wild
goose chases to think otherwise.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
We couldn't have known.

35
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,166
They've tried to invade areas
around the head temple,

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,291
while still pursuing
our contracted monks.

37
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,291
And Shikabane have been
created at every turn.

38
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,958
How could we have known

39
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,958
that it was all to spread their
defilement throughout the city?

40
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,083
Given the nature of death, there
will be a large number of them.

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,541
Shikabane produced
in Ikai City could range

42
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,000
from the thousands
to the ten thousands.

43
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,250
The longer we sit here,
the bigger the number.

44
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,833
Wow... This is all starting
to sound like something out

45
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,500
of a really cheesy
horror movie!

46
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,708
[Laughter]

47
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,750
What...? You don't think
it's even a little funny?

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,458
Shame it's not like
an action movie,

49
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,083
I could be
the leading lady.

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,916
For crying out loud...
Would you give it a rest?

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,416
None of us are really in
the mood for jokes, Flesh.

52
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
Why?

53
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,625
Have you forgotten that our
whole reason for being here

54
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,250
is destroy 108 Shikabane?

55
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,625
If there are
swarms of Shikabane,

56
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,125
we'll take
every single one out.

57
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,000
Today could be the day every
one of us goes to heaven!

58
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,791
Is today the day
you wanna die...?

59
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,750
Flesh?

60
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,541
We can't just leave...

61
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,083
There has to be a way
for us to save Ikai City.

62
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,625
If each Shikabane Hime
were able to kill 108,

63
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,083
it still wouldn't be enough.

64
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,250
Are you concerned about
the Shikabane Hime?

65
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,541
Or worried of what
may happen to you...?

66
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,041
Like it or not, the contracts
they've made will run out.

67
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,666
Eradicate the Shikabane
threat within Ikai City.

68
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,208
Your Grace...

69
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,625
This would greatly
weaken our defenses here.

70
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,416
We, the Kougon Sect...

71
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,541
Exist to protect and maintain
order within society.

72
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,458
How many Shikabane
Hime are available?

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,583
Eleven, sir.

74
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,000
They, as well as their
monks, are moving out.

75
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,291
If anyone needs to replenish
their weapons, do it quickly...

76
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,458
Understand?

77
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,625
Where are we going?

78
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,375
Into the depths of Hell.

79
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13,708
Wow... This is going to be so
much fun, I think I might vomit.

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,791
Anything from
Makina Hoshimura?

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,916
Makina's whereabouts
have been unknown

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,333
since we separated
in the underground.

83
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,583
We haven't heard
from Ouri either.

84
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,291
Don't worry, I think the two
of them will be all right.

85
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,708
If I know them at all, I bet
they've destroyed another member

86
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,083
of the Seven Stars
and are on their way.

87
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,041
I hope you're right.

88
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,250
I'll go on my own.

89
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,916
I doubt you'll be
enough to stop him.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,625
But what if ...
something were to happen?

91
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,958
You and I both know

92
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,458
that Akasha's target
isn't the head temple.

93
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,166
We must tend to this
matter on our own.

94
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,541
No one else needs
to be made aware of this,

95
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,791
not even his
Grace Dai-Sojo.

96
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,750
Is that all
you're taking?

97
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,458
What do you expect
us to do...?

98
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,791
Umehara and the others cleaned
the place out for the most part.

99
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,416
And finding these wasn't
easy by any means.

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,250
Do what you must...
But work quickly...

101
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,208
Akasha is coming.

102
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,750
And don't forget...

103
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,666
Our success may very
well rely on you.

104
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,041
We won't allow anyone
near that place.

105
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,250
Contracted monks...
Or Shikabane Hime.

106
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,833
Do not disappoint me.

107
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,416
They're inside!

108
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,125
Are all of you
okay in there?

109
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,375
Ouri!

110
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,833
Hanagami...!

111
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,125
Don't scare
us like that!

112
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,166
Ouri...

113
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,458
Get somewhere safe.

114
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,166
Ouri!

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,375
I'll take care of everyone
until you come for us...

116
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,541
Hanagami!

117
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,125
Ouri...
Acts like Keisei now.

118
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,916
He sure does.

119
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,875
Maybe you should've
gone with them...

120
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,791
They might run into Shikabane
on their way out of town.

121
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,541
I think the Seven Stars
on are the move.

122
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,333
I know where
Hokuto is going.

123
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,000
She's heading to a
different location.

124
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,416
She's going to a place I'm all
too familiar with these days.

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,791
The purification chamber.

126
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,291
We should go.

127
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:09,000
But Shikabane are festering
throughout the city.

128
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,750
You know the others will have
no problem destroying them.

129
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,833
This isn't just
about you anymore.

130
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,125
I want revenge on
the Seven Stars...

131
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,791
Just as much as you do.

132
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,625
Your Grace...

133
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,833
The purification chamber...

134
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,791
Heals a defiled
Shikabane Hime.

135
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,833
We have always relied
on this place...

136
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,750
The land is drenched
in defilement.

137
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,625
But isn't the only
reason for this location.

138
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,541
Combining the power
of the Seven Stars

139
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,083
with a Zadan technique,
Akasha...?

140
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,125
This is bordering on
just plain pathetic!

141
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,333
Is that you,
old friend?

142
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,208
Let's end this.

143
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,875
You got it.

144
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,625
How impertinent.

145
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm not the man
I was before.

146
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
I will show
you no mercy!

147
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,041
Senior Mibu...

148
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,083
Listen to me,
Sadahiro.

149
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,791
I have no desire
to quarrel with you...

150
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,541
My fight is with
the Kougon Sect.

151
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,708
Think about
what you witnessed.

152
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,000
Think about what happened to
my Shikabane Hime on that day...

153
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,666
The fate that awaited
my beloved Hibiki.

154
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,333
You walked right
into a trap.

155
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,083
We were told it was
only a few Shikabane...

156
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,000
But well over 100
ambushed your group.

157
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,875
My Shikabane Hime was the
strongest I'd ever seen.

158
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,000
Even though Hazama's
bugs kept eating her...

159
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,666
She kept fighting...
And fighting...

160
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,541
She fought her hardest...

161
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,375
Until she destroyed
more than 108 Shikabane.

162
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,375
And then she...

163
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,541
That's enough!

164
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,500
You know what
happened to her...

165
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,541
And so does your
Shikabane Hime!

166
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,125
We know all too well.

167
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,000
That's why we not only kill
Shikabane, but human beings.

168
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,208
I didn't have a choice.
I wandered down this path

169
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,000
because I've seen
how dark the world truly is.

170
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,791
But I'm no traitor!

171
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,708
Because not everyone
is like you, Akasha!

172
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,583
Whose Zadan technique
is stronger...?

173
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,333
Let's find out!

174
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,000
Hokuto!

175
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,708
You're producing
the water again?

176
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,458
Just ahead from here lies
the origin of the Kougon Sect.

177
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,583
Then that's where
I must go now...

178
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm their enemy...
Remember?

179
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,208
Wait!

180
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,833
You know where
she's going!

181
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,750
What are you doing
here, Sadahiro?

182
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,166
What's wrong?

183
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,583
It's just...

184
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,333
Some of these people
could be survivors...

185
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,000
And I'm shooting anyone and
anything that I see moving.

186
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,541
I think we're
all doing that.

187
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,666
There were no survivors.

188
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,958
At least, that's what'll be
announced in the morning.

189
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,791
Oh, so big.

190
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,416
I think we're all
in trouble now!

191
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,041
If we get out of this,
I'm gonna slap you.

192
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,500
Well done, my dear...

193
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,458
I expect no less from
the Shikabane Hime

194
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,375
they call the strongest.

195
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,000
Seven Stars...!
Do your worst.

196
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,583
Scatter about your
defilement all you like.

197
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,958
Every one of us swore an oath

198
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,125
to protect the humans
and this world.

199
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,333
Getting the attention of you
and your Shikabane Hime

200
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,708
seems to have worked.

201
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,166
You wish to subdue
the Seven Stars?

202
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,958
The time has come to end
the pitiful lives you lead.

203
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,958
Are you
the reserve unit?

204
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,166
We'd gotten word that
you'd been kidnapped...

205
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,375
But that doesn't appear
to be the case... Good.

206
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,291
Get out of our way.

207
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,583
I can't allow you
to go past this point...

208
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,000
Whether you're
Shikabane Hime or human.

209
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,833
What do you mean
you can't allow us?

210
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,583
I just saw not only Akasha,
but members of the Seven Stars

211
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,333
enter the
purification chamber.

212
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,041
We will stop them...

213
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,083
After we stop
the two of you.

214
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,041
What have we done...?
Why are you stopping us?

215
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,458
Unlike you, we know
how to follow orders...

216
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,958
No one is allowed
to get beyond this point.

217
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,125
What's inside the
purification chamber...?

218
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,291
What are you trying
to hide from us?

219
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,083
Are you really
that stupid?

220
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,458
We wouldn't have to go
through all this trouble

221
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,916
if we could just tell you.

222
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,791
Stop it,
Makina!

223
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,375
Akira is a Shikabane Hime,
just like you are!

224
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,625
She's just an enemy.

225
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,208
C'mon - think this through.

226
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,958
You've seen my Zadan
technique in action;

227
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,750
you know what'll happen.

228
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,375
Get up...! Go back...!

229
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,000
This is far enough.

230
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,666
Not until you explain
why we need to leave.

231
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,958
That's the least
you could do...

232
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,833
What's inside the
purification chamber?

233
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,291
Listen to me
carefully, Ouri...

234
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,416
Shikabane aren't the only
ones we've had to kill.

235
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,458
At times we've had to
resort to killing people.

236
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,583
Occasionally people that
try to make the existence

237
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,125
of Shikabane public after they
learn of it themselves...

238
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,000
Or others that
attempt to hide them.

239
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,458
I'm not talking about a couple
of people here and there...

240
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,791
There are dozens,
maybe even hundreds!

241
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,333
There was a time that
we didn't have to do this.

242
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,083
But times change...

243
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,875
We do what is necessary
for the greater good.

244
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,333
The world is a better place

245
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,916
because of the sacrifices
we make everyday.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,625
The secret the Kougon
Sect is trying to hide...

247
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,208
It's really
that important?

248
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,875
Trust us, you don't need to
concern yourself in this matter.

249
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,875
Don't talk to me like
you know what's best!

250
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,833
Don't pretend for a second
like you two are the only ones

251
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,291
that have been to hell.

252
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,291
This whole time...

253
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,166
All I've ever
known is hell.

254
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,500
And still...

255
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,083
My heart tells me
that hope is not lost...

256
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,208
Out of my way!

257
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,250
That's it!

258
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,208
Ouri...?
Was that your...?

259
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,791
Zadan?

260
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,500
I will... Protect
Makina at all costs!

261
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,291
She's meant
to protect you.

262
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,791
A Shikabane Hime is meant to
act as a shield for her monk.

263
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,041
Protecting her is
just a lost cause!

264
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,333
My brother did everything in his
power to protect me from harm.

265
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,916
Deep down, I know if it wasn't
for me, he'd still be alive.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,375
I never had the chance to repay
him for everything he did.

267
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,125
This is why...

268
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,041
This is why I must do all
that I can to protect Makina.

269
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,125
It's the least I can do

270
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,541
and Brother would
have done the same.

271
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,250
Sadahiro!

272
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm going...
And I'm sorry.

273
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,708
That hurt.

274
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
You didn't even try
to dodge that, did you?

275
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,458
Keisei...

276
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,250
Looks like it was a good thing
you took in the boy after all.

277
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
Akasha.

278
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,875
The reign of the Kougon
Sect is at an end.

279
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,458
The dead will know
what freedom is

280
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,291
and walk the
earth once again.

281
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,291
Shut your mouth,
you treacherous snake!

282
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,750
Quite an impressive
zadan, Gon Dai Sojo.

283
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,500
My technique is only
known by a select few...

284
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,708
It purifies the area...

285
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,833
And eliminates any
defilement within its radius.

286
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,208
My zadan would render any
other's completely powerless.

287
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,916
Leave and take
your pets with you!

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,458
Do you consider
me an enemy, monk?

289
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,875
I should warn you...

290
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,416
If you step into this space,
you'll turn to dust...!

291
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Do you seek death?

292
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,875
I am death.

293
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,625
Hokuto!

294
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,416
It isn't killing her!

295
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,583
Shikabane Hime scripture?

296
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,291
None other than.

297
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,833
The last volume of the scripture
on Shikabane Hime Laws...

298
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,666
One of the most
important and holy

299
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,750
amongst the Kougon
Sect archives.

300
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,625
This one in particular
was once stolen

301
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,916
from the family
of Hoshimura.

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,083
And you were crazy enough

303
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,500
to put that on the body
of a Shikabane?

304
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,041
Indeed...

305
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,916
What could be better than
that when creating a shield?

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,125
No one has the power
to stop Hokuto now.

307
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,791
Hokuto...!

308
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,666
Use your new strength and break
the coffin in front of you!

309
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,750
Makina!

310
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,291
I felt this way when Keisei's
rune was taken from me.

311
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,250
Rika, where are you?

312
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
Why?

313
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,708
Takamasa...

314
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,125
My power...

315
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,000
It's gone.

316
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,208
Takamine...

317
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,250
Our bond...

318
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,458
It can't be.

319
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,083
