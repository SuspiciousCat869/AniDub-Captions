Somebody help me! Please!

00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,291
Tsukiyama!

00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,666
I'm so glad you're here!
You have to save me.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,875
These people, they're--

[KANEKI gasps]

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,958
[TSUKIYAMA]
Sweet Kaneki.

9
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,791
Bon appétit!

[MALE CUSTOMER A] You hear the
news? Another dove's moved in.

13
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,958
[MALE CUSTOMER B]
How many does that make now?

14
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,833
The way things are heading,
I'm scared to go out alone.

15
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,541
[MALE CUSTOMER C]
Remember the good ole' days,

16
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,208
when the 20th Ward was safe?

17
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,541
[YOSHIMURA] That'll be
all for today, Kaneki.

18
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,916
I've asked Kaya to take
things from here.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,375
[KANEKI]
Oh, alright.

20
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
But, sir, where is Touka?

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,625
[IRIMI] She called in sick,
so I'm filling in for her.

22
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,083
[YOSHIMURA] Hey Kaneki. Why
don't you pay her a visit?

23
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,291
[KANEKI] I don't
know if I should.

24
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:34,166
It won't be too much trouble.
After all, she's just upstairs.

25
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,625
[KANEKI]
Ayato Kirishima?

26
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,208
Kay, I'm leaving. Thank you
for keeping an eye on her.

27
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,000
Hinami, be a good girl and
do whatever Touka says, okay?

28
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,750
Bye!

29

[RYOKO gasps]

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,416
Oh. Hi there.

31
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
[TOUKA]
Well?

32
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,583
So what are you doing here?

33
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,958
[KANEKI]
Oh, uh.

34
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,875
I heard you were sick so
I thought I'd check on you.

35
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,000
That's all.

36
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,958
[TOUKA] Mm-hm. So
what'd you bring me?

37
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,208
[KANEKI]
Nothing. Sorry.

38
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,708
[HINAMI] Hey Kaneki,
what is this word?

39
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,750
[KANEKI]
Uh. Let's see.

40
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,666
That word is "orange osmanthus."

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,541
[HINAMI] Is that another flower?
[KANEKI] Mm-hm.

42
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,041
I'll get some
coffee started.

43
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,208
Hey, wait a second
and I'll do it.

44
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,375
[TOUKA]
Nah, you're good.

45
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,208
You're helping Hinami
with her reading.

46
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,000
But if you're not feeling
well, then you should rest.

47
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,041
[TOUKA] I'm fine,
I just ate too much.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,208
[KANEKI gasps]

49
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,125
Ate too much of what?

50
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,666
[KANEKI]
Do I really wanna know?

[TSUKIYAMA]
Non!

53
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,125
Non!

54
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,083
Non!

55
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:51,250
[TOUKA]
Yoriko? Why's she here?

56
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,375
Yoriko.

57
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,875
Hey, what's up?

58
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,958
I'm sorry. I should've called.
But you weren't at school

59
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,875
so I wanted to make
sure you're alright.

60
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,458
[TOUKA] You came by
to check on me?

61
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,833
Yeah. And also--

62
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,958
[YORIKO gasps]

63
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:11,083
Touka! Don't tell
me that you two--!

64
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,750
[TOUKA] Oh no,
that's just Kaneki!

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,166
I get it. I made you
these dumplings.

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,416
Share them with him!

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Listen, I think you've
got the wrong idea.

68
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,458
Hey! Yoriko, wait!

69
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,125
[YORIKO grunts]

70
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,916
[KANEKI]
So. Did I--

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,750
do something wrong,
or am I okay?

72
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,875
[TOUKA groans]

73
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,916
[KANEKI] Geez. Seems
like such a waste.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,208
[TOUKA]
I'll eat it!

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,250
It must've taken her hours
to make this for me!

76
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,666
Wait. You've been making
yourself sick eating human food?

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,583
Yeah? So what?

78
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
[TOUKA chewing, gagging]

79
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,500
[KANEKI] Wow, she's
a really good friend.

80
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,875
[TSUKIYAMA] What should
I do? What should I do?

81
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:12,333
The partaking of Kaneki
must be savored, but how?

82
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,791
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]

83
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,125
Yes, That's it!

00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,208
[TSUKIYAMA whimpers]

85

87
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,041
...not just two but three!

88
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,958
A maestoso locale!

[TSUKIYAMA moaning]

91
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,958
Until finally I...

92
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,625
...Fortissimo!

93
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,208
My sweet Kaneki!

94
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,500
[KANEKI]
Man that hurt.

95
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,958
Yomo's gonna break my
arm one of these days.

96
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,458
[MEN grunting]

97
00:05:56,541 --> 00:06:00,208
[GHOUL A] C'mon, cry
like the bitch you are.

98
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,666
[KANEKI]
It's Nishio!

99
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
[GHOUL A] So how 'bout
we start with his arm?

100
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,833
[GHOUL B]
Sounds good to me.

101
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,750
[KANEKI] I dunno if I should
help after everything he's done.

102
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,083
[NISHIKI screaming]

103
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,250
[GHOULS laughing]

104
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,708
[KANEKI] Hey, uh, sorry
to interrupt, but,

105
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,666
Don't you think that you
might be overdoing it a bit?

106
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,708
No, don't do it, kid.

107
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,083
Not really. What,
is this piece of shit

108
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,958
a friend of yours or somethin'?

109
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,875
[KANEKI] Well, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

110
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,666
[GHOUL A]
Then be a good little boy

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,041
and get the hell outta here.

112
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,708
'Cause we're about to
dig in to the bastard.

113
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,541
[KANEKI]
You're gonna eat him?

114
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,208
[KANEKI grunts]

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Well? You wanna try
your luck, kiddo?

116
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,291
[GHOUL A grunting]

117
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,541
[KANEKI] His speed's
pathetic compared to Yomo's.

118
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,958
Looks like my training
actually paid off.

119
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:50,958
Why, you!

120
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,583
[GHOUL A groaning]

121
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,500
Whoa, I hit him!

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,750
[NISHIKI weakly]
It's called a grudge, kid.

123
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,708
You should try it sometime.

124
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,041
[KANEKI]
Is this your place?

125
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,166
[KIMI gasps]

126
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,166
[KIMI]
Nishiki! What happened?

127
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,375
It seems like every time you
leave you come back hurt!

128
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,458
[NISHIKI] Sorry, my hunger is
driving me completely insane.

129
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,708
[KANEKI grunts]

130
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,041
Don't Kimi, he's okay.

131
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,708
But he's the one who
hurt you last time.

132
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,625
Yeah, He's the guy. Allow
me to introduce you

133
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,166
to the kid who tore that
hole in my stomach.

134
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:40,458
[KANEKI] Excuse me, Kimi?
You're a human, right?

135
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,583
So why do you choose
to be with a ghoul?

136
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,125
[KIMI]
I'm in love with him.

137
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,541
[KANEKI] You know that
he kills other people.

138
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,583
Doesn't that affect
your feelings for him?

139
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,250
[KIMI]
Well, of course it does.

140
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,750
But as long as he doesn't
hurt anyone I care about.

141
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,833
I'll just do my best
not to think about it.

142
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:03,000
Besides, if he didn't kill
them, then he would die.

143
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,500
Well, yeah. That's true.

144
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,041
Please help me.

145
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,541
There's got to be something that
I can do to save Nishiki.

146
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,750
The thing is, if he
doesn't eat, he'll die.

147
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,500
But how am I supposed
to help him with that?

148
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:23,666
[KIMI sobbing]

149
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,708
[KANEKI]
Hey, Kimi. Listen.

150
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,916
I'll see what I can do, okay?

151
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,875
[KIMI]
Thank you so much.

152
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
[KIMI] I've done everything
I can for Nishiki.

153
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,166
I'll just have to trust Kaneki
to take care of the rest.

154
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,416
[KIMI muffled screaming]

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,458
Bonsoir, sweet mademoiselle.
Please forgive me.

156
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,500
But I require your
assistance tonight.

157
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,291
[KANEKI]
It's locked, but why?

158
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,083
[KANEKI] Strange. Even
knowing that he's a ghoul,

159
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,500
she's decided to
stay by his side.

[tap]

[KANEKI gasps]

162
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,458
[KANEKI]
A note with a rose?

163
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,166
Only one person would do this.

164
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,583
[TSUKIYAMA]
"My Sweet Kaneki.

165
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,833
Won't you join me for
supper this evening?

166
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,625
How's midnight sound?
I've already brought

167
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,250
that charming woman you were
speaking with at the park.

168
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,750
But to be honest,

169
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,833
it's your company that I'm
really looking forward to."

170
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,750
[KANEKI gasps]
Kimi!

171
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,916
[loud knocking]

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,083
[KANEKI]
Nishio!

173
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,125
[NISHIKI] Kimi. She
never made it back.

174
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,458
Damn it! Tsukiyama,
you son of a--

175
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,125
This can't be happening!

176
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,833
Why would he do this?

177
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,458
I'm the one he's after
so, that means

178
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,750
It's on me to make this
right. I'll bring her back!

179
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,875
[NISHIKI]
I'm comin' with you.

180
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,625
But in your condition that would
be suicide! He'll kill you!

181
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,041
[NISHIKI] Do you honestly
expect me sit at home

182
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,125
while Kimi's in this mess?

183
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,375
I have to do something.

184
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:28,250
[organ playing]

185
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,583
Ah Kaneki. Tell me, are
you a fan of Beethoven?

186
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,208
[NISHIKI panting]

187
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,208
Tsukiyama!

188
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,833
[TSUKIYAMA]
Well, This is awkward.

189
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,541
I don't recall
inviting you, Nishio.

190
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,500
[NISHIKI] Give Kimi
back, you sick freak!

191
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,416
[TSUKIYAMA] Apologies, but
I simply cannot do that.

192
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,708
I'll be needing her to add
spice to tonight's entrée.

193
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,291
It is essential that she
remain as fresh as possible

194
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,375
for sweet Kaneki's pleasure.

195
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,041
Huh?

196
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,625
Do allow me to explain.

197
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,000
I shall feast upon sweet Kaneki!

198
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,166
But even as I do, I want
him to feast upon her!

199
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,666
You son of a bitch.

200
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,208
But that's so disgusting.

201
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,333
Disgusting? You wound me.

202
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,458
But still, if that's how
you really feel about it...

203
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,625
Then Kaneki, I think it's
important that you realize

204
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,791
it is your flavor, which
has driven me to this.

205
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,875
And You sure as
hell better realize

206
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,791
just how delicious you will be.

207
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,041
[NISHIKI groans]

208
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,458
[KANEKI]
Nishio!

209
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,708
Why don't you take
a load off for a bit?

210
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,666
[KANEKI grunting]

211
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,291
Oh my, you're rather
clumsy aren't you?

212
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,333
Tottling about like a
freshly hatched chick.

213
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,375
Pay attention.

214
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,916
This my friend...

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,375
[KANEKI groaning]

216
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,666
...Is what real
punch feels like.

217
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,041
[KANEKI grunting]

218
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,583
[TSUKIYAMA]
Oh, and this...

219
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,666
[KANEKI groans]

220
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,958
Is what a real
kick feels like.

221
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,458
[KANEKI gasping]
[TSUKIYAMA] Well, my darling,

222
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,625
[TSUKIYAMA]
what sort of attack

223
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,750
would you like to see
demonstrated next?

224
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,916
[TOUKA]
How about that one?

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,375
It's a regular sneak attack.

226
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
[TSUKIYAMA grunts]
[KANEKI] Touka, it's you!

227
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,541
[TSUKIYAMA] I must admit,
this is rather embarrassing.

228
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:15,000
It's been quite a while
since I've been scratched.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,083
When I'm done, you'll
be picking up your teeth

230
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,666
with broken fingers,
ya creepy bastard.

231
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,875
[TSUKIYAMA] You have
such a filthy mouth.

232
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,000
Miss Kirishima.

233
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,666
He's not hurt!

234
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,875
[TSUKIYAMA] I remember a time
when you had that lithe body

235
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,250
of yours honed like
a sharpened blade.

236
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,125
You must've weakened
considerably over the years,

237
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,250
or that scratch would've taken
more than seconds to heal.

238
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,958
[TOUKA] That was just
my way of sayin' hello.

239
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,958
Wouldn't be any fun if it was
over as soon as it started.

240
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,583
Oh my goodness, such
a feisty little girl.

241
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,666
But still...

242
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,791
that's always been the heart
of your charm, my lovely.

243
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,875
[TOUKA grunts]

244
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,250
Do you really think that's
enough to beat me?

245
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,375
[TOUKA grunting]

246
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,708
[TSUKIYAMA]
Remember when you were 14,

247
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,250
and I was 18?

248
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,791
[TSUKIYAMA] Those cold,
piercing eyes of yours

249
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,208
that shone like crystal shards.

250
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,791
I will never forget
their beauty.

251
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,000
Tryin' to win me over with
words? Well, forget it!

252
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,541
I'm not ashamed to admit,

253
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,583
I was quite smitten
with you back then.

254
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,166
[TSUKIYAMA groans]

255
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,833
[KANEKI] I'm leaving and
I'm taking Kimi with me.

256
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,125
Tonight, you're going hungry.

257
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,625
That was a good kick. I mean it.

258
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,666
[TSUKIYAMA laughing]
Oh, brother.

259
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,791
Where were we?

260
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,833
Oh yes.

261
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,416
[KANEKI screaming]

262
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,375
Now then. Let's have a taste.

263
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,625
[KANEKI groans]

264
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,208
[KANEKI coughing, groaning]

265
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,291
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]

266
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,208
[TSUKIYAMA]
Tres bien!

267
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,708
So exquisite!

268
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:04,583
A symphony of flavor
played in perfect harmony!

269
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,833
Ah, yes! It's even
greater than I imagined!

270
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,375
But now that I've had a taste,

271
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,166
I want something even
more extravagant!

272
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,708
I can't allow my morsel
to die like this!

273
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,791
No.

274
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,125
Not before he's feasted
on my offering!

275
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,166
[TOUKA grunts]

276
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,708
Once upon a time, your cold,
dark heart set mine a flutter.

277
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,333
Sad to say that's
no longer the case.

278
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,500
Something's lit a
fire in your eyes,

279
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,916
and you grow softer as you melt.

280
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,166
[TOUKA gasps]

281
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,791
[TSUKIYAMA] It's truly
a shame, Miss Kirishima.

282
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:41,583
You see. Softness is the
last thing that you need.

283
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,833
Touka, no!

284
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,458
Stop interrupting my meal!

285
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,458
No, wait! I'm the one
you wanna eat, right?

286
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,125
Don't tell me you forgot.

287
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,333
I want to eat you as
you eat her, remember?

288
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:03,666
How can you kill people so
easily? Don't you care at all?

289
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,541
It's only natural.

290
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,291
Ghouls are equal-opportunity
carnivores.

291
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,500
Think of life on this
planet as a whole.

292
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,125
Mankind eats every beast
that squirms or crawls.

293
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,583
Since human's are all we eat,

294
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,500
we level the playing field
for other creatures.

295
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,958
What is this?

296
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,875
Such a repulsive scar.

297
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,208
Kimi.

298
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,375
Hey, Nishiki.

299
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,916
I'm sorry. It's just that

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,541
I don't want to eat
people anymore, Sis.

301
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,208
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
But we don't have a choice.

302
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:44,500
Humans eat animals like cows and
pigs the same way we eat them.

303
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,708
[YOUNG NISHIKI]
But I don't wanna kill anyone.

304
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,916
It's okay. You don't
have to hurt anybody.

305
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,833
[YOUNG NISHIKI]
You're gonna work?

306
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,833
Yep. You don't want us to
live like stray cats forever,

307
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,125
now do you?

308
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,666
[YOUNG NISHIKI]
Well, no.

309
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,125
Nobody's gonna find out about
us. Don't worry, little bro.

310
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,416
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
Okay, I gotta go!

311
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,208
[YOUNG NISHIKI]
Be careful out there.

312
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,708
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
Okay, I gotta go!

313
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,125
[YOUNG NISHIKI]
Be careful out there.

314
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,166
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
Well, guess who got fired today?

315
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,875
[TEEN NISHIKI]
Not again.

316
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,208
What's up?

317
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,333
I didn't realize how much
taller you've gotten.

318
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,833
You look just like dad now!

319
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,875
[TEEN NISHIKI]
Who was that?

320
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,291
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
He's the manager at work.

321
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,875
Now butt out.

322
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,708
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Which way did they run?

323
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,166
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Search over that way!

324
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,833
[TEEN NISHIKI]
C'mon Sis, please!

325
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,083
You've gotta stay
with me, you have to!

326
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,625
Little bro. Take
care of yourself.

327
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,458
You're on your own.

328
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,541
No, Sis! I need you!

329
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,000
Stay strong! Don't die on me!

330
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,625
[NISHIKI'S SISTER]
You have to live.

331
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,625
[TEEN NISHIKI screaming]

332
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,791
[TEEN NISHIKI]
Yup, you're the one

333
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,250
who turned her in, all right.

334
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,958
[MANAGER] No, d-don't
do this. Spare me.

335
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,666
I'm begging you!

336
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,833
[TEEN NISHIKI]
You've reaped what you sowed.

337
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,666
Both you and my sister.

338
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,958
[TEEN NISHIKI]
Not me though.

339
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,166
'Cause I'll never trust a soul.

340
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,375
Hey. You forgot your change.

341
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,541
[NISHIKI]
Here ya go.

342
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,583
Thanks, that was nice of you.

343
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,791
[NISHIKI]
She's a pale looking girl.

344
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,250
But who knows? She might
be useful for something.

345
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,583
[NISHIKI]
I really like your name.

346
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,833
[KIMI]
Why?

347
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,958
'Cause "Kimi"
means "noble future".

348
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,750
So who came up with it anyway?

349
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,833
Your mom or your dad?

350
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,791
[KIMI sobbing]

351
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,250
What's wrong?

352
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,625
[NISHIKI] What the hell?
Was it something I said?

353
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,166
[NISHIKI coughing]

354
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,041
[NISHIKI]
Kaneki, you son of a bitch!

355
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,666
How come this wound won't heal?

356
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,250
Dammit! I need to
eat some flesh!

357
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,125
Hey, Nishiki?

358
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,375
[KIMI gasps]

359
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,916
[KIMI] Oh my goodness!
What happened to you?

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,500
Are you bleeding?

361
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,958
[NISHIKI growling]
[KIMI screaming]

362
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,416
[NISHIKI] You're a real
lifesaver Kimi, do ya know why?

363
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,041
'Cause otherwise I'd be
shit outta luck right now!

364
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,625
[NISHIKI coughs]

365
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,791
[NISHIKI] It's no use.
I don't have the strength.

366
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,875
Nishiki, you--
you're a ghoul?

367
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,125
[NISHIKI panting]
This is just great.

368
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,958
Now she's gonna report me
and it'll be game over.

369
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,291
I'll end up dead
just like my sister.

370
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,583
Ah well, it's been
a lousy life anyway.

371
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,041
[KIMI]
Here you go.

372
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,541
[NISHIKI snarles]
[KIMI gasps]

373
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,333
[KIMI] If we're being honest,
then I should let you in

374
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,291
on a secret I've been
keeping from you.

375
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,875
The day that I met you
I had lost my mom, dad,

376
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,875
and little brother in a car
accident. I was crushed.

377
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:28,750
I felt like I had nothing
left to live for in this world.

378
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,375
Then you came along and
gave me a reason to live.

379
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,791
You see,

380
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,083
I owe you my life.

381
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,125
[NISHIKI yelling]

382
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,208
[NISHIKI]
That's all I need.

383
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,375
[NISHIKI yelling]

384
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,583
[NISHIKI shouting]

385
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,666
What are you, stupid?

386
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,500
[NISHIKI groans]

387
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,416
[NISHIKI] I always knew
that trusting a human

388
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,541
would get me killed.
And nothing's changed.

389
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,666
I've just found one
who's worth dying for.

390
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,208
[NISHIKI grunting]

391
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,875
You're wearing at my patience.

392
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,125
[NISHIKI shouting]

393
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,416
You don't stand a chance
if you can't use your kagune.

394
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,458
It is the source
of our strength!

395
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,166
The most powerful
weapon we possess!

396
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,833
If your kagune
is an engine,

397
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,916
Human flesh is the fuel.

398
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,625
If a ghoul has a poor diet,

399
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,000
he'll find his kagune's
strength severely diminished.

400
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,333
[TOUKA] Yeah, I know
that all too well.

401
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,375
[KANEKI]
Whaddya mean?

402
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,875
I didn't expect Yoriko's cooking
to make me so much weaker.

403
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,416
[TSUKIYAMA]
Well, enough of that.

404
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,708
Now, for tonight's main event.

405
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,666
You're becoming quite
the pest, Nishio.

406
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
Let her go!

407
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
[TSUKIYAMA] Damn you!
Stop annoying me!

408
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,875
Stop annoying me!

409
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,125
[TSUKIYAMA sighs]
See?

410
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,916
That's what happens when
you get me all riled up.

411
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,500
[NISHIKI] I've got nothing.
I'm alone in this world.

412
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,041
Except for Kimi,
she's all I've got.

413
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,000
Lay a hand on her
and I'll kill you.

414
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,416
I swear.

415
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,541
Even if it kills me.

416
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,666
What can we do?

417
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,541
[KANEKI] If we want
to use our kagune,

418
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,333
we have to eat.

419
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:42,208
Hey, Touka. So who's stronger
when at full strength?

420
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,750
You or Tsukiyama?

421
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,333
The last time I fought
him, we were about even.

422
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,541
Okay. Here's the plan.

423
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,958
[NISHIKI groans]

424
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,333
[TSUKIYAMA sighes]
There. That should do it.

425
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,916
You're lucky I didn't
kill you the first time.

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,291
[KANEKI]
Tsukiyama!

427
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,208
Huh?

428
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,000
Here goes.

429
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,000
Look away.

430
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,208
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]

431
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:17,166
[KANEKI grunting]

432
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,583
[TSUKIYAMA gasping]

433
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,125
He belongs to me!

434
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,125
[TSUKIYAMA grunting]

435
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,666
[TOUKA]
You think he's yours?

436
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,083
No way.

437
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,583
[TOUKA] I hate to break
it to you, Tsukiyama.

438
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,125
But nothing here belongs to you.
