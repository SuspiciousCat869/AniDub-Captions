00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
[RIZE giggles]

157
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,625
Crazy, right? So then Hide asks,

158
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,250
"Do you like me
or novels better?"

159
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,500
[RIZE]
Which one did you pick?

160
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,750
[KANEKI]
Novels, duh.

161
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,916
[RIZE giggling]
He sounds like a funny guy

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,791
[KANEKI]
Yeah, he is.

163
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,416
[RIZE] Have you always
been into reading

164
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,166
or is it more of
a newfound passion?

165
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,833
[KANEKI]
I grew up around books.

166
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,750
My dad had a ton in the house.

167
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,250
He passed away
when I was little.

168
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,750
I barely even remember
him. It may sound weird

169
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,833
but when I read his books
I felt closer to him.

170
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,166
My mom had to work
a lot to make ends meet

171
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,875
so I spent most of my
time home alone reading.

172
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,958
Then, ever since my mom died...

173
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,250
[KANEKI gasps]
Hide's the only person

174
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,583
I've talked to about this.

175
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,166
[RIZE] Thanks for
sharing it with me.

176
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,541
[RIZE]
It's this way.

177
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,375
[KANEKI]
Oh, okay.

178

[YORIKO humming]

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,958
[YORIKO] Is there
something wrong, Touka?

180
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,708
Nuh-uh. It's nothing.

181

[RIZE] Well, I'm right
over here, so, Goodnight.

Rize, um...

183
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,583
[KANEKI] I'd like to
see you again. I mean,

184
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,333
only if you want to.

185
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,875
[RIZE]
Oh, I see.

186
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
Well, we have similar
taste in books.

187
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,208
And we're both the same age.

188
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,416
I suppose we do have
a lot in common.

[KANEKI]
Uh, yeah?

192
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,708
[RIZE] The truth is,
I've had my eye on you, too.

193
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,958
I'll admit, I love the
way you look at me.

194
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,583
[KANEKI] Does that mean
you feel the same way?

195
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,083
[RIZE]
Yeah. I want you,

196
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,000
Just as much as you...

197
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,500
...want me.

[RIZE] You see,
here's the thing.

206
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,875
There's something I like
even more than reading.

207
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,083
Know what that is?

208
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,125
Ripping the organs
out of someone

to run away from me.

Oh, how I love the
look on your face!

So what do you say, Kaneki?

Will you let me have my fun?

you died on me.

Aw, that's too bad.

I was hoping you'd
last a little longer.

228

You've got just the right
amount of fat on you.

And your flesh is so
tender and tasty.

00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,708
...I thought I was
on a date with Rize.

[KANOU] How are you
feeling today, Kaneki?

tell me you haven't eaten

you were admitted.

But there doesn't seem
to be anything wrong with you.

00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,833
I know. I feel okay.

264
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,458
It's my sense of taste.

[KANOU]
Care to explain?

tastes disgusting to me.

Then why do I feel this way?

274

[KANEKI] Everything that
happened that day with Rize.

almost like some strange dream.

But one thing's for
sure. Ever since then,

understand about these attacks.

There's no need for
a ghoul to eat this much

in such a short amount of time.

Let me ask you this Mr. Ogura,

294
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,000
why can't ghouls be satisfied

that humans do?

296

[OGURA]
Well, to put it simply,

297
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,833
they can only derive
nutrition from human flesh.

298

Eating anything else can
actually be detrimental to them.

Our food tastes
disgusting to ghouls.

differently than ours do.

00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,958
[HIDE] I even got you your
favorite hamburger!

313
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,958
[KANEKI]
Hide...

314
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,250
Did you go out and
buy this just for me?

315
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,625
[KANEKI]
This can't be happening.

316

Worried about your friend?

319
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,833
Yeah.

320
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,875
They released him
from the hospital.

321
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,500
But I can't seem to reach him. I
went to go see him a few times.

322
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,750
But he didn't want any visitors.

323
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,708
[NISHIKI] Sounds kinda
rude, if you ask me.

324
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,125
I'd cut ties with him.

325
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,833
[HIDE] Kaneki and I have
been pals since we were kids.

326
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,416
He's my best friend.

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,166
Isn't that sweet?

328

[phone beeps]

329
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,291
[HIDE] What's up, Kaneki?
You feelin' any better?

330
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
Anyway, just wanted to let you
know Takatsuki what's-her-name

331
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,250
is doing a signing
at the bookstore

00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,625
in front of the station.

333
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,458
Gimme a call when you
feel up to it, dude. Later.

[KANOU]
He needs her organs to survive!

365
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,208
[OGURA] Ordinary blades such
as hunting knives or kitchenware

366
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,916
can't cut their flesh.

[KANEKI]
Let's see.

368
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,166
If that's true
and I'm a ghoul...

369

This won't hurt!

What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

375
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,416
[KANEKI]
Kill a person.

376
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,833
Take their flesh. And eat it!

377
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,458
What's gotten into me?

[KANEKI]
What is that scent?

381
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,916
I've never smelled it before.

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,166
But there's something
familiar about it.

383
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,083
It's got a sweet aroma to it.

384
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,541
Almost like my
mom's home cooking.

[KANEKI]
Who cares what it is!

I've finally found
something I can eat!

Where is it?

[KANEKI grunts]

[KANEKI]
A ghoul. A human!

394
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,916
The sweet smell that lured
me here was a corpse?

[KAZUO gasps]

You're a ghoul... aren't you?

397
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,083
What's wrong? Are you all right?

398
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:15,500
Don't cry. It's okay, I'm Kazuo.
I haven't eaten in a while

399
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,166
so I'm afraid I can't
share too much with you,

400
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,416
but here, you can have some-

401
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
[NISHIKI]
Good riddance.

402
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,916
You should know better
than to trespass

403
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,125
on my feeding grounds.

404
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,500
[NISHIKI]
I've never seen you before.

405
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,000
Whoa, how come only
one of your eyes is red?

406
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,500
That looks pretty nasty.

407
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,750
[KANEKI groans]

408
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,041
[NISHIKI] Did you think
you could hunt for food

409
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,791
on my feeding grounds
and get away with it?

410
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,666
No, I--

411
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,291
I didn't do it.

412
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,458
[KANEKI]
Look, I swear!

413
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,750
I just happened
to be passing by.

414
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,375
[NISHIKI]
You think I believe that?

415
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,000
Imagine this, your girlfriend is
naked and lying on the ground.

416
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,333
A guy standing over her with his
pants around his ankles says,

417
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,916
"I didn't do it! I swear!
I was just passing by!"

418
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,250
That's basically the same
as what you're telling me

419
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,125
right now. If someone did that
to my girl, I'd kill him.

420
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,000
So that's what I'm
gonna do to you.

421
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,291
If you trespass on
my territory, you die-

422
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,708
[TOUKA]
This isn't your territory!

423
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,625
Which means he wasn't
trespassing, Nishiki.

424
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,958
So let him go.

425
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,375
Touka.

426
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,708
[KANEKI gasping, coughing]

427
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,458
[NISHIKI] I don't see
what the problem is,

428
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
I know that binge
eating bitch is dead.

429
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,083
[TOUKA] How does that make
this your feeding ground?

430
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,416
You don't have any say in how
the territory Rize stole

431
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,416
in the 20th Ward gets
distributed among

432
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,458
the weaker ghouls. Just leave it
up to those of us at Anteiku.

433
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,250
Huh? Y'know, I still don't
understand why we've gotta run

434
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,500
every little thing by a bunch
of fence-sitters like Anteiku!

435
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,583
I'm just reclaiming what's mine.

436
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,625
This was my feeding ground--

437
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,375
[TOUKA]
Yeah, because you were weak.

438
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,250
[NISHIKI] I don't
appreciate being insulted

439
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,250
by a punk kid with
a smart-mouth.

440
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,166
Watch it, you're
starting to piss me off.

441
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,375
Think I'm scared?

442
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,750
[NISHIKI]
You should be!

443
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,375
[TOUKA yelling]

444
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,708
Is that all you've
got, Touka?

445
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,083
[TOUKA]
Wait for It.

446
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,083
[NISHIKI groans]

447
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,625
Do you want me to go
harder next time?

[NISHIKI panting, grunting]

449

You don't wanna take
your corpse with you?

Do you want this?

[KANEKI grunting]

454
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,916
[TOUKA]
You're not eating?

455
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,833
[KANEKI panting]

456
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:45,500
Oh wow, only one of your eyes
has changed, that's crazy.

457
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,625
Wait, you're the guy
who was with Rize!

458
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,416
[TOUKA]
Why didn't she eat you?

459
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,416
And what's with your eye?

460
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,291
[KANEKI grunting]

461
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,833
Please Miss, you
have to help me!

462
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,583
[KANEKI] I know you might find
this hard to believe this, but,

463
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,583
I'm actually human.

464
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,041
And yet I wanna eat that!

465
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:08,250
Part of me wants to shove it
in my mouth. But I know I can't.

466
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,625
'Cause if I do, I
won't be a human!

467
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,041
If you're in that much
pain, then just eat.

468
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:21,458
[KANEKI grunting]

469
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:27,291
No way! No way! No way!
No way! No way!

470
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,833
There's no way
that I could ever

471
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,541
eat another person's flesh!

472
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,625
[KANEKI] I can't be a ghoul.
Not if this is what it's like.

473
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,458
I've never even hurt a fly, so
how am I supposed to fight?

474
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,000
And I have to kill to eat?!

475
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:43,166
Well, I won't!
'Cause I'm a human!

476
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,541
This is ridiculous. Why don't
you just give in, already?

477
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,875
If you don't have the nerve
to eat it on your own.

478
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,250
[TOUKA]
Then let me give you a hand.

479
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,916
[KANEKI grunts]

480
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,833
[KANEKI swallowing]

481
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:41,000
Yoshida Kazuo, age 41 "Ghoul"

482
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,875
Occupation:
aerobics class instructor.

483
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,583
On his day off,
he visits Anteiku

484
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,875
and takes over a feeding
ground from Nishimura.

485
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,541
Once he's home,
he selects his target.

486
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,250
He kills them and then
prepares to eat.

487
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,583
All of a sudden a
young ghoul shows up.

488
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,583
The kid starts screaming
and trembling

489
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,083
and sobbing uncontrollably

490
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,541
Before he can help he gets
whooped by Nishiki.

491
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:06,958
Yoshida Kazuo, one-time
aerobics class instructor,

492
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,916
dead at just 41 years old.
