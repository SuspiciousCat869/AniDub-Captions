[TSUKIYAMA inhaling]

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,791
Long time no see, Mon Cheri.

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,375
What is it?

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,666
Oh, come now, I'm a
customer. Then again,

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,333
I can't expect too much from
someone with your charms.

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,125
[TOUKA] You're lucky
I'm at work right now.

[TSUKIYAMA]
Who's this morsel?

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,875
You're new around here.
What's your name?

10
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,333
Um. I'm Kaneki.

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,583
Oh?

[KANEKI whimpers]

[TSUKIYAMA]
C'est mangnifique.

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,875
Leave him alone.

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,750
Stop soliciting and take your
skeevy sideshow somewhere else.

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,125
You really have no sense
of tact, my dear.

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,875
I look forward to
trying your coffee.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,083
Give Yoshimura my best.

19
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,791
[KANEKI]
Uh, sure.

20
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,125
Ravissant! Ciao,
then! See you soon.

21
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,791
My Sweet Kaneki.

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,375
Wow. Who was that guy?

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,500
Keep your guard
up around him.

24
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,875
[TOUKA] He's one of
20th Ward's parasites.

25
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,041
[WAITER speaking french] Next
we have a local girl's eyes,

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,500
prepared in the French style.

27
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,958
[TSUKIYAMA]
Merci.

28
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,291
Well, Kaneki, dear.

29
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,625
I want you.

30
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,041
And I'll have you.

[YORIKO]
For real?

32
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,500
Now what's wrong?

33
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,333
Just the carbs in your hand.

34
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,333
[TOUKA] Yeah, so? I like
to keep my food travel size.

35
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,375
[YORIKO] That's no excuse!
You need to eat right!

36
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,583
Let's see, eenie, meenie,
miney, mo! Perfect!

37
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,666
Alright, down the hatch!

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,583
No, I'm fine.

39
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:14,208
You can't live on processed
sugar. Come on, try some!

40
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,208
Okay, fine.

41
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,166
[YORIKO] I played around
with the seasoning some more.

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,750
Do you like it?

43
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,500
What is it?

44
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,958
Touka!

45
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,583
I guess it's pretty good.

46
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,666
You're just saying that
to spare my feelings.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,041
No, I like it.

48
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,708
[YORIKO giggling]

[TOUKA]
Keep it down! Keep it down!

Keep it down!

This sucks.

...to the chef.

[TSUKIYAMA]
Kaneki?

00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,875
Hello.

61
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,208
[KANEKI]
Hi. Can I help you, or?

62
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,208
[TSUKIYAMA]
Shu Tsukiyama. May I join you?

63
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,208
[KANEKI]
Sure. Be my guest.

64
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,833
[TSUKIYAMA]
Merci beaucoup.

65
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:25,583
Uh. So what brings you
to Kamii University today?

66
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,791
What if I told you,
you're what brings me?

67
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:33,333
[KANEKI] Huh? Oh. I'm, uh,
really flattered, but--

68
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,500
[KANEKI]
I gotta remember he's a gourmet.

69
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,291
A parasite of the 20th Ward.

70
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,333
I had a feeling I'd find you
lost in the pages of a book.

71
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,791
A bird from Anteiku
told me of your passion.

72
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,458
[KANEKI] Yeah, well. I'm not
sure I'd call it a 'passion'.

73
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,916
[TSUKIYAMA] I love books.
With just one sentence,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you can lose yourself
in someone else's dreams.

75
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,083
The way I see it, literature
serves as the bridge

76
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,916
by which readers connect
with an author's mind.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Allowing us to truly know
and relish their thoughts.

78
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,750
Splendid, yes? While the
writer spins their tale,

79
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,125
we freely walk the
tapestry they weave.

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,833
Immersing yourself in
a book is liberation.

81
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,250
You can truly forget
yourself, if but for a time.

82
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,666
Whoa. You really
like books, huh?

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,000
[TSUKIYAMA chuckles]

84
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,500
Well, they have
carried me through

85
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:30,041
many a bitter circumstance,
those treasured tapestries.

86
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,000
[KANEKI]
He's a lot like me.

87
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,000
[TSUKIYAMA]
Oh, what's this?

88
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,166
I didn't know you
liked Takatsuki.

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,625
[KANEKI]
Oh, yeah.

90
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,791
Her style fringes on the
side of delicacy sometimes.

91
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,958
But her eloquence and
elusive way with words

92
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,541
really draws me in, you know?

93
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,583
[TSUKIYAMA] Well put. I'm
also a fan of her work.

94
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
So he likes Takatsuki, does he?

95
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,208
Splendid.

96
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,750
Hey, There's this café run
by a fellow bibliophile.

97
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,375
Would you care to go
with me sometime?

98
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,375
Rumor has it Takatsuki
visits every now and then.

99
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,791
Whoa. She does, really?

100
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,375
Um. Sorry, I can't.

101
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,875
I guess Kirishima warned
you to keep your distance?

102
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,541
[KANEKI]
No, it's not like that--

103
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,500
Please, I'm not offended.

104
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,666
Believe me, I'm used
to being misunderstood.

105
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,250
It's just, since
Miss Kamishiro died,

106
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,375
it's been hard to
find good company.

107
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,875
Miss Kamishiro?

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,375
Wait, are you
talking about Rize?

109
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,500
You and Rize have a very
similar vibe about you.

110
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,833
Ghouls who love books are
something of a rarity, you see.

111
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,416
Truth be told, I just wanted
a friend that I could chat with

112
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,291
about things that interest me in
a quiet and comfortable place.

113
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,375
[KANEKI]
Hey, hold up!

114
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,791
I'd love to join you.

115
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,416
Great! Then I'll see you
this Sunday at 3 o'clock.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,125
He didn't really seem like
he was all that bad to me.

117
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,541
You're done for the day, so
why don't you head on home?

118
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,625
Uh, yes, sir.
Have a good evening.

119
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,458
Oh, And one last thing.

120
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,833
Yomo's downstairs
waiting to speak to you.

121
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,375
He wants to speak to me?

122
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,875
But why?

123
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,208
So, uh. What's the deal?

124
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,958
[KANEKI]
He's as tight-lipped as always.

125
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,958
Doves have been spotted
inside the 20th Ward.

126
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,666
Huh? And that means?

127
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,625
[YOMO] It's dangerous
for us out there.

128
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,500
So you're going to need to
learn how to protect yourself.

129
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,083
Let's go!

130
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,500
[KANEKI]
Hold on, I'm not ready!

131
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,333
[KANEKI grunting]

132
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,666
[YOMO grunts]

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,291
[KANEKI panting]

134
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,958
On the bright side, you're
a natural at dodging attacks.

135
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,208
It's everything
else you suck at.

136
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,250
Ya think?

137
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,958
[YOMO] Stop by here after
your shifts. I'll train you.

138
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,000
[KANEKI panting]
Yeah, sure thing.

139
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,541
[KANEKI panting]

140
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,041
[YOMO]
Are you comin' or what?

141
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,833
We've got one more stop
to make before you're done.

142
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,958
[ITORI] So you're the
famous Kaneki, huh?

143
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm so terribly delighted
that you came to see me.

144
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,125
I've heard so much about
you from Ren and Uta, here.

145
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,291
All good, of course.

146
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,208
I'm Itori, and this
is my bar! Welcome!

147
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,833
Thanks for having me.

148
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,291
C'mon, loosen up, kiddo!
No need to stress.

149
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,708
We won't bite you.

150
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,833
Uh...

151
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,000
So have the three of you known
each other for a long time?

152
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,250
Long enough to be stuck with
each other. But, way back when,

153
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,083
Ren and Uta weren't exactly
on the best of terms, you see.

154
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,291
Because of them, the
4th Ward was even more

155
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,625
of a shit-hole than it is now.

156
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,250
But we've moved past
those days. Haven't we?

157
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,500
[YOMO]
Yeah, I guess.

158
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,250
Once upon a time, Ren
was a total wild man.

159
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,333
Weren't you, Renny?

160
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,958
Um. Was he that bad?

161
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,000
[UTA] Yeah. Touka kinda
reminds me of Renny

162
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,083
when she blows a gasket.

163
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,916
You know what,
you're totally right!

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
Whoa, that sounds
terrifying to me.

165
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,500
Enough talking about the past.

166
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,541
Now. Didn't you have something
you wanted to tell him, Itori?

167
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,541
[ITORI]
Oh! I almost forgot!

168
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,375
Here! Bottoms up!

169
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,333
Oh, no thanks.
I'm still underage.

170
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,875
Silly thing. Don't
worry, it's not wine.

171
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,500
[KANEKI]
Ah! What the heck!

172
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,541
Hoo-hoo! Wow! It's
just like you said!

173
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,750
A one-eyed ghoul!

174
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,041
Sorry 'bout that.
But you can relax.

175
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,291
It's just us ghouls here.

176
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,166
[ITORI] Take this. Maybe
that'll make it up to you.

177
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,958
Hm. I wonder if the
other one-eyed ghoul

178
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,541
is anything like Kaneki here.

179
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,583
[YOMO]
Who knows?

180
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,166
Wait. You mean there's another
ghoul out there who's like me?

181
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,208
Oh, have I piqued your interest?

182
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,375
[KANEKI]
Yes.

183
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,875
Great! First, let me
ask you something.

184
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,416
If a human and ghoul fell
in love with each other.

185
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,125
What would you get?
If 'the magic' happened?

186
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,541
You'd get a hybrid of
the two of them. I guess.

187
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,541
Hm. What you get is a corpse.

188
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,583
[KANEKI]
Huh?

189
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,000
[ITORI] They just don't
mix. Even if they managed

190
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,083
to conceive, the child would
be too weak to survive.

191
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,583
But, there are the miraculous
few who beat the odds.

192
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,916
And give birth to a
healthy ankle biter.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,583
Just like me. They'd
be a half-breed.

194
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,958
[ITORI] For some reason,
a half-blooded ghoul

195
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,541
is far superior to
a full-blooded one.

196
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,000
And the hybrid in
question has a red eye.

197
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,791
On the opposite
side that you do.

198
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:31,500
Then again, those stories are
little more than urban legends.

199
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,791
[KANEKI]
A one-eyed ghoul...

200
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,958
Um, If you don't mind.

201
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,625
More? Of course not!
Ask away, kid.

202
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,958
Okay. Then do you know
anything about Rize Kamishiro?

203
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,250
[YOMO grunts]

204
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,750
Oh ha-ha. Any special reason?

205
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,625
She's a big part of
what happened to me.

206
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,583
Since I met her, my life's gone
to hell in a hand basket.

207
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,250
[ITORI]
Mm-hm.

208
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,458
And yet, after all
that's happened,

209
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,916
I know nothing about her.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,833
That makes a lot of sense.
Where should I start?

211
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,791
She was a troublemaker
from the word 'go'.

212
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,916
If her death hadn't
been so mysterious,

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,791
I kinda doubt she'd
be on anyone's mind.

214
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,541
[KANEKI]
How was it "mysterious"?

215
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,958
It was just an accident.

216
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,125
Is that right? The biggest
glutton in the 20th Ward

217
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,833
just happened to be
crushed to death?

218
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,458
Talk about gullible.

219
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
Hey, watch it.

220
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,833
[ITORI] You see, there
are more than a few

221
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,625
rumors floating around,
and they all say

222
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,583
that someone was spotted
on top of the building

223
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,333
at the same time as
your little "accident".

224
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,791
For real?

225
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,875
So, what you're telling me
is, it wasn't a coincidence?

226
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,958
I'm telling you someone
wanted Rize dead. Or worse.

227
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,916
That's enough!

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm just sayin'! Lighten up!

229
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,125
They're only rumors. There's
no need to put stock in them.

230
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,458
[YOMO grunts]

231
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,375
[KANEKI] If it's true.
Who would have done that?

232
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,875
[TSUKIYAMA]
Kaneki.

233
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,625
Kaneki?

234
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,333
Uh, yeah?

235
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,875
What's bothering
you, my friend?

236
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,541
[KANEKI]
Oh, nothing!

237
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,666
May I ask you something?

238
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
Sure. Go ahead.

239
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,750
[KANEKI]
I was just wondering

240
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,958
what you and Rize
used to talk about.

241
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,916
Ah, Miss Kamishiro.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,250
As I said before, we were
both partial to reading.

243
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,208
Dining was also
a favorite topic.

244
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,708
[RIZE]
Thank you, Tsukiyama.

245
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,583
I appreciate
the invitation.

246
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,791
But I have no interest in your
group of VIP food snobs.

247
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,333
It's just not my speed.

248
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,291
Mais pourquoi? Tell me,

249
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,333
why would you deny yourself
the taste of quality?

250
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,500
As long as you fit
your meals on a plate,

251
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,416
they won't do it for me.
Now don't get me wrong.

252
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,958
Nothing makes a
good binge better

253
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,000
than a nice, delectable prime
cut. It's just, the thought

254
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,541
of ghouls creating high-brow
versions of their entrees.

255
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,083
It sounds more like a sick
joke than high-society.

256
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,583
Wouldn't you say?

257
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,208
That ignoble sow! How dare
she mock my dining!

258
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,375
"La vengeance est un plat
qui se mange froide!"

259
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,500
Uh. Wow. Are you okay?!

260
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,666
Ow!

261
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]
My apologies!

262
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,833
I can't believe I
was so careless.

263
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,000
[KANEKI] It's all right.
It's just a little cut.

264
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,583
Nothing major.

265
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,458
Uh. I'll tell you what, Kaneki.
Let me make this up to you.

266
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,333
Miss Kamishiro's
favorite hangout

267
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,458
isn't very far from here.
Would you like to see it?

268
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,125
That is one way to get to
know her. Sure, let's go!

269
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,916
Great! We should head there now!
No time like the present.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,416
How is your finger holding up?

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,875
I think the bleeding stopped.

272
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,416
But I got your
handkerchief dirty.

273
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,958
Let me wash it real fa--

274
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,166
Oh, Please! I couldn't allow you
to clean a mess that I made.

275
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,958
[TSUKIYAMA]
Don't worry, it's in good hands.

276
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,666
[TSUKIYAMA panting]

277
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,500
[TSUKIYAMA]
I almost slipped up.

278
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,333
Another spook like that and this
fawn will scurry out of sight.

279
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:46,416
Be cool. Smooth and
steady. That's the ticket.

280
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,333
Shu Tsukiyama. The
wait is almost over.

281

[TSUKIYAMA giggling, inhaling]

282
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:01,291
Such a tender and
mellow harmony.

283
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,916
[TSUKIYAMA moaning]

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,958
The sheer, ravishing elation...

[TSUKIYAMA moaning]

286
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,916
...at discovering
this rare treat.

287

You couldn't have
been more right.

291

[KANEKI] Okay. Why did he
have me take a shower, again?

[KANEKI]
Yeah?

294
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,500
[WORKER] I've left some
fresh clothes here for you.

295
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,041
I hope they are to your liking.

296
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,458
I'm sure they'll
be fine, thank you.

[KANEKI sighs]

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,666
Wow, Rize sure had
extravagant taste.

[door creaks]

300
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125

from the house, sir.

00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,625
Prepare your palates for an
incredibly unique cut of meat,

314
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,875
as you dine on Ghoul!

315
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:44,958
Huh?

316
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,250
[GENTLEMAN A]
A ghoul?

317
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
I'm not quite up
for cannibalism.

318
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,500
[EMCEE] Tonight's dish
is courtesy of Mr. MM!

319
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
[trumpets playing]
[GENTLEMAN 4B] Look up there!

320
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,166
It's Mr. MM!

321
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,125
[GENTLEMAN C]
He always makes an entrance!

322
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,083
Good day, my esteemed
ladies and gentlemen!

323
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,375
Normally, the flesh of a
ghoul offers a course flavor,

324
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,166
not worthy of eating.
I'm sure those of you with,

325
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,041
discerning tastes are
well aware of the fact.

326
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,333
[KANEKI]
Hey! What is this?

327
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,083
No. How could you?

328
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,916
[TSUKIYAMA] What drew
me to this rare cut.

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,916
Was his equally rare scent.

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,541
[TSUKIYAMA inhales]

331
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,458
For while this
morsel is a ghoul,

332
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,541
the sweet scent of
human is inescapable.

333
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,583
[CROWD clamoring]

334
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,208
[GENTLEMAN C]
I smell it!

335
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,541
[LADY B] The aroma is heavenly!
[GENTLEMAN D] Magnificent!

336
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,041
[LADY C]
I just can't get enough!

337
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,333
[TSUKIYAMA] Have I
enticed your taste buds?

338
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,708
Then let us explore this
mysterious flavor, together!

339
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,833
[CROWD cheering]

340
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,166
[KANEKI] I've been set up.
This whole thing was a trap.

341
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,541
Fellow culinary pioneers. I
salute your sense of adventure!

342
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:55,208
Now! Let us enjoy the
ultimate epicurean delight!

343
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,166
[CROWD cheering]

344
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,875
[EMCEE]
And here's the scrapper

345
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,416
who will be preparing
today's mouthwatering entree!

346
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,625
[SOTA] Madam A, may
I ask you something?

347
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,208
Whatever your little
heart desires, Mr. PG.

348
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,166
[SOTA] Can you tell me
which of your scrappers

349
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,958
you've brought out to play?

350
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,583
[MADAM A giggling]
My all-time favorite, of course!

351
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,666
Little Taro.

00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,041
[TARO]
Huh?

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,583
Where are you runnin' off to?

364
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,208
[KANEKI panting]

365

[TARO]
Waid up, teeny!

Catch him! Go, Taro, baby!

367

[TARO]
Yes, Mamma!

from his owner, Madam A!

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,708
[KANEKI] Gotta get outta
here! Gotta get outta here!

371
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,958
[KANEKI panting]
Or at least trip this guy up!

[KANEKI]
He has me cornered!

380
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,250

[TARO growling]

384
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,208
[KANEKI] It's no use. None of
my attacks even faze him!

385
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,541
What's the matter,
my sweet Kaneki?

386
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,458
You should put your
kagune to use.

387
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,541
We have to hurry
things along here.

388
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,833
[KANEKI] There has to be a
way out of this nightmare!

389
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,000
Think, dammit!

Did you see that?

[GENTLEMAN D]
Did his legs get twisted up?

has finally begun its work,

[TSUKIYAMA]
Forgive me.

I'm afraid the commotion
is my fault entirely.

Though not by design.
For, you see,

I had no way of knowing
this boy was a living legend.

444

That being said, our
palates must be placated,

and I've no intention
of denying them.

We have a prized pet here.

And it would be a shame
to let him go to waste.

this was all in good fun.

Yes! That's it, Tsukiyama!

That's the face
I was looking for!

00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,666
More! I need more!

471
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,541
Make the camera fall for you!

472
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,958
Fantastic! Now let's give 'em
a peek at the goods, baby!

473
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,083
So... What exactly
are you doing?

474
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,291
[TSUKIYAMA] Oh, this? Nothing
special, I'm just going to grace

475
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,208
the cover of this month's
manga, that's all.

476
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,583
Why don't you join
me, Kaneki, dear?

477
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,833
[TARO]
Join.

478
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,708
[KANEKI]
Uh, no, thanks.

479
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,958
I think I'll pass.
