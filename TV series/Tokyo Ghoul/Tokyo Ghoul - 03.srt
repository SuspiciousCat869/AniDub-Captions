1
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,291
[GHOUL C]
Yes. Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,583
[ASAKI]
Take care of yourself.

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,750
Okay, next patient!

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,416
[GHOUL C screaming]

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,666
[GHOUL C]
Please, help me.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,416
[YAMORI]
Knock, knock.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,083
I see the doctor is in.

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,500
[ASAKI]
Yamori.

9
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,416
[YAMORI] Remember the whats-it
you made for me before?

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,833
I seem to have uh, misplaced it.

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,875
So I'm gonna need you
to make me another one.

12
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,583
[ASAKI]
Okay.

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,791
[knuckle cracks]
[YAMORI] Thanks, Doc.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,833
[YAMORI]
I'll be back soon.

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,958
[RYOKO]
What now, dear?

16
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,625
[YOSHIMURA]
There's no rush.

17
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,583
Just take it slow and
keep pouring in circles.

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,041
[KANEKI]
Uh. Yes, sir.

19
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,875
[YOSHIMURA]
How is it?

20
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,416
[KANEKI] I wish I could say
it tastes as good as yours

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,916
but that's not the case.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,208
[YOSHIMURA] Remember coffee
takes on a different flavor

23
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,083
depending on the
effort put into it.

24
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,166
So take your time and you'll
always have a perfect cup.

25
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,416
Okay.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,291
[YOSHIMURA] There's one
thing to keep in mind.

27
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,958
Anteiku isn't just an
ordinary coffee house.

28
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,333
It's a place where the ghouls of
the 20th Ward can come together.

29
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
A safe-haven of sorts.

30
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,041
Though there will be times
when human customers come in,

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,875
as well. Just as you did once.

32
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,583
But I thought ghouls were
supposed to hide themselves

33
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:02,708
from the world. So why are we
still serving human customers?

34
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,333
[YOSHIMURA]
Because we need to study them.

35
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,208
It's the only way we can
blend in to their society.

36
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,666
When it comes down to it,

37
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,833
humans are like living
textbooks to us ghouls.

38
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,875
That said, I suppose the
simplest answer is...

39
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,250
I like them.

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,458
Oh.

41
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,916
[YOSHIMURA] Okay, do
you think you're ready

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,708
to go downstairs and
give Touka a hand?

43
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,916
Uh. Yes, sir.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,208
[KANEKI] He likes humans...
In what sense, exactly?

45
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,791
Well, some other
time then, okay?

46
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,583
Kaneki! What's up?

47
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,291
Hey. Hide! Why're you here?

48
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,333
Aw, c'mon! I think that's
pretty obvious, don't you?

49
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,791
I came to thank Touka.

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,750
[KANEKI]
For what?

51
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,000
[HIDE]
Dontcha remember?

52
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,000
She's the one who found
us after the accident.

53
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,291
[KANEKI] Wha-?
[KANEKI grunts]

54
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,125
I guess he hasn't
completely recovered yet.

55
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,583
So how ya feelin'?

56
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,541
Um, good. Yeah.

57
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,875
Hm. Well, I'm glad.

58
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,583
[HIDE] I heard Nishio's
still in the hospital.

59
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,500
We're really lucky you
found us when you did.

60
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,791
I mean the fact that we
got off with nothin'

61
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,708
but a few scratches is all
thanks to you. We owe ya one.

62
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,125
See you guys later.

63
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,958
[KANEKI] Yeah. See ya.
[TOUKA] Thanks for coming in.

64
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,708
[TOUKA] Be careful
around that guy.

65
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,708
You can't let him find
out you're a ghoul.

66
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,750
I know. Thanks.

67
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,333
[TOUKA] I'm warning you,
if he ever catches on to us

68
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,500
I've got no choice.

69
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,791
I'll have to kill him
right on the spot.

70
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,416
You'll what?

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,458
If you want him to stay alive,
then don't tell him anything.

72
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,833
[bell ringing]
[TOUKA] Hi, good afternoon!

73
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,958
Hello, Touka.

74
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,208
[TOUKA] Ryoko! Get
some towels, Kaneki!

75
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,250
[KANEKI]
Okay.

76
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,791
[RYOKO] I'm sorry. I don't
want to trouble you.

77
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,000
[TOUKA]
Don't be silly.

78
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,833
Hey there.
Long time no see.

79
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,583
[HINAMI grunts]

80
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,583
Hinami...

81
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,125
Where's Yoshimura?

82
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,333
He's Inside. Kaneki!

83
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,583
Can't you see she
needs a new towel?

84
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,083
[KANEKI]
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,750
[RYOKO]
Thank you very much.

86
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,291
Uh...

87
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,291
They're ghouls, too?

88
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,125
That's Mrs. Fueguchi
and her daughter,

89
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,458
we're gonna be
looking after them.

90
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,833
[KANEKI]
Why'd they come here?

91
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,541
[TOUKA] I'd explain
but it's a long story.

92
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,791
[KANEKI] So tell me.
We've got time.

93
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,666
You're getting on
my last nerve!

94
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,583
You can't do anything right!

95
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,041
I'm well aware.

96
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,333
[TOUKA]
Let's drop it.

97
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,750
So did the manager have
a talk with you today?

98
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,166
About the box-carriers.

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,750
About the wha-?

100
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,875
Did he warn you about the guys
who carry the big attaché cases?

101
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,875
[MARUDE] This map shows the
current status of the 11th Ward.

102
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,250
As you can see,

103
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,208
they're starting to demonstrate
organized movement.

104
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,125
I hate to say it, but I think
it's only a matter of time

105
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,833
before we have a
war on our hands.

106
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,416
Well, that's all I've got.

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,750
I don't suppose there's anyone
else with something to report?

108
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,375
Kotaro Amon,
Detective First Class.

109
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,625
I'll start with this.

110
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,541
I'm sure everyone here is
aware that three months ago,

111
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,500
the 13th Ward's Jason
came in contact with

112
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,500
an S-rated binge eater
from the 20th Ward.

113
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,625
This was left behind
at the crime scene.

114
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,416
And may I ask what that is?

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,000
[AMON] We believe it's a
ghoul medical apparatus.

116
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,791
That may sound farfetched,
But we analyzed it

117
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,791
and discovered it's made
of quinque steel.

118
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,375
[MARUDE]
Oh really?

119
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,958
[AMON] While Jason's objective
is currently unknown,

120
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,916
there is one thing
that we do know.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,791
Ever since his meeting with
the S-rated binge eater

122
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,583
all occurrences of binge
predation have suddenly ceased.

123
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,375
[MARUDE] It sounds like
there's something smoldering

124
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,958
in the 20th Ward.

125
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,791
I see why you were head of the
class at the academy, Detective.

126
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,125
Aren't you lucky, Mado?

127
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,916
I'd imagine that having
such a brilliant partner

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,125
allows you more time
to play with your toys.

129
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,500
Yeah, yeah, lucky me.
I don't mean to be rude,

130
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,791
but do you think we could
hurry and wrap this up?

131
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,583
I can think of a million more
productive ways to use my time.

132
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,958
I'd toss you out if you weren't
such a good investigator.

133
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,958
Alright Mado and Amon, I'm
putting the two of you in charge

134
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,541
of the 20th Ward. Understood?

135
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,833
Yes, sir.

136
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,750
[MARUDE] I find it
unsettling that the ghouls

137
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,500
of this once quiet ward are
suddenly becoming more active.

138
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,208
I can't help but think it's
a harbinger of things to come.

139
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,291
But we cannot lose sight
of our purpose here at CCG!

140
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,583
It's our sworn duty to drive
every last ghoul out of Tokyo!

141
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,125
No matter what trials
we face in the future,

142
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,041
that will always be
our top priority!

143
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,125
So let's get focused
and get to it!

144
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,416
[CCG MEN]
Yes, sir!

145
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,083
Alright people, this
meeting is now adjourned!

146
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,500
Dismissed!

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,625
[MADO]
Well, on the bright side,

148
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,416
at least we're free to
investigate the 20th Ward now.

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,750
[AMON]
Yes.

150
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,541
But unfortunately, this
is the only lead we have.

151
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,791
[MADO]
It's enough.

152
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,833
You see, we've caught
one end of the thread.

153
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,708
All we have to do now
is rout them out,

154
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,500
and I'm sure it won't be long
until we reach the other end.

155
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes, sir.

156
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,750
[MADO]
The 20th Ward.

157
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,666
[AMON]
What about it?

158
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,000
[MADO]
Oh nothing.

159
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,458
A gourmet, a binge eater.
And then there's Jason.

160
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,375
Fun.

161
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,083
[MADO cackling softly]

162
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,750
[YOSHIMURA]
Give it a try.

163
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,750
[KANEKI gagging]

164
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,166
[KANEKI retching]

165
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,083
[KANEKI] I'm sorry sir, but
there's no way that I can do it.

166
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
Are you all right?

167
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,625
The bread's so bland, it's like
I took a bite out of a sponge.

168
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,000
The cheese smells rancid

169
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,958
and it's got a nasty
texture, like clay.

170
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,041
[YOSHIMURA chuckling]

171
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,625
Oh, if only you could have seen

172
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,958
the ridiculous look
on your face.

173
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,833
[YOSHIMURA munching]
[KANEKI gasps]

174
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,541
The trick is not to eat it
but to swallow it whole.

175
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,125
Then you have to pretend
to chew it about ten times.

176
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,583
If you make chewing sounds,

177
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,958
it'll make your performance
even more believable.

178
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,125
You just have to make
sure to throw it up

179
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
before your body
starts digesting it.

180
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,583
Skip that step and you could
jeopardize your health.

181
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,666
Don't worry. All you
need is a little practice

182
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,458
and I promise you'll be able
to eat with your friend again.

183
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,833
I'll keep trying.

184
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,583
[YOSHIMURA] Oh right,
I have a present for you.

185
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
[KANEKI] What are
these? Sugar cubes?

186
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, but they're a little
different on the inside.

187
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,791
Dissolve a couple of them
into your next cup of coffee

188
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,625
and they'll help you keep
your hunger under control.

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,750
What are they made of, sir?

190
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
It's probably better
that you don't know.

191
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,708
Thanks, these'll help a lot.

192
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,833
I hate to ask this of you,

193
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,750
but would you mind staying
late today, Kaneki?

194
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
No. I don't mind at all, sir.

195
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,041
[YOSHIMURA] Normally I'd ask
Touka to help out after hours,

196
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,666
but she's busy studying
for an important exam.

197
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,958
If you're up for it,

198
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,166
I'd like you to go food
shopping in her place.

199
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,916
What? Me go food shopping?

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,708
But I can't kill anybody!

201
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,166
[YOSHIMURA]
It's not what you think.

202
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,750
You don't have to harm anyone.

203
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,666
Here at Anteiku, we provide
food for our brethren

204
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,416
who are incapable
of hunting humans.

205
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm sure you can understand
why that's necessary.

206
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,666
[KANEKI]
Yes, sir.

207
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,875
But if we're not hurting
anyone then how--

208
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,250
[YOSHIMURA]
Go see Yomo.

209
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,291
He'll be happy to answer
any questions you may have.

210
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,250
[KANEKI]
Um, excuse me, Mr. Yomo?

211
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,583
I know we're going
"food shopping"

212
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,333
but what exactly does that mean?

213
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
[KANEKI] Ghouls incapable
of hunting humans.

214
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,166
I wonder if Mrs. Fueguchi
and her daughter are like me.

215
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,958
[YOMO]
Alright, get out.

216
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,625
Oh, man! We're so high up!

217
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,500
[YOMO] Don't lean on that.
[KANEKI] Huh?

218
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,500
[YOMO]
You'll fall.

219
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,333
[KANEKI screaming]

220
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,583
[KANEKI grunts]

221
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,500
[KANEKI groans]

222
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,583
[KANEKI panting]

223
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,208
I'm still alive.

224
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,375
[KANEKI screaming]

225
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,708
[KANEKI whimpering]

226
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,666
[YOMO] Many people
come out here to die.

227
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,208
For whatever reason, they
choose to give up their lives.

228
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,000
[KANEKI]
So the ghouls of Anteiku

229
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,166
eat people who've
committed suicide.

230
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,583
[YOMO] Pack him up.
[KANEKI] Huh?

231
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,875
[KANEKI gasping]

232
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,125
[KANEKI gulps]

233
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,208
[KANEKI]
Huh?

234
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,291
[GHOUL D grunting] 

235
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,583
[GHOUL D yelling, groaning]

236
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,875
You okay? I'm sorry!

237
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,958
I had to catch up.

238
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,833
Don't worry, I'm fine, Amon.

239
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,875
You, however, need to
rely on your senses.

240
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,208
Tell me. Do you happen
to know what this is?

241
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,625
[GHOUL D]
Uh, What?

242
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,541
I asked you about this gadget.
Now you'd better hurry

243
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,958
and tell me what it is
or you'll regret it.

244
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,291
That? I dunno! I-I swear!

245
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,333
[thud]

246
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,000
So I need a mask?

247
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,500
Yes. I think it'd be a good
idea for you to have one.

248
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,458
Okay.

249
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,250
Touka.

250
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,250
[TOUKA]
Yes sir?

251
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,750
Kaneki needs to
have a mask made,

252
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,000
so would you mind taking
him to Uta's tomorrow?

253
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,791
Wha--? But tomorrow's
my one day off

254
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,250
and the last person I wanna
spend it with is this loser.

255
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,166
I'd send him on his own but
I'm afraid he might get lost

256
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,125
and as you know, that isn't
exactly the safest part of town.

257
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,625
I understand why you want
me to go with him, sir,

258
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,666
but I don't think that
moron deserves a mask yet!

259
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,708
Touka.

260
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,791
There are two inspectors
in the 20th Ward.

261
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,833
Not the doves?

262
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,416
The what?

263
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,916
They're already doing damage.
That's why I think it'd be good

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,958
for Kaneki to have
one, just in case.

265
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,750
[TOUKA] Yeah, you got it.
Listen up, eye patch.

266
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,916
2:30 tomorrow at
the train station.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,083
Show up late and I'll kill you.

268
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,416
Right!

269
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
[CROWD murmuring]

270
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,208
[KANEKI grunting]

271
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,291
Oh, it's you.

272
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,916
[BARKER] Hey pal,
wanna see a real lady?

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,541
[WOMAN]
Screw you, jerk!

274
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,500
[music pulsing]

275
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
[TOUKA]
We're here, Uta!

276
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,083
Geez. Is he sleeping on the job?

277
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,958
Boo.

278
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
[KANEKI screams]

279
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,541
[TOUKA laughing] What the hell
do you think you're doing?

280
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,041
[UTA] Everyone needs a
good scare now and then.

281
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,125
This is Uta, he's gonna
make your mask for you.

282
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,333
What's your name?

283
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,250
[KANEKI]
I'm Kaneki. It's nice to meet--

284
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,583
[UTA sniffing]
That smell.

285
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,833
Very unusual. Hey, Touka.

286
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,291
I heard the doves are on
the prowl, is that true?

287
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,416
[TOUKA]
Yeah.

288
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,916
[UTA] But the 20th Ward
is pretty quiet.

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,458
Why on earth are they
all up in your business?

290
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,416
I'm guessing that it has
something to do with Rize.

291
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,250
It's possible but Tsukiyama's

292
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,875
also been pressing
his luck lately.

293
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,500
[UTA]
Oh yeah. Him.

294
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,875
'Scuse me.

295
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,750
Is the 20th Ward more peaceful
than all the others?

296
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,250
I was just wondering.

297
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,083
Wow, you're the very picture
of naiveté, aren't you kid?

298
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,333
How would you like to stay
here with me tonight?

299
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,583
You might get to watch some
cannibalism go down,

300
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,666
that is, if you're lucky.

301
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,791
[KANEKI]
Uh. Thanks but no thanks!

302
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,291
You don't realize
how lucky you are

303
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,166
to have a place like Anteiku.

304
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,416
Have a seat over there and
I'll take your measurements.

305
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,875
[UTA] Have any allergies?
[KANEKI] No, sir. 

306
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,083
[UTA] Rubber or metals are cool?
[KANEKI] Yeah, I guess--

307
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,916
[UTA] You want it full-face?
[KANEKI] I'm not sure.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,166
[UTA] Wait, on second thought,
let's try a half-mask.

309
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,583
Whatever you say.

310
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,083
I think the eye patch is kinda
cute. Wanna include it?

311
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, You don't have to. I
just keep this eye covered

312
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,625
because it turns red when I get
hungry. I can't control it.

313
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,916
You know that if you eat
it'll go away, right?

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
Speaking of, you
care for a snack?

315
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,291
[KANEKI gasping]
No, thanks.

316
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,916
[UTA] So Kaneki, do you
have a lady friend?

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,666
[KANEKI]
Huh? No, I don't.

318
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,833
I see. You're one of those.
A guy who gets more attention

319
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,500
from the cougars than
from ladies his age.

320
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,833
Excuse me. What do all
of these personal questions

321
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,291
have to do with anything?

322
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,708
[UTA]
A lot, really.

323
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,708
The more I know you, the
better your mask'll turn out.

324
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,208
You're not interested in Touka?

325
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,250
She's cute but she's
also kinda scary.

326
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,708
Scary, huh? I wouldn't say that.

327
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,500
I think she's misunderstood
'cause she's such a hard worker.

328
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,166
I dunno. Maybe.

329
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,750
[UTA] In order to blend
into human society,

330
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,500
we have to wear a
metaphorical mask.

331
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,208
One that we never take off.

332
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,750
We're forced to live on the
outskirts of their world.

333
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,791
We can't get too close because
if anyone were to suspect us,

334
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,250
we'd be goners. She
knows she's at risk

335
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,291
but she doesn't let
it affect her life.

336
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,583
She works at Anteiku
serving humans.

337
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
Hell, she even goes
to school with them.

338
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
But why would a ghoul like her

339
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,541
wanna be so 
involved with people?

340
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,833
That's a good question.

341
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,958
Well, you see.

342
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,125
I know my pulse races whenever
I get a human customer.

343
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,625
I can't explain it.

344
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,458
There's just something
thrilling about it.

345
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,416
She stays cool.

346
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:54,958
[KANEKI] She is a hard worker.
Meanwhile, I'm nothing.

347
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,208
[KANEKI]
Hey, Touka!

348
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,625
Yeah, what?

349
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,291
[KANEKI] I was just wondering,
what happened to Hinami?

350
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,041
Why should I tell you?
It's none of your business.

351
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,000
[KANEKI]
Please. You've gotta tell me!

352
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,958
'Cause I wanna help her.

353
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,541
There's gotta be
something that I can do.

354
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,708
[TOUKA] In that case, she was
forced to flee her family home

355
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,791
and leave her father behind.
I'm sure that she's anxious.

356
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,416
I've never seen her
look so scared before.

357
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Yeah, that's gotta be tough.

358
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,125
Hey Touka. Can I
ask you something?

359
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,500
What exactly is the purpose
of having a mask made?

360
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,125
What? Nobody bothered
to explain that to you?

361
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,500
Uh, no.

362
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,541
[TOUKA] Some manager
he is. So the doves,

363
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,458
or ghoul investigators,
are hanging around our ward.

364
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,708
If you have a
run-in with them,

365
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,875
you don't want 'em
seeing your face.

366
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,708
That's why we're having
Uta make your mask.

367
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,416
Those jerks are just
lookin' to start trouble.

368
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,416
[GHOULS yelling]

369
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,875
Back off!

370
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,583
[GHOULS grunting, coughing]

371
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,916
[AMON]
Okay, listen up.

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Can either of you tell
me what this thing is?

373
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,958
[GHOUL A] Huh? How should
I know you piece of--

374
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,833
[GHOUL B whimpering]

375
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,083
[AMON]
What about you?

376
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,708
[GHOUL B] Nah man!
I've never seen it before!

377
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,916
[MADO] You aren't
lying, are you?

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,750
No way, why would I--
[GHOUL B screaming]

379
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,250
[MADO] Thank you for
being so cooperative.

380
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,875
Don't get discouraged.

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,916
We'll just have to hit
up another alleyway.

382
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,666
Yeah. Good idea.

383
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,375
[KANEKI sighs]

384
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,875
Here goes.

385
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,708
[HINAMI gasps]
[heart beating]

386
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,791
[heart beating]

387
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,666
[KANEKI screaming]

388
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,875
[KANEKI]
I, uh, sorry!

389
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,000
Um, take your time!

390
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,625
[KOMA]
Uh-oh, you saw her eating?

391
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,416
She's not gonna be
too happy, Kaneki.

392
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,416
Most ghouls like to keep
that stuff private.

393
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Especially the ladies, y'know?

394
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,166
That's understandable.

395
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,625
[KOMA]
Here.

396
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,791
Just give her some coffee.
Along with an apology, okay?

397
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,833
[KANEKI sighs]

398
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,958
[KANEKI] Excuse me,
Hinami? May I come in?

399
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,333
[HINAMI]
Yeah.

400
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,791
[KANEKI]
I'm so sorry about earlier.

401
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,250
I brought you a fresh
cup of coffee.

402
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
I'll just leave
this here for you.

403
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,333
Uh, Mister?

404
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,583
[KANEKI]
Yeah, what's up?

405
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,083
Well, I don't wanna be
rude, but what are you?

406
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,041
Uh. Oh, I'm...

407
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,416
[HINAMI]
I'm sorry for asking.

408
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,541
It's just you're different
from other humans.

409
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,000
And if you were like us,
I'd be able to tell,

410
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,875
even from far away.

411
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,083
[KANEKI] A lot's happened
to me. It's hard to explain.

412
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm a little of both, actually.
But if I had to choose one,

413
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,750
I'd say that I'm probably closer
to what you are now, Hinami.

414
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,625
It's like my body's
becoming a ghoul

415
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,875
but I've still got
the mind of a human.

416
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,125
[HINAMI] I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

417
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,666
[KANEKI]
No. It's fine, really.

418
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,375
Wow! Did you draw
that all by yourself?

419
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,625
Is that a teddy bear?

420
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,000
[HINAMI]
Hm? No. It's my daddy.

421
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,875
Oh! Yeah. I can see that now!

422
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,958
Your daddy, huh?

423
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,375
[HINAMI] Hm?
[KANEKI chuckles]

424
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,916
I hope that you get to
be together again soon.

425
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,791
Me, too.

426
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,666
[KANEKI gasps] Is that
"Monochrome of Rainbows"?

427
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,000
[HINAMI]
Uh-huh, it is.

428
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,041
[KANEKI] I can't believe
you're reading Takatsuki!

429
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,333
Her books must be tough for
someone your age.

430
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,375
But, then again, that's
a book of short stories

431
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,458
so I guess it's easier to read.

432
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,916
So tell me Hinami, which
one's your favorite?

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,166
I think it's called.
"Little Night and Rain Time"?

434
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,916
[KANEKI] I'm not
familiar with that one.

435
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,875
Oh wait, you mean
"Showers at Sunset"?

436
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,208
That story inspired her book
"Egg of the Black Sheep"!

437
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,375
Wow, you know so much.
You're really smart.

438
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,625
Oh, hold on! Can you tell
me what this word is?

439
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,333
[KANEKI]
Sure! That's "hydrangea."

440
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,291
[HINAMI]
Hydrangea? Like the flower?

441
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,541
[KANEKI]
Yep.

442
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,333
[HINAMI]
Okay. Then what's this?

443
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,458
[KANEKI] That word
basically means "thin ice"

444
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,125
but it's pronounced "verglas".

445
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,708
[HINAMI] That's pretty.

446
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,000
I suppose, but there's another
word for it that I like better.

447
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,750
Have you ever heard "glazing"?
I think it's prettier.

448
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,625
[HINAMI gasps]
Yeah!

449
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,458
[HINAMI] That's "hydrangea".
[KANEKI] Impressive.

450
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,166
[KANEKI]
So, do you always take notes?

451
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,666
[HINAMI]
Since I can't go to school,

452
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,750
I write everything I
learn in my notebook.

453
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,541
That's smart of you. Hey,
I've got an idea, Hinami.

454
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,541
How would you like me to teach
you new words every so often?

455
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,875
Really?

456
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah. 

457
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,500
I would love that!
Thank you so much!

458
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,625
[HINAMI] Okay, so what's
this one right here?

459
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,208
[KANEKI]
Well, let's see.

460
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,166
[GHOUL C]
Box-carriers in the 20th Ward?

461
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,083
Sounds like you've had
one hell of a day.

462
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,916
No joke. I just
don't understand

463
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,541
why they're hangin'
around here, y'know?

464
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,958
Dammit, this really hurts!

465
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,416
[GHOUL C] I've heard that
gourmet guy's

466
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,916
been on a tear lately.

467
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,875
I'll bet he's what attracted
them to our ward.

468
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
[GHOUL B]
Did a dove do that to you?

469
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,541
Nah, these injuries
are from something else.

470
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,166
[GHOUL B groaning]
This sucks!

471
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,708
[GHOUL C]
Geez, quit whining!

472
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,875
Why dontcha let Dr. Fueguchi
take a look at you and get it--

473
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,833
[MADO] It would seem that the
best way to catch flies isn't

474
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,500
with honey or vinegar.
But with other flies.

475
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,583
[GHOUL C whimpering]
Not you!

476
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,666
[MADO] And now I can't
help but wonder.

477
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,958
What kind of flies
you're going to bring us,

478
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,000
you nasty little insect.

479
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,750
[MAN humming]

480
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,500
[HINAMI] Morning! I hope
you all have a great day!

481
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,291
[MAN humming]

482
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,125
[TOUKA] Good morning!
[KANEKI] Hey, isn't once enough?

483
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,500
Morning! Hey, Kaneki!
Good morning!

484
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,625
Right back at ya.
Thanks, Hinami.

485
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,500
[MAN humming]

486
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,666
Why're you just standing
there, ya big dummy?

487
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,583
Get back to work!

488
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,041
Okay!

489
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,500
Hello! Welcome!

490
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,375
[MAN humming]

491
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:56,583
[MAN breathes deeply]

492
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,875
My, my. What an aroma.

493
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:06,416
All of a sudden I feel
much more relaxed.

494
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,291
[BIRD coughing]

495
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,666
Look! I found a bird
on the veranda!

496
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,083
I guess it must've
gotten lost somehow.

497
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:49,041
It looks hurt. We have
to save it, Touka!

498
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,166
[HINAMI] What's the matter with
you? Why're you running away?

499
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,875
Come on, quit running!
This bird needs our help!

500
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,125
[TOUKA]
I'm afraid of birds!

501
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,916
Do you think I should give
this poor guy a name?

502
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,416
[TOUKA] No, I think we
should look for its owner.

503
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,625
You do?

504
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,125
[TOUKA]
Or we could cook it.

505
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,958
[HINAMI]
That's not very nice.
