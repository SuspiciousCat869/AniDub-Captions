You dumbass.

162
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,080
I guess you didn't learn
your lesson the last time
I kicked your face in.

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Did you?

164
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Uh, sorry, sir.

165

KANEKI: No way.

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
That's her brother?

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,800
What's up? Long time no see,

Don't ever call me that.

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
So where have you been
all this time?

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,360
I've been out learning
about the world.

174
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
See, I'm not
a closed‐minded hermit like you.

What? You think
you're better than me?

176

I don't think that. I know it.

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
Can we come in now?

JUZO: Oh, great.
Now what am I gonna do?

186
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't know where I am.

Hm?

189
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,800
I've spotted a police box.

190
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
Huh.

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,680
Things are looking up.

192
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,720
The group we're dealing with
is called Aogiri Tree.

193
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
They have over 200 members
that we're aware of.

194
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,880
We've never seen
this many ghouls
band together before.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
So, we don't know
what to expect.

196
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,360
What do you think
their objective is, sir?

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,520
I really wish I could tell you.

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,320
Who knows what the ghouls
are thinking?

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
At this point,

200
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,640
they have control
of the 11th Ward.

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,760
That's all we know for certain.

202
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,680
We expect their numbers
to grow.

203
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,360
When word gets out
that Aogiri Tree

204
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,280
have taken control
of an entire ward,

205
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
the ghouls who've been acting
on their own will most likely
join their ranks.

206
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,360
We must prepare for a war
between humans and ghouls.

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,800
And the CCG is going to be
fighting on the front lines.

208
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,560
We'll give our life
for the call.

209
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
And that's an order, by the way.

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,280
From here on, the 11th Ward
Special Task Force will be‐‐

Hi, I'm Mr. Shinohara's

The name's Juzo Suzuya.

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,760
Sorry to barge in late
but I kinda got lost
on my way here.

I hope that you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

219
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,800
So, who's this, Ayato?

NICO: My, my.

You know, I'd heard
your older sister lives here.

But, no one told me
she's as gorgeous as you.

Oh, I'd rather she both.

224

So, how did you know
I was here,

226
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,240
YAMORI: Easy.
I just followed your boy, Banjo.

227
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,800
Got to say, your men
are first rate.

You think that this one will do?

Sure, why not?

NICO: Oh. No problem precious.

324
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,440
AYATO: You heard the man.
We've gotta start heading back.

325
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,560
Hurry and stuff

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Huh?

332
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,840
YOSHIMURA: They kidnapped him,
didn't they?

333
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,240
Yomo, round up everyone
for a meeting.

334
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
Anteiku will have
to be closed for a while.

MARUDE: They're clearly
starting to show signs
of an organized movement.

337
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,160
Unfortunately,
that's all we know
about Aogiri Tree at this time.

338
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,560
As much as I'd love to charge in
after them right now,

339
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm afraid we'll have
to be patient.

340
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,200
We'll engage the enemy
in one week.

341
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,680
Until then, the 11th Ward
must be evacuated.

342
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,680
Allow me to handle the media.

Be sure to work
alongside local police.

344

Hm?

So, you're Juzo Suzuya.

349
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,040
I got to admit, you're not
what I was expecting at all.

350
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,040
Huh? Uh‐oh.

351
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,080
You're an awfully
slender young man, aren't you?

352
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Well, it's either that
or you're a flat‐chested woman.

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
SHINOHARA: Now, now, Maru.

354
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
Suzuya had just got here

355
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,520
and I'm sure
he's got to be tired.

356
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
Cut him some slack, would you?

357
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,240
MARUDE: What gives?
I was just making small talk.

358
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
SHINOHARA: Yeah, I know.

359
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,800
But, it can wait until tomorrow.

360

AMON: Suzuya's only
a third class investigator?

361
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,760
SHINOHARA:
From what I can tell, Maru's
pulling all his resources.

362
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,040
He must have decided
that we can use Juzo somehow.

363
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,400
In any case,
he was personally admitted
by Chairman Washuu himself,

364
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
following Arima.

They've got one, too.

369
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,800
And who's that? Jason?

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
Yeah. He's S‐rated.

371
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Hails from the 13th Ward.

372
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,560
He's a sadistic bastard

373
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
who kills for fun
rather than for food.

374
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,680
I wouldn't want
to go up against him
That's for damn sure.

375
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,920
Wait a minute. You came
face to face with him once,
didn't you?

376
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,040
Yeah. Well, Mr. Mado and I.

Oh, that's right.

out of my head?

Please, Ko.

I don't wanna be the monster
you think I am.

382
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
and his expression.

that I don't want to remember.

Kotaro, who said
that you could come in?

SHINOHARA: Amon.

Amon.

I'm sorry.

Could you repeat that, please?

Breathe. I just asked
if your quinque is broken.

Oh. Yes, sir.

395
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,200
In that case, why don't you
take one from Mado's collection?

396
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
AMON: Huh?

397
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,200
He left them all to you.

398
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
Well, I'll see you later.

399

AMON: Thank you, Mr. Maru.

JUZO: Guess what, Rei,

401
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,680
I've heard
there are lots of ghouls
in the 11th Ward.

402
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,760
And I might be able to get
a new quinque.

403
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm so excited. I can't wait.

so I'd better behave.

I have to be a good boy.

MARUDE: At this point in time,

410
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,880
we're increasing our presence
in the 11th Ward

411
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,200
and working to pinpoint
this ghoul organization's base.

412
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
Once we can do that,

413
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm confident
it won't take us long
to close the case.

414
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,360
REPORTER: Do you really think
a full‐scale evacuation
of the area is needed?

415
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
I mean, doesn't that seem
like overkill?

416
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,160
MARUDE: We feel it's necessary
to guarantee
our citizen's safety.

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
You can count on us.

The CCG are fighting for you.

419
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,920
In return I ask you
to please...

420
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
Come on. Text me, Kaneki.

421
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm worried.

you're all here.

A few more
will be joining us later.

430
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,800
But let's go ahead
and get started.

431
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,640
We need to discuss the problems
unfolding in the 11th Ward.

432
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,600
And then, we must decide
what action Anteiku should take.

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,280
But before we get into that,

434
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
let me address
Kaneki's kidnapping

435
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,200
and what it means
for the rest of you.

[exhales]

437
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
Do yourselves a favor

438
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,560
and forget about
ever seeing him again.

439
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,240
What the hell?

440
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,680
How could you say
such a thing?

441
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,000
TOUKA: Shut up!

442
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
Quit yelling.

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,360
We're going, right?
To save him?

444
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
Well?

445
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,520
You have to understand,

446
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,720
Aogiri Tree
is a heartless organization.

447
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,320
They are ghouls
who live to fight.

448
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,000
It won't be easy
to sneak into their base

449
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,160
and rescue Kaneki.

450
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
They'll do everything
in their power to stop us.

451
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,280
But why?

452
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,840
That's so mean.

453
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,240
YOSHIMURA: And then,
there's the CCG.

454
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,280
We can't ignore their movements.

455
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm sure it's only
a matter of time

456
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,040
before they start sending
their troops to the 11th Ward

457
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,280
in the hopes of wiping out
Aogiri Tree.

458
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,280
If we try to save him...

459
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,840
there's a very good chance
that we'd be the ones

460
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,400
who end up dead.

461
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,920
We gotta do something.

462
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,600
We can't just abandon him.
He's one of us.

463
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,720
TOUKA: I'm going.

464
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,200
Have you forgotten
our policy, sir?

465
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,320
If you're not gonna save him...

466
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
then I'll go alone.

467
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll go with you.

468
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,800
TOUKA: Huh.

469
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
Might as well. I owe him one.

470
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
HINAMI: I wanna help, too.

471
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,560
Kaneki's done so much for me.
It's the least I can do.

472
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,680
Just let me know
how I can help and I'll do it.

473
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
TOUKA: Hinami...

474
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
It appears that there's been
a misunderstanding.

475
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm in no way abandoning Kaneki.

476
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,080
I always planned
on rescuing him.

477
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
ALL: Huh?

478
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,560
YOSHIMURA: I would never abandon
a ghoul in need.

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
Especially not one of our own.

480
