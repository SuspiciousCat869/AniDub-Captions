1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:14,625
[AMON] I can't let it
end here. Not like this.

2
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,333
[AMON grunts]

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,958
[AMON growling]

4
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:31,416
[KANEKI screaming]

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,833
[KANEKI] What is this?
I don't understand.

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,916
What am I doing here?

7
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,708
[TOUKA]
Like hell he's tagging along!

8
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,166
Whatever his reasons, they
aren't for our benefit.

9
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,166
I know how you feel,
but, the hard truth

10
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,333
is that we're short on
allies at the moment.

11
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,125
With his help, we
might save Kaneki.

12
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,791
[TOUKA] How are you even
alive? We left you for dead.

13
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,208
Oui, Mon cheri!

14
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,333
But in desperation,
I heeded your advice.

15
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,875
And, to my surprise,
it actually worked!

16
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,083
Not only did I fully heal,

17
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,708
I also discovered
I'm quite tasty.

18
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,708
You really think he
plans to help us?

19
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,250
He's only in it for
a chance at Kaneki.

20
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:45,000
[YOMO] He won't get one.
I'll make sure of it.

21
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,083
So put it out of your mind.

22
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,625
[YOSHIMURA] Has there been any
movement from the CCG yet?

23
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,083
[YOMO] It looks like they'll
be going for a full assault

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,916
once the civilians are clear.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250
[YOSHIMURA]
That's when we'll move.

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,208
If we use their attack as cover,

27
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,333
we'll have the best chance
of getting Kaneki out.

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,583
Are there any objections?

29
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,166
No, sir.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,625
[YAMORI]
Oh, good. You're awake.

31
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:24,416
This is my room.
Make yourself comfy.

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,041
[YAMORI] Tatara decided he
didn't need you, after all.

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,541
But one man's garbage
is another man's hobby.

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,791
I'm glad you're here.

35
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,666
I've wanted to invite you
over for a while now.

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,208
Since the moment
we met, in fact.

37
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,333
[knuckle cracks]

38
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,500
[YAMORI]
Or maybe,

39
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
since even before we met.

40
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,250
So please,

41
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,750
do your best not to
disappoint me, alright?

42
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,375
[KANEKI whimpering]

43
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,083
[YAMORI]
RC inhibition fluid.

44
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,458
You know what that does once it
gets into a ghoul's bloodstream?

45
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,833
It suppresses all
kagune activity.

46
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,708
When that happens, their flesh

47
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,833
might as well be
construction paper.

48
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,041
'Least as far as my
scalpel is concerned.

49
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,208
Slice's right through it.

50
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,000
Just like a human.

51
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
[KANEKI gasping]

52
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,458
[YAMORI]
The only problem is,

53
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,916
hypodermic needles
can't break your skin.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,041
So I'll have to stick you in
the one spot it will go through.

55
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,083
The mucus membrane.

56
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,166
Right in here!

57
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,916
[KANEKI screaming]

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,666
[MABUCHI]
Here's the situation, everyone.

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,791
Two months ago, the
shopping mall in question

60
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,041
was occupied by a
large force of ghouls.

61
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,291
Over the last week,

62
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,125
they've increased their
numbers substantially.

63
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,166
So far, we count
500 ghouls inside.

64
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,458
[MABUCHI] As you can see--
[AMON] Mr. Mado...

65
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,500
[SHINOHARA]
Here.

66
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
What is it?

67
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,125
[SHINOHARA] Mado told
me to give it to you.

68
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,375
He said you should use it
when the time was right.

69
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,791
[SHINOHARA]
Take it.

70
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,041
[AMON] I'll make sure
it's put to good use.

71
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,791
[SHINOHARA] The civilian
evacuation has been completed!

72
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,375
Let's kick some ass!

73
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,916
[INVESTIGATORS]
Yes, sir!

74
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,625
[NEWSCASTER A] At this moment,
a joint force of over 1,000 CCG

75
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
and Law Enforcement
officials are standing-by,

76
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,375
waiting for the word
to storm the 11th Ward.

77
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,500
The leader on the scene is the
man responsible for locating

78
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,041
the ghoul base, Special
Investigator Marude Itsuki.

79
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,833
We've staked our
lives on this op.

80
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,750
And we guarantee the safety
of up to 99% of the population.

81
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,250
As for the remaining one,

82
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,083
their lives hinge on the rest
of you working together.

83
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,625
[MARUDE]
With your cooperation,

84
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,083
I know we can bring peace and
order back to the 11th Ward!

85
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,208
[NEWSCASTER A] That was
Special Investigator Marude.

86
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,041
[HIDE]
Kaneki...

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:04,458
[KANEKI screaming]

88
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,333
[YAMORI]
How many was that?

89
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
I lost count, again.

90
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,166
[KANEKI]
500...

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
50...

92
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,125
...9.

93
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,000
[YAMORI]
Take some time to recover.

94
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,375
I'll be back in a little while.

95
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,750
[KANEKI]
500...

96
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,375
[YAMORI]
Clean that up.

97
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,833
[HOODED MAN]
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,000
[KANEKI gasping]

99
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,833
[HOODED MAN]
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,333
[KANEKI]
Banjo? Is that you?

101
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,166
The moment I see an opening,
I'm gettin' you outta here.

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,625
So don't you quit on me, okay?

103
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,875
[KANEKI]
Why me? What did I do?

104
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,750
[BANJO] I heard, you know.
About Rize's death.

105
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,583
You could've just told
me from the start,

106
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166
but you were trying
to spare my feelings.

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,083
You're a good guy, Kaneki.

108
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,875
The next shift
is Shu and Haru.

109
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,416
They're friends of mine.

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,083
If something comes up,
find a way to tell them.

111
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,750
Hang in there.
We'll get you out.

112
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,833
[KANEKI sobbing]

113
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,625
Is everybody ready to move?

114
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,000
[TOUKA] Uta, hey!
Are you coming with us?

115
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,958
'Course I am. I can't leave a
valued customer to such a fate.

116
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,333
[YOSHIMURA] It looks like
we're all here. Let's go.

117
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,625
[AMON] Is something
wrong, Shinohara?

118
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,416
[SHINOHARA]
Hmm? Oh, no.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,208
I was just thinking, when
you and Mado fought the guy,

120
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:55,375
did you get manage to get
any sort of read on him?

121
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,000
Definitely unique,
as far as ghouls go.

122
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083
He had a weird vibe about him,
but it's hard to put into words.

123
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,625
That helps. And the
only photo we have

124
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,833
was taken before he even
started going by "Jason."

125
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,041
[YOUNGER YAMORI screaming]
[SHINOHARA] After his initial

126
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,708
[SHINOHARA]
arrest by CCG,

127
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,625
he was sent to the
Cochlea Ghoul Internment Center.

128
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,000
The investigator who
was posted there...

129
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, let's just say he
was a little "disturbed".

130
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,583
[YOUNGER YAMORI]
559.

131
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,291
552.

132
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,625
[INVESTIGATOR]
There's still so much left.

133
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,666
[INVESTIGATOR panting]
[YOUNGER YAMORI sobbing]

134
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,125
[INVESTIGATOR cackling]
Let me take it!

135
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,500
[SHINOHARA]
He was tortured in ways

136
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,583
you only hear about in fiction.

137
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,583
It was so brutal, his mind
did the only thing it could

138
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,541
to protect itself.

139
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,000
It created another personality.

140
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,833
After that...

141
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,416
...he busted out.

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,916
Ever since then, he's favored
acting like the brute, himself.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,708
And he employs the same torture
he endured on his victims.

144
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,916
He started calling himself
Jason after that, too.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,708
Crazy shit, huh?

146
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,333
[ETO] They got here
sooner than we thought.

147
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,000
[TATARA]
Yeah.

148
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,208
Bin Brothers, you're
in the main building.

149
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,208
[BIN BROTHERS]
Right.

150
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,916
[TATARA]
Kirishima, take the annex.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
You got it.

152
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,833
[TATARA] Let's get going, Eto.
You can take it from here, Noro.

153
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,166
Where's Yamori?

154
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,291
[NICO] Beats me. Probably
in his little play room.

155
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,166
Now, of all times?
That's just perfect.

156
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,458
[YAMORI] The weak should
be trampled underfoot.

157

Crushed!

Violated!

159
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,250
Tormented.

[YAMORI laughing]

161
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,416
Please, no.

Don't do it. Don't!

[KANEKI scraeming]

164
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,875

are they picking us off?!

00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,833
Enemy forces are employing
kagunes and scopes, sir.

170
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,083
So, the ghouls fancy
themselves soldiers, do they?

171
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,333
C'mon, men! Don't let
these bastards show us up!

That's how you take out

a goddamn sniper's nest,
you sack-less clods!

176

Hop to it!

00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,541
[CCG TROOPER]
What a badass.

[MARUDE]
What's going on?

179
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,416
[MABUCHI] Your bike. It was
brought over from headquarters.

[MARUDE]
Hold it, stitches!

What do you think you're
doing with my bike!

no no no, not that way!

Change direction, you

into Swiss cheese!

o'clock! I count ten targets!

[SHINOHARA]
This is Shinohara.

212

We've taken control of the main
building, second floor entrance.

Awaiting orders.

214
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,916
Split up into three units,
move in from below,

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,708
then secure the parking
lot and the interior.

216
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,958
Then you should be able
to rendezvous top-side.

Copy.

By the way, I haven't
seen Suzuya around.

Thank you both.

Hey, Kaneki.

still hasn't given up on you.

He sent a message,

"I'll get you outta
here, bro. Count on it."

234
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,083
[SHU] We'll come back when
we can. You stay strong.

Trust Banjo.

Hold it!

[AMON] Thought you
could slip past me?

Well, think again, Rabbit!

dove from before?

258
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,625
Not bad, they've actually
made some headway.

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,791
[IRIMI] I lost their
footsteps. Wait, got them!

260
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,500
It sounds like they
all made it inside.

261

[HINAMI] Wow, you can
hear them? That's amazing!

262
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,458
[IRIMI]
With a little practice,

263
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,541
I'm sure you'll be able
to do it someday.

264
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,916
[YOSHIMURA] Focus, Kaya. Give
me an update on the CCG.

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,625
[IRIMI]
They've split their forces.

266
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,125
They have the advantage,
at the moment.

267
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,833
[YOSHIMURA]
Then there's little choice.

268
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,791
[YOSHIMURA] We'll have to buy
our team some extra time.

269
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,833
Kaya, look after
Hinami while I'm gone.

Yes, sir.

I've got you now!

[TOUKA] I don't get it,
what'd I ever do to him?

276
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,791
He wants revenge.

[TOUKA, AMON grunting]

278

time to deal with him right now!

[AMON]
You can't run forever!

[YOUNGER BIN] Who was that?
I don't think I know 'em.

281

[OLDER BIN] Whoa. He shrugged
off a number three combo.

282
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,291
[YOUNGER BIN]
Not bad, for a human.

283
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,750
The Bin Brothers?

284
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,666
They're S-rated ghouls!

285
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,000
[UTA] Well, well.
What do we have here?

286

[TSUKIYAMA laughing]

287
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,625
[TSUKIYAMA] I follow my
nose and who do I find

288
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,416
but Mister High C himself.
Simplement merveilleux!

289
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,041
Shall we share a table together?

290
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:31,250
[YOMO] Keep your guard up.
This is no ordinary ghoul.

291
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,166
[TSUKIYAMA] My, what a
charming mouth you have.

292
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,541
I believe a passionate baiser
may be in short order.

293
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,833
Take him out.

294
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,041
[TSUKIYAMA cackling]

[AMON grunting]

296
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,208
[AMON] Can I take down
two S-rated ghouls?

297
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,166
Do I have what it takes?

298
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,875
I know Mr. Mado did.

299
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
[MADO] Here's a question for
you. How can a human being

300
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,000
overcome their physical
limitations and prevail against

301
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,416
a ghoul in an
all-or-nothing brawl?

302
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,708
Any thoughts?

303
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,500
[AMON groaning]

304
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,833
[AMON] I suppose building up
muscle mass and stamina

305
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,041
would do the trick.

306
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,583
[MADO giggling]
It certainly wouldn't hurt.

307
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,333
But, no. You can't
depend on brute strength

308
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,708
in a fight
against a ghoul.

309
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:27,958
You'd never be able
to overpower them.

310
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,166
[AMON grunting, gasping]

311
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,041
[MADO] Now think. When
all the training in the world

312
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,625
can't save you, what can
you do to close the gap?

313
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,375
Got any ideas?

314
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,625
[AMON]
I don't.

315
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,541
[OLDER BIN]
Number one combo!

316
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,791
[YOUNGER BIN]
Got it!

317
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,625
[MADO] You have to be wily.
Guile is your weapon, Amon.

318
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,291
As long as it's for the
right cause, fight dirty.

319
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,791
And don't you dare
feel guilty for it.

320
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:04,541
[MADO] In my collection, there's
a quinque I like to call "Kura".

321
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,125
I think it would
suit you nicely.

322
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,666
[MADO] I'm not going to
be around forever, Amon.

323
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,791
When I die, I want
you to use it.

324
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,208
[AMON]
Yes, sir!

325
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,583
[AMON yelling]

326
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,750
[YOUNGER BIN screaming]

327
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,250
[OLDER BIN grunts]

328
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,375
[AMON yelling]

329
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,583
[OLDER BIN groaning]

330
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,125
[AMON] I can't let it
end here. Not like this.

331
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,875
I won't give up until
I've avenged you!

332
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,458
[TOUKA]
Kaneki.

333
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,416
[NISHIKI groans]

334
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,083
Be a little more
careful, would ya?

335
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,208
I don't like playing the hero.

336
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,708
[TOUKA]
Nishiki!

337
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,250
[AYATO] Well, If it
isn't my dumbass sister.

338
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,625
What the hell are
you doin' here?

339
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,875
You and me, bro.

340
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,166
[CCG TROOPER P] Squad A
has secured the annex,

341
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,166
third floor, and north exit.
Squad B has secured

342
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,666
main building, second
floor, and west exit.

343
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,125
[MARUDE] Shinohara.
how're we looking?

344
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,208
[SHINOHARA] Parking level
and fifth floor are secure!

345
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,166
En route to rendezvous!

346
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,666
[MARUDE]
Copy that.

347
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,458
Kind of reminds you of the
good old days, now doesn't it?

348
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,041
[SHINOHARA]
Sure does.

349
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,208
[SHINOHARA] They were
good men. Every one of 'em.

350
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:02,125
[SHINOHARA] This is Shinohara.
We've arrived at the roof.

351
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,166
Doesn't look like
anyone's up here.

352
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,833
I don't like this.

353
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
[AMON]
Shinohara!

354
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,708
[SHINOHARA]
You alright?

355
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,833
[AMON] No, far from it. The
ghoul who killed Mr. Mado--

356
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,833
What's happening?

357
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,041
[SHINOHARA]
Maru...

358
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,416
It's him.

359
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,791
[SHINOHARA]
The one-eyed Owl.

360
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,625
Listen closely.

361
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,541
Only those who are willing
to die should stay behind.

362
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,333
'Cause you probably will.

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,833
[MARUDE] If you guys can't
hold him off, then no one can.

364
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,791
Don't go throwing lives away.

365
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:52,125
We both know it's not going
to slow the bastard down.

366
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,916
Challenge him with as
few men as possible.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,208
Good luck.

368
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,625
[MARUDE] Even on the roughest
days, riding clears my head.

369
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,208
When the good-for-nothing peons

370
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,166
and the ball-busting
higher-ups get me low.

371
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,916
[MARUDE] Going full-throttle
down the Big Slab takes me high.

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,083
I couldn't ask for
a better partner.

373
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,125
I know I had my keys.

374
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,333
[JUZO]
Yahoo!

375
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,375
[MARUDE yelping]

376
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:12,041
[JUZO laughing]
[MARUDE sobbing]
