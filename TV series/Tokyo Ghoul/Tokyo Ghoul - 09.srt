1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,125
[AMON] Kotaro Amon. I've been
assigned to Division One.

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,875
It's an honor to meet you
and join your ranks.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:27,125
[ARIMA] I see the new blood's
looking strong this year.

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,291
[AMON]
Special Investigator Arima!

5
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,333
I've heard great things
about you from the Academy.

6
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,958
It's a pleasure, Amon.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,291
Thank you. It's an honor, sir.

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,791
[ARIMA] You'll be under
Mr. Mado, one of our best.

9
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,208
Yes, sir!

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,000
[INVESTIGATOR A] You're
stickin' the rookie with him?

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,583
Whelp, I guess
them's the breaks.

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,916
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Don't let him

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,958
talk you into anything
crazy and you'll be fine.

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,625
There you are.

15
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,458
Mr. Mado, meet your new
partner, Kotaro Amon.

16
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,291
[MADO]
Hmm. Yes, he'll do nicely.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,875
Well we have our orders.

18
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,958
Shall we shake
hands, seal the deal?

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,250
[AMON] It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

20
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,625
This ghoul's
codenamed Applehead?

21
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,875
Yeah. And she's had her fill
of forbidden fruit lately

22
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,083
50 victims in
the past year.

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,833
What do we have to work
with so far, any suspects?

24
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,500
Well, there is one.

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,708
[MADO]
Kie Muramatsu, age 68.

26
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,125
She's been spotted at a
few of the crime scenes.

27
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,083
Her?

28
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,791
What, are you surprised?

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,000
Didn't realize ghouls get
old like the rest of us?

30
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:31,916
[AMON]
No, sir.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,708
There's not a
doubt in my mind

32
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,166
that this little old biddy
is our wolf in disguise.

33
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,958
[AMON] What makes
you think that, sir?

34
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,000
Instinct.

35
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,333
Uh. Excuse me?

36
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,083
[MADO] Instincts are nothing
to sneeze at, young man.

37
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:52,041
I mean, take a look at me. I
trust mine and I'm still alive.

38
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,041
[AMON] Of all the investigators
I could've been partnered with.

39
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,958
[MADO]
Good afternoon, Ms. Muramatsu.

40
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,708
[MURAMATSU]
Oh, hello Investigator.

41
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,541
Isn't the weather lovely today?

42
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,750
Goodness, who is this handsome
young man you've got with you?

43
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,458
Allow me to introduce
my new partner, Amon.

44
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,041
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

45
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,583
[MURAMATSU giggles]

46
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,541
[AMON] Does he really think
this sweet old lady's a ghoul?

47
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,375
Anyway, I Just wanted to
stop by and say thank you

48
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,125
for sending me your
medical certificate.

49
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,500
I took some time to
look over your results,

50
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,875
paying special attention
to your RC Factor.

51
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,833
Your RC cell count is 231,
which is good news

52
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,875
because that means you're
definitely not a ghoul.

53
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,500
I apologize for the
inconvenience ma'am,

54
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,916
you have a lovely day.

55
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,416
[AMON]
Why didn't you tell me

56
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,041
you had a medical certificate
from her, Mr. Mado?

57
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,875
Do you know how easy it is to
forge a document these days?

58
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,958
A scrap of paper
doesn't prove anything.

59
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,750
Even so...

60
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,625
I only asked for the certificate

61
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,875
to lure her into a false
sense of security.

62
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,041
You could learn a thing
or two from me, Amon.

63
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,250
After all, I'm a seasoned pro,

64
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,875
and you're still wet
behind the ears.

65
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,791
Whatever you say, sir.

66
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,500
Well, if it's whatever I say.

67
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,125
Why don't you pop open
that briefcase for me?

68
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,166
[AMON]
Why?

69
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,166
I'd love to see what
kind of quinques

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,666
they're giving to the
rookies these days.

71
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,416
C'mon, let's have a peek.

72
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,083
[AMON] Forgive my impertinance,
Senior Investigator,

73
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,708
but I take my
job very seriously.

74
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,791
I'm not playing show
and tell with you.

75
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,791
Not when there are
lives at stake!

76
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,666
Now if you'll excuse me.

77
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,833
[MADO]
Hm...

78
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,666
[AMON]
Crazy old, fool.

79
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,333
He doesn't seem to be
taking the job seriously.

80
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,416
How did he even become
a Senior Investigator?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,375
[AMON]
Ms. Muramatsu?

82
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,708
[MURAMATSU]
I can't thank you enough

83
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,000
for helping me, young man.

84
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,583
[AMON]
It's my pleasure.

85
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,083
You protect us from ghouls and
help old ladies with their bags.

86
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,916
Your mother must be so proud.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,875
[AMON]
Really, it's nothing.

88
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,833
Nonetheless, I'm very grateful.

89
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,875
[AMON] I can't believe he'd
suspect this sweet old lady.

90
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,500
He's definitely
got a screw loose.

91
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,250
I have to admit, this is heavy.
How'd you get as far as you did?

92
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,500
[AMON gasps]

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,666
[AMON grunting]

94
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,291
[MURAMATSU] Since you asked so
nicely I'll tell ya' my secret.

95
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,583
I eat well.

96
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,250
[MURAMATSU yelling]

97
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,708
[AMON groaning]

98
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:35,166
[MURAMATSU chuckling]

99
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,583
[AMON]
So this is how it ends.

100
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,166
[MURAMATSU yelling]

101
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,416
[AMON gasps]

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,791
[MADO] Ya see? What'd
I tell you, Amon?

103
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,791
Anyone can be a ghoul,
even a sweet old lady.

104
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,625
[MADO giggling]

105
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
Mr. Mado...

106
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,125
[AMON sighs]

107
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,291
[AMON]
I'm sorry, Sir. Thank you.

108
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,041
[MADO] Don't be,
you were perfect.

109
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,916
Seriously, you were the best
ghoul bait I've had in years.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,041
At least your heart's
in the right place.

111
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,791
Now if you want
to keep it there,

112
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,708
and not in some granny's
gullet, keep this in mind.

113
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,833
When the foe is before
you, you fight!

114
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,833
Even if it costs you your life!

115
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,833
That's what it means
to be an investigator.

116
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,166
Yes, sir.

117
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,958
[SHINOHARA]
Well, if it isn't Amon!

118
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,416
How ya doin'?

119
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,791
[AMON]
Mr. Shinohara!

120
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,875
Hey! It's been a while.
How've you been holdin' up?

121
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,500
[AMON] Not too bad.
So what brings you out here?

122
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
[SHINOHARA]
Actually, I came to see you.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,791
Whatcha got there?

124
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,375
[AMON]
They're for Mr. Mado.

125
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,500
[SHINOHARA] Oh, of course.
Sorry, I should've known.

126
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,083
[AMON]
It's okay

127
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,083
You know he really was
one of the best we had.

128
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,250
I still can't believe he's gone.

129
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,583
[AMON] Anyway, what
can I do for you, sir?

130
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,958
Oh. Don't worry about
it now, we can talk later.

131
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,000
[AMON]
Are you sure?

132
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,791
Yeah, you go see Mado.

133
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,000
[SHINOHARA]
By the way.

134
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,000
You should know...

135
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,916
he was very proud of you
and what you've achieved.

136
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,916
Thanks. That's good to hear.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,250
I felt the same way.
He was a great partner.

138
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,958
[NEWSCASTER A] In a gruesome
scene uncovered late last night,

139
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,791
several bodies were found in
the 11th Ward. The CCG is now

140
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,000
treating the incident as
a ghoul related crime.

141
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,416
[HINAMI]
Hey, Kaneki!

142
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,250
[KANEKI]
Hinami, is that you?

143
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,458
Yep, you guessed it!

144
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,208
That's quite the
disguise you got there.

145
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,083
[HINAMI] Pretty cool, right? I
borrowed most of it from Touka.

146
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,916
Yomo's gonna take
me shopping today!

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,166
Shopping for what?

148
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,125
[HINAMI] We're getting
a bird house for Hetare!

149
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,791
Oh.

150
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,250
[HETARE]
Hetare! Hetare!

151
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,583
All right then, Yomo. Keep
a close eye on Hinami, okay?

152
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,000
[HETARE]
I'm a cat! Hetare!

153
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,500
[HINAMI]
See ya later!

154
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,291
[KANEKI] After she
lost her family,

155
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,166
Hinami ended up
living with Touka.

We thought we'd lost
her for a while there,

her smile back.

Oh, uh, hey, Touka.

You seen the bird?

164
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,958
Yeah, he's with Yoshimura.

it haunts my dreams. I hate it.

[KANEKI]
Touka isn't one to share,

168
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,666
but I can tell that
she's distracted.

169
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,166
Quit starin' if you
like that eye!

170

I'm sorry.

[KANEKI] Our wounds
are starting to heal.

172
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,291
In fact, there are times
when it feels like things

173
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,000
are almost back to normal. But
I don't know if that's possible

00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,125
after everything
we've been through.

[HINAMI whimpering]

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,208
[KANEKI] We were hit by
a tragedy and none of us

177
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,916
have fully recovered from it.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,250
But we're resolved
to go on living.

179
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,000
For those we've lost and
the child they left behind.

180
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,583
We're going to continue to fight
until we get our old lives back.

What the hell is the matter with
you? You're useless, woman!

183
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,708
[TOUKA] Excuse me? You
better shut your mouth

184
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,833
before I shove it full of
glass, you misogynist pig!

185

Oh, Yeah? You
would try that,

where the trash can is!

Well, that's the least
you can do, you dick!

189
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
Because you suck so hard
at everything else!

190

So Screw you and your lazy ass.
Do us both a favor and quit.

[NISHIKI] You'd love that,
wouldn't you? Y'know what?

192
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,875
We have a business to run,

193
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,541
you could cut back
on all the cursing?

[KOMA] You're a brave pair
to ignore me like this.

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,916
Impetuous even.

It's like you've never heard
the legend of the Devil Ape.

Oh, hell yeah, you are!

[NISHIKI] If I were lazy I
wouldn't have gotten into Kamii!

[NEWSCASTER A]
Among the casualties,

203
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
was a CCG investigator--

204
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,000
[AMON]
I failed you Mr. Mado.

205
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,041
I should've fought harder,
gotten to you sooner.

206
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,458
Then the rabbit would be dead.

207
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,625
And you'd still be with us.

208
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,833
[ITORI]
So what, you were like,

209
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,666
possessed by Rize's
ghost or something?

210
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,500
[KANEKI] That's not exactly
how I would describe it.

211
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,666
I don't remember much.
I must've blacked out.

212
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,166
When I came to,
I'd impaled Yomo.

Damn. You ran him through?

214
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
Most ghouls aren't
strong enough

215
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,666
to pierce through a
chiseled body like Ren's.

216
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500
[ITORI] I know who to call
if I ever need a hit man.

217
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,000
But Itori I--

Oh, relax, I'm only kidding!
What is it with you and Ren?

I'm freakin' hilarious.

[KANEKI]
Sorry, I'll work on that.

221
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,583
What's got me worried is that
this has happened once before.

222
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
Just like last night,

223
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,375
I could feel Rize's presence,
as she took control.

224
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,666
[ITORI] And here I thought
you came to hang out with me.

225
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,458
You want the scoop
on Rize, don't ya?

226
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,625
[KANEKI]
Yeah.

227
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,083
[ITORI] Well, I'll do
what I can for ya.

228

You've disarmed me with
that boyish charm of yours.

Rize, huh?

230
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,208
To be totally honest with you...

231
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,625
[KANEKI]
Yeah?

232
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,291
[ITORI] I don't know much
about her. I can tell you

233
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,166
the life story of anyone
else in this ward,

234
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,166
but she was a mystery.
It's the weirdest thing.

235
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,666
One day she just popped
up outta nowhere.

[KANEKI]
Whaddya mean?

237
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,833
[ITORI] Nobody knows
where she came from

238
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,666
or what she was up to
before she showed up here.

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,833
But, mysterious as she was,

240
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,541
she had to come from somewhere,
that girl had a past.

241
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,333
The info's out there, it'll
just take some work to find.

00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,458
[KANEKI]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

You could start by
going to the 11th Ward.

244

[KANEKI]
What makes you say that?

245
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,416
Because I asked her
where she'd moved from,

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,208
and that was her answer.
I'd start there if I were you.

247
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,875
Thanks for the tip.

[NEWSCASTER A]
Chairman Washu Tsuneyoshi has

announced an unusual
change in CCG strategy

278
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,041
Due to recent events, a large
numer of investigators will be

279
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,958

given' 'em that much trouble?

281
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,833
[KANEKI]
Beats me, man.

282
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,166
[HIDE] I wonder if the
balance has shifted.

283
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,541
What?

00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,833
[HIDE]
Hm? Oh.

285
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,125
It might sound silly, but
I have this theory that

286
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,583
there's a ghoul organization
that monitors this ward.

287
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,083
[KANEKI] Okay. What
makes you think that?

288
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,458
Well, we haven't had as
many predatory cases

289
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,750
as the others,
that is, until now.

290
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,000
I figured it's because
the 20th Ward's ghouls

291
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,708
have some kinda
pact or somethin'.

292
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,583
[KANEKI gasps]
Um...

293
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,333
As soon as their predation
began to attract attention,

294
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,708
both the binge-eaters and
the gourmets vanished.

295
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,041
It seems conceivable that this
ghoul organization would want

296
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,958
to clean house to avoid
a crackdown by the CCG.

there's this badass ghoul gang

306
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,416
and they all wear clown
masks. They call the shots

307
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,708
in the 3rd Ward, at least
until this ghoul named Matsubara

308
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,916
dips out of Wakayama
and heads for Tokyo!

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,208
[HIDE] I gotta jet.
See ya later, man!

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
[STAFFER] Investigator Amon,
reinforcements from

311
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,666
the head office are
waiting for you upstairs.

312
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,833
[AMON] Thank you.
I'll be right there.

313
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,041
[AMON] I wonder
who they've sent us.

314
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,166
I doubt it's a veteran officer,
they don't have any to spare.

315
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,791
[elevator dings]

316
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,416
Hey!

317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
[AMON]
Mr. Shinohara!

318
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,208
Don't tell me that they've
assigned you here.

319
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,291
[SHINOHARA]
No, I'm headed elsewhere.

320
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,208
But you get these
two fine officers.

321
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,333
[AMON]
Hoji!

322
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,791
Hello, Kotaro. It's
been far too long.

323
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,250
[AMON]
You can say that again.

324
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,666
[SEIDO]
Um. Mr. Amon, sir?

325
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,125
It's an honor to meet
you! Seido Takizawa,

326
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,875
Investigator Second Class,
Control Division One, sir!

327
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
He's been talking about
meeting you all day.

328
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,625
Looks like you've got a fan.

329
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,708
[SEIDO] Assistant
Special Investigator Hoji,

330
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,791
you're embarrassing me!

331
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,791
I mean, not that
that's a problem, sir.

332
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,000
[AMON] Nice to meet you,
Investigator Takizawa.

333
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,958
[SEIDO]
It's such an honor, sir!

334
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,375
Amon,

335
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,666
these two are gonna keep an
eye on the 20th Ward for you.

336
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,000
At least, until you get back.

337
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,875
You and I have been assigned
to a special task force.

338
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,541
A task force, are you
sure about this?

339
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,833
[SHINOHARA] Heard it
from Marude himself.

340
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,958
The 11th Ward. There's
something brewing.

341
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,750
Yeah, so I've heard.

342
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,500
[NISHIKI] Are you for real?
Sounds like shit's really

343
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,083
hittin' the fan
in the 11th, huh?

344
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,541
[KOMA] Yeah. I was
talkin' to Yomo.

345
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,875
Apparently a buncha'
ghouls've teamed up down there

346
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,291
to hunt the investigators.

347
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,875
Now the whole damn ward's
like a slaughterhouse.

348
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,416
[NISHIKI]
Man.

349
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Things get any worse. it'll
mean big trouble for all of us.

350
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,791
What do you mean
by "big trouble"?

351
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,166
Could be a war.

352
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,375
That's right. You guys
might get the chance

353
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,833
to see how I earned
the nickname, Devil Ape.

354
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,458
Anyway, where's Touka?

355
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,833
I'm not sure, but she
could with Hetare.

356
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,625
Seriously? But I thought
she was scared of birds.

357
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,791
Exposure therapy, maybe? I'll
go and check on her real quick.

358
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,666
[HETARE]
Hetare's a cat!

359
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,208
[TOUKA]
He had a family.

360
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,125
And I took him from them.

361
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,041
Hey, Touka?

362
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,708
[TOUKA] Do you think this little
guy's got a family out there?

363
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,916
[KANEKI]
Huh?

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,416
I mean...

365
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,791
Everybody has one, right?

366
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,625
Ayato!

367
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,083
[YOUNG AYATO]
Yeah, Sis? What's up?

368
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,833
[bird chirping]

369
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,041
[ARATA]
Poor little guy.

370
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,375
He must've fallen from the nest.

371
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,375
Whadda we do Dad?

372
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,291
Well, would you like to
take care of him at home?

373
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,416
Uh-huh!

374
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,416
Hey look, I
caught a worm!

375
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,625
[YOUNG AYATO shrieks]

376
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,541
You're a boy, you're
s'posed to like worms!

377
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,833
I know, but...

378
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,958
[YOUNG TOUKA]
C'mon! Do it for Chunta!

379
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,041
[YOUNG AYATO]
Okay.

380
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,875
That's a lot of
worms you caught.

381
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,500
[YOUNG TOUKA]
Mm-hmm.

382
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,666
Yeah!

383
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,791
You've turned into
such a tomboy, Touka,

384
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,125
you're just like your mother.

385
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,291
[YOUNG AYATO] So does that
mean I'm like you, Dad?

386
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,583
[ARATA] That it does,
my boy. I hate bugs, too.

387
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,625
So if you see one, you'll
have to call for your sister.

388
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,958
Whew! It looks like you
two could use a bath.

389
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,250
[YOUNG TOUKA]
I don't like baths,

390
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,666
but a hug might change my mind.

391
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,916
[YOUNG AYATO] I want one, too!
[ARATA] All right, deal.

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,875
[ARATA] I can't believe
how fast you're growing!

393
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,250
[ARATA] Touka, as the oldest
you're going to have to teach

394
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,041
your brother all
sorts of stuff.

395
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,166
And you're not off
the hook, Ayato.

396
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,500
You're going to have to
keep your sister safe.

397
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,833
'Kay!

398
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,583
Is that a promise?

399
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,250
[TOUKA] I never asked you.
What's your family like?

400
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,750
Well, uh--

401
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,375
My dad's been dead for about
as long as I can remember.

402
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,333
And my mom...

403
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,000
[KANEKI] She died while
I was in grade school.

404
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,500
Sorry.

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,041
It's dinnertime, Hetare!

406
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,291
[HINAMI]
Hi Kaneki!

407
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,375
[KANEKI] Hey, Hinami.
Did you get a haircut?

408
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,791
[HINAMI] Yeah, I did!
Do you like it?

409
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,958
[KANEKI] It really suits you.
Did you go to a hair salon?

410
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,333
I didn't have to!

411
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,458
Touka cut it for me right here!

412
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,500
[TOUKA] You surprised?
[KANEKI] Well, yeah.

413
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,916
[TOUKA] Didn't think I
had it in me, or what?

414
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,083
[KANEKI] It's not that. I'm just
impressed that it looks so good.

415
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,625
You've got talent.

416
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,708
It's no big deal.

417
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,375
[HETARE] Shut your
yap, stupid bird!

418
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,791
Don't peck me,
you son of a bitch!

419
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
[TOUKA] Are you tattling
on me, you stupid bird?

420
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,166
Better shut your yap before
you end up in a deep fryer!

421
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,583
[HETARE]
Asshole!

422
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,958
[BOTH giggle]

423
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,166
It's so bitter.

424
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,791
[NICO] You've met her
before, haven't you?

425
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,208
[MAN]
Who, Rize?

426
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,166
Yeah, but I don't exactly
have fond memories of her.

427
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,208
[knuckle cracks]

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,416
She won't get away
from me this time.

429
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,541
[can thudding]

430
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,958
[ICHIMI]
So this is the 20th Ward?

431
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,833
I've never been here before.

432
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,458
[JIRO] For some reason, it feels
like time moves slower here,

433
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,416
know what I mean?

434
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,958
[BANJO] Idiots. Don't
let your guard down.

435
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,333
We've got a job to do,
let's get moving.

436
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
[SANTE] We've got a lot
of ground to cover, Banjo,

437
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,166
where should we start?

438
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,625
[BANJO] There's a coffee
shop here called "Anteiku,"

439
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,458
that's run by some old ghoul.

440
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,833
Let's move. Rize's
been there before.

441
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,916
I just know it.

442
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,750
[screaming]
[thudding]

443
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,500
[MAN] These guys were
weak, even for humans.

444
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,375
Heard from that
dumbass, Banjo yet?

445
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,458
[SUBORDINATE A]
Not a word.

446
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,875
[MAN] Damn, he's
useless. At this rate,

447
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,208
Yamori and his fairy friend'll
get the jump on him.

448
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,333
Fine then. We'll head
to the 20th Ward ourselves.

449
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,708
And then secure
Rize, at all costs.

450
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,041
[SUBORDINATES]
Yes, sir!

[SUBORDINATE A]
Hey, wait a minute,

452
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,291
isn't that the ward
you grew up in?

453
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,125
[MAN] Yeah. But I don't
remember much about the place,

454
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,833
except that it's full of
human-loving cowards.

455
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:08,750
Ha ha. Come to think of it,
I still have some family there.

She's one of those

00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,958
Ha! Are we in a
western or what?

458
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,916
Looks like that handsome

459
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,458
about to get a
thrashing from Uta.

460
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,625
Heard someone's makin'
waves in my part of town.

461
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,083
That you?

462

466
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,833

smash up the 4th Ward!

467
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,958
[YOMO] On second thought,
I'm outta here.
