You think he's yours?

No way.

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,875
I hate to break it
to you, Tsukiyama

[TSUKIYAMA] Who'd've thought
I'd take on this much damage?

20
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,166
Your kagune is no more
powerful than mine.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,791
My, my. And here I thought
the fire within you was dead.

22
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,875
But it appears...

23
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,500
...your passion has reawakened!

24
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,958
I was wondering how I
could dress up my meal

25
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,958
and I think your organs will
make the perfect garnish!

26
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,416
Such an unexpected
hors d'oeuvre!

27

I'm afraid you've
left me no choice.

33
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,833
To be honest, I was hoping this
would play out more elegantly.

34
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,416
But now I'm desperate...

done to me!

her but she knows too much.

Don't do it!

You can't kill her.

It's not fair.

We've all got a
human we care about.

I've got Hide and
you've got Yoriko.

to kill Yoriko?

why I have to do it!

The incident at the church

was kind of a turning
point for us.

That's a stupid question.

Do you really think I'd
wear this silly get-up

just for the hell of it?

The biggest change of all?

[KANEKI] Do it for Kimi's sake.
If you keep taking human lives,

you're not only putting
your life in danger,

[YOSHIMURA] With the way that
we go about gathering our food,

115
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,791
Anteiku allows you
to live a relatively

guilt-free life as a ghoul.

However, there is something
that we ask of you in return.

[HIDE] Man, I hate to
break it to you, Nishio,

121
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,541
but a guy like you
doesn't really fit in

at a classy place like this.

s'posed to mean?

say or I'll throw you out.

Alright, alright.

A good woman. Now butt out.

Hold up! Don't tell me
that you're after Touka!

[NISHIKI] Gimme a break! I said
"good woman" not "dumb girl"!

[HIDE] Speaking of,
how's she doing?

131
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,083
Is she feeling any better?

00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,750
Dunno.

[KANEKI] I wish I knew
what was bothering Touka.

She hasn't been back
to work since that day.

What was that about?

00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,458
[NISHIKI]
She's a kid.

tantrums all the time.

Oh crap, I'm gonna be late!
Here, this should cover me.

[KANEKI]
Hey, Hinami?

144
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,458
[RYOKO] It's my fault
she's acting out.

145
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,875
Without my husband, I
have to be both parents.

146
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,291
Turns out that's a lot
harder than I thought.

147
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,750
[KANEKI] You don't have to
tell me if you don't want to.

148
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,333
But, um, why is she so upset?

149
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,416
[RYOKO] It's been a while
since we've heard anything

150
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,833
from my husband. She's
worried, and rightfully so.

151
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,708
But now she's insisting
that we go see him.

152
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,291
[KANEKI]
And that's bad?

153
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,291
Where is he right now?

Looks like business has been
slow for you lately, eh Doc?

158
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,708
[ASAKI] Here, take this
and get out of my office.

Hm...

Oh yeah, this'll be perfect.

Gotta hand it to you, this
craftsmanship is impressive.

chance against this!

163
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,166
[ASAKI] Now that I've
finished that for you.

164
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,875
Please leave me alone.

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,958
[YAMORI] What, you
don't like my company?

166
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,083
[ASAKI] I just want to
live my life in peace.

167
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,125
[ASAKI] Please.
[knuckle cracks]

168
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,958
[YAMORI]
As you wish.

169
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,583
[ASAKI]
Hinami, Ryoko,

170
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,541
We'll be together again soon.

171
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,083
[YAMORI]
Oh hey Doc,

172
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,833
I don't wanna be a nuisance
so I'll get out of your hair.

173
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,333
But before I go I gotta ask ya,

174
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,750
when did you become a
flunky for the humans?

175
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,791
[ASAKI grunts]

176
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,083
[RYOKO]
Well, you see,

177
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,958
My husband used
to be involved

178
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,083
with some dangerous
business in the 13th Ward.

179
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,833
But then, when Hinami was born,

180
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,625
he chose to leave
that life behind him.

181
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,875
I don't worry about his past.

182
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,875
He's a wonderful
husband and father.

183
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,916
That's all that matters.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,791
Well. See ya.

185
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,250
[KANEKI]
Uh, you okay?

186
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,750
Yeah, I'm fine.

187
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,541
I can take it from here. I'm
going to have a talk to her

188
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,375
and maybe even spoil
her a little bit.

189
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,458
[ASAKI groaning]

190
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,625
[ASAKI]
A box-carrier?

191
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,291
Why are the doves here?

192
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, well, look who it is!

193
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,333
It seems our patience
has paid off.

194
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,833
See? What'd I tell you?

195
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,916
As long as we use
the peons as bait,

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,541
we're bound to reel in a trophy.

197
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,708
or a bottom feeder in this case.

198
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,416
[AMON]
Mr. Mado, is that?

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,375
[MADO]
Jason. Funny seeing you here.

200
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,000
What's a big fish like you

201
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,958
doing in a small pond
like the 20th Ward?

202
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,500
You didn't honestly
think you could

203
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,458
wander around
undetected, did you?

204
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,583
He's S-rated.

205
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,625
The 13th Ward's Jason.

206
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,875
[RYOKO]
Open up.

207
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Please, Hinami. I
want to talk to you.

208
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,125
[HINAMI] No! I'm
not letting you in!

209
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,250
Leave me alone!

210
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,833
I know that you're
angry with me but--

211
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,708
[HINAMI] I just wanna see daddy
and you won't let me! Why, Mom?

212
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,875
Why won't you let me
see him? I hate you!

213
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,333
You need to calm down, Hinami!

214
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,500
[RYOKO]
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,041
I shouldn't have
raised my voice.

216
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,041
This is has been
hard on all of us.

217
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:00,208
I'm sure your dad misses you
just as much as you miss him.

218
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,625
I'm sorry. I wish
I could take you

219
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:07,333
to see him but I don't
want us to get in his way.

220
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,875
I hate that I'm putting
you through all this.

221
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,791
[lock clicks]

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
[MADO cackling]
Jason!

223
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,750
[MADO]
Jason! Jason!

224
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,916
I've got you now!

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,750
[AMON grunting]

226
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,083
[YAMORI]
You guys aren't half bad.

227
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,666
Sure. I'll entertain
ya for a minute or two.

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,166
[AMON] I'm sorry about that.
Guess I didn't get close enough.

229
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,333
No worries. Just be sure to
nail him with the next one.

230
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,250
[AMON]
Yes, sir.

231
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,333
[AMON gasps]

232
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,500
[AMON groaning]

233
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,791
[YAMORI]
Pathetic.

234
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,291
[AMON groans]

235
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,125
Did you really think that tough
guy act was gonna fool me?

236
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,708
How're ya doin'
over there, Amon?

237
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,916
[AMON grunts]
Fine, sir!

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,875
Good, then sit back
and catch your breath.

239
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,416
[weapons clanging]

240
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,791
[MADO gasps]

241
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,916
[YAMORI]
What a shame.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,958
[MADO]
Yeah, For you.

243
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,708
[MADO grunts]

244
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,833
[YAMORI laughing]
Are you kidding me?

245
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,333
That all you got?

246
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,791
No! Get away!

247
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,041
[YAMORI] Your time's up.
Better luck next time.

248
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,000
[AMON]
Dammit! You all right?

249
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,291
[MADO] Yes. But that
bastard broke my quinque.

250
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,375
[ASAKI grunting]

251
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,375
[MADO] Well, what
do we have here?

252
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,708
I wonder what kind of fish
we'll be able to attract

253
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,000
with this little worm.

254
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,583
[RYOKO]
Hinami...

255
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:48,333
[ASAKI grunting]

256
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,708
You're not alone.

257
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,166
Believe me, I miss him too.

258
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,541
[ASAKI grunting]
[MADO gasping]

259
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,541
I'm so sorry, mama!

260
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,291
[RYOKO]
Me, too.

261
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,583
[ASAKI yelling]

262
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,500
Okay, that's enough.

263
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,708
[RYOKO] Are you still
angry with me?

264
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,708
[HINAMI] Mm-mm. So don't
cry anymore, okay?

265
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,125
I can't promise anything
but I'll try my hardest.

266
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,625
Oh, Hinami. I love you.

267
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,291
[RYOKO] We have to try
to stay strong for Daddy.

268
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,875
We'll be together again soon.

269
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,333
[AMON] I still can't believe
we let Jason get away.

270
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,291
[MADO] There's nothing we
could've done to stop him.

271
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,291
Not after he broke my quinque.

272
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,625
[AMON]
Even so.

273
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,083
There's no need for you
to be so hard on yourself,

274
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,916
we're bound to run
into him again.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,625
Yeah, I guess you're right.

276
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,416
Oh... I think that
we can use this.

277
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,875
All right.

278
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,000
You've been such a trooper
through all of this, Hinami.

279
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,666
I want to make it up to you

280
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,541
so I'm going to get
you a little present.

281
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,041
Can you think of
anything you want?

282
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,125
[HINAMI]
Hm...

283
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,041
Well. Give it some
thought, okay?

284
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,125
[HINAMI]
Thank you so much, Mama!

285
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,625
[RYOKO] I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

286
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,083
[doorbell rings]

287
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,083
[doorbell rings]

288
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,541
[TOUKA sighs]

289
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,708
[TOUKA]
What do you want?

290
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
[KANEKI]
Sorry to bug you.

291
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,541
I was wondering if you're gonna
work your shift tomorrow.

292
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
[TOUKA]
I don't wanna.

293
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,333
Hey, listen--

294
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,375
I'm a complete failure.
I couldn't kill that woman.

295
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,291
[KANEKI gasps]

296
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, uh,

297
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,916
[KANEKI] I saw Hinami and
her mother fighting earlier.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,708
Thankfully they were
able to patch things up.

299
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,041
But as I was watching
them, I couldn't help

300
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:42,416
but think to myself, it must
be nice to have a family.

301
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,125
I realized that familial
bonds and relationships

302
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,125
are the same whether
you're a human or a ghoul.

303
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,041
I hate to admit it, but, I never
even thought about that

304
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,166
before I ended up like this.

305
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,833
If only everyone else would
come to that realization.

306
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,291
Then maybe Nishio and
Kimi's relationship

307
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,750
could serve as a guidepost

308
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,708
for the way things could be
between humans and ghouls.

309
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,041
[TOUKA]
Well? Is that it?

310
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,375
Uh. Well, yeah.

311
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,791
And also, I,

312
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,916
I wanted to apologize to you...

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
About Yoriko,

314
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,416
I shouldn't've mentioned her.

315
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,375
[KANEKI]
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,250
Um, I'll let the manager
know you need some time.

317
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,375
[KANEKI] I'm sure Touka agrees
with my way of thinking.

318
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,208
Especially after she
saw how Kimi, a human,

319
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,000
instantly accepted
her. But I know

320
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:42,375
that if it had gone the other
way and she had been rejected,

321
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,750
there would've been
no going back.

322
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,041
The same goes for Hide and me.

323
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,666
[HINAMI] Is Touka feeling
any better today?

324
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,708
[KANEKI]
Uh, that's a good question.

325
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,875
Do you think she'll be
back to normal soon?

326
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,041
[KANEKI]
Hm.

327
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,833
I've got another word for you.

328
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,625
How do you read
this one right here?

329
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,750
Lemme see.

330
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
That's a tough one,
it's "cloudburst".

331
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,875
[HINAMI]
What does that mean?

332
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,666
[KANEKI] It's a sudden rainstorm
that doesn't last verylong.

333
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,916
[RYOKO]
What's going on here?

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,375
[HINAMI]
Oh, hi Mom!

335
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,041
[RYOKO] Is this another
reading lesson?

336
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,250
[HINAMI]
Mm-hm!

337
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
[RYOKO] You're so sweet
to do this for her.

338
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,291
[KANEKI]
It's no big deal.

339
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,416
Well, I should go.

340
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
[HINAMI]
Thanks again, Kaneki.

341
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,208
[KANEKI] I'll see you tomorrow.
[HINAMI] Okay!

342
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,041
[HINAMI]
Hey Mama, look!

343
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,958
I've already learned all of
the words inside this book!

344
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,416
Really? I'm so
proud of you!

345
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,791
[HINAMI] Thanks. Can
I ask you something?

346
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,041
[RYOKO]
Sure, dear.

347
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,750
Well, now that I know
everything in this book.

348
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,750
[RYOKO]
Yeah?

349
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,250
[HINAMI]
Can you get me a new one?

350
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,541
I wanna learn even more
words so I can surprise Dad!

351
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,125
[HINAMI]
Also, his birthday's coming up

352
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,583
and I still need to get him a
present. So, I was wondering...

353
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,125
Let me guess, you want
to give him a book?

354
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,625
[HINAMI]
Mm-hm.

355
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,958
This calls for a trip
to the bookstore.

356
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,250
No, sorry.

357
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,666
[KUSABA]
Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,333
[KUSABA]
Excuse me.

359
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,250
[HIDE] Looks like
there's a storm coming.

360
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,833
Wow, you were right!
It is raining!

361
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,458
See? Does this mean that
you'll believe me next time?

362
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,375
Yeah!

363
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,166
Mom! You know what this is?

364
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,708
It's rain.

365
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,625
[HINAMI] No, a sudden storm
like this has a special name!

366
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,833
[RYOKO]
I didn't know that.

367
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,541
[HINAMI] Uh-huh! It's
called a cloudburst!

368
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,666
But don't worry, they
don't last very long.

369
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,625
At least that's what
Kaneki told me.

370
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,708
Goodness, he sure
is smart, isn't he?

371
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,833
You think Daddy knows
what a cloudburst is?

372
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
We'll have to ask him
when we see him.

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,375
It'd be so cool if I knew
something that he didn't.

374
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,041
That'd make me super smart, huh?

375
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,833
It would, indeed.

376
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,041
[HINAMI humming]

377
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,708
[RYOKO] What's gotten
into you, silly girl?

378
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,333
It's been a long time since
we've gone out, Mama!

379
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,583
Stay under the umbrella
or you'll get wet.

380
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,083
[HINAMI humming]

381
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,416
[RYOKO] Come on.
We have to go home.

382
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,083
[HINAMI]
But why?

383
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,791
[HINAMI] But I thought
we were gonna go

384
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,416
to that other place, Mama!

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,416
[KUSABA inaudible]

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,041
Is something wrong?

387
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,000
No, dear. There's just
something I need to do.

388
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,458
[HINAMI gasps]

389
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,208
Why did you stop?

390
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,750
[HINAMI inhales]

391
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,666
I smell Daddy!

392
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,000
[RYOKO]
Huh?

393
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,125
That's his scent! He's
gotta be somewhere nearby!

394
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,375
No way.

395
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,750
[HINAMI giggling]
He came to get us, Mama!

396
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,666
[RYOKO]
Hinami!

397
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,833
[HINAMI]
Come on, he's this way!

398
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,833
[RYOKO] No, you come
back here right now!

399
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,375
It's Daddy!

400
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,500
Wait! Hinami!

401
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,833
Where is he?

402
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,666
No, stop! Hinami!

403
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,333
It's Daddy! It's him! I know it!

404
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,166
[RYOKO]
Hinami!

405
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,500
[HINAMI]
I've missed you so much!

406
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,750
You're not my Daddy.

407
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,000
[RYOKO]
Hinami!

408
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,916
Mama. That's his scent.

409
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,125
[MADO] Don't you
just love the rain?

410
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,041
[MADO]
Although I have to admit

411
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,041
I'm glad it's not raining any
harder than this. Why, you ask?

412
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,041
Because it dulls ghouls' senses,

413
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,583
so you wouldn't have been
able to pick up his scent.

414
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,541
I don't suppose that I could
have a moment of your time.

415
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,000
Mrs. Fueguchi?

416
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,958
Mama...

417
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,541
[HINAMI]
I'm scared.

418
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,250
Oh...

419
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,708
[HINAMI gasps]

420
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,625
Run, dear.

421
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
Run fast.

422
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,500
But, Mama...

423
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,041
No...

424
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,625
Don't be scared. Just go to
Anteiku and I'll meet you there.

425
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,083
You don't have to worry,

426
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,250
I promise I'll be
right behind you.

427
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,875
Mama! I can't!

428
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,750
[HINAMI]
I wanna stay here with you!

429
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,416
[NAKAJIMA] Now Kusaba!
Use your Q-bullets!

430
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,208
[KUSABA]
Right!

431
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,375
Hurry, go!

432
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,916
[HINAMI gasps]

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,875
[HINAMI sobbing]

434
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,041
[KUSABA]
Hold it!

435
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,458
[MADO] Was that little display
meant to tug at my heartstrings?

436
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,791
'Cause it made me sick!

437
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,458
Just leave us alone!

438
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,041
[HINAMI]
Somebody, please! Help me!

439
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,500
Kaneki!

440
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,541
Touka!

441
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:51,125
[HINAMI sobbing, panting]

442
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,041
[HINAMI sobbing]

443
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,041
Mama!

444
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,916
Hey, guess what Nishiki?

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,875
What?

446
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,791
I got you a
little something.

447
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:42,916
What's this?

448
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
[KIMI] It's called
a bangle bracelet.

449
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,416
See? I've got one too.

450
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,125
[NISHIKI] Does she
seriously want us

451
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,166
to wear matching jewelry?

452
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,875
[NISHIKI] Well, I'll wear
it since it's a present.

453
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,375
But man, these bangles are
about as ugly as horse crap.

454
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,833
[KIMI] Huh? What do you
mean they're ugly?

455
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,250
Oh, did I say that?
I'm sorry, Kimi.

456
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,916
I didn't realize I said that in
my outside voice, don't hurt me!
