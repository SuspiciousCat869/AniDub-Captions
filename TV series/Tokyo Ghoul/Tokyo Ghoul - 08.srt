1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,958
[AMON] You're sure you want
to split up for this one?

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,875
[MADO] Yes. The waterway
is a big place.

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,333
The rabbit and number 745.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,750
Culling both of them
from the herd at once

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,875
might just put a
spring in my step.

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:20,958
[AMON]
If they show up.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,583
[MADO] My instinct
says they will.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,666
[AMON]
All right then.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,791
[MADO]
Let's get moving.

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,583
[AMON]
So, uh. What's with the luggage?

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,541
[MADO cackling] It's better
that you don't know, kiddo.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,958
[HINAMI sniffing]

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,416
[HINAMI]
Mama?

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,125
[KANEKI]
Oh! Touka!

15
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,666
[KANEKI]
Where have you been?

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,125
[TOUKA]
None of your business.

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,541
[KANEKI] If there's any way
I can help just say the word.

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,000
'kay?

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,041
[TOUKA]
Honestly, at this point,

20
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,750
I don't think there is.

21
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,083
[clicking]
[TOUKA gasps]

22
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,083
[TOUKA]
Hinami?

23
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,625
[TOUKA]
Hinami!

24
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,083
Oh, no.

25
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,083
[HINAMI sniffing]

26
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,625
Hinami?

27
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,666
[KANEKI]
Find Anything!

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,791
[TOUKA]
No! Nothing here. How about you?

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,125
[KANEKI panting]

30
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,916
[TOUKA]
Where could she be?

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,083
What if she--

32
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,500
[TOUKA]
What is this place?

33
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
[KANEKI]
Ryoko died here.

34
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:29,166
Nobody else. I promise, Hinami.

35
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,791
[HINAMI whimpers]

36
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,625
[KANEKI panting]

37
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
[KANEKI gasps]

38
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,666
[HINAMI screaming]

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,333
[KANEKI gasps]
That's close!

40
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,083
But which way!

41
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,791
She heard it, too.

42
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,416
[KANEKI] Oh crap! It's
the man from the before!

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,791
Touka!

44
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,333
[TOUKA]
Hinami!

45
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,000
[KANEKI panting]

46
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,291
That's got to be the rabbit.

47
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,000
No one else moves that way!

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,500
[KANEKI grunts]

49
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,750
Well, hello. And who are you?

50
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:31,458
[HINAMI sobbing]

51
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,458
You okay?

52
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,750
[HINAMI grunts]

53
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,791
Hinami, what is that?

54
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,083
It's my...

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,791
...Mom.

56
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,541
[TOUKA gasps]

57
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,166
[TOUKA]
It's too dangerous here.

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
Let's get you back to Anteiku.

59
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,875
[HINAMI]
No!

60
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,791
Ghouls and the world don't mix.

61
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,708
We can't live like this.

62
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,708
[HINAMI] I want to go
wherever mama went.

63
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,458
Could you send me there?

64
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,125
I just wanna see her again.

65
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,583
Please let me go to her.

66
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,625
[TOUKA]
It's gonna be okay.

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,750
I miss my mama.

68
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,125
So bad.

69
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,083
[HINAMI sobbing]

70
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,916
[footsteps sloshing]
[HINAMI sobbing]

71
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,666
[MADO cackles]

72
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,666
[AMON] Covering for
your rabbit friend?

73
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,250
I don't have that
kind of time to waste.

74
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,916
Get out of my way.

75
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,291
[KANEKI]
I can't do that.

76
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,166
[MADO] How's that
wound of yours?

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,833
Is it all healed up, Rabbit?

78
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,041
Trying to lure us here with
false leads was just pitiful.

79
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,000
A child could come up
with a better strategy.

80
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,416
You've earned a
spanking for that one.

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
Like your gift, honey?

82
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,541
I know you must miss your folks.

83
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,583
I've collected all but one
of the Fueguchi family.

84
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,833
Ha! You're all I need.

85
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,833
[TOUKA]
You bastard!

86
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,458
[KANEKI yelling]

87
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:19,916
[KANEKI grunting]

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,083
[AMON]
Quit screwing around!

89
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,166
[KANEKI gasping]

90
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,625
[KANEKI]
It's gonna be tough.

91
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,833
But I've gotta try
to keep him busy.

92
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,875
I can't let him get to them!

93
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,375
[KANEKI grunting]

94
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,416
[AMON] Are you
looking for a fight?

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,916
Then you've got one.

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,375
[KANEKI whimpers]

97
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,166
[AMON yells]

98
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
[KANEKI screaming]

99
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,125
[HINAMI gasps]

100
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,458
[MADO cackling]

101
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,416
[TOUKA yelling]

102
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,708
[MADO giggling] You're not like
the other guppies, are you?

103
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,958
Bounce for me!

104
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,416
Bounce, wascally wabbit!

105
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,458
Better keep moving
or you're mine!

106
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,833
Your weapon isn't much use
in confined spaces like this.

107
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,916
[MADO]
Tch!

108
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,666
[TOUKA grunting]

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,416
[MADO gasps]

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,458
[MADO coughs]

111
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,833
[AMON] There's something I've
always wanted to ask you ghouls.

112
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,541
When you take the lives
of innocent people,

113
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:40,166
do you ever stop to think
about the pain you're causing?

114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,708
This world would be a
better place without you.

115
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,333
Think about all the
orphaned children,

116
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,291
the families
destroyed by grief...

117
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,541
...the loneliness.

118
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,666
Are your victims just
faceless entrees to you?

119
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,208
Answer me, you monster!

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,666
Do you know what it's like to
be hunted for no good reason?

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,791
[TOUKA]
The confusion and the fear,

122
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,125
and the rage when someone
close to you is butchered.

123
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,000
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

124
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,916
You monster!

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,875
[AMON] The rabbit murdered
a good man the other day.

126
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,333
Why did he deserve to die?

127
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,458
Because he was
an investigator?

128
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,375
Because he was human?

129
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,791
Bullshit!

130
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,625
He was my friend, and you
killed him for no reason!

131
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,958
Ryoko never hurt anyone,
and you killed her

132
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,458
just for being a ghoul!

133
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,333
[AMON] This whole
world's gone to hell.

134
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,666
And it's your kind
who sent it there!

135
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,416
[TOUKA] There's only one
way to deal with your kind.

136
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,208
[KANEKI screaming, gasping]

137
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,666
Kill them all!

138
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,416
[TOUKA grunting]

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,458
[HINAMI whimpers]

140
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,708
That's right.

141
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,041
You recognize it, don't you?

142
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,416
[HINAMI whimpers]

143
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,625
[MADO]
What's wrong?

144
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,875
[HINAMI whimpering]

145
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,875
[MADO]
Don't be shy.

146
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,916
[HINAMI whimpering]

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,625
Say hi to mama!

148
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,833
[HINAMI screaming]

149
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,875
And here I thought
you'd be happy

150
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,791
to see her one last
time, my mistake!

151
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,458
[MADO cackling]

152
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,583
[TOUKA screaming]
I'll kill you!

153
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,750
[KANEKI] Ghouls are
screwing up the world?

154
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,375
Is that really true?

155
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:37,541
[KANEKI] I mean Ryoko didn't
go out and terrorize anybody.

156
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,458
And what about Hinami?

157
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,875
She had her loved ones
taken from her, too.

158
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,500
Doesn't her pain
count for something?

159
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,791
Ghouls have feelings, too.

160
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,875
No different than humans.

161
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,625
Why can't people focus
on that, for a change?

162
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:02,208
Why can't they see we're
not all that different?

163
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,625
Why don't they understand?

164
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,500
How could something so obvious,

165
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:12,708
be so hard for them to see?

166

[KANEKI gasps]

168
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,875
[KANEKI]
What if I'm the only one...

169
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,791
...who's aware of it?

170
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,208
Maybe I can break
through to them.

171
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,458
I can make them see.

172
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,250
Because I'm both
human and ghoul.

173
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,250
[KANEKI]
It's in my hands.

174
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,458
[KANEKI]
You're wrong.

175
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,083
It's not the world
that's messed up.

176
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,000
It's those of us in it.

177
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,500
Yes,

178
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:52,333
some ghouls walk a path that
leaves sorrow in their wake,

179
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,791
but just like humans,

180
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,291
we can choose a
different path altogether.

181
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,375
We have a lot to learn.

182
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,416
both your kind and mine.

183
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,708
We need to stop fighting,

184
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,541
and start talking.

185
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,083
Because when it comes to
the state of the world,

186
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,458
you can't point your
finger at ghouls or humans.

187
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,416
We're all to blame.

188
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,666
What are you talking about?

189
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,666
[KANEKI] I'm still not
getting through to you, am I?

190
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,000
Fine, then.

191
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,708
I'll make you understand.

192
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
[TOUKA screaming]

193
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,416
I can't wait to see the
quinque you'll become.

194
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,375
Y'know, honey, using
your mama and daddy

195
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,500
together makes for
one powerful combo.

196
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,333
I can't even begin to tell you

197
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,791
how much fun I had ripping
them both to shreds.

198
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,208
[MADO]
There was blood everywhere!

199
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,625
Stop it!

200
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,500
[MADO]
Now then.

201
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,833
Any preference on which of
these finishes the job, Rabbit?

202
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,250
Blow it out your ass.
Sick old bastard!

203
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,458
Someone should wash
out that mouth.

[HINAMI whimpering]

205

[KANEKI gasping]

210
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,666
[KANEKI] What can I do
to get through to him?

211
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,833
How can I make him
see what I see?

212
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,166
[AMON yelling]

213
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,791
[KANEKI] We have to put
an end to the hostility.

214
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,500
Stop taking each others' lives.

215
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,375
If we could that,

216
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,458
then maybe...

217
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,708
...we could finally break
free of this vicious cycle!

218
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,083
But that's easier
said than done.

219
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,875
Stay down, already!

220
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,083
[AMON] I've had it with your
game. You're a waste of my time.

221
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,125
[AMON gasps]

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,875
Let go of me.

223
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,625
[KANEKI] I can't let him
get to Touka and Hinami.

224
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,750
I need to keep him
here as long as I can.

225
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,250
But I don't have the
strength to fight anymore.

226
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,583
[KANEKI]
That's it.

227
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,750
I guess It's the only
option I have left.

228
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,458
Very well.

229
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,125
I won't fight you.

230
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,958
Just this once.

231
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,416
I'll let you do your thing.

232
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,166
Don't make me regret it.

233
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,625

[KANEKI] This hunger is
going to drive me wild.

It's so overwhelming I can
feel myself slipping away.

242
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,416
But I'm not going to lose
sight of the person I am.

Not if I can help it!

after my quinque.

[KANEKI]
It's over.

without his weapon.

[AMON] I'm completely

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,291
No!

253
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,958
When the foe's
before you, fight!

254
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,750
Even if it costs you your life!

255
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,875
You need to run,
while you can.

[KANEKI]
The way this is going,

258
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:09,208
I won't have the strength
to keep from killing you.

259
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,791
So, please, you have to run!

260
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,916
[AMON]
No!

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,875
I'm not going to run
away from a ghoul!

262

[KANEKI]
I'm begging you.

267
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,583
Please, go.

268
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,166
I don't want to be the
monster you think I am.

269
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,250
[TOUKA] I think you'd be
singing a different tune

270
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,166
if you'd been born a ghoul.

271
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,916
What's wrong with wanting
to live? Explain that to me.

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,708
If humans are
all we can eat,

273
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,500
then what other
choice do we have!

274
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,458
How're we supposed
to live by your rules

275
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,750
when our bodies won't
let us? How do we survive?

276
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,750
We can't!

277
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,041
We can't, we can't, we can't!

278
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,875
Don't you see?
We'd all die!

279
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,541
I don't want much.

280
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,666
I just want to live my life.

281
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,750
The same way you do.

282
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,458
Your blubbering is boring me.

283
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,583
But I know how to shut you up!

Don't hurt Touka anymore!

And don't use my mommy
and daddy like that!

295
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,375
It's wrong and I won't let you!

00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,416
[MADO laughing]
Absolutely incredible!

297
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,875
I'm impressed, honey!

298
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree!

299
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,791
Your kagune's truly
something to behold!

300
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,166
I want it!

301
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,416
Give it to me!

[TOUKA]
Hinami.

307
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,416
Finish him off.

308
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,250
[HINAMI]
I can't.

309
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,791
Why not?

310
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,541
He deserves it, for what he did.

311
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,333
[HINAMI] I know. But I
don't care about that.

312
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
I don't care...

313
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,250
...about revenge.

314
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,708
[HINAMI sobbing]

[HINAMI]
I'm just sad, that's all.

00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,458
I can't help it.

317
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,000
I miss them more
and more every day.

318
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,416
It won't stop hurting.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,041
Mama...

320
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,375
...and Daddy.

321
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,750
I'm so lonely without you.

322
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,541
[HINAMI sobbing]

323
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,458

00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,833
She's right.

325
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,625
She'll only get lonelier
without her parents.

326
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,083
I'll send her to them.

327
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:23,041
And once she's in hell, I'll
use her as my new quinque!

328
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:27,958
[MADO groans]

329
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
[MADO] Well, this went
to shit in a hurry.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,541
That speech of yours.

331
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,333
Do you really believe

332
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,625
your kind deserves to live?

333
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,250
Don't make me laugh.

334
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,750
I'm not...

335
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,250
...out of steam.

336
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,625
Not yet!

337
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,375
I won't give up,
not until I get him.

338
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,541
I will find that
one-eyed bastard,

339
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,166
and make him pay
for what he did.

340
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,083
I can't...

341
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,041
...die yet.

342
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,583
[AMON]
That ghoul...

343
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,833
Why didn't he finish me off?

344
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,041
It looked like he was crying.

345
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,166
[KANEKI gasping]

346
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,583
[KANEKI] It's no good.
I can't control it!

347
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
No! Somebody...

348
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,875
Help me!

349
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:32,500
[KANEKI groaning, gasping]

350
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,333
[KANEKI]
I need to eat flesh!

351
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,500
No, stop!

352
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,791
You know what that means!

353
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,166
[KANEKI, RIZE]
Be careful. That's dangerous.

354
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,083
Standing so close when I'm
dying to grab a bite of flesh.

355
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,750
[MAN]
I finally understand

356
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,250
why Yoshimura's taken
such an interest in you.

357
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,791
[MAN] From here on out, I'll
be keeping an eye on you, too.

358
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
I'm interested to see
what you'll accomplish.

359
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,625
[KANEKI gasps]

360
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,166
Come home, Kaneki.

361
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,833
You're safe.

362
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,000
Yomo?

363
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,208
It's you.

364
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,458
No. What have I done?

365
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,208
[YOMO] Eat this. It'll
make you feel better.

366
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,208
I bet you always
wore these things.

367
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,375
Are we so vile you
couldn't bear to touch us?

368
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,750
Was that it?

369
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,416
[TOUKA gasps]

370
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:48,333
[TOUKA hyperventilating]

371
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,708
[KANEKI]
Hinami!

372
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,875
Hey.

373
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,416
Where'd Touka go?

374
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,291
[AMON choking up]

375
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:37,250
[AMON screaming]

376
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,708
[HINAMI] Maybe that
old man was right.

377
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,208
I shouldn't be alive.

378
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,875
Because I'm a ghoul.

379
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,291
No, he was wrong.

380
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,958
[KANEKI] I think
that's what your mom

381
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,666
was trying to tell
you back there.

382
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,208
You have the right to
live as much as anyone.

383
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,333
[HINAMI]
Yeah.

384
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,291
[MADO] I can't believe I
bit the big one back there.

385
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,916
Amon must be sweating
buckets about now.

386
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
[AMON]
Ah-choo!

387
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,458
[MADO laughing]
Time to see

388
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,791
what this afterlife
business is all about.

389
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,708
Hot baths always
hit the spot.

390
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,250
Yeah, it's so relaxing!

391
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,458
Right? My head feels like
it might fly off my neck.

392
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,666
[MADO cackling]

393
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,250
[ALL screaming]

394
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,833
[MAN A]
My head flew off!

395
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,541
[ASAKI] The neighbors
are being rowdy today.

396
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,916
They certainly are.
