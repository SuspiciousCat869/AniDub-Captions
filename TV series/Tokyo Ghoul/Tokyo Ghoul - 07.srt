Hinami!

It's Kaneki!

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,750
[KANEKI]
Sorry!

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,875
Calm down, what's the matter?

9
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,250
It's mama!

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,458
You gotta help her!

11
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,291
What? Where is she?

12
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,416
[KANEKI]
Let's go!

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,250
It looks like someone
isn't used to fighting.

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,416
That kagune's potential is
wasted on the widow, here.

[BOTH panting]

16
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,458
Dear old mother lays down her
life for the sake of her child.

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,708
That right? You're a
noble waste of flesh?

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,500
Makes my skin crawl.

19
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,708
Watching ghouls mimic human
behavior is like bad theatre.

20
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,583
It's almost funny, somehow.

21
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,750
[KANEKI]
What am I doing?

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,875
I don't even know what
I'm getting into!

23
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,416
Hey, Amon. You can
sit this one out.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,875
Allow me to take
care of the rest.

25
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,541
[KANEKI] Do I take
her to her mother?

26
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,291
Or do I get her to safety?

[RYOKO gasps]

28
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,375
No way! Is that?

00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,708
No, it can't be!

30
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:24,583
[MADO cackling]
Oh yes, it can!

31
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,666
[RYOKO]
My husband.

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,958
Bingo!

33
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,250
That's the expression
I wanted to see!

34
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,166
A harmony of terror,
hatred, and despair!

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,125
Oh, how I love that look!
I can't get enough of it!

36
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,208
I want more!

37
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,125

[HINAMI muffled grunting]

39
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,333
We can't let them find us!

40
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,625
[KANEKI] This was a bad idea.
How'm I supposed to help her?

41
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,250
Still, I'm not above courtesy.

42
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,291
How about it, Mom,
any last words for us?

43
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,708
What's the matter?

44
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,500
There's no reason to hold back.

00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,791
Time's up!

46
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,291
So sorry. But we
don't have all day.

[HINAMI muffled screaming]

48

[KANEKI]
When it came down to it

49
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
all I was good for...

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,625
...was protecting her
from that awful sight.

What the--?

00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,583
Oh, hey.

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,833
What's up?

54
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,958
Welcome back. Feeling better?

55
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,625
[TOUKA] Much better, thanks.
I'm sorry for missing work.

56
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,916
[YOSHIMURA]
I understand.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,833
[TOUKA] So. What's with
all the doom and gloom?

58
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,666
Well, Earlier today,
investigators found Ryoko.

59
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,500
She didn't make it out alive.

[KANEKI gasps]

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,958
[TOUKA]
And Hinami?

64
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,583
Please don't tell me
they got her, too!

65
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,291
[YOSHIMURA] No, she's fine.
She's sleeping in the next room.

66
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,166
Thank goodness! They didn't
see her face, did they?

67
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,500
[TOUKA]
I can't believe this.

68
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,500
I didn't think things
could get any worse.

69
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,000
[YOSHIMURA]
It's too dangerous now,

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,708
but when it calms down,

71
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,208
I think it'd be best to
move her to the 24th Ward.

72
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,916
[TOUKA] You're kidding,
right? That cesspool?

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,375
There's no way she'd survive
on her own out there!

74
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,500
Calm down.

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,875
Why not just kill the doves
and be done with it?

76
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,791
They have it coming!
Whaddya say?

77
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,583
Are you in, Yomo? If we work
together, we can beat them!

78
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,833
Forget it.

79
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,791
If we kill the doves
in the 20th Ward,

80
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,166
it'll attract attention.

81
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,208
They'll send reinforcements
hell-bent on revenge.

82
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,541
They'll hunt us to extinction.

83
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,333
But still!

84
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,083
Drop it, Touka.

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
Sorry, I have to
agree with Yomo.

86
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,833
We cannot make a move
against the doves.

87
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,125
As much as I'd love
for that to happen,

88
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,666
we have to think
of everyone's safety.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,166
You're letting them
get away with it?

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,583
They killed one of our own,

91
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,625
and you're gonna sit
here and let it slide?

92
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,333
What's Hinami going to think
when she finds out.

93
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,458
That you're too scared to
avenge her mother's death?

94
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,000
The inability to take vengeance
isn't cause for sorrow.

95
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,666
If you truly want
to pity someone,

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,333
Then pity those who
obsess over vengeance

97
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,125
and forget to live out
their own lives.

98
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,000
That s'posed to be
a jab at me, old man?

99
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,250
[KANEKI]
It's my fault. All of it.

100
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,708
If Hinami had found
Touka instead of me,

101
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,375
her mother'd be alive.

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,375
You shouldn't take the
blame for what happened.

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,166
It's not yours.

104
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,583
[KANEKI sobbing]
Dammit!

105
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:36,083
I'm so useless!
I just stood there!

106
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,041
I couldn't do anything!

107
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,208
[AMON] So Jason's base isn't
in the 20th Ward, after all.

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,791
Well, if the information
in this report is accurate,

109
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,125
then it might be a good idea
to check out the 11th Ward.

110
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,916
So you think that
Jason might be...

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
...part of the
organized movement?

112
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,375
[MADO] That's what my
instincts are telling me.

113
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,708
Sucks, I know.

114
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,625
But jurisdiction's always
been a cruel mistress.

115
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,875
Special Investigator Marude
gets our sloppy seconds.

116
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,666
What about the other S-class
ghouls in the 20th Ward?

117
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
The so-called
"binge eater" and "gourmet"?

118
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,500
[MADO]
They're staying off the radar.

119
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,333
You have to admire prey that
can match you move-for-move,

120
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,666
keeps things interesting.

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
That said, it makes
our job harder.

122
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,291
It's a waste of
time to speculate

123
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,458
where a target's hiding.
So, that means...

124
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,916
We need to pound the pavement,
sir. Search for them.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,208
Try enough fishing holes and
you're bound to nab a big one.

126
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,875
Eventually.

127
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,791
[MADO]
Okay. Starting tomorrow,

128
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,041
we go back to straight-up
detective work.

129
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,250
Rest up tonight.

130
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,333
You may not have another
chance for a while.

131
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,250
[AMON]
Good idea.

132
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,125
Right.

133
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,875
You got plans, sir?

134
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,500
No, I don't have many talents
outside of work I'm afraid.

135
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,083
Oh, I almost forgot.

136
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,166
[MADO] Keep in mind that number
seven forty-five saw our faces.

137
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,708
She could be out for blood,

138
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,916
so I'd suggest you don't
sleep too soundly.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,750
Oh yeah, right. Like a
kid's gonna do anything.

140
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,458
[AMON]
An orphan?

141
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,708
[TOUKA]
So that's them.

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,000
[CLERK A]
Come on in!

143
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,583
One shrimp tempura
and chicken onigiri.

144
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,458
[KUSABA] Why dontcha try
something new, Nakajima?

145
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,916
I don't want to hear it.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,333
He orders the same
thing every day.

147
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,208
Really?

148
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,875
So, what are you getting?

149
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,916
[CLERK A]
Large kakiage bowl. Enjoy!

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,625
[AMON slurping]

151
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,250
[KUSABA] Hey, Amon, you came
up through the Academy, right?

152
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,916
Uh, yeah. I did.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,916
I've always wondered, what
sort of stuff do they teach you?

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
Mostly the law and how
it pertains to ghouls.

155
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,083
I'd say, other than that, you
do a lot of weight lifting.

156
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,166
I'm sorry, but I can't
go into further detail.

157
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,708
Did you train with any ladies?

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,416
Zip it, Kusaba!

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,333
Yeah, of course I
did. Two of them.

160
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,833
They were strong-willed and
about as sharp as they come.

161
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,041
Lucky!

162
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,041
Let me guess, you fell
hard for one of 'em?

163
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,250
Moron! Would you shut up?!

164
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,375
[AMON] They were both
killed in the line of duty.

165
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you serious?

166
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:19,750
[AMON]
Yeah.

167
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,208
Damn. Sorry, I didn't...

168
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,000
...know.

169
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,000
[AMON]
That's the way it goes.

170
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,583
The more earnest they are, the
sooner they end up in the dirt.

171
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,750
[AMON] Sorry, I
have to get going.

172
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,500
Get some rest, okay, guys?

173
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,833
[NAKAJIMA]
Good work today.

174
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,708
[KUSABA]
See you tomorrow.

175
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,208
Asshole.

176
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah. Sorry 'bout that.

177
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,416
[KUSABA]
"The more earnest they are,

178
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,375
the sooner they
end up in the dirt?"

179
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,208
You think the big
guy was telling us

180
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
not to work too hard back there?

181
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,625
Don't be stupid. Not with
the pile we've got right now.

182
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,000
To think, we got
off reasonably light.

183
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,791
I'm just saying that
we shouldn't sweat it.

184
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,291
The guys at the home office
can pick up the slack for us.

185
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,666
You keep up that attitude,

186
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,375
and you'll be gracing
the branch office for life.

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,708
Hell, both of us will.

188
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,166
Maybe that's okay.

189
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,958
I mean, Amon doesn't seem
too worried about moving up.

190
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,250
It seems like the man works out
of a pure sense of justice.

191
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,416
Yeah, well. I can't
argue with that.

192
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,083
[KUSABA]
Honestly, I think he's amazing.

193
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,750
[NAKAJIMA] You've got
a ways to go before

194
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,375
you can compare yourself to
someone from the home office.

195
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,958
[KUSABA]
Yeah, I know.

196
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,416
[KUSABA] Back when
I started this job,

197
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,708
my only goal was finding
a safe desk to sit behind.

198
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,500
But seeing the
single-minded devotion

199
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,208
Amon brings to the
job gets me pumped.

200
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,458
I feel like I could totally

201
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,666
take on all the ghouls
myself, you know?

202
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,333
Maybe I'll start working
harder from now on.

203
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,041
[NAKAJIMA]
Kusaba?

204
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,125
[NAKAJIMA]
Kusaba!

205
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,125
Damn monster!

206
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,875
[NAKAJIMA grunts]

207
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,125
[AMON] Don't move!
Save your strength.

208
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,458
[AMON]
Who is that!

209
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:17,000
[AMON grunting]

210
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,291
[AMON] An ukaku kagune!
It's a high-speed ghoul!

211
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,083
[AMON gasps]

212
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,416
[AMON grunting]

213
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,666
[AMON panting]

214
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,208
[AMON]
Is this how it's going to end?

215
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,416
[AMON panting]

216
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,583
[AMON]
No!

217
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,791
When the foe is
before you, fight!

218
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
Even if it costs you your life!

219
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,500
[MADO] Well, well,
what do we have here?

220
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,333
Were you going to try to
take her on all by yourself?

221
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,625
Now you see why it always helps
to have your quinque with you.

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,208
Right. Thank you.

223
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,625
Losing your composure
out here can be fatal.

224
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,916
Don't forget that.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,333
Yes, sir.

226
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,541
How about I take this dance?

227
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,833
[MADO] Oo! You're a
nimble one, aren't you?

228
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,083
This is gonna be fun.

229
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,208
Huh. Let me guess,

230
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,625
were you buddies
with the she-ghoul

231
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,750
I popped off yesterday?
You missed quite a show!

232
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,291
Would you like
me to tell you

233
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,208
how that pathetic
sow met her demise?

234
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,666
[TOUKA gasps]

235
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,833
Oh my, where
are my manners?

236
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,625
I know it was recent, but
I can't help bringing it up.

237
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,625
I mean, she was so
weak and helpless.

238
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,416
But, I put her
out of her misery!

239
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,250
[TOUKA]
Sick bastard.

240
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,666
[MADO giggling]
Missed!

241
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,333
Would you look at this, Amon?

242
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,166
This is a chance
for us to review

243
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,791
what you learned at the Academy!

244
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,250
[TOUKA grunts]

245
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,958
A ghoul with an
Ukaku will strike

246
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,375
with a flurry of attacks
that rely on speed and guile.

247
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,791
[TOUKA grunts]

248
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,291
That said, they're relatively
short on stamina.

249
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,333
If you can manage
to dodge their attacks

250
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,875
long enough to tire them out,
they're far more manageable.

251
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,708
[TOUKA grunts]

252
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
[MADO]
Now.

253
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,500
About your dead friend.
She had a kid, didn't she?

254
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,208
Be a good sport and tell
us where we can find her.

255
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,708
Poor thing's been separated
from her mother.

256
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,583
Do you have any idea how
hard that is on a child?

257
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,333
[MADO] I have to hurry
and kill her, too.

258
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,375
[TOUKA]
Damn you!

259
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,458
[TOUKA groans]

260
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,458
All too easy.

261
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,041
[MADO] I've left more
of your ilk in the garbage

262
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,041
than you could ever eat of mine
in a lifetime, little Rabbit.

263
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,791
When it's all
said and done,

264
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,875
you'll just be another
notch in my belt!

265
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,166
[TOUKA]
Tch!

266
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,583
Shit!

267
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,458
Well, no matter.

268
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,750
[MADO]
I'll remember you, Rabbit.

269
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,666
You can count on it.

270
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,083
[KANEKI]
At least she's resting.

271
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,416
[crash]

272
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,708
[KANEKI]
Touka!

273
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,000
[TOUKA]
Stay away!

274
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,541
[KANEKI]
Your wound! It's bad!

275
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,375
[TOUKA] That's my
problem, not yours.

276
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,833
[YOSHIMURA]
Did you go dove hunting

277
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,125
while you were out?

278
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,500
[KANEKI] She's been injured!
She needs medical attention.

279
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
[YOSHIMURA]
That's too bad.

280
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,958
She won't find any help here.

281
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,583
Sir, why are you
acting like this?!

282
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,416
[YOSHIMURA] She should've
thought about the consequences

283
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,791
before she attacked the
doves against my wishes.

284
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,375
Whether she lives or dies
is in her hands now.

285
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,791
It doesn't concern you, or me,
or anyone else at this café.

286
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,083
You're serious?

287
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,416
Hey, Touka!

288
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,166
Wait!

289
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,833
[YOSHIMURA]
Let her go.

290
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,250
With all due respect, sir, I
know that you've seen a lot,

291
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,333
and I'm sure your decision
is based on experience.

292
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,708
I don't have that.

293
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,458
I don't know what's
expected of me

294
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,708
when it comes to being a ghoul.
Nor do I know what to expect

295
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,875
should I step out of line.

296
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,041
I have to learn by
experiencing things myself.

297
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,875
That's the only thing I can do.

298
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,583
[YOSHIMURA]
Hm.

299
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,125
[TOUKA]
Tch!

300
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,625
What do you want?

301
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,333
I brought you the
first-aid kit.

302
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,250
I don't need it.

303
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,875
But, you're bleeding.

304
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,333
It's 'Not your
concern'. Remember?

305
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,791
Touka...

306
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,375
[TOUKA] Can't you see
you're annoying me?

307
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,083
Go away, ya damn human!

308
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,416
I'm more ghoul than
human these days!

309
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,375
[KANEKI sighs]

310
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,666
[KANEKI]
Why did you go alone?

311
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,875
[TOUKA] It's okay if a killer
like me dies out there.

312
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,416
But when an innocent like
Ryoko or Hinami gets hurt...

313
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,291
Especially when there's
no reason for it,

314
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,166
it drives me crazy!

315
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,666
[KANEKI] She knew what
she was doing was wrong.

316
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,958
But she went ahead
and did it anyway.

317
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,708
Nothing was going to stop
her from fighting back.

318
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,958
Hear me out. I'm
against killing anyone.

319
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,041
I don't think what
you did was right,

320
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:55,208
and, to be honest, I think that
the investigators are necessary,

321
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:59,625
but, when I watched Ryoko's last
moments, I realized something.

322
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,333
If it was a ghoul who
died, or a human being,

323
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,416
if it was someone I
knew I'd be crushed.

324
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,958
And, just so we're clear, Touka,

325
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,875
that includes you.

326
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,375
S'that so?

327
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,125
[KANEKI] I wanna help you
fight them, if you'll let me.

328
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,291
I won't kill any
investigators.

329
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,750
But I don't wanna sit on
the sidelines. Not anymore.

330
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,791
I wanna do something!

331
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,708
Investigator Kusaba
will be remembered

332
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
for his valor in the field.

333
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,625
Let us now honor his memory by
observing a moment of silence.

334
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
Please, bow.

335
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,750
[MARUDE]
Where the hell is Mado?

336
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,000
So, one of his crew
winds up in a casket.

337
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,041
And the old man can't
be bothered to show up?

338
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,208
Asshole move, if you ask me.

339
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,625
I'm sorry, Amon,

340
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,625
but I doubt that he'd even
show up to your funeral.

341
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,208
You know, if it hadn't
been for that one incident.

342
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,333
The fool might be a
Special Investigator by now.

343
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,125
What a messed up world, right?

344
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,666
[MARUDE whispering] 11th Ward's
gonna see some real action soon.

345
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,333
You'll be called in once
the fireworks get started.

346
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,208
So finish your chores
down in 20th before then.

347
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,791
[AMON]
Nakajima.

348
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,458
Care for a bite?

349
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,041
[NAKAJIMA] Luckily he
didn't leave a widow.

350
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,708
Imagine the hell she'd be
going through right now.

351
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,458
So you know, Kusaba
really looked up to you.

352
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,708
You were his hero.

353
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,041
I'm no hero.

354
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,958
[CLERK A]
Here ya go.

355
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,625
It's weird seeing
you two in here

356
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,041
without the fellow
in the glasses.

357
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,125
[NAKAJIMA] Could we
get some water, please?

358
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,666
Three cold waters comin'
up. Or, two, rather. My bad.

359
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,541
[NAKAJIMA]
My favorite.

360
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,041
I order the same
thing every day.

361
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,083
That jerk, Kusaba. He always
gave me flak for it.

362
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,708
And to add insult to injury,
he'd stick me with the bill.

363
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,958
What'd I do?

364
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,875
I bought his meals while
he sat there and let me.

365
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,416
I didn't care, just
as long as he'd shut up.

366
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,250
I finally got rid
of that little prick,

367
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,208
and now I'm stuck eating alone.

368
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:21,083

I promise you that Kusaba's
memory will live on!

371
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
Nakajima!

372
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,625
I've got a few more bowls
in me, but I'm flat broke.

373
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,166
Do you think you could
spot me, just this once?

374
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,083
Why not just eat my paycheck
and be done with it?

375
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,208
[train horn blaring]

[KANEKI]
Touka?

377
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,208
[TOUKA]
Yeah?

378
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,125
[KANEKI] Is there a reason
we're wading through sewage?

379
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,625
[TOUKA] You said
you wanted to help.

380
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,625
Well, now you're helping.

381
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
[KANEKI] And how
am I doing that?

[water sloshing]

383
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,208
[TOUKA]
This should do.

384
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,333
[TOUKA]
All right, onto the next one.

385
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,250
This time, it's your turn.

386
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,083
[KANEKI]
What do you mean? Hey!

387
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,541

This is Mado.

[WOMAN ON PHONE]
Excuse me, Senior Investigator,

391
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,916
but you asked to be notified
if we received information

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,916
regarding number 745?

393
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,041
That's right.

394
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,541
[WOMAN ON PHONE]
An eyewitness called in,

395
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,583
but their voice was trembling
so badly I suspect

396
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,750
it might be another prank call.
I thought you'd want to know.

397
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,750
What'd they say?

398
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,583
[MADO]
Mm-hm. Thank you.

399

[AMON grunting]

[AMON] People who adhere
to a sense of justice.

402

Children who've had their
loved ones taken from them.

403
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,750
And those who have
fought to protect others.

404
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,041
Why do they have to
die before the world

405
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,500
can become a better place?

[MADO] Using a quinque would
be difficult in there.

But...

409
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,041
[MADO] ...factor in the
ghouls' keen sense of smell,

410
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,458
and the fact that the rabbit

411
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,625
was clearly connected
to number 745...

412
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,208
...and now, this.

413
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,000
There has to be a connection.

Your mask is done!
I wanted to deliver it!

00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,833
And since I made the trip,

431
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:56,000
would you mind putting it on so
I can make sure it fits you?

[UTA]
Yeah! How's it feel?

435
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,166
At first, I thought
I'd make a one-eyed mask

436
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,500
to compliment your
rare condition,

437

but the muse spoke to me,
and I'm so glad she did.

438
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,666
It was worth every bit
of the extra effort.

You're insane.
