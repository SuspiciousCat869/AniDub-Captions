1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,000
[TOUKA]
Go, on eat it!

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,708
[KANEKI muffled grunting]

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,750
[KANEKI retching]

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,708
[KANEKI] How could
you do that to me?

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,083
There's no way I could eat
someone's flesh!

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,666
You're not gonna turn me
into a cannibal! I'm human!

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,958
I'm not like you monsters!

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,625
[KANEKI groans]

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:43,708
[KANEKI grunting]

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,500
[TOUKA]
So. If I'm a monster,

11
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,833
then what the hell does
that make you?

12
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,041
Please, you have to help
me. I dunno what to do.

13
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,833
My whole world has been
turned upside down.

14
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,666
That day has ruined
my entire life!

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,208
Yeah, I bet it's rough.

16
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,875
I can't really say that
I pity you though.

17
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,500
You see, I've always wondered
why humans love cake.

18
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,666
It tastes so disgusting to me
that it makes me wanna puke.

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,750
But you guys sure
seem to enjoy eating it.

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,166
It must've been nice to
live such a peaceful life.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,166
One where you didn't live in
fear of the CCG or other ghouls.

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,916
[KANEKI sobbing]

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,833
[TOUKA] You think
your life sucks now?

24
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,875
Gimme a break! This
life is all I've ever known,

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,916
so how do you think
that makes me feel?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,541
Well, buddy? Answer me!

27
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,125
[KANEKI whimpers]

28
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,833
[KANEKI screams]

29
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:19,083
[stomach growling]

30
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,541
No! I'm telling
you, I'm a human!

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:32,250
[KANEKI grunting]

32
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,333
[TOUKA sniffing] Well you're
not a ghoul, I know that much.

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,333
But you're not human, either.

34
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,500
A half-breed like you

35
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,000
isn't gonna last five
seconds out here!

36
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,750
[KANEKI]
But I, I'm not..

37
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,541
If you wanna be
a human so badly,

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,791
then let's see how long
you last 'til you starve.

39
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,958
But I should warn you.

40
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,666
Starvation is utter
hell for a ghoul.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,291
[YOSHIMURA]
That's enough, Touka.

42
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,125
Leave the poor boy alone.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,416
[TOUKA]
But, sir!

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,291
This must be hard on you.
Please, come with me young man.

45
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,750
[TOUKA] Are you
gonna take him in?

46
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,333
Of course I am. Remember,
it's our policy

47
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,000
to help our fellow ghouls
in their time of need.

48
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,916
[YOSHIMURA]
Sorry that took a while.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,708
Here you go, son.

50
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
[YOSHIMURA] What's the matter?
You don't like coffee?

51
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,458
I do. It's just...

52
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,458
[YOSHIMURA] Kaneki, take a good
look at the cup in front of you.

53
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,291
Does it look strange?

54
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,583
[KANEKI]
No, sir. It looks delicious.

55
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,041
[YOSHIMURA] Then why
don't you give it a try?

56
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:59,000
[KANEKI gulping]

57
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,166
Oh wow! It is delicious!

58
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,875
[KANEKI] But every time
I try to eat something,

59
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,583
it tastes horrible.

60
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,166
[YOSHIMURA] Through the ages,
coffee is the only thing

61
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,875
that ghouls have been able
to enjoy the way humans do.

62
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,958
However. Drinking coffee is not
enough to satisfy our hunger.

63
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,583
Take this.

64
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,541
What is that?

65
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,958
[YOSHIMURA] When you need more,
don't hesitate to come back.

66
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,083
There's plenty where
that came from.

67
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,541
[KANEKI gulps]

68
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,500
[TOUKA] I don't get why you
decided to help that kid.

69
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,666
[YOSHIMURA] I know you're upset.
But do you remember the story

70
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,166
on the news about an
emergency organ transplant?

71
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,708
Some steel beams fell
and crushed two students

72
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,833
who were standing beneath them.
The doctor took it upon himself

73
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,541
to transplant the organs
from the deceased girl

74
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,583
into the surviving
young man's body.

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,333
[TOUKA] But the girl who
died in that accident...

76
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,791
It was Rize.

77
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,500
Wait, he was the guy?

78
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,208
[YOSHIMURA] Yes. He's had ghoul
organs transplanted into him,

79
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,041
and as a result, his life
has been forever changed.

80
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,500
[TOUKA]
You gotta be kidding me!

81
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,333
[YOSHIMURA] This is the first
time I've encountered

82
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,041
this situation. But I have
a feeling that his body

83
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,458
may be changing to
become more like ours.

84
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,583
[stomach growling]

85
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,666
[KANEKI whimpering]

86
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,541
[KANEKI]
Flesh.

87
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:31,083
Flesh...

88
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,458
[TOUKA] You're not a ghoul,
but you're not a human either.

89
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,750
A half-breed like you

90
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,875
isn't gonna last five
seconds out here!

91
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,916
[RIZE] Who cares if
you're a "half-breed"?

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,958
I don't see why
it really matters.

93
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,000
So you're not a human.

94
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,041
Well, you're not a ghoul either.

95
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,291
All that matters
is you're still you.

96
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,000
I say you make the most
of being a "half-breed".

97
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,958
There's delicious flesh out
there just waiting for you.

98
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,000
Watch.

99
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,583
You're gonna love
it. You'll see.

100
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,000
Once you start eating it,
you won't be able to stop.

101
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,666
Yes, it's so good.

102
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,041
It'll put any steak to shame.

103
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,833
[KANEKI screaming]

104
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,500
[KANEKI panting]

105
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,791
Go ahead and eat it.
You know you want to.

106
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,875
It's extra rare just for you.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:21,541

112
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,750
[KANEKI]
Hide.

113
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,083
[COLLEGE GIRL] Hey, have you
ever been to the bakery

114
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,625
that's in front of
the train station?

115
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,208
They have the yummiest
stuff in there!

116
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,541
[HIDE yelling]

117
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,791
[HIDE]
Dang it, Kaneki!

118
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,833
How long are you gonna
skip class, you jerk?

119
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,750
Do you know how hard
it's been for me?

120
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,125
If you don't come back soon
I'm gonna die of loneliness.

121
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,958
Whoa, easy! Sorry, man.

122
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,333
[HIDE] What's with
the eye patch?

123
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,166
Is that some new trend
I'm not hip to? Anyway...

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,291
[KANEKI]
You know, it's funny.

125
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:19,833
All these years, and Hide
hasn't changed one bit.

126
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,500
[YOUNG KANEKI sobbing]

127
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:29,416
[YOUNG HIDE yelling]

128
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
[YOUNG HIDE]
Dang it!

129
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,166
How long were you gonna
stay home, you jerk?

130
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you know how hard
it's been for me?

131
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,500
Hey, are you even listening
to me? Earth to Kaneki!

132
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,208
Oh, uh. I'm Sorry.
What'd you say?

133
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,708
[HIDE groans]

134
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,750
[HIDE] I've gotta go pick up
some materials from Nishio.

135
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,708
He's an upperclassman.
Kinda snarky but he's okay.

136
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,833
You wanna come with me?

137
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,458
[KANEKI]
Yeah, Sure.

138
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:53,041
[HIDE] Hey Kaneki. I don't mean
to pry but are you eatin' right?

139
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,166
You're lookin' a little pale.

140
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,041
You're gonna have to eat better
if you wanna stay healthy.

141
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,333
Uh. Right. Okay.

142
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,500
[KANEKI] You can't get
anything past, Hide.

143
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,208
I should've known that he'd be
able to see right through me.

144
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,041
He's hypersensitive.

145
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,458
It's like he knows what
I'm feeling before I do.

146
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,041
But he pretends that
everything's cool. For my sake.

147
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,833
What upsets me the
most about all this,

148
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,750
is if I were to
stop being human,

149
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,916
I couldn't hang out
with him anymore.

150
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,750
[HIDE]
Thanks for coming along.

151
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,458
I think you're really
gonna like him.

152
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,458
[KIMI giggling]

153
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,291
[KANEKI]
Who? Nishio?

154
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,208
[HIDE]
Yeah, who else?

155
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,500
Like I said, he can be
snarky but he's cool.

156
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:38,750
He's got this dark, mysterious
vibe. It's hard to explain.

157
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,666
This is it. Hey, Nishio!

158
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,041
[KANEKI] Geez, you
could've knocked first!

barge into places

162
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,791
without any warning, Nagachika?

163
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,041
[HIDE] Sorry about that,
I wasn't thinkin'.

164
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,375
Yeah, no kiddin'. Y'know,
nothing pisses me off more

165
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,041
than people disrespecting
my territory.

166

So, anyway.

167

This is my friend Kaneki I was
telling you about before.

Hm...

00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,708
[NISHIKI] Nishiki Nishio.
I'm a second year

171
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,791
with the School of Pharmacy.
It's nice to meet you,

Kaneki.

173
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,041
[NISHIKI] You wanted last
year's numbers, right?

174
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,875
[HIDE] Yeah, but I'm only
interested in the retail data.

175
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,000
[NISHIKI] Wish I could
remember where I put it.

176
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,166
Oh, wait. It's prob'ly at home.

177
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,291
Aww, seriously?

178
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,083
I don't live too
far. If you want,

179
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,583
we can walk over
there right now.

180
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,333
Walk over where?
To your house?

181
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,666
That okay?

182
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,208
[HIDE sighing] I need that
data. I'm sorry, buddy.

00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,166
I hate to ditch ya
but it looks like

184
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,083
we'll just have to hang
out some other time.

185
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,333
Okay.

[NISHIKI]
Yeah sure, that's fine.

191
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,875
It's not like I'm gonna
let him in or anything.

[HIDE] Totally understandable.
[phone ringing]

193
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,458
[NISHIKI] But I gotta work
this out before we go.

[HIDE] Why're you actin'
weird? What's up?

195
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,958
[KANEKI] Nothing, I'm fine.
[HIDE] You sure about that?

196
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,416
[NISHIKI] What'd you see?
[HIDE] Who, me?

197
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,458
[NISHIKI]
Yeah, you.

198
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,041
How much of her did
you see earlier?

199
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
[KANEKI] Why are
all of these ghouls

200
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,125
suddenly popping up around me?

201
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,958
[HIDE] They were very pretty.
[KANEKI] No, it's not them.

202
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,833
[KANEKI] They've always been
here, I've just never noticed.

203
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,541
'Cause I wasn't a
part of their world.

204
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,375
[NISHIKI] You want one?
[HIDE] Yeah, sure!

Here ya go.

208

Awesome! Thanks again.

211
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,583
[NISHIKI] So, are you
in any clubs, Kaneki?

212
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,000
Uh, no. I'd like to join one

213
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,000
but I don't do so great
with large groups.

214
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,375
Oh, yeah?

215

You're the exact opposite of
your buddy, Nagachika.

[KANEKI] No way. He can't
eat that, he's a ghoul!

and crispy!

eat yours, Kaneki?

222
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,666
[KANEKI]
I will. Later.

223

[KANEKI]
It's crazy.

224
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,666
He has no problem blending
in 'cause he acts just like

225
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,291
any other college student.
It's kind of impressive.

226
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,583
I'm sure nobody even
suspects that he's a ghoul.

of muscle on your body.

just ruined your meal.

So tell me, just when
were you going to eat him?

Don't you think you've
waited long enough, Kaneki?

Which part of him do
you wanna eat first?

Humans aren't your "friends",
they're nothing but food to eat.

It's no different than the way
they'd think of a cow or pig.

277
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,708
It's rude to play
with your food.

278
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,833
You should probably just
go ahead and eat him.

279
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,708
Quit pretending
you're his friend.

Dontcha think that hangin'
out with Nagachika is risky?

283
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,708
He's pretty smart. Having
somebody who's as perceptive

284
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,416
as he is by your side is bound
to get you into trouble.

I could release my kagune

and put you out of your misery,
but where's the fun in that?

[KANEKI] I can't beat him.
I'm not strong enough.

Well, you should be.

Are you ready to hear
him scream in agony?

Aw. He's unconscious?

302

happier to hear those words.

Is that wrong?

309
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,875
[YOUNG HIDE] Nah, you're fine.
Lemme shoot straight with ya.

310
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,708
I just moved here and I haven't
made any pals yet, so...

311
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,250
I was wondering if
you'd be my friend.

312
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,708
Yeah. Sure thing!

313
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,625
Wow, really? I'm
Hideyoshi Nagachka,

314
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,000
but that's a mouthful,
you can call me Hide.

315
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,125
Okay. My name's Kaneki.

316
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,208
[KANEKI]
He changed my life.

317
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,375
I was always the outcast.

318
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,958
Until Hide came along
and reached out to me.

319
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,708
I have to do something.

320
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,625
I don't want my best friend

321
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,750
[KANEKI screaming]
to die!

322
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,041
No. I won't let that happen!

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,375
[NISHIKI grunts]

324
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,000
[NISHIKI chuckles]

325
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,250
[KANEKI grunting]

326
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,666
Nice try!

327
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,041
[KANEKI grunting]

328
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,041
[NISHIKI groaning]

329
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,083
[NISHIKI] Stop, you dumbass!
Keep this up and you'll kill me!

330
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,000
[NISHIKI groaning]

331
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,666
That's Rize's kagune.
But how can that be?

332
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,666
[dripping]

333
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,125
[KANEKI]
Hide.

334
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,625
[RIZE]
He sure looks delicious.

335
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,708
[KANEKI gulps]

336
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,500
What a savory aroma.
It's making me hungry.

337
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,750
So what do you think, Kaneki?
Doesn't he look tasty?

338
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,916
No way! I can't eat
him. He's my friend!

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,541
Forget about that for a sec.
And take a closer look.

340
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,083
Well? Can you see it now?

341
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
Yeah. I can.

342
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,583
[KANKEI panting]
He does look tasty!

343
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,625
[KANEKI cackling]

344
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,291
No! What the hell am I doing?

345
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,375
[RIZE]
Aw, you poor thing.

346
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,041
You want to eat him so
badly you can't stand it!

347
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,875
Don't beat yourself up.

348
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,333
I mean, it's not like you're
doing anything wrong.

349
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,625
[KANEKI whimpering]

350
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,416
[RIZE]
What're you waiting for?

351
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
Quit fighting yourself and
give in to your instincts.

352
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,000
[KANEKI]
What instincts?

353
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,625
The primal ones.
He's all yours, Kaneki.

354
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,416
He's all mine?

355
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,083
[RIZE]
Go on.

356
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,333
[KANEKI panting, cackling]

357
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,166
You're right!

358
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,708
Maybe I should follow
my instincts for once.

359
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,250
He's like a special
treat just for me!

360
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,208
'Cause Hide is my...

361
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,666
[RIZE]
He's your friend!

362
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,708
Yeah!

363
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,916
Hide's been my friend for years.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So I should be the one
who gets to eat him!

365
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,000
[TOUKA] It looks like you're
becoming more like us,

366
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,333
half-breed.

367
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,333
You're so hungry you've
lost your sense of reason.

368
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,916
Move it!

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,125
I don't give a crap
about your friend,

370
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,625
go ahead and kill
him if you want.

371
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,166
[TOUKA]
But I'm warning you.

372
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,541
You're gonna be sorry
if you gobble him up.

373
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,791
You'll be left with nothing

374
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,208
but a sea of blood,
entrails, and regret.

375
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,166
Do you think you could
live with that guilt?

376
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,083
Knowing that you killed
your best friend?

377
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,458
[KANEKI growling]

378
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,000
I didn't want it
to come to this.

379
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,541
I'll try to go easy
on you, Kaneki.

380
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,958
But I can't promise anything!

381
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,750
[KANEKI panting]

382
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,291
[KANEKI gasps]

383
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,000
[YOSHIMURA] Touka found you
and brought you back here.

384
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,583
[KANEKI]
Where's my friend?

385
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,541
[YOSHIMURA]
Please follow me.

386
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,458
[KANEKI]
Hide!

387
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,291
[HIDE grunts]

388
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,250
[KANEKI]
This hunger.

389
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,541
It seems to be getting
worse and worse by the day.

390
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,583
I couldn't control it. And
I completely lost myself.

391
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,250
I was so hungry that I
thought I was going to die.

392
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,666
So I went after Hide.

393
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,375
Now that agonizing
hunger's gone.

394
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,625
But there was blood in my mouth.

395
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,875
I want to know where
it came from.

396
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,416
What did you do to me
while I was sleeping?

397
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,750
[YOSHIMURA]
As you know,

398
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,458
there's only one way to
satisfy a ghoul's hunger.

399
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,041
I'm afraid that we
had no choice.

400
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:59,833
If we hadn't stepped in, you
would've devoured your friend.

401
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,666
[KANEKI sobbing]

402
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,750
[YOSHIMURA] Don't be ashamed,
you're one of us now.

403
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,250
[KANEKI]
I know that.

404
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,000
And as a result, I'm gonna
lose my best friend.

405
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,500
Because...

406
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,583
...I care too much about
Hide to put him at risk.

407
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,666
What now? It's
not like I can just

408
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,625
join the ghoul world. You
guys don't want me around

409
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,791
'cause I'm a half-breed.

410
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,791
I'm alone.

411
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:29,416
I'm not a human or a ghoul.
There's no place for me!

412
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,666
[YOSHIMURA] I can assure
you that's not true.

413
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,916
Don't you see, you are both
a human and a ghoul, Kaneki.

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Therefore, you are
the one and only person

415
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,666
who has a place in both worlds.

416
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,000
I promise you,
you're not alone.

417
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,958
Why don't you join
us at Anteiku?

418
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,708
I'm sure we can help
you find your way.

419
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,125
It'd be good for you.

420
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,708
It'll give you the opportunity
to better understand us.

421
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,583
Then you can judge for yourself

422
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,833
whether or not we're
just ravenous beasts.

423
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,375
Well, how about it?
I'll start off by teaching you

424
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,708
how to make one of our
delicious cups of coffee.

425
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,958
Yeah. Sounds good. I've
never made coffee before.

426
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,958
[MADO]
Isn't the rain lovely?

427
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,625
You know, precipitation
dulls their senses.

428
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,958
Which makes this the perfect
weather to work in.

429
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,625
[AMON] According to the
20th Ward Branch's report,

430
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,458
there was a predatory
incident involving

431
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,250
a binge eater in this
building three months ago.

432
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,333
What's interesting is
eyewitnesses claim

433
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,583
to have seen Jason
in the area as well.

434
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,791
A binge eater and Jason?

435
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,958
[AMON]
2 S-rated subjects interacting?

436
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,833
Well, it's hard to say. But
I think it's safe to assume

437
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,208
that they weren't
cordially sharing a meal.

438
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,250
[MADO gasps]

439
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,958
[AMON]
Everything alright?

440
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,541
[AMON]
Mr. Mado!

441
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,166
[MADO]
What'd I tell you?!

442
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,666
I knew the weather would
work in our favor.

443
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,291
As far as I'm concerned,

444
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,750
there's only one drawback
to this downpour.

445
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,583
It's a shame we're
not able to hear

446
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,291
the scumbag's throes of death.

447
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,291
[MADO cackling]

448
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,000
Tastes like I'm eatin'
a pile of horse crap.

449
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,541
[KANEKI]
May I ask how you know

450
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,375
what horse manure
tastes like, Nishio?

451
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,958
What are you, an idiot? I've
never actually eaten crap!

452
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,583
It's just a figure of speech!

453
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:49,791
[KANEKI]
Oh, Yeah?

454
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,333
[KANEKI cackling]

455
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,750
[KANEKI whispering]
[HIDE] What?

456
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,166
Nishio has eaten horse dung?

457
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,291
And cow patties, too!

458
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,916
And every other kind of feces!

459
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,041
Whoa, for real?

460
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,625
[NISHIKI]
Damn you, Kaneki!

461
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,916
So, how's that poop
taste, buddy?

462
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,666
Oh, Nishiki, you smell like poo!
