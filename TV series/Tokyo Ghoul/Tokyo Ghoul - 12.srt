00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,291
But how?

9
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,500
[RIZE]
Long time, no see, Kaneki.

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,166
Wow, you look awful. Been
through the ringer, huh?

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,458
Sucks to be you.

[YAMORI laughing]
[KANEKI screaming]

17
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,958
[YAMORI] How far did
you manage to count?

18
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,791
[KANEKI gasping]
To 500...

19
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,333
...59!

20
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,958
[YAMORI]
I've got a bucket here.

21
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,125
I want you to fill
it to the brim.

22
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,750
[KANEKI screaming]

23
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,916
[KANEKI] Since the first cut,
Yamori told me to count

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,875
backwards from 1,000, out-loud,
in increments of seven.

25
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,291
I didn't understand
why, at first.

26
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,208
Then I realized he was
trying to keep me sane.

27
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,625
so I'd be aware of every
single cut that followed.

28
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,541
I was clinging to every number.

29

[KANEKI gasps]

30
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,208
[KANEKI] Meanwhile, he
took my fingers and toes.

31
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:19,916
over and over, and over, and
over, and over, and over...

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,750
Every time my fingers and toes
grew back, it was a reminder.

33
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,541
I'm not human anymore.
I'm a monster.

34
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,916
[RIZE yawns]

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,583
Good Morning.

36
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,458
[KANEKI]
Rize, are you still alive?

37
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,791
[RIZE] That depends on
your definition of 'living',

38
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,125
I suppose. New topic!

39
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,125
Tell me about your mom. What
kind of person was she?

40
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,416
Earlier, you thought
I was her, right?

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,291
She's over there.

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,333
[KANEKI gasping]

43
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,625
[KANEKI]
Are you still alive?

44
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,541
[KANEKI gasps]

45
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,833
[YOUNG KANEKI]
Hey, Mom, I'm home!

46
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,875
[KANEKI'S MOTHER]
Welcome home, sweetie!

47
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,708
[RIZE]
I barely recognize you.

48
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,666
[YOUNG KANEKI]
I found another one!

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,333
[RIZE]
You were so full of energy.

50
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,333
What's that you're doing?

51
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,208
[KANEKI] When I had
trouble with reading.

52
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,791
She'd carefully write
out the pronunciations.

53
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:38,375
We'd drill over them until
I could do it on my own.

54
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,500
Is she leaving you all alone?

55
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,000
[lock clicks]

56
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,875
[KANEKI]
She had to go to work.

57
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,166
[RIZE]
Now where are we?

58
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,833
[KANEKI]
My Dad's Study, at home.

59
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,000
[RIZE]
Tell me about him.

60
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,041
[KANEKI]
I never got to know him.

61
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,166
When he passed away, I
was still just an infant.

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,416
These books...

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,958
They were the only real
connection I had to him.

64
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,958
I fell in love
with reading here.

65
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,041
[RIZE] Weren't you
lonely, all by yourself?

66
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,333
[KANEKI] I had a
kind, caring mother.

67
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:23,166
And all the books I
could ever ask for.

68
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,916
My mom really was 
a wonderful person.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,583
She worked so hard, but
our home was always tidy.

70
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:34,083
She was a joy to be around.
She got along with everyone.

71
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
And she never, ever
lost her temper.

72
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,375
I loved her dearly. I'm
very proud to be her son.

73
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,625
[KANEKI'S MOTHER] Ken, It's
okay to feel sadness from loss.

74
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,291
As long as you remember to stay
kind, you'll find joy again.

That's what my mom
always told me.

80
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,125
[RIZE] Yeah, she was a
wonderful person, alright.

81
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,583
She's the reason you're
living this hell now.

You're really somethin' else.

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,666
So, have you figured out
the reason you're here?

85
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,500
Why you're special?

86
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,791
It's your regenerative ability.

87
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,958
That kind of power
doesn't come standard

With that one eye, and
the stank of the glutton.

You're a goddamn collector's
item, and you're all mine.

Chinese Red-headed Centipede.

Nasty little shit.

96
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,333
I'm gonna let him run around in
your ear for a little while.

You don't mind, do you?

[KANEKI]
No, please. I'm begging you!

You want me to cut out your
heart and eat it, don't you?

You bought in to that
masochistic crap?

118
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,125
[KANEKI] Of course I did.
It's how Mom raised me.

119
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,708
Is that bad?

120
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,166
[RIZE] You chose to blindly obey

Yeah, that is bad.

Are you sure she
was all that great?

Because, from where I'm
standing, it seems her lessons

haven't brought you
anything but misery.

[RIZE]
What's that, there?

00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,125
[KANEKI]
An allowance.

[RIZE]
For whom?

128

[KANEKI]
My aunt. Mom's sister.

129
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,541
She always claimed to
be struggling financially.

130
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,166
Mom felt bad for her,
so she'd give her money.

131
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,750
She had a part-time
job during the day.

132
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:35,916
She collected garbage at night.
Mom never stopped working.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,333
Even her free time was
devoted to work.

You're exhausted.
Take care of yourself.

I'm fine, Ken.

Then what happened?

[KANEKI sighs]
What do you think?

138
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,083
[KANEKI] She worked herself
to death. I lost her.

139
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,541
Suddenly, I was all alone.

140
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,041

[KANEKI] Then again,
I wasn't completely alone.

144
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,666
One person was always
there for me.

145
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,750
[HIDE]
Okay, serious question,

146
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,541
if you were a ghoul would you
eat that hottie from Class 2?

[KANEKI]
Who, Yoshikawa?

I don't stare at her
that much, do I?

[KANEKI] Hide wasn't just
my friend, he was all I had.

he means so much to you.

things are going,

up losing him, too.

00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,291
[YAMORI] "All the drawbacks
and detriment in this world

159
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,458
stem from a lack
of individual ability."

160
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,416
The person who told me that
was a real sack of crap.

161
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,375
but, that doesn't make
his words any less true.

162
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,958
It's an important lesson
to learn. You'll see.

163
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,750
Now, I've been thinkin',

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:17,208
and I realized, I've been going
about this the wrong way.

165
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,958
Ripping off your digits
has been fun and all,

166
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,666
but what I really want to
rip apart is your mind.

167
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,083
So I devised a little game
that should do the trick.

168
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,250
Oh...

169
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,833
...yeah!

170
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,916
A couple of love birds.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,666
Let's play!

172
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,708
[muffled grunting, screaming]

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,916
You're gonna pick
which one I kill,

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,583
him or her!

175
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,333
[YAMORI] What's the matter?
You don't owe them anything.

176
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,625
Just choose.

177
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,833
Say. You weren't
holding out hope

178
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,000
that they'd get you outta
here, were you, kid?

179
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,583
These weaklings? They're your
knights in shining armor?

180
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,208
[knuckle cracks]

181
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,875
Well? Pick one.

182
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,083
Choose.

183
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:05,291
Keep me waiting and
I'll kill both of them.

184
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,291
Let me rephrase it for ya.

185
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,791
[knuckle cracks]

186
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,458
Which one of them
do you want to save?

[KANEKI whimpering]

[muffled grunting]

189
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,291
No, I can't. I can't
do it. Please.

190
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,875
Why do I have to be
the one to choose?

191
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,791
Hurry. Time's a wastin'.

192
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,333
No! If I choose,

193
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,125
I might as well be
killing them myself!

194
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,708
Just pick one! C'mon!

195
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,125
Choose!

196
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,500
Brat! It's easy!

197
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,500
The guy? The girl?

198
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,625
Right! Left!

199
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,583
Pick one!

200
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,833
Didn't you hear me? There's
no way I'm doing that!

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,083
You'll have to kill me first!

202
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,291
Fine. Have it your way.

203
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,041
[YAMORI] I'll show
you how it's done.

204
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,333
[YAMORI]
See? It's easy!

205
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,375
Do you like my pick?
Well? Speak up!

206
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,291
You can still save
her if you want to!

207
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,500
C'mon! She's dying,
here, Kaneki!

208
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,375
Choose!

209
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,250
Look at them! The guy?

210
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,750
Or the girl?

211
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,166
[KANEKI gasping]
[YAMORI] Well?

212
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,208

This is your last chance!

213
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,625
Do it!

00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,416

Kaneki, I'm begging you!

219
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,125
No! Please!

[SHU screaming, sobbing]

222
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,458
[YAMORI]
Too late. She broke.

223
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,000
[KANEKI whimpering, gasping]

224
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:06,500
[SHU growling]

225
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,500
Now, they'll both rot in hell.

226
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,583
[SHU groans]

227
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,250
[KANEKI]
But, It's not my fault.

228
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,041
No. It is.

229
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,041
I'm the one to blame.

230
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,750
[RIZE] It took a lot of blood
for you to learn that lesson.

231
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,583
[RIZE]
Do me a favor, 'kay?

232
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,166
Don't just sit there
wallowing in your own guilt.

233
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,625
That's not going to
change anything either.

234
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,916
You've got a problem
with that, you know.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,541
You're complacent.
You never change or adapt.

236
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,416
That's why you're at fault.

237
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,500
Did you think you could
blame it on something else?

238
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,833
Coincidence? Tragedy? Fate?

239
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,583
Sorry, but destiny doesn't
exist in this world.

240
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,083
It's all just one
person's circumstances

241
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,541
colliding with another's.

242
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,083
And, who creates
those circumstances?

243
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
Would you care to guess?

244
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,416
It's you, Kaneki.

245
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,166
"All the detriment
in this world

246
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,208
stems from a lack of
individual ability."

247
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,666
Jason sure nailed that one.

248
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,916
If you were smart to
the ways of the world.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,875
You and I may never have
come together like this.

250
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,375
Aw, you were
such easy prey.

251
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,125
You practically begged
me to devour you.

252
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
Then the doctor had his way.

253
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,333
And we were turned
into a Grade-A freak.

254
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:40,291
All because you
were such a fool.

255
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,666
But you're supposed to take

256
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,833
the moral high road
and suffer, right?

257
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,375
Do you think the loves
birds would agree?

258
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,416
You had everything you needed
to kill the son of a bitch.

259
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
and all you did was watch him.

260
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,666
Or, you could have
picked one of them,

261
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,791
and the other would
still be alive.

262
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,708
But you failed them both.

263
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,041
Just like you failed
her that day.

264
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,458
[KANEKI]
Ryoko...

265
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,541
No.

266
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,000
[KANEKI grunting, screaming]
No! Stop it!

267
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,583
[RIZE] And she won't
be the last one.

268
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,958
[KANEKI]
Touka...

269
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,875
Hinami...

270
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,666
[RIZE]
You'll lose everything again.

271
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,958
[KANEKI]
I'm here, Hide!

272
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,875
[HIDE]
You're a monster.

273
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,000
No, I'm not...

274
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,875
I swear.

275
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,083
Why didn't you tell
me about any of this?

276
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,666
You had a choice to
make, and you failed.

277
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,708
That's why this--

278
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,666
[HIDE]
...is-is happening.

279
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,250
[KANEKI screaming]

280
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,541
[RIZE]
You see?

281
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,750
You have no right to play
the victim, Kaneki.

282
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,916
This is the life and
the future you chose.

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,208
Why are you crying?
This is your doing.

284
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,166
You said you'd rather
feel pain yourself,

285
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,416
than inflict it on others.

286
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You choose to be neutral.

287
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,500
But, you know what happens
when you play both sides?

288
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,375
In the end, everybody loses.

289
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,875
You saw what happened
with your mother.

290
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,208
If she'd had the guts to tell
her lazy sister to get a job,

291
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,541
she wouldn't have worked
herself into an early grave.

292
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,750
[KANEKI]
Shut up.

293
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,875
[RIZE] Not much of
a mother, was she?

294
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,458
If she loved you, she would've
abandoned her sister

295
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,125
and focused on raising her son.

296
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,541
[KANEKI]
Please stop it.

297
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,916
Be honest with me.

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,958
You wanted her to choose
you over your aunt.

299
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,291
[KANEKI]
It's not true.

300
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:50,958
[KANEKI sobbing]

301
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,416
[KANEKI]
Mom...

302
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,291
Oh, Mom.

303
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,375
I wish...

304
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,250
I wish that you were
still here with me.

305
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,000
I hate being all alone.

306
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,916
I miss you so much it hurts.

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,333
Why?

308
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,916
Why couldn't you
just live for me?

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,833
You had a choice!

310
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,166
Why didn't you choose me?!

311
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,125
Even if it meant
forsaking your aunt?

312
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,583
Yes, if she'd be here now!

313
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,250
Even if it meant hurting her?

314
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,791
[KANEKI]
If it had to be done.

315
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,416
[RIZE] Even if it
meant killing her?

316
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,750
[KANEKI]
Whatever it takes!

317
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,583
Good boy!

318
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,250
[RIZE]
Now you've got it, Kaneki.

319
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,833
You've learned the lesson your
mother couldn't seem to grasp.

320
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,291
That, sometimes,
to protect one thing,

321
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,791
you have to have the resolve
to let go of another.

322
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,500
Her actions didn't make her
kind, they made her weak.

323
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,916
She didn't have the
resolve, the strength

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,291
to turn her back and
focus on what's important.

325
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,583
[RIZE] But you're not
weak like she was.

326
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,916
You have the power to
break this chain of grief.

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,083
Or will you die at
the hands of Yamori?

328
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,208
[KANEKI]
No. No, I won't!

329
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,083
[RIZE] If Aogiri continues
to get stronger, it's only

330
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,833
a matter of time before they
attempt to seize the 20th Ward.

331
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:21,125
[KANEKI]
I won't let that happen.

332
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,875
[RIZE] Good, otherwise your dear
friend, Hide and your pals

333
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,500
at Anteiku might have
to endure the same hell

334
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,958
you've just been through.

335
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,500
[KANEKI] Anyone who tries
to take them from me

336
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
will get no mercy.

337
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,041
[RIZE] Are you sure you have
the strength to back that up?

338
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,250
[KANEKI]
Yes.

339
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,958
Does this mean you'll finally
stop holding me back?

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,333
'Course not. That'd be foolish.

341
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,083
[chains clattering]

342
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,291
[KANEKI] I'm never going
to let you have control.

343
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,791
And what if your decision
ends up being the wrong one,

344
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,916
in the end?

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,625
[KANEKI]
That won't happen,

346
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,500
because I'm not wrong.

347
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,500
[KANEKI]
What's wrong...

348
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,958
...is this messed up world!

349
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:28,416
[RIZE] That will do,
Kaneki. At least, for now.

350
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,125
To live is to devour others.

351
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,333
That's part of who you are now.

352
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,458
[KANEKI swallows]

353
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
[RIZE]
Go eat.

354
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,166
[KANEKI]
I am a ghoul.

355
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,958
[YAMORI]
Bad news, kid.

356
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:59,791
It's been fun but I'm afraid our
play time has to come to an end.

357
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,000
Apparently, the doves are
about to swoop down on us.

358
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,375
It's my job to go out
and clip their wings

359
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,500
with extreme prejudice.

360
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,125
[YAMORI]
Aogiri won't hesitate

361
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,666
to slaughter anyone
who gets in our way.

362
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,791
Obviously, that's mostly humans,
but ghouls aren't exempt either.

363
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,583
That includes your adopted
family of coffee drinkers.

364
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,458
What do they call that
café of theirs again?

365
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,875
Anteiku, right?

366
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,333
Yeah, that's the one.

367
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,875
Aogiri's got their
eye on them.

368
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,375
They're targeted
for elimination.

369
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,916
[YAMORI]
Kaneki!

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,083
Let me take from you!

371
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,458
Let me devour you!

372
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,750
Every last bite!

373
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,416
[YAMORI gasping]
[RIZE laughing]

374
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,208
We meet again.

375
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,958
[RIZE] Poor, Yamori.
All that brawn and no brain.

376
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,916
[YAMORI laughing]

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
[YAMORI] I knew there was
something special about you!

378
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,208
[knuckle cracks]

379
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,666
[YAMORI yelling]

380
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,833
[YAMORI]
I'll swallow you whole!

381
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,541
[YAMORI grunting, gagging]

382
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,250
Why don't you chew on this?

383
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,875
[YAMORI growling]

384
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,083
[YAMORI panting]

385
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,500
You taste foul.

386
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,833
[YAMORI growls]

387
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,041
What'd you do? You bit me!

388
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,083
[KANEKI] Yeah, and your
flesh is disgusting;

389
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,291
it tastes just like rotten meat.

390
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,875
[YAMORI]
I've got you now!

391
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,416
[YAMORI grunts]

392
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,833
After everything you've done,

393
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,083
you think that would hurt me?

394
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,916
[YAMORI] I'll kill
you. I swear it.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,416
I'll kill you! Kill you!

396
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,875
Kill you dead!

397
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,208
You're dinner!

398
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,875
I'll rip you to pieces!

399
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,500

your head off!

Not too bad...
