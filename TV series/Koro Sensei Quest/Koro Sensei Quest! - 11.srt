2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,291
[HERO] I am the Prince of
the Fateful Eternal Wind.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,000
My journey is endless.

4
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,083
[IRON KUNUDON B]
Anyone have a clue

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,583
what this guy's babbling about?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,125
[IRON KUNUDON C] I don't know,
but he sounds confident!

7
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,958
[VILLAGER A]
We are in your debt, good sir!

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,500
Such bravery will be
spoken of for ages!

9
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,958
Nay. You are too kind.

10
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,500
Now, then.

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,625
Methinks there are no
monsters left to slay

12
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,750
in these lonesome hills.

13
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,416
Where shall I venture next?

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
[NAGISA]
Our tale begins a year ago,

15
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,958
when Koro-sensei,
the Demon King,

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,791
also known as the Big Bad,

17
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,416
was still human.

18
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,458
[YANAGISAWA]
Look sharp: We've got customers.

19
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,000
No sleeping on the
clock, troglodytes.

20
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,083
Morning, welcome to
the Temple of Trades.

21
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,583
Dissatisfied with your job?

22
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,958
Let us relocate you to one
more suited to your skillset!

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,333
So what brings you
in to see us today?

24
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,958
I, uh, believe I've
gone as far as I can

25
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,125
in my current line of work.

26
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,791
Oh. And what line of
work might that be, sir?

27
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,166
There are many who would
refer to me as a hero.

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,875
Oh my goodness, I bet the hours
are absolutely dreadful.

29
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,541
Well now, I do endeavor
to give the quest my all.

30
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,833
'Tis the duty of
one so intrepid.

31
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,875
Sure, sure. 'Cept you're
not making much progress?

32
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,916
A shame after coming
as far as you have.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,125
That must be
super-duper frustrating.

34
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,666
But I think I have
just the thing!

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,625
Really?

36
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,791
You're gonna love it!

37
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,875
A vacancy just opened
up the other day.

38
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,541
Yes, go on.

39
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,000
[AGURI] How do you feel
about being the Demon King?

40
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,208
[HERO]
You said this lair's called

41
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,041
the Castle of Darkness, correct?

42
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,208
I must confess, the ambiance
in here is wonderfully gloomy!

43
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,083
And I appreciate
your generous offer

44
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,916
to waive the security deposit.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,125
You really didn't have
to do that, you know.

46
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,333
He'd hit a wall professionally

47
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,625
and decided it was
high time to move on.

48
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,041
I can relate.

49
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,708
I suppose any job gets
tiresome after a while.

50
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,250
Oh. And there he is now.

51
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:11,375
Welcome. I am the gentleman
you'll be replacing.

52
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,916
[HERO] I can't thank you enough
for coming all this way.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,208
[NEURO]
My pleasure.

54
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,000
In a position like this,
the handoff is vital.

55
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,541
So... from Hero to Demon King
seems a rather long way to fall.

56
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,791
Forgive my asking,

57
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,958
but is the world really
so dreadful as all that?

58
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,666
My public will be
surprised, won't they?

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
[chuckles]

60
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,416
You will do beautifully.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,791
This gig is no walk in the park,
but you seem ferocious enough.

62
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,083
You're too kind, sir. I hope
that I can do it justice.

63
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,500
What's next for you?

64
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,833
What indeed...

65
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,708
Alas, this place holds no
mystery for me anymore.

66
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,666
Charming though it once was.

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,541
I could journey to a new world,

68
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,833
or perhaps try my hand
at being a warlock.

69
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,291
Sounds exhilarating.

70
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,375
You'll have to regale me
with stories one day.

71
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,083
Yes, well, very best of
luck to you, my friend.

72
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,583
[HERO]
And to you.

73
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,791
[AGURI]
The Demon King's wardrobe!

74
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,875
You'll look fantastic
in this stuff!

75
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,750
Gracious, how thoughtful
of him to have left it.

76
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,833
[gasps]

77
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,916
[AGURI]
Uh-oh. Is something wrong?

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,416
[HERO screams]

79
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,083
[KORO-SENSEI] Uh! I think
the position is cursed!

80
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,916
You... look...

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Gah! Avert your eyes!

82
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,916
I cannot bear to
be seen like this!

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,916
[AGURI]
...splendid!

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh?

85
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,375
[NEURO]
Koro-Q.

86
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,375
[YAKO]
Hey!

87
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,791
Ha! I seek the Demon King!

88
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mew?

89
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,958
[NEWBIE HERO] So it's true!
You've turned to evil!

90
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Huh?

91
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,875
Excuse me, young man, but, um,

92
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,583
do we know each other
from somewhere?

93
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm your pupil! Don't tell
me you've forgotten!

94
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,291
Whatever all this is,
I demand an explanation!

95
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
What can I say?

96
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,291
Being a hero simply
lost its luster for me.

97
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,375
Of course, it turns out 80%
of what a Demon King does

98
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,708
is sit and brood.

99
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,541
You couldn't have picked
a better time to show up.

100
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,083
Newsflash: I'm not here
to alleviate your boredom.

101
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,541
I'm here to vanquish you!

102
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Aw. That's not
a very nice thing to say.

103
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you have any idea how many
new monsters started showing up

104
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
the minute you turned your
back on the hero game?

105
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,208
I can't remember the last
time I got good sleep!

106
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,375
I've been so busy slaying,

107
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,041
my level is through
the friggin' roof!

108
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah! Congratulations, m'boy!

109
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,375
I knew you had it in you!

110
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,333
Are you patronizing me?

111
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,583
Take a deep breath.

112
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,416
You're going to give
yourself an aneurism.

113
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,333
[NEWBIE HERO] Why do you
encourage him to do this?

114
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,916
You can change jobs, too.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,458
Why stick with something that
makes you so miserable, right?

116
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,666
'Sides, no offense,

117
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,625
but you just don't seem
like the hero type.

118
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,166
Not what I needed
to hear, thanks.

119
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,041
But, yeah.
I suppose you're right.

120
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,583
It's the same thing
every day, y'know?

121
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,916
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,500
I mean, c'mon, is that
what it is to be a hero?

123
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,291
'Cause it feels like torture.

124
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,625
[AGURI] It doesn't sound like
there's much room for growth.

125
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Bingo.

126
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,208
So what else is
out there for me?

127
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,791
Let's have a look, shall we?

128
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,833
Ooo! This one sounds fun!

129
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,041
[KORO-SENSEI, NEWBIE HERO]
What is it?

130
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,125
The Reaper! Perfect!

131
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,333
[AGURI]
Koro-Q!

132
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,291
[SHIRO]
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

133
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,791
We're thrilled to be here!

134
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,208
[SHIRO]
My name is Shiro.

135
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,708
I'm Yanagisawa.

136
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,916
[BOTH] And together:
We're One and the Same!

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,541
Thank you, you're
a marvelous crowd.

138
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,791
[SHIRO]
Anyone who can tell us apart

139
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,375
receives complimentary
passes to our next show.

140
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,458
That reminds me, Shiro.

141
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,916
[SHIRO]
Yes, Yanagisawa?

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,166
That "Shield of Earth" Barrier

143
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,375
really did a number
on you the other day.

144
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,583
[SHIRO]
Oh, that.

145
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,750
Just the government
playing with its toys.

146
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,916
More like molecular
gastronomy. Hey!

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,291
[SHIRO]
Comedy gold.

148
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,541
Parum-pum-pum.
You've been great.

149
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,791
[SHIRO, YANIGASAWA]
Koro-Q.

150
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,541
[AGURI]
Hello? Mr. Demon King?

151
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,750
How are things going?

152
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,958
Thought I'd stop by
for a follow-up. Huh?

153
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,125
Is this a bad time?

154
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Power corrupts.

155
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,666
Absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

156
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,041
[AGURI]
You're bored again?

157
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yes. Ugh.

158
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:56,375
The novelty sustained me
for a little while, but...

159
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,958
Not a single warrior has proven
equal to the task of facing me.

160
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,708
I tidied up the castle,
tended to monsters,

161
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,375
hid treasures in dungeons
all over the land,

162
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,083
day after day after day.

163
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,541
[AGURI]
All by yourself?

164
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,333
[KORO-SENSEI]
Did I mention trap maintenance?

165
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,125
Oh, there's been a lot of that.

166
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,666
[AGURI] Sounds like you've
really thrown yourself

167
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,833
into the work.

168
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yet no one dared to come

169
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,541
and throw down the gauntlet.

170
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,791
The seasons marched on.

171
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,833
And suddenly: Eureka!

172
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,125
[AGURI]
Yes?

173
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,666
[KORO-SENSEI] I thought,
why not train warriors

174
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,333
to take me on?

175
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,791
Oh! Greatest idea ever!

176
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Right?

177
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,125
That's splendid!

178
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,958
[KORO-SENSEI] Couldn't have
said it better myself!

179
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
So there you have it.

180
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,375
That's what brings
me to E-class.

181
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,208
An ingenious solution,
if I do say so myself.

182
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,416
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

183
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,625
So then, what became
of your former pupil?

184
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,625
[KORO-SENSEI] Oh, he accepted
the Reaper position

185
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,791
and promptly disappeared
without a trace.

186
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,708
Kudos to reinventing yourself!

187
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,458
That doesn't sound very good.

188
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,166
[bell tolls]

189
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mew?

190
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,125
Time to mold young minds!

191
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,500
I believe today we'll
focus on magic potions

192
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,708
and how best to use them
against a foe of my stature.

193
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,541
Oh, I forgot the bring
the forbidden tome

194
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,875
I borrowed from Okajima!

195
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,208
Excuse me!

196
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,041
So regardless of his past,

197
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,708
he's, uh, he's the
Demon King now, right?

198
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,791
Because I'd swear it looks
like he's having fun.

199
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,083
Yeah, well, whatever the
hell you wanna call him,

200
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,500
he sure loves being a teacher.

201
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,458
[KORO-SENSEI] Moral of
the story, boys n' girls:

202
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,583
Enjoy the climb.

203
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,958
Reach the summit too
soon or too easily

204
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,666
and you'll want
to change careers.

205
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,208
[CLASS]
What're you talking about?

206
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Embrace the chance to fail.

207
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,083
What better way to know the path

208
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,791
than falling onto it face-first
every now and then?

209
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,458
[CLASS]
What does that even mean?

210
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,708
[KORO-SENSEI] Okajima,
here's the book you loaned me.

211
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,750
Thanks again!

212
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,708
You have to do this now?!

213
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,791
Late again, huh?
Oh, well. Big shock.

214
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,750
Well, as long as the kids are
learning and he's having fun.

215
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,416
Lucky dog!

216
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,000
[NEURO]
Out with it!

217
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,916
Reveal to me the ultimate
mystery and satisfy my hunger!

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,833
[NEURO chuckles]

219
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,208
Y-Yusei Matsui's next
project is gonna be--

220
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,958
[FUWA]
You're in the wrong show!
