1
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,791
Yep. I get the feeling we've
come to the right place.

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,416
Pretty obvious spot for
a legendary item, huh?

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,083
Come on. Why's this on us?

4
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,458
Can't someone else grab
the stupid thing?

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,291
Oh, don't be that way.
We want in good with the Pope.

6
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,208
He's needs a replacement for
the one the Big Five broke.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,666
Well, yeah, and we need it
to defeat the Demon King.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,333
So there's that.

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,333
Quit being such an octo-wuss!

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI] I'm telling
you it's a Pandora's Box!

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,500
We open it at our peril!

12
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,000
Some hideous, boss-level monster

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,208
lies coiled within...

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,500
How's the Demon King
more scared than we are?

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,458
Wow, Professor
Bitch came along.

16
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,416
Of course I did! Ha-ha!

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,833
Rumor has it the world's
Skimpiest Magical Bikini

18
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,166
is hidden in this chest.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,333
And I want it!

20
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,666
Not even Karasuma can
resist such power!

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,625
Yes, I can.

22
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,333
[OKAJIMA]
Uhh, details please.

23
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,500
[IRINA]
Huh?

24
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,416
Tell us more about
this "magical bikini."

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,041
Would her ladyship
prefer some help

26
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,458
in trying on said garment?

27
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,875
[MEG]
She most certainly would not!

28
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,583
[KAEDE] Since when is
a cave a dressing room?

29
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,125
Um, thanks, Mosquito
Bite Squad, but chill.

30
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,125
Can it, pimple-prick!

31
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,333
[MEG]
Hey, Nagisa.

32
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,875
Why don't we go ahead
and open the, uh--

33
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,333
[NAGISA]
Yeah. Sure thing.

34
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,500
Um, here goes.

35
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,500
What? Nobody wants
to say "chest" now?

36
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,333
What the--?

37
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,583
Okay, uh. It's empty.

38
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,500
[NAGISA]
Hmm.

39
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,916
Way to manage our expectations.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,583
[BOTH gasp]

41
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,083
[OKAJIMA]
No!

42
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,500
This isn't happening,
this isn't happening,

43
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,375
this isn't happening!

44
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:38,958
Did we--?

45
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:39,875
Oh my God.

46
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,000
[ITONA screams]

47
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,125
Itona, what--?

48
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,583
[KORO-SENSEI]
Over here.

49
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,791
[ITONA]
What twisted magic is this?

50
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,583
What is this? Why have
I turned into Kaede?

51
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,166
I have way bigger boobs
than I'm used to.

52
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,833
Huh. That's what's going on.

53
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,791
Our bodies have pulled
the ol' switcheroo on us.

54
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,625
I'm totally Isogai. What a trip.

55
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,250
And I'm Maehara.

56
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,541
Seems like a serious violation
of privacy if you ask me.

57
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,916
And why do I feel a draft?

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,166
Oh, come on!

59
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,583
Our clothes shouldn't
be part of the bargain!

60
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,708
Um, sir? How's that a thing?

61
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,583
[ITONA] Well, I suppose
given our predicament,

62
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,958
logic dictates a bug resides

63
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,750
more in one's mind
than in the flesh,

64
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,708
meaning when we transfer
to a new physical form,

65
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,958
our quirks follow.

66
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,208
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hey, knock it off!

67
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,125
I look weird when you do that!

68
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,291
[ITONA]
Sorry.

69
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,208
The point is, Isogai's
equipment shortage

70
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,500
is a function of
his programming.

71
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,416
Even when manifested
in Maehara's body,

72
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,916
it remains in the old one.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,208
[ISOGAI]
So I'm screwed?

74
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,458
[MEG yells]

75
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,916
Let me down!

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,208
Kataoka?

77
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
This isn't fair!

78
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,583
Come on! Just let me
have this, damn it!

79
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,916
Please don't look, Isogai!

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,333
Um, over here.

81
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,291
I can't keep up!

82
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,208
So Kataoka's Okajima now?

83
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,750
I feel sorry for Meg.

84
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,875
I lucked out getting
to be Kaede.

85
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,791
Could be worse, right?

86
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,958
This is what it feels like

87
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,375
to go from being a
have-not to a have-lots!

88
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,791
Just so you know, I am never
giving these back ever!

89
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,250
Excuse me?!

90
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,125
Hey, did anybody see what
happened to Professor Bitch?

91
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,208
Now that you mention it,
where's Commander K?

92
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,708
[KARASUMA]
No! Stop it!

93
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,750
I won't submit to
your evil wiles!

94
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,000
[KARASUMA snickers]

95
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,625
[IRINA]
If you rip out a button,

96
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,375
I swear by all that is sacred--

97
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,166
Put my cape back on!

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,083
[KARASUMA] Oh, my.
My rags come off so easily!

99
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,916
Hey, quit making
my face do that!

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,125
Not you, too, Isogai!

101
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,333
I thought you were
better than this!

102
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,083
The girl knows
how to multitask.

103
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
This is terrible.

104
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,583
[RYUNOSUKE]
There's something up ahead.

105
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

106
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,875
We keep pushing forward,

107
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,958
we might find a way
to undo all this.

108
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,708
Wait a sec. Why didn't
the two of you swap?

109
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,791
[BOTH] What? Can you
not tell the difference?

110
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,708
I'm Chiba. That's Hayami.

111
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,708
[ALL] You two were
meant for each other!

112
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,958
[HAYAMI]
Koro-Q.

113
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,750
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy
to stand guard and all,

114
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,041
but d'you think Rinka
and the others are okay?

115
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,458
I dunno.

116
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,875
I'd be surprised if Karma
can do much with my body.

117
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,500
Well, they got Koro-sensei
and Commander K with 'em,

118
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,333
so they ought'a be
in good shape.

119
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,625
[KUNUDONS laughing]

120
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,583
Abandon all hope,
ye who venture this far!

121
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,916
[chuckles]

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,958
I may be inhabiting
an unfamiliar form,

123
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,375
but my speed is
more than intact.

124
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,833
[ITONA chuckling]

125
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,375
[yelps]

126
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,291
[screaming]

127
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,833
[KORO SENSEI]
What did you do?

128
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,083
Seems I neglected to factor in

129
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,041
the relative rigidity
of human limbs.

130
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,916
[KORO SENSEI] Classic slapstick.
Let me learn from you!

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,333
I need you to focus!

132
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,625
'Kay, I'll tell ya what.

133
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,333
You handle this and
we'll keep going.

134
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,708
[IRINA]
This is your fight, too!

135
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,875
Must be rough
without his comic foil.

136
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,791
Good thing we're not
that kind of double act.

137
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,625
Look, if we don't
reverse this spell,

138
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,250
Okajima's gonna
have a field day.

139
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,458
[NAGISA]
That was a whole lot a' nothin'.

140
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,708
[NAGISA]
Huh?

141
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,333
Oh, crap.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,916
[KARASUMA] All right, just
think about it for a second.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,750
If some big scary
dungeon boss shows up

144
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,333
and starts wailing on us,
we'll be sittin' ducks!

145
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,916
Don't worry, we'll protect you.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,833
Maehara and I
have similar builds,

147
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,708
so adjusting hasn't been
as difficult as it could be.

148
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,333
Believe me, holding our own
won't be awkward in the least.

149
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,583
[OKAJIMA, TOKA]
He's so manly even with

150
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,125
his butt hangin'
outta somebody else.

151
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,166
[KAEDE]
Hmm...

152
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,541
Okajima seems quiet,
don't you think?

153
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,166
He's alive, right?

154
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,875
What if the rope is cutting
off his circulation?

155
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,375
[MAEHARA] Maybe we should give
it some slack, just in case.

156
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,875
[OKAJIMA]
Probably a good idea.

157
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,291
I mean, he hasn't tried anything
and he looks so pitiful.

158
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,750
Now this is what
I call role-play.

159
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,041
Oh-ho, yeah. Papa may've
found himself a new hobby.

160
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,416
[screams]

161
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,708
[OKAJIMA]
Definitely NSFW! Look away!

162
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,625
[ISOGAI]
Actually, those are my eyes!

163
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,750
Um, what was that?

164
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,666
Hey. What's wrong?

165
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,000
I just feel sorta
weird all of a sudden.

166
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,791
Like maybe something's
happened to my real body.

167
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,708
Call it a sense of foreboding.

168
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,958
What do you mean?

169
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,666
You think Karma might be
in some kind of trouble?

170
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,875
Could be. I should go
look. You stay here.

171
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,500
Wait! Nagisa!

172
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,708
We're coming, too!

173
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,833
What happened?

174
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,500
[MAEHARA]
Guys! There's a hidden room!

175
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,000
[KARMA]
Chiba! Hayami!

176
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:12,708
[IRINA]
Huh?

177
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,291
[HAYAMI]
Hey.

178
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,916
Where's Karma?

179
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,500
[TOKA gasps]

180
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,791
[TOKA]
Look!

181
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,958
Oh, no! It can't be!

182
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,708
[KARMA]
Karma!

183
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,791
Avert your eyes, Nagisa!

184
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,541
Is it that bad?

185
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,916
[KARMA]
Seriously?

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,291
The world's skimpiest bikini
fits you like a glove!

187
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,791
What possessed you
to try it on?!

188
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,833
I tried to make him
stop. I really did.

189
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,041
'S girls-only armor, but
you're still able to wear it.

190
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,250
No surprise!

191
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,583
[KORO SENSEI]
It does look good on you.

192
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,791
Not really the point!

193
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,166
Hey, we found another chest!

194
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,000
Ah! I do believe
that's a Swap Orb!

195
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,666
Right, boys 'n girls,
if we use this,

196
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,916
we should revert back
to our old selves.

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Well, what are we waiting
for? Let's do it!

198
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,416
[ALL scream]

199
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:07,208
Huh? Where'm I now?
Did that thing work?

200
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:07,958
[BOTH]
We're us.

201
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,541
[MEG]
Yes!

202
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,375
I'm back! Ha-ha! Thank you!
I feel like myself again!

203
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,750
Ugh. I almost tasted bliss.

204
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,416
[KAEDE] Back to being
one of the have-nots.

205
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Aw, sweetie. Don't be sad.

206
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,416
Glad that's over. Let's get
outta this place, guys.

207
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,875
Sounds like a plan.
You ready to go, sir?

208
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,750
Koro-sensei? Hello?

209
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,666
Wait a sec.

210
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,958
He's not still Itona?

211
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,250
[ITONA]
No, I'm me.

212
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,458
[MEG]
Hm?

213
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,208
So what's the problem?
Cat got your tongue?

214
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,916
Hey, Koro-sensei?

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,333
[screams]

216
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,041
[KORO-SENSEI] Why am I wearing
the Demon King's skin?

217
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,291
I surrender! This magic is
way beyond my pay-grade!

218
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,083
[CLASS]
What was that about?

219
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,833
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh. Uh-oh...

220
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,958
[gasping]

221
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,208
[KUNUDON A]
Ah! Wait! Come back!

222
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,041
That's my body you're
running away with!

223
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,000
Uh... excuse me. I'm still here.
