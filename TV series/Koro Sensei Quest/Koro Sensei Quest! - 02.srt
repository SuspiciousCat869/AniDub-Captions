00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,833
[NAGISA]
Kunugigaoka School of Magic,

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,916
where students from
all over the world

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,333
come to forge themselves
into heroes.

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,083
We're E-class.
Outsiders. Underdogs.

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,333
And we share a secret no one
else in the school knows.

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,250
This year, our teacher
just so happens to be...

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,208
...the Demon King!

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,666
[KORO-SENSEI]
Alrighty. Take your best shot!

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,666
[NAGISA] Another day with the
one-and-only Koro-sensei.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,458
Here goes nothin'!

11
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:37,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okay.

12
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,083
My goal, boys n' girls,
is to train a war party

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,125
capable of giving the Demon
King a run for his money.

14
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,416
To get started,
we need some heroes,

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,125
however, I'm sad to say
there doesn't seem to be

16
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,958
anyone here who
meets the criteria.

17
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,000
[CLASS gasps]

18
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,500
But there's Isogai!

19
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Granted,
between his leadership skills

20
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,791
and undeniable courage, he does
have a certain heroic streak.

21
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,708
There's just one problem.

22
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,791
In his case, the phrase
"heroic streak"

23
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,125
has an unfortunate
double meaning.

24
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,583
[CLASS]
Harsh!

25
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,625
Okay then, if Isogai
doesn't fit the bill,

26
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,125
then who do we have that does?

27
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,833
[KORO-SENSEI] Not to put too
fine a point on it, but moi!

28
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,083
[MAEHARA]
That defeats the purpose!

29
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
So what are we supposed to do?

30
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,875
Well, when the conversation
turns to mighty warriors,

31
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,083
three names never
fail to be brought up.

32
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,250
[KORO-SENSEI] How long have
you been standing there?

33
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,750
I recommend enlisting the
three of them to your ranks.

34
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,958
The first is said to
dwell in a northern cave

35
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,166
and call himself Karma,
a.k.a. The Red Devil.

36
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,583
Legend has it, his abilities
are way above average.

37
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,125
I've heard of that guy!

38
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,083
Yeah, he's supposed to be a
super-sadistic ranger type,

39
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,333
I think!

40
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,541
Sorta hard to believe
we have a living legend

41
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,833
in our own backyard.

42
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,833
The second is Ritsu,
known as the Evolved Mage.

43
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,083
Dwelling in a northern cave,

44
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,791
her magic is rumored to
evolve on a daily basis.

45
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,583
Third is the Silver
Berserker, Itona.

46
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,625
The story goes that deep
within a northern cave--

47
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,500
Just how many northern
caves are there?!

48
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,041
[NAGISA]

[KUNUDON] Talk! Don't
try to fight it! Fess up!

50
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,750
Remember that birthday money
you asked me to keep safe?

51
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,250
Yeah, Mama treated herself
to the Korean spa!

52
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,000
[KUNUDON]
No!

[KORO-SENSEI] The strategy
guide for this dungeon.

00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,416
Everything you need to know

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,125
compiled into one
handy-dandy manual:

63
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,166
Maps, monsters, treasure
chests, save points--

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,916
you name it,
I've got you covered!

[KORO-SENSEI laughing]

68
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,541
[KORO-SENSEI] Isn't being on the
attack side of things exciting?

69
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,958
[MAEHARA]
So exciting.

70
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
The sealed portion of the book

71
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,541
deals with more adult monsters.

72
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,166
[OKAJIMA, MAEHARA, SUGINO] We
talkin' parental advisory stuff?

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
And of course the final page

74
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,166
lays out details regarding
the dungeon boss himself.

75
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,541
[MAEHARA]
What does "irregularities

76
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,708
in his luck trait" mean?

77
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,708
[KAEDE]
I was about to ask.

78
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,125
Heh. All bark and no bite, huh?

79
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,458
You could live a bazillion years
and not get close to beating me.

80
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah, yes.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,291
You see, when Karma thinks
opponents are beneath him...

[OPPONENTS chuckling]

83

That's right, fleabags!
Laugh it up while you can.

84
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,000
After that, go run
back to the shelter

85

and get yourselves euthanized!

86
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,500
[KORO-SENSEI] The effect on
his luck is rather negative.

87
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,250
[OPPONENTS laughing]

88
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's his bug.

89
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,166
When he acts cocky or
looks down on someone,

90
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,166
his luck takes an
astronomical plunge.

[CLASS]
Oh, I get it. Karma!

92

[KORO-SENSEI] A shame, really.
Oodles of potential.

93
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,875
He'd make a great warrior if not
for the disagreeable tendency

94
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,833
to lord his prowess over others.

95
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,208

[MAEHARA] Wow. This place
is crawling with booby traps.

[NAKAMURA]
Dude must be a total sadist.

100

Not that his
handiwork's gonna do much

101
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,500
to slow down Koro-sensei.

102
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,916

A little poison ought'a dial up

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,583

through those, you know!

blades are simply screaming

106

artistic makeover.

[FUWA, OKUDA, NAKAMURA, OKAJIMA]
We don't need that kinda danger!

108
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,750
[NAGISA] Questing through
a dungeon's a lot easier

109
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,208

ahead of you,

Heads up! Monster incoming!

113

An adult one?

Dang it. Never mind. Huh?

Wait. They're in

Right, so apparently
these guys only smile

Not to worry, children.

He actually hurt him.

Am I wrong or does that
make him the first?

[KARMA] And here I
thought "Koro-sensei"

135
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,208
was a play on the Japanese
for "un-killable teacher."

Guess the teacher part
was true, at least.

[NAKAMURA] Karma's smack-talk
seems to have really

152
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,750
touched a nerve.

there for a second.

156
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,291
Well, well. Hey, Nagisa.
What's up? It's been a while.

157
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,375
[NAGISA, KAEDE, OKAJIMA gasp]

158
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,041
L-Long time no see.

159
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,500
Whoa, whoa. Say what?

160
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,500
Oh. We've known each
other since we were kids.

161
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
So, uh, how the hell're
you bottom-feeders

162
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,291
kickin' it with the Final Boss?

163
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,666
[OKAJIMA]
Damn! Sick burn on Nagisa!

164
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,916
[GOOD BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
And you!

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,208
Look, we, uh, want you
to join our war party.

166
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,500
You're the only
chance we've got.

167
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,250
I always knew you were amazing,
but that attack a minute ago?

168
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,291
Work with us and Koro-sensei's
as good as defeated.

169
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,333
[KARMA]
Hmm...

170
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,833
[CLASS]
He thinks we suck.

171
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,208
Come on. seriously?
Even if I did join you...

172
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,958
[CLASS]
Like, sincerely suck.

173
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,833
...I think we all
know it'd be my kill.

174
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's no-- Ah!

175
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,166
[KARMA]
Heh.

176
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,583
You're mine now.

177
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,416
[gasps]

178
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,291
[MUSHROOM KUNUDON A]
Eh?

179
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,708
[MUSHROOM KUNUDON A]
My life is meaningless.

180
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,166
Where'd he run off to?

181
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Sorry.
It's this cave. I felt grimy.

182
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,666
Did you take a bath?!

183
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
No disrespect, but to be honest,

184
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,500
you were so slow and
that trap so tedious,

185
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,375
I thought, "why not make
the most of my time

186
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,166
and zip over to a hot springs
for a nice, soothing dip?"

187
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,291
Just the ticket, too.

188
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,000
Healed that nasty
wound up like magic.

189
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,958
[KARMA] You're not supposed to
bathe yourself in a hot spring!

190
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,791
[KARMA yells]

191
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
Zip. Snip.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,375
Oh, really?

193
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,416
[KORO-SENSEI] You're strong,
Karma, I'll give you that.

194
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,416
Quick on your feet,
literally and figuratively.

195
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,958
Hey, quit tryin' to wash
my back, it's weird!

196
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,416
Creep thinks he can just--!

197
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,166
[KORO-SENSEI] The trouble
is you let those talents

198
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,375
go to your head.

199
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,750
If wielded in arrogance,
a blade will never touch me.

200
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,250
The Demon King isn't felled
by a single player,

201
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,041
but by a team of skilled
warriors working in tandem.

202
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,916
Camouflaging yourself was
an exceptionally clever move.

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,666
Why not shroud yourself in the
mantel of E-class next time?

204
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,833
[KARMA]
I see.

205
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,125
You want me to be part
of the group, too.

206
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,625
Fine.

207
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,416
Give me my clothes back and
I'll give it some thought.

208
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
All right, there we go.

209
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,791
Dammit I didn't agree to this!
I said I'd give it some thought!

210
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,250
[GIRLS] E-class proudly
welcomes our newest member!

211
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,875
[KARMA]
What is wrong with you people?!

212
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,958
And your banner looks
like a bad website!

213
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,083
And why the stupid dialog box?

214
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,333
[CLASS]
Hip-hip, hooray!

215
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,708
[NAGISA] And that's how
you drag the Red Devil

216
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,625
into being part of your clique.

217
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,083
Which brings us that
much closer to victory!

218
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,333
But I still haven't said yes!
