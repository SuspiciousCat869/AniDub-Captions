161
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,041
[KORO SENSEI] Slithering is
supposed to be my thing!

162
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,583
Demon King! Your
reign is at an end!

163
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,500
[screams]

164
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hold a second!

165
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,666
The traps were all
bogus, I swear!

166
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,333
No one was ever
gonna get hurt! Ah!

167
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,500
Wait, I know!

168
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,708
We could join forces!

169
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,916
Ah! Half the world will
be yours to command!

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,333
Uh, and did I mention
I'm your father?

171
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,750
No? Well, I am!

172
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,791
Uh, at least, I could be!
You don't know! Come to...

173
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,875
He's lost it.

174
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,875
This is so cliché it's sad.

175
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,250
Gah. His humor's too powerful.
I don't have a comeback.

176
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,500
[KAEDE, FUWA]
Oh, come on!

177
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,416
[KARMA] Heh. Terasaka's
got blood in his eyes.

178
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,125
Now what? Koro-sensei
will be massacred!

179
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,083
That's, uh, kinda what
we've been going for.

180
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Mew?

181
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,291
You might want to evacuate.

182
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,666
All those traps have been
pushed way past their limit.

183
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,583
The whole castle's
going to collapse on us!

184
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,375
Wait, what're you
doing here, sis?

185
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,791
[AGURI chuckles]

186
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
[KORO-SENSEI screams]

187
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's the only exit!

188
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,958
Uh-huh.

189
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,791
I tried to tell you moving
the throne room so far in

190
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
was a bad idea, but no.

191
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,541
[CLASS]
You've killed us all!

192
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,416
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nagisa.

193
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,666
We need your power
now more than ever.

194
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,500
Your bug, m'boy.

195
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,916
I don't know where
this is going anymore.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's precisely the point.

197
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
Whatever's in store for us,
if you're behind it,

198
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,625
I'm positive things will
work out for the best.

199
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,708
That's your special ability.

200
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,208
Gah!

201
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,041
And our only hope
of not being squashed!

202
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,958
For the love of my professional
future, Nasiga, do something!

203
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,041
No one's gonna hire a teacher

204
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,291
with wholesale slaughter
on his resume!

205
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,750
[NAGISA]
Sir.

206
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,333
[NAGISA]
All right. Here goes!

207
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,083
[KORO-SENSEI]
Hiddy-ho, class!

208
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:20,333
I'm the Big Bad Demon King,
or, as of today, your teacher.

209
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,041
[CLASS]
Huh?

210
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,291
Excuse me, sir?

211
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,416
What are we doing back
at the beginning?

212
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,708
Uh, I feel like I
remember something.

213
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,666
Aww... We gotta do this again?

214
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,833
Whoa, I-- Wait a sec!
Did my bug do this?

215
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
This would seem to be one of

216
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,083
its many possible outcomes, yes.

217
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,583
Nice touch pushing us back
to before I got canned.

218
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,250
[CLASS]
So this is happening?!

219
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Embrace the chance to fail.

220
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,666
What better way to know the path

221
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,875
than falling onto it face-first
every now and then?

222
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,500
[KORO-SENSEI laughs]

223
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,250
[KORO-SENSEI] What an honor
and a privilege it'll be

224
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,666
to teach you again.

225
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,291
Now then, boys n' girls,

226
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,125
let's get started, shall we?

227
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,916
Whoever feels ready,
come get some!

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
[CLASS]
Yes, sir!
