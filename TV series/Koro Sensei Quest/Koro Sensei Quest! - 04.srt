called the Chamber of Imposters

Of course, in the dark hallway.

The more you know
about a person,

the more exploitable
weaknesses you'll find.

[MAEHARA]
Got'cha, ya sneak!

157
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,625
I tried to tell ya
he was too pretty.

158
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,916
Nice job!

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,833
So you saw through my ruse, eh?

160
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,458
Not bad for such
a squishy bunch.

161
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
The real Terasaka is safe, yes?

162
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,125
Aw, why can't this be
real Terasaka from now on?

163
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,500
Okay, losers!
On to the next trial!

164
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,500
"Chamber of Secrets." Okay.

165
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,750
Huh. "Tell the guardian
something only you know

166
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,958
about another party member."

167
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,333
That sounds pointless.

168
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,791
Actually sounds awful.

169
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,291
What kind of trial is this?

170
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Don't fret,
children. I have us covered.

171
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,250
Knowing the gory details of a
student's life is, after all,

172
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,833
a vital part of the job.

173
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,958
Naturally it often means
going above and beyond,

174
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,166
but the information
I've compiled

175
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,333
is well worth the trouble.

176
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,583
[SUGINO]
Sugi-Strike!

177

[CLASS]
Creep.

178
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,833
An instructor knows the weakness
of every child in his class.

179
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,875
There's no better means
to ensure they obey.

180
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,583
I'm beginning to be impressed.

181
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,875
[KARASUMA] You sure
you're not a Demon King?

182
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,583
Ugh! I can't believe you!

183
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,375
'Kay. Fine.
If that's how it is...

184
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
Eee! Is nothing sacred?!

[NAGISA whispering]

186
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ah! Stop! Please!

187
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,833
I'll do anything
you say! Have mercy!

188
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,375
[ASANO]
Inconceivable!

189
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
That's it.

190
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,708
I'll never show my
face in public again!

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,583
For the final trial, I've
prepared a li'l somethin'

192
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,250
that oughta be right up
you maggots' alley!

[CLASS gasps]

194
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,083
The Chamber of Self Sacrifice!

195
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,250
Look at the ceiling!

00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,875
[GUARDIAN KUNUDON A laughing]

197
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,166
[GUARDIAN KUNUDON A]
Soon you'll be squashed

198
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,041
like the insects you are!

199
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,416
This is where the trial part
comes in, boys and girls.

200
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,041
Fairly straightforward.

201
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,083
Press the button and the door
on the opposite side will open.

202
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,125
Just be warned: Once it does,

203
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,375
the door on your own side
can never be opened again.

204
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,583
If we press our button,

205
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,750
Koro-sensei will get
out of here alive.

206
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,583
But on the flip side,
if he doesn't press his,

207
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,750
we'll all be mashed
into mystery meat pâté!

208
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,000
What the hell are
we supposed to do?

209
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,666
[ASANO]
Can he sacrifice himself

210
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,583
to save the lives
of his students?

211
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,958
We're about to see
his true nature.

212
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,708
A monster has no business
being a teacher.

213
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,208
Show yourself!

214
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,833
Reveal your black heart and
bear your fangs, Demon King!

215
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,875
[KORO-SENSEI]
Bee-bop.

216
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,208
[KORO-SENSEI] I assure you,
abandonment was never an option.

217
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,375
For goodness' sake,
they're my responsibility.

218

[KARASUMA]
But--

226
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,291
[ASANO] I acknowledge
Koro-sensei as a teacher

227
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,250
at Kunugigaoka Magic Academy.

228
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,541
That said, should he fall short
of my scholastic vision...

229
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,250
...I won't shrink
from terminating him.

230

I'm just gonna put this out
there for everybody to ponder.

If we'd left Koro-sensei in
there, we'd have beaten him.

Uh.

There he goes again.

[KORO-SENSEI]
And that, boys n' girls,

241
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
is what we call
"commitment to the bit."
