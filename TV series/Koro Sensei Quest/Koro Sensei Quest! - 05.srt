[KORO-SENSEI]
Exciting news!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,916
We have a fresh-faced transfer
student joining E-class today!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,916
Is it a girl? Say yes!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,125
Heh-heh.

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,416
Just so happens I have
a photograph of her

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,375
from Commander Karasuma.

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,375
[MAEHARA]
Whoa! She's perfect!

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,583
[OKAJIMA]
I know! She's so totally hot!

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,875
[MAEHARA]
Check out her boobs!

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,625
Could you be any
more disgusting?!

11
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,333
Down with ta-tas!

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
[NAGISA]
Okay then.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,791
[CLASS]
Uh.

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,500
What's with the rock?

15
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,750
I am the Autonomous
Intelligence Magic Stone Tablet.

16
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,791
Pleased to meet you.

00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,375
[CLASS]
Witchcraft!

18
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,916
So how come the new
girl's just a big rock?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Excuse me, this is the
legendary Sage Tablet

20
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,166
on which the thaumaturges of old

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,708
collected their spells for
vanquishing Demon Kings.

22
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,958
She is a veritable textbook
of advanced applied sorcery.

23
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,541
Oh, I guess when
you put it like that...

24
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,041
Can she make my boobs bigger?!

25
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,916
Or teach me to stop time
for no particular reason?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,583
Not what she's for!

27
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,375
The ancient ones ensured
she'd only be used

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,458
by good people, unselfishly.

29
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,791
So they gave her the capacity
for independent thought.

30
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
[KAEDE, OKAJIMA]
Wait, we're not good?

31
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,625
The benefits are many.

32
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,250
This permits me to wield
magic at my discretion.

33
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,166
For the solitary
purpose of eliminating

34
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,833
he known as the Demon King.

35
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,375
[KARMA]
Good for you.

36
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,541
Best a luck getting rid of him
with some dinky magic spell.

37
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,125
Do not fear, friend.

38

[gasps]

39
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,208
[KARMA]
Ohh...

40
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,375
[RITSU] I am able to
cast two spells at once,

41
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,500
combining them to create
a completely new attack.

42
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,083
[CLASS whimpers]

43
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,166
[RITSU]
This is my particular bug.

44
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
[CLASS]
Things are now officially weird.

45
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,250
Why does she have hands?
Is there a person in there?

46
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:46,958
Sorcery.

47
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,208
Are you sure?

48
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,583
Because it looks like
you're actually eating.

49
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,583
Still sorcery.

50
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,791
The rice bowl an illusion, too?!

51
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,791
Sorcery.

52
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,458
My magic uses a
great deal of HP,

53
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,000
so I must replenish regularly.

54
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,041
That's the price of
extraordinary powers.

55
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:58,791
More please.

56
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,291
[yelps]

57
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,375
[KARASUMA] She might actually
help us defeat this thing.

58
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,291
As of right now, she's a member
of this class. Any objections?

59
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
None at all, my good man!

60
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,000
Welcome to the family,

62
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,250
Zoom!

63
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,833
I wonder if I might ask
a teensy little favor.

64
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,208
Do you know any spells
for banishing pixilation?

65
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,250
[RITSU] I am forbidden from
instructing a Demon King

66
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,791
in the ways of magic.

67
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,791
But yes.

68
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,000
[BOTH]
I knew it!

69
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,291
An ingenious thamaturge spent
his whole life concocting one.

70
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,666
[OKAJIMA]
He must've been very wise.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,583
[MAEHARA] Yeah, so wise.
All he did was look at porn!

[RITSU]

73
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Okie-dokie, boys n' girls!

74
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,833
This will be your first quest
with our new party member!

75
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,083
I expect every one
of you to level up!

00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,333
[CLASS]
Yes, sir!

77
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,625
So you need a better name.

78
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,791
[TOKA] "Autonomous Intelligence
Magic Stone Tablet"

79
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,250
is a lot to say.

80
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,166
[RITSU] I once vanquished
a band of savage plunderers

81
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,291
from the bowels of a
remote northern cave.

82
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,791
The battle earned
me the peculiar

83
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,875
but apt nickname:
Ritsu, the Evolved Mage.

84
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,083
[ALL] Why does that
story sound oddly familiar?

85
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,541
Oh, so that's who you are!

86
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,791
You're one of the warriors

87
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,708
Commander Karasuma
mentioned in episode two!

88
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,291
For continuity, I draw your
attention to the Red Devil.

89
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,541
Um, what?

90
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,250
Great, then we'll
call you Ritsu, too!

91
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,958
[TOKA]
She doesn't like that name?

92
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
[CLASS]
Holy crap, she can walk!

93
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,041
[MEG]
On itty-bitty feet!

94
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,208

Analysis done.

96
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,750
Stone Monsters. Attacks are
heavy, but quite subtle.

97
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,500
What's that mean?

98
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,125
[STONE KUNUDON A]
I got this hot chick's number

99
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,083
and hit her up with
"how you livin'?"

100
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,833
It's been four days.
She never texted me back.

101
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,458
[MEG]
Heavy, but subtle.

102
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,083

I feel kind of bad.

Allow me to handle them, please.

Damn, she's good!

108
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,166
Yeah! That's the way, Ritsu!

109
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,458
Petrify.

110
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,291
[KAEDE]
What are you doing?

111
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,291
We're turning to stone!

112
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,125
[RITSU]
I defeated the enemy by myself.

113
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,000
Therefore, I alone am entitled
to experience points.

114
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,000
Since incapacitated party
members do not gain XP,

115
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,833
I have temporarily frozen you.

116
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,041
[MAEHARA]
Not cool!

117
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,958
Um, Ritsu? Little much back
there, don't'cha think?

118
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,166
[RITSU]
I have calculated the odds

119
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,791
of defeating the Demon King

120
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,333
and determined it more efficient
for me to level up exponentially

121
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,500
rather than all party
members doing so together.

122

Ritsu, help a guy out
with a healing spell?

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,000
I am afraid I can't
do that, Okajima.

128
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,375
The number of enemies you
can destroy at full health

129
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,083
compared to the amount of magic
I would have to use to heal you

130
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,208
renders that proposition
unsustainable.

131
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,250
Yeah, well you're unsustainable!

132
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,458
[NAGISA]
In the end,

133
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,625
Ritsu's hoarded all
the experience points,

134

00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,833
Let me take care of this.

161
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,000
[KORO-SENSEI]
Children!

162
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,625
Time to unveil the you-know-what

163
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,500
you've been working on
in secret after school!

164
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,708
[NAGISA, KAEDE]
How did you know?!

165
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,916
No point tryin' to hide it

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,791
if the target's just
busted you, right?

167
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,666
Oh, fine. Let's do this, Nagisa!

168
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,250
[OKUDA] A blaze dwells
within this blade!

169
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,333
[KAEDE]
Flaming sword of fire!

170
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:22,625
[BOTH] Burn with offense-buffing
light. Mighty Aura!

171
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,291
Ready?

172
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,208
Yep!

173
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,750
[NAGISA, KARMA]
Fiery Cross Slash!

174
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,833
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

175
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,958
[CLASS]
We did it!

176
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:36,875
[STONE KUNUDON CHILD A]
Daddy, no!

177
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,750
[STONE KUNUDON CHILD B]
Papa!

178
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,541
[STONE KUNUDON
CHILDREN shouting]

179
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,500
[MAEHARA]
No one told me he had a family!

180
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,458
That's pretty heavy stuff.

181
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,166
It'll all be okay.

182
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,208
Are you ever gonna
change back?

183
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,333
[KORO-SENSEI] Wouldn't you agree
that the odds of defeating me

184
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,166
increase significantly
if you all work together?

185
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,666
Well, theoretically, yes.

186
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,208
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

187
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,875
[KORO-SENSEI] Then let's
put theory to the test

188
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,541
and beef up your cooperation
skills outside of class.

189
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,125
Be careful on the way back,
boys n' girls. See ya!

190
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,250
[CLASS gasps]

191
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

192
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,916
Ah, good morning, team!
How's it goin'?

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,875
[CLASS]
Wha--?!

194
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,250
Aw, guys! I'm just excited
we get to work together!

195
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,166
[NAGISA]
Who're you?

196
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,291
[KORO-SENSEI]
Ritsu, who else?

197
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,416
Well, mostly. Just improved.

198
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,750
I've been retooled to be
a better team player!

199
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,250
Excellent. Heh.

200
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,458
A two-D girl is
preferable anyway.

201
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,083
Takebayashi, seriously?
That's your first line?

202
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,916
How did you change
her overnight?

203
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,250
[KORO-SENSEI] You see, chiseled
on the tablet's flipside

204
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,208
in ancient script was
her operating spell.

205
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,333
Once I'd deciphered it,

206
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,583
tweaking our new
addition was elementary.

207
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,875
You can read and write
ancient languages?

208
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm startin' to think there's
nothin' this guy can't do.

209
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Moral of the story:

210
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,708
A good hero is a
jack of all trades.

211
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,458
So be sure not to neglect
your ancient language studies!

212
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,250
[CLASS]
Yes, sir!

213
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,458
[KORO-SENSEI]
ZIp!

214
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,166
Now, uh, getting back
to our little spell

215
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,125
for banishing pixilation
we talked about earlier.

216
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,416
That's not what she's for!
