I'd call that hit.

161
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,666
Really nice shot.

162
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,000
Especially for such
a long-range target.

163
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,125
Hella respect.

164
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,208
You're very sweet.

165
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,583
[BOTH chuckle]

166
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,583
[MURAMATSU, YOSHIDA]
When did they become the OTP?

167
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,416
Hey! You ain't won yet!

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,375
My crotch is on fire,
but I still have a hos--

169
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,541
[KAEDE] I wouldn't try to play
that card if I were you, buddy.

170
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,291
Son of a bitch!

171
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,333
[sighs]

172
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,625
Best pudding ever!

173
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
[ALL]
Ugh! What is with you?

174
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,416
Oh, wait. 'Parently I
still got the upper hand.

175
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,750
[BOTH gasp]

176
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,416
[groans]

177
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,375
[CLASS]
Why are you wearing that?

178
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,958
[NAKAMURA, KARMA chuckle]

179
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,166
[OKAJIMA, MAEHARA] Damn, Nagisa!
You're totally an eight!

180
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,708
Yeah, that's right.
Make love to ze camera.

181
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,125
[NAGISA]
Don't you dare post those!

182
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,916
It's so nice to see you
embracing your true self.

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,375
Want me to grab
the hedge clippers?

184
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,833
[NAGISA]
Only to cut me out of this!

185
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,208
You, uh, do know there's
nothing inherently funny

186
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,000
about a guy in a
dress these days?

187
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,791
[NAGISA]
I couldn't agree more.

188
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,583
[KARMA] I don't see
what the problem is...

189
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,041
So does this count
as rescuing him?

190
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,375
[TAKAOKA grunts]

191
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,583
You've outdone yourselves,
I'll give you that much,

192
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,833
but I still have few
tricks up my sleeve!

193
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,458
So good.

194
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:11,708
[ALL gasp]

195
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,625
Kayano!

196
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,041
[laughs]

197
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,291
What did I say?

198
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,041
I put a poison in that
limited-edition pudding

199
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,500
that will make
her slumber forever

200
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,583
unless she's kissed
by a princess!

201
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,458
[TAKAOKA laughing]

202
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,750
No! What are we
supposed to do now?

203
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,625
It's not like we happen to
have a princess on hand.

204
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,666
Except we kinda do.

205
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,375
[BOTH]
What?!

206
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,541
[NAGISA] Not that anybody cares,
but I'm actually a boy!

207
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
Fine. Whatever. You're a dude.

208
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,375
Accept you've been miscast
and get on with it.

209
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,375
I've never kissed anyone.

210
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,208
Come on, she'll
never wake up again.

211
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,458
You want that on
your conscience?

212
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,375
[NAGISA]
Of course not, but...

213
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,541
[ALL]
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

214
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,458
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

215
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,750
Ugh, okay. I'll do it.
But only to save Kayano!

216
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,500
[OTHERS]
Ooh!

217
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,958
What's this?

218
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,750
[ALL gasp]

219
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,583
[ALL squeal]

220
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,875
Nagisa? Why am I...?

221
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,458
What's going on?

222
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,458
Oh, thank goodness.
We were all worried.

223
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,416
[OTHERS cheering]

224
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,583
Um. How come I feel so hot?

225
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,583
Is something wrong?

226
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,583
Is it love?

227
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
I'm... afraid not.

228
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,750
[KAEDA screams]

229
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,791
What's happening to her?

230
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,333
You gotta be kidding!

231
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,166
[OTHERS]
Okay...

232
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,500
We should've seen this coming.

233
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,791
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm creeped out.

234
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,333
[KAEDE] Creeped out?
I'll show you creeped out!

235
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,708
[KAEDE yells]

236
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,041
Huh. Guess, you'd call
this a non-sequitur?

237
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,458
[RYUNOSUKE]
Well, that happened.

238
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
[HAYAMI]
Yes, it did.

239
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
Damn, we're good.

240
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,333
Yep.

241
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,250
[BOTH chuckle]

242
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,833
[MURAMATSU, YOSHIDA]
Respect.
