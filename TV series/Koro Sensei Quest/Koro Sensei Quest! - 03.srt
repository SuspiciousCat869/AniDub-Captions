[MAEHARA] He sliced off

[KORO-SENSEI]
Tadaomi Karasuma.

Oh, wow! The fact he's
so scary makes him hot!

[GUYS gasp]

160
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,916
Great. So now what're
we supposed to do?

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,916
[KARMA]
Hm.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,833
She's been playing that charm
close to the chest, heh.

163
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,958
But if we got it away from her,
the spell'd be broken.

164
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,125
[gasps]

165
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,583
Yeah? So what if it
would, carrot top?

166
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,208
[KARMA]
Nailed it.

167
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,166
Like you've got the grapes
to yank this baby outta my hand!

168
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,958
Get 'em, boys! I'm tired
of lookin' at their faces!

169
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,083
I was going to let
you leave here alive,

170
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,000
but since you know
my weak point...

171
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,125
Too bad they had
to be so damn pure.

172
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,708
Oh, well, c'est la vie.

173
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,458
[GIRLS]
Nagisa! Karma!

174
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,375
[IRINA] This is what happens
when snot-nosed pubescent punks

175
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,000
stick their noses
in grownup business.

176
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,041
Buh-bye now.

177
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,750
[BOTH scream]

178
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,916
[BOTH gasp]

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,458
[gasps]

180
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,250
[KORO-SENSEI] Whew! That was
almost too close for comfort.

181
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,875
Son of a--! You're supposed
to be under my spell!

182
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,250
[KORO-SENSEI]
Madam, please.

183
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,416
Your magic has no power over me.

184
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,458
What do you take me
for, a trash mob?

185
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,041
Do your homework.

186
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,625
Status-effect enchantments have
no power over the Demon King!

187
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,500
Go figure.

188
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,875
Heh. Knew it all along!

189
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,625
Nice fake-out there, Teach.

190
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,166
[KORO-SENSEI chuckles]

191
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Toying with you has been a lark,

192
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,416
but trying to push my students
out a window to their deaths

193
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,666
is a bridge too far.

194
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,000
Nice try, Jaw Breaker!

195
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm not sure what's going on,

196
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,833
but don't pat yourself
on the back just yet.

197
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,416
I still have hostag-- Huh?

198
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,708
Not anymore you don't.

199
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,750
I've taken the liberty
of setting them free.

200
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,333
[IRINA]
What?!

201
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,625
[KARASUMA] This thing told me
his plan on the first floor.

202
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,791
[KORO-SENSEI]
Easy, easy! I'm only pretending!

203
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,541
Gah! He broke the
cage in one blow!

204
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,666
Coolest thing I've seen
in my entire life!

205
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,500
Same. I think I'm
falling in love.

206
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,500
[KORO-SENSEI] Gah!
No, no, no! This was my idea!

207
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,000
Why are they all
smitten with you?

208
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,541
I don't know!

209
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,083
[KORO-SENSEI] And what about
your immunity to Irina's charms?

210
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,416
I'm the Demon King,

211
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000
so of course she couldn't
get a foothold on me,

212
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,791
but are you sure you don't
bat for the other team?

213
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,750
[KARASUMA]
It's called being disciplined!

214
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,000
Game, set, match.
Admit defeat, foul witch.

215
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
[KORO-SENSEI] Someone's
been a naughty sorceress.

216
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,083
Whatever are we to do?

217
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,666
[screams]

218
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,083
[IRINA]
Ah! No, please! Stop!

219
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,041
I-I'll be a good girl
from now on, I swear.

220
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,583
Cross my heart.

221
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,125
I beg your forgiveness.

222
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,458
[GUYS]
What did they do to her?

223
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,416
[grunting]

224
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,541
[ALL]
What is wrong with you?!
