00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,125
[KIMURA]
Go us, am I right?

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,041
We've got the Red Devil.
And the Evolved Mage!

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,125
That's two legendary
warriors on our team!

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,666
Yeah, I gotta admit,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,375
you're in pretty good hands
if you wanna kill the octopus.

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,125
You know, we've come this far,

7
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,166
so we might as well
recruit the third one.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,916
[KORO-SENSEI] Bringing all
three legendary warriors

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,541
into the fold would increase
your odds of victory.

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,541
Trying to have a
conversation here!

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,916
[KORO-SENSEI]
You don't have to be mean.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,541
I'm just trying to contribute.

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,958
It's kinda awkward when we're
talkin' about killin' you.

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,291
The third one's called
the Silver Berserker.

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,875
Sounds a little intense.

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,833
[KORO-SENSEI] I believe
his given name is Itona.

17
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,416
Ooo! Why don't we gather intel
on him for today's lesson?

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,083
[ITONA]
No need for that.

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,500
Victory's mine.

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,333
I've proven that I'm
stronger than this wall.

21
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,166
[CLASS] This guy's even
worse than the first two!

22
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,208
[SHIRO]
Apologies for startling you.

23
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,916
This is the prospective
new recruit

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,583
you were looking for, yes?

25
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,791
I bring him to you
new and improved.

26
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,041
Behold the next Demon King.

27
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
Uh! It's you!

28
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,625
[SHIRO]
We meet again, Koro-sen--

29
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,625
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yanagisawa!

30
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,750
[FUWA gasps]

31
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,833
Spoiler alert!

32
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,541
Fuwa.

33
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,125
[clears throat]

34
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,541
[SHIRO] I am Shiro a humble mage
sent by the Demon King's Army

35
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,708
to dispatch its leader.

36
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,916
Koro-sensei has an army?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
[SHIRO] To think such
a fearsome creature

38
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,833
would stoop to
teaching outcasts.

39
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,583
What a tragic waste of
your considerable gifts.

40
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,458
In fact, it's caused
quite the scandal.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,416
[KUNUDON]
Shocker!

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Big Bad Beset by Big Bongos.

43
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,500
[KORO-SENSEI]
Boobies!

44
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,958
If you could see your way clear

45
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,333
to give me a teensy-weensy
raise, I'd be most grateful.

46
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,583
[KUNUDON]
Read all about it

47
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,625
under-the-radar
rendezvous with royalty!

48
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,041
[KORO-SENSEI]
Who is saying that?

49
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,416
Wow. Way to have
integrity, Teach.

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,250
[SHIRO] I'm afraid this
string of disgraces

51
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,291
is taking a toll on your
once loyal constituents.

52
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,333
This is where Itona comes in.

53
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,000
Um, okay. He's mumbling to
himself and it's getting weird.

54
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,958
Strong, stronger. Strongest!

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,541
[BOTH gasp]

56
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,750
Wait, he's got tentacles, too?

57
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,208
[SHIRO] The Silver Berserker is
obsessed with strength, you see.

58
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,000
On his head are
grafted appendages

59
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,083
similar to your teacher's.

60
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,166
An extreme decision, to be sure,

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,625
but dedication is what
separates a Demon King

62
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,250
from washed-up has-beens.

63
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,166
I am the Demon King!

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,666
[yells]

65
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,708
[gasps]

66
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,875
Look out, sir!

67
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,833
Whoa, look at him! He's actually
matching Koro-sensei's speed!

68
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,541
[SHIRO]
That's the way, Itona.

69
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,083
Kill him good. I'm ghost.

70
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,375
[KORO-SENSEI]
Yana-- I-I mean, Shiro!

71
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't look at him, look at me!

72
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,708
Oh, no, this is bad.

73
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, but for who?

74
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,666
You don't think
Koro-sensei's met his match?

75
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,083
[FUWA]
It's not that.

76
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,458
This series is a comedy!
The show's tone just took a 180!

77
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,083
What does that even mean?

78
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,708
The concept was supposed
to be light-hearted!

79

Grow nice and big now.

Oh!

Hey, maybe we ought'a
water your chest?

[KAEDE chuckles nervously]

85
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,375
[KAEDE]
What are you implying?

86
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,541
[KAEDE]
Koro-Q!

87
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,041
You don't have what it
takes to be the Demon King.

88
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,583
The title belongs to me!

89
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,708
[KORO-SENSEI]
You really have your heart

90
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,833
set on taking my
place, don't you?

91
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,750
Don't be so
single-minded, my boy.

92
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,000
A hero casts his net wide,
becomes a jack-of-all-trades.

93
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,875
Same holds true for Demon Kings.

94
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,708
Fat lot of good the
title does anyone

95
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,166
if all we get is
bragging rights.

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,208
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,750
[KORO-SENSEI]
What indeed.

98
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,291
Making its glorious debut.

99
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,583
An E-class original production!

[BOTH] Ta-da! "Who's
Your Big Bad, One!"

When the heck did
you make that?!

102
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,708
True Big Bads, conversely
known as Demon Kings,

103
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,541
are as smart as they are strong.

104
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,375
And since we have a
challenger to the throne,

105
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,375
let's test the current ruler and
the newbie on their abilities!

106
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,791
Are you ready for
stage one? Right.

107
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,583
True villains kidnap people.

108
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,083
As a Big Bad, what would you do
if you kidnapped a princess?

109
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,958
Uh! Why am I the
princess in this?

110

[KARMA, NAKAMURA chuckling]

111

Yes! Koro-sensei?

Yes! Itona?

120
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,041
Well, I would...

121
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,708
...challenge her to a battle
and prove I'm stronger!

122
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,041
I don't wanna fight!

[KARMA]
Heh. What a joke.

124

The two of you are
completely hopeless.

125

Ooo, the Red Devil has
entered the battle!

126
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,833
Your answer, contestant three!

127
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,000
[KARMA] First off, I would
tease him mercilessly

128
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,833
about how he looks the dress.

129
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,708
You put me in this thing!

130
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,083
[dinging]

131
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,833
End round one.

Almost harvest time.

00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,541
[ISOGAI] They said we can
keep whatever we pick.

136
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,833
My family might get a
decent meal this spring.

137
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,958
[MEG] What sort of flowers
should we put in afterwards?

138
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,000
[ISOGAI] I'm thinkin' potatoes,
a few carrots, some bok choy.

139
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,291
Ooo! And maybe green beans.
And onions. I love onions.

140
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,291
Oh! There might even be
room for mustard greens!

141
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,291
[MEG]
Well, at least it's practical.

142
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,625
[MEG]
Koro-Q!

143
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,750
It's time for round two!

144
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,083
In scientific terms, the Demon
King is an apex predator.

145
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,791
We all know that those at the
top have to maintain their cool.

146
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,458
So whatever happens next,
be sure to keep a straight face!

by my bodacious bod?

You'll need these.

You need aversion therapy!

[GOOD BOYS &amp; GIRLS]
"Students On Duty"!

165
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,375
[FUWA] So the whole
point of these cutaways

166
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,000
is to make fun of us.

167

the butt of a joke.

168

the next Demon King rages on.

Tell us the one thing a true
Demon King has to be wary of!

It doesn't get much more
brutal than a Demon King.

the game's final round!

The last and most

will be a scary
no-tears face off!

which of our determined

most spine-chillingly
terrifying expression!

[KORO-SENSEI] I have a
proposition for you, Itona.

187
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,875
Once the match is done,
why not join E-class?

188
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,166
You're kidding, right?

189
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,083
I didn't come here
to join your class.

You're a gifted young man,

192
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,958
but I'm richer in experience.

193
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,000
I use that experience to teach.

194
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,833
The way to beat me isn't to
hone in on my weaknesses,

195
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,208
but to absorb my lessons!

196

Are you saying... that I'm weak?

sit on the sidelines for this?

Technically she wasn't
up for the title,

00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,375
but her evil game is strong.

She's the party member

you wouldn't wanna
meet in a dark alley.

feel bad for you,

beat this demon...

Heh.

214
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,875

like that! Itona, stop!

to join us, but to no avail.

out my stupid tentacles.
