Yeah, no.

00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,083
Right, so first off,
know that he's fast,

45
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666

[CLASS]
Is that actually a thing?

But how are we supposed
to take him on?

48
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,500
And why us in the first place?

49
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,333
[KARASUMA] Because apparently
there's only one way

to land an attack on him,

51
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,958
and I have it on good authority
that your bugs are the key.

[CLASS]
Huh?

53
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,000
[KORO-SENSEI] A bug is whatever
sets you apart from the herd.

Those little idiosyncrasies
that make you who you are.

55
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,041
Take Isogai for example.

56
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,833
His inability to buy the
back half of a suit of armor

57
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,250
is, in fact, a bug.

58
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,416
You mean it's not just because
my family's dirt poor?

[KORO-SENSEI]
Money,

60
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,041
or rather the lack
thereof in your case,

61
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,166
should not allow you to buy
only half a suit of armor.

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,666
So is me only being equipped

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,541
with plumbing
hardware a bug, too?

64
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,250
Or how my magic only
attracts actual bugs?

65
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,125
[KORO-SENSEI]
You bet'cha.

00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,750
Is it the same for my cup size?

67
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,000
And me not being able to
throw away dirty magazines?

00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,833
[KORO-SENSEI] No, those
are definitely not bugs.

If there's any hope

They will allow me
to teach E-class,

The simple answer?
It's lonely at the top.

156
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,041
Whatever. Get a load of me!

157
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,375
[GIRLS]
That's disgusting!

158
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,000
What'd I do wrong?!

159
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,583

160
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,375
Hey, Koro-sensei.
I'm ready to give it a try!

161
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,458
[chuckles]

162
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,833
[KORO-SENSEI]
Show me that bloodlust.

163
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,750
[NAGISA] We've been labeled
misfits and cast aside,

164
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,416
but for once, our
outlook is positive.

165
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,916
If we just apply ourselves,
things will change.

166
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,791
[CLASS]
Nagisa? Huh?

167
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,500
[NAGISA yells

168
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,041
[CLASS]
What the hell?

169
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,666
[KORO-SENSEI] It would appear
that Nagisa's particular bug

170
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,375
is marked by random
stat changes.

171
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,750
[NAGISA] This must be what
God-mode feels like!

172
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,583
Time to hit these slimes
with everything I've got.

173
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,291
Achievement unlocked!

174
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,333
Fire!

175
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,458
[SLIME KUNUDON ARMY screams]

176
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,625
Yes! I am now
conqueror of slime!

177
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,375
[CLASS]
What kind of magic was that?!

178
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,458
Nagisa's leading by example
to help us crush our foes!

179
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,166
Yeah, with our powers combined,
they'll be toast!

180
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,708
[CLASS yells]

181
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,125
[chuckles]

182
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,625
[SLIME KUNUDON A]
Hey! Who do you think you are?!

183
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,375
[SLIME KUNUDON B]
Just kidding! Uncle! Uncle!

184
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,458
[SLIME KUNUDON C]
We're sorry!

185
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,500
We're not worthy
to lick your boots!

186
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,583
[SLIME KUNUDONS]
But just so we're clear,

187
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,750
we totally let you win!

188
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,916
[CLASS laughing]

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
Nicely done.

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,750
I'd say the dark clouds
of your "misfit mindset"

191
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,541
have finally begun to part.

192
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,083
[NAGISA]
Um, sir.

193
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,500
I was just curious when
I'd change back to normal...

194
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,958
[KORO-SENSEI screams]

195
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,833
[NAGISA]
Okay...

196
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,541
[KORO-SENSEI]
Trust me, a sauna's the best way

197
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,166
to rid your body of toxins--
and that troublesome bug.

198
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,541
But I thought our
bugs were good!

199
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,500
[splashing]

200
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,791
I haven't changed even a little!

201
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,208
[KORO-SENSEI grunting]

202
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,875
[NAGISA]
How come you're shrinking?

203
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,166
[KORO-SENSEI]
To be continued.
