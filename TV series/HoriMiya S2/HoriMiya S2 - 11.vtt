[HORI] Chocolate cake that
simply melts in your mouth.

00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:10.293
Whipped cream
that isn't too sweet.

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:12.548
Just how I like it.

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:14.510
[MIYAMURA] Now, what should
I make next year?

00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.138
Stop!
Too soon!

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.894
You're gonna eat it, right?

00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:22.275
Do you even have to ask?

00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:25.490
[HORI] It's something
that only I'll get to taste.

00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:27.536
[MIYAMURA] Have you
thought about what

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.830
you're gonna make for me?

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.959
[HORI] This is gonna be
hard to top.

00:20:31.503 --> 00:20:33.214
Look as worried and cute
as you did today,

00:20:33.297 --> 00:20:34.216
and it'll be a win.

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.761
-Heh!
-Avert your eyes!

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:37.472
I can't look at your face?!

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.646
[HORI] He put his whole heart
into that cake.

00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:42.775
And it tasted like happiness.

00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:20.554
Oh. Hi, Sawada.

00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:24.979
All the seniors
are leaving soon.

00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:26.900
[MAYA]
I know.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.739
I can't do it.

00:22:30.072 --> 00:22:32.493
Should've known since I can't
even talk to the boys in class.

00:22:32.703 --> 00:22:34.874
What an awful excuse
that is, right?

00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:37.546
I'm sorry.

00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:40.343
You were such a huge help,
but it was all for nothing.

00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.140
Hey, I can go give it to hi...

00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:45.729
[SAWADA]
That's not the issue here.

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:50.112
She wanted to
give it to him herself.

00:22:51.198 --> 00:22:53.327
What a waste
of perfectly good chocolate.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.958
But at least the shopping trip
is a nice memory.

00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.045
Thank you.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.632
Wait.

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:01.970
Then let me have the chocolate!

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:05.059
You said I could have it
if you didn't give it to him.

00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:06.813
That way, it won't go to waste.

00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:08.608
I'll eat all of it!

00:23:09.652 --> 00:23:10.654
[MAYA]
Really?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.910
Even if you hate the flavor?

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.162
[sighs]

00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:17.083
Okay.

00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:19.295
It's yours.

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:20.381
[SAWADA]
Thanks.

00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:22.468
Here.
Trade ya.

00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:24.472
I got it yesterday.

00:23:24.932 --> 00:23:25.934
For you.

00:23:27.353 --> 00:23:28.773
What do they call these gifts?

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.861
Obligatory? Or whatever.

00:23:32.322 --> 00:23:33.908
I really appreciate this.

00:23:35.036 --> 00:23:37.373
It isn't some
"obligatory chocolate," though.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.294
It's friendship chocolate.

00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:42.342
