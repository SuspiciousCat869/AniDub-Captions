WEBVTT

00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:03.674
[SAWADA] Hey, what colors
do you think

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:05.385
Hori-senpai would like best?

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:08.935
I've seen her wear red and pink
accessories before,

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:10.772
so maybe warmer colors?

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:12.859
Bound to beat something
blue or white, yeah?

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:15.907
Are you even listening?

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.495
Hello?
You in there?!

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.581
[MIYAMURA]
Go home.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:21.544
[SAWADA] If anyone knows
the answer, it's you.

00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:22.629
Please, go home.

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:23.798
[SAWADA] Why won't you
just tell me

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.050
what her favorite colors are?

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.931
Sawada, I am begging you.

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:30.394
You realize Valentine's Day
is right around the corner,

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:31.312
and I can't wrap her present

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:32.941
until I know
which color ribbon to use!

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.195
Don't ask
her boyfriend about it! Jeez!

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:36.824
It's important
for a gift's wrapping

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:38.869
to be as cute
and appealing as possible.

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:40.080
Don't you get it?

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.875
[sighing]
Well, I know it looks nice,

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.546
though it's not like
I've dwelled on it.

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:45.883
The art of gift wrap, huh?

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:46.885
[grunting]

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.556
Hold on a friggin' minute here.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.436
Are you planning to let
the shop wrap your present?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.522
Uh...

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.611
Well, what you choose
doesn't involve me.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:56.905
[MIYAMURA]
But, it's cute

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.199
and appealing
when they wrap it.

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.580
Though I'm willing
to learn your way as well.

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:03.335
Golly! I wish I knew
which one to pick!

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.007
[MIYAMURA]
Red and orange are the colors

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.011
I've found Hori
most partial to.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:09.388
-[giggles]
-See?

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:10.975
That wasn't so hard now, right?

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.269
Ooh!

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:14.440
Check out this simple
yet sweet wrapping here!

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:49.965
[indistinct chatter]

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.766
-Good morning, Sawada.
-How are you doing today?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.227
I'm okay.

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:57.564
[sighs]

00:02:58.732 --> 00:02:59.693
[gasps]

00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:01.195
[SAWADA]
Oh, right. I need to figure

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.657
where I'm gonna buy
a nice ribbon.

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:06.414
â™ª

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:10.005
[popping]

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:11.132
Kyon-Kyon!

00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:13.679
You getting Miyamura something
for Valentine's Day?

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:15.265
Actually, no.

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:17.227
But he said he's whipping up
a present up for me.

00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:18.689
-[gasps]
-Oh, then I bet

00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:20.442
you're in
for an amazing treat, Hori.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.487
His family does own
a cake shop.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:23.782
-[laughs]
-Uh-huh!

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.201
You're just receiving?

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:26.329
Well, yeah.

00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:29.168
See, I'm not all that great
at making desserts and stuff.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.337
Wow.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.798
How very selfish of you.

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:32.842
Uh!

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.596
[HORI]
I mean, mine would pale

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.600
in comparison
to his masterpieces.

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.689
And buying from a shop
that isn't his feels wrong.

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.319
Girl, you know it's the thought
that counts, right?

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:44.783
He'll be disappointed
to get diddly-squat.

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:46.369
Diddly is far better

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:48.289
than my lousy sweets,
I guarantee it.

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:50.210
Well, in Remi's opinion,

00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:52.381
he'd be happy to receive
any gift from you!

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:53.466
[chuckles]

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.011
[HORI sighs]

00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:56.848
She's underestimating

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:58.602
-how yucky that gift could be.
-The one on this page, okay?

00:03:58.686 --> 00:03:59.646
Ten-four.

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:00.815
-[both gasps]
-[HORI] What's up, you two?

00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:02.527
Oh, you know,
just shooting the breeze!

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.279
-[tittering]
-You over here for class, or?

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:06.492
I had a little business
to handle with Miyamura.

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:07.745
It's almost time!

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.081
And I'm as ready as ever!

00:04:09.373 --> 00:04:11.168
This year,
I'll pull out all the stops!

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.212
What "stops?"

00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.718
Miyamura and I had
a long talk about what kind...

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.095
-[mumbles]
-Come on, Sawada.

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.472
Don't wanna be late
for class, right?

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:18.517
-[SAWADA growls]
-Let's go.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.186
I'll look like a total loser
if she finds out

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.648
I'm stressing
over the gift wrap!

00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:24.028
-[SAWADA screams]
-Any idea what that was about?

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.321
None.

00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:27.325
Jeez!

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.081
Would it kill him to empathize
with me just a little?

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:31.375
[groans]

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:33.505
That memory's gonna tick
me off for weeks!

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:35.049
[MAYA]
Um. Can we talk?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.343
Uh.

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:38.347
I guess.

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:39.934
Uh...

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:42.397
Aren't you, um,
really good friends

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:44.109
with some third-year
students here?

00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:46.656
This again?

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:47.992
I'd say so.

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:49.996
But why are you asking?

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:53.002
Well, Valentine's Day
is coming up.

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:55.006
-Uh-huh.
-[MAYA] And there's this guy.

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:57.553
I'm almost positive
he's one you hang out with.

00:04:58.597 --> 00:04:59.808
Uh...

00:05:01.227 --> 00:05:02.312
Which one, though?

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:04.274
Oh. um.
Thing is...

00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:06.153
Is it Yanagi or Miyamura?

00:05:06.362 --> 00:05:08.116
Regardless,
I can pass on your gift.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.704
Um. I don't know
either of those boys.

00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:12.499
-Are they seniors?
-Huh?!

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:13.585
[buzzing]

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.796
Uh...

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.635
Is it Ishikawa?

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.429
Maybe Sengoku?

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:22.102
No. Those names
aren't ringing bells either.

00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:23.647
They aren't?

00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:26.485
Sorry, but he must be
a third-year that I don't know.

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.532
I think you do.

00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:30.326
He's the only person
in your group

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.997
who always wears
a hoodie to school.

00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:33.416
Okay.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.836
Iura's your guy.

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:37.132
Wait, that's who you meant?!

00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:38.342
[MAYA]
Oh.

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:39.721
From the way you said that,

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:41.473
I take it you have a thing
for him?

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:42.518
I'm sorry.

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:44.396
There is zero romance
between us!

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:47.485
But, wow.
This mystery man is Iura?

00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:48.780
[MAYA]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:50.701
[quivering]

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:51.828
Is this a prank?

00:05:51.912 --> 00:05:52.872
It's not.

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:54.876
He's so outgoing,
and energetic, and...

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:57.088
Oh, gosh.
I feel myself blushing.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.928
He doesn't even know I exist,
since we haven't spoken a word

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:01.932
to each other,
but, everybody loves

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:04.311
getting a Valentine's treat,
and this is my last chance

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:06.023
since he's about to graduate!

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:07.902
Jeez.
Calm down, I get it.

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:09.029
Deep breaths.

00:06:09.614 --> 00:06:10.824
[MAYA] I'm worried
he won't accept it

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.160
if he has a girlfriend.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.122
[SAWADA]
He doesn't, so don't.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.333
[MAYA]
You sound pretty sure!

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:16.836
What if they're keeping
it low-key?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.964
[SAWADA]
There's no way.

00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:19.132
You should make a move.

00:06:19.216 --> 00:06:20.218
Ask him out.

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:22.598
No! I just wanna give him
some chocolate!

00:06:22.723 --> 00:06:24.142
That's all it is.

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:26.564
Dating him isn't my goal.

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:28.025
[SAWADA]
Uh...

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:29.069
[sighs]

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:30.990
This is great.

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.413
I've wanted to talk to someone
about this for a while.

00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.503
None of our classmates
would know who he is, though.

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:38.964
Huh.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.383
Didn't think I'd get

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.345
so flustered
from saying it out loud.

00:06:42.763 --> 00:06:43.765
I...

00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:46.270
I'll listen if you need me
to, you know...

00:06:46.353 --> 00:06:48.357
Since I can't really
help you out beyond that.

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:50.403
If it's okay, could you ask him

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.198
what kind of chocolate
he likes for me, please?

00:06:52.575 --> 00:06:53.535
Uh...

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:56.165
You really wanna give some
sugar without getting any back?

00:06:56.373 --> 00:06:57.292
Mm.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.377
Uh.

00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:00.841
[SAWADA]
So you admire him from afar.

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:03.054
Yes.
That sounds about right.

00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.766
It's that time of year.

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:06.435
Store shelves
are gonna be packed

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.314
with Valentine's stuff
everywhere.

00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:09.817
I feel you, man.

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:12.155
But you're one of those guys
who's gonna be swimming

00:07:12.238 --> 00:07:14.535
in chocolate treats,
so maybe I don't feel you.

00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:16.873
You already said you did.
No take-backs.

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:19.837
[IURA] So. Any plans
for the "lovey-dovey" day?

00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:22.593
Uh. Practice tying a tie?
Yeah.

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.348
[IURA] Is that what
Miyamura's teaching you now?

[ISHIKAWA] He said
he wants to practice, too.

Ta-da!

No.
It's not appealing at all.

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:34.826
Yeah.
Ya think?

I thought I tied it the way

I'm guessing you came
for Miyamura.

-[SAWADA] N-No.
-Oh, hey, Sawada.

-Huh? Mm.

here for... you, Iura.

Me? Really?

00:07:57.162 --> 00:07:58.205
What's up, dudette?

00:07:58.289 --> 00:07:59.291
[SAWADA]
Um.

00:07:59.374 --> 00:08:02.005
Do you like chocolate, or no?

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:04.301
[lightning zapping]

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:05.804
Ahh!

C-Could it be?

Yes. I like chocolate.

00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:15.323
Do you have a favorite?

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:16.618
I love them all.

00:08:16.784 --> 00:08:17.828
I'll eat bitter or sweet,

no known allergies, yay!

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:20.876
Huh.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.715
Might as well skywrite
how desperate you are, Shu.

00:08:23.924 --> 00:08:25.802
So, yeah!
Any kinda chocolate works.

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.138
Got it.
Thanks, Iura.

-Any kind at all!

-on chocolate for Shu?
-Wait!

00:08:34.862 --> 00:08:36.699
Shock someone besides
Hori is on your list.

Hey, if you
wanna make me sweets,

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:42.503
that's your prerogative, okay?

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:43.546
[SAWADA scoffs]

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.383
What kind of warped delusion
did you invent

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:46.844
to think I'd make
sweets for you?

00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:47.930
Gah?!

00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.059
I'm going back to class.

What? She's the one

00:08:57.073 --> 00:08:58.117
-who's not making sense!
-Sawada's

-playing love games, my dude.
-You know?

-I knew that wasn't...

...what she was after.

â™ª

00:09:05.924 --> 00:09:08.012
He said it doesn't matter
what kind you get him.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:09.431
Works for me.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.437
That just means I have a lot
of options and time to choose.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.567
It'd be easier
if he narrowed it down.

00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:15.986
There are just so many!

00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:18.950
Thanks for coming to help
me pick out something.

Don't sweat it.

00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:22.206
I'm giving chocolates
to someone special, too,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.918
so I wanted to see
what they have.

00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:26.006
So you've also got
someone special?

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:27.593
Well, yes, but, it's a secret!

00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:28.678
Aww!

If I can't give this to him,

will you accept it instead?

[SAWADA]
Don't worry, you'll do it!

I know you will!

he'd be happy
to receive any gift from you.

Okay!

-what's a chocolate dessert...

could botch it?

[KONO]
Hmm...

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.742
Oh! So you decided to make
something for Miyamura, then?

00:10:21.826 --> 00:10:22.786
Hush!

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.665

Miyamura bakes,

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:32.388
so I don't want him to find out
I asked you instead.

00:10:33.474 --> 00:10:35.478
It won't be as pretty
as the store-bought stuff,

00:10:35.562 --> 00:10:38.025
and I'm sure it's gonna be
an "acquired taste" at best.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.114
But if there's anything
I can't screw up entirely.

the simplest dessert

on the planet
to a cake shop owner's son?!

As simple as possible,
but still delicious.

Whoa, too cool!

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:00.570
Our school has recipe books?

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:01.656
[KONO]
It does.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:04.077
And the ones in here
are very easy to follow.

00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.041
I would check this book out
on the regular

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:08.962
when I started learning
how to make desserts.

00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:11.717
Uh...
Chocolate desserts.

Can we watch?

00:11:39.147 --> 00:11:40.232
I kinda need space,

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:41.652
so you gotta watch
from over there.

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:43.155
[SOTA]
Is it for anything special?

00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:45.034
Well, yeah, I guess so.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.789
It's, uh,
Valentine's Day practice.

00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:50.629
It should be for Halloween
since her face is so scary.

simply melts in your mouth.

00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:10.293
Whipped cream
that isn't too sweet.

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:12.548
Just how I like it.

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:14.510
[MIYAMURA] Now, what should
I make next year?

00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:16.138
Stop!
Too soon!

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.894
You're gonna eat it, right?

00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:22.275
Do you even have to ask?

00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:25.490
[HORI] It's something
that only I'll get to taste.

00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:27.536
[MIYAMURA] Have you
thought about what

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.830
you're gonna make for me?

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.959
[HORI] This is gonna be
hard to top.

00:20:31.503 --> 00:20:33.214
Look as worried and cute
as you did today,

00:20:33.297 --> 00:20:34.216
and it'll be a win.

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.761
-Heh!
-Avert your eyes!

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:37.472
I can't look at your face?!

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.646
[HORI] He put his whole heart
into that cake.

00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:42.775
And it tasted like happiness.

00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:20.554
Oh. Hi, Sawada.

00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:24.979
All the seniors
are leaving soon.

00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:26.900
[MAYA]
I know.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.739
I can't do it.

00:22:30.072 --> 00:22:32.493
Should've known since I can't
even talk to the boys in class.

00:22:32.703 --> 00:22:34.874
What an awful excuse
that is, right?

00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:37.546
I'm sorry.

00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:40.343
You were such a huge help,
but it was all for nothing.

00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.140
Hey, I can go give it to hi...

00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:45.729
[SAWADA]
That's not the issue here.

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:50.112
She wanted to
give it to him herself.

00:22:51.198 --> 00:22:53.327
What a waste
of perfectly good chocolate.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.958
But at least the shopping trip
is a nice memory.

00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.045
Thank you.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.632
Wait.

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:01.970
Then let me have the chocolate!

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:05.059
You said I could have it
if you didn't give it to him.

00:23:05.309 --> 00:23:06.813
That way, it won't go to waste.

00:23:07.313 --> 00:23:08.608
I'll eat all of it!

00:23:09.652 --> 00:23:10.654
[MAYA]
Really?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.910
Even if you hate the flavor?

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.162
[sighs]

00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:17.083
Okay.

00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:19.295
It's yours.

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:20.381
[SAWADA]
Thanks.

00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:22.468
Here.
Trade ya.

00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:24.472
I got it yesterday.

00:23:24.932 --> 00:23:25.934
For you.

00:23:27.353 --> 00:23:28.773
What do they call these gifts?

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.861
Obligatory? Or whatever.

00:23:32.322 --> 00:23:33.908
I really appreciate this.

00:23:35.036 --> 00:23:37.373
It isn't some
"obligatory chocolate," though.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.294
It's friendship chocolate.

00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:42.342
