00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.624
Yanagi would've hated that.

00:20:29.707 --> 00:20:31.460
So you're groping people now?

00:20:31.544 --> 00:20:33.882
[SENGOKU] Why do you pop in
at the worst possible times?

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.761
Doing a bit of roleplay, are we?

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:37.515
And Sengoku's playing
the handsy pervert.

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:38.432
Hey, now!

00:20:38.517 --> 00:20:40.103
[MIYAMURA]
What part are you playing, then?

00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:41.397
Yanagi.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.442
Throw in a setting
while you're at it!

00:20:43.527 --> 00:20:45.405
How about a train or something?

00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:48.494
If the scene's Akane
getting felt up on a train,

00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:49.914
who should I be?

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.125
[sighs]

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.962
Since it's a role you know
inside and out,

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:53.964
just be an airhead.

00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:55.926
He really called somebody
an airhead just now!

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.431
[MIYAMURA] Is the class
president bullying me?

00:20:58.515 --> 00:20:59.684
No. Calm down.

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:00.894
He's just frustrated.

00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:02.606
Wants to bridge a gap
between a friend,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.650
but is missing parts.

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:05.738
What gap?
We're all peas in a pod.

00:21:05.821 --> 00:21:07.157
But he's unsatisfied?

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:09.912
Am I the only one who thinks
we're friends?

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:12.292
[SENGOKU] This isn't about you,
and your life's not in danger,

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:13.252
so cut it out!

00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:14.171
[IURA]
Aw, come on.

00:21:14.547 --> 00:21:15.674
Don't fight, guys.

00:21:15.758 --> 00:21:17.427
[SENGOKU]
Really, people? Timing!

00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:19.347
[MIYAMURA]
The prez is being mean to me!

00:21:19.431 --> 00:21:20.517
[IURA]
You're bullying?

00:21:20.601 --> 00:21:22.813
-Say it ain't so!
-[SENGOKU] You two need to hush!

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:26.320
I really can't see Sengoku
as a bully.

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:27.238
[gasps]

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.702
[YANAGI chuckles]

00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:31.831
You take his side

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:33.585
like it's the one
with the cream.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.046
Guess I never noticed.

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:38.094
Sengoku and Yanagi
sure are good friends.

00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.306
[SENGOKU grunts]
Discretion, please?

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:41.225
Guess what?

00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:43.479
Sengoku told me
he wants to be like Shu.

00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:44.397
[YANAGI]
He did?

00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:45.609
But why?

00:21:45.692 --> 00:21:47.530
I like him just the way he is.

00:21:47.613 --> 00:21:48.447
[gasps]

00:21:48.532 --> 00:21:49.700
[IURA]
What a surprise!

00:21:49.784 --> 00:21:51.913
To walk in Shu's shoes,
I suggest you start

00:21:51.996 --> 00:21:52.832
with a new 'do--

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:54.209
[SENGOKU]
I didn't mean your looks!

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:55.712
First, you're a pervert,

00:21:55.796 --> 00:21:57.340
and now you're Iura.

00:21:57.423 --> 00:21:58.969
Talk about a busy day.

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:01.473
-Huh?
-[YANAGI, ISHIKAWA, IURA] Uh...

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:02.475
[SENGOKU yelps]

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.603
A "pervert?"

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:05.231
[SENGOKU]
No! He's confused!

00:22:05.314 --> 00:22:07.193
Meet me in the student
council room later!

00:22:07.277 --> 00:22:09.030
[MIYAMURA]
Me? Why? What did I do?

00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:11.828
-[SENGOKU] Infuriated me!
-[MIYAMURA] Wait. Why's that?

00:22:12.412 --> 00:22:14.040
You know, Miyamura and Sengoku

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:16.003
-sure have a great friendship.
-Uh-hmm.

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:17.171
[MIYAMURA]
Why's that?
