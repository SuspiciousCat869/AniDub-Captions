Where did it go?

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.310
I'm sorry
for the trouble, Ishikawa.

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:11.064
Nothing to be sorry for.

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:12.776
You're sure it dropped
over here?

[YANAGI]
Yes.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:15.907
Maybe if I'm careful,
I can help you look.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.992
[ISHIKAWA]
Or maybe not!

True.

Yanagi, what'd you do
to make Ishikawa bow down?

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.378
Hmm.

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.467
[SENGOKU] More importantly,
it's past time to leave.

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.263
So I'll tell them to go home.

what's going on.

I'm sorry, Dad.

What was the point
of that elective?

-Why?

Lemme stop you right there!

Just because I call him
by his first name

doesn't mean anything,
so don't read into it!

That's what's wrong?

if I told him
I'd like to call him Akane?

I would guess slim to none.

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.935
Hori, may I please
have a cookie?

00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:49.229
[HORI]
Of course!

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:50.899
[YANAGI]
Much obliged.

00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:56.160
[FEMALE TEACHER 208A] I've been
informed certain students

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.247
have been skipping
elective classes,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.794
because they're frequently used
as study halls.

00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:02.798
An utter and tragic waste.

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.342
This vital time
in your education

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:05.804
should be spent wisely.

00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:06.806
-[thuds]
-Therefore,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.436
I won't permit tardiness
from class three-six!

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.524
All students are to be
on time next week!

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:12.442
Are we clear?

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:14.739
[STUDENTS]
Yes.

â™ª

00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:20.458
Sengoku's texts are weird.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.836
Sometimes
I find myself wondering,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.172
"Did he really send this?"

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.299
[MIYAMURA, ISHIKAWA]
Yeah, I get that.

00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:27.388
What are you saying?
I send perfectly normal texts!

00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:28.432
[HORI]
Maybe at first.

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:30.812
[ISHIKAWA]
They do start off normal enough.

00:08:34.612 --> 00:08:36.908
Gotta maintain some sense
of shame when you text.

00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:38.703
[SENGOKU] Don't reveal those
to the public.

00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:40.289
[ISHIKAWA]
You aren't the only one.

00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:43.505
Miyamura's texts occasionally
sound like a girl typed them.

00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:45.091
[MIYAMURA]
That's news to me.

00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:47.345
-[thuds]
-Back me up here, Yana-- Oh.

[smoke sizzling]

00:08:49.934 --> 00:08:51.353
Holy crap.

00:08:51.436 --> 00:08:52.898
Uh, dude, was that the sound
of your head

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:54.067
-colliding with the desk?
-[YANAGI] Huh?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.779
[YANAGI]
What makes you think that?

00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:58.618
Why on earth would I hit my head
on the desk?

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:01.123
[ISHIKAWA]
Those are some bleary eyes.

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:03.460
[SENGOKU]
Yanagi, are you tired?

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:04.755
A rough night's sleep?

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:06.843
-Anxious thoughts?
-[YANAGI] Well,

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.347
actually, since you asked...

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:14.609
You can't be late for a week?

00:09:14.692 --> 00:09:16.821
A campaign to end all tardiness.

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:18.742
Makes it sound
like a heroic journey.

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:19.785
I don't see how.

00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:21.204
I have trouble waking up.

00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:23.626
And stressing about this rule
makes it hard to sleep.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.714
If I'm tardy even once,

00:09:25.797 --> 00:09:28.427
they'll display my name
and photo for the entire school.

00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:29.889
[ALL]
Whoa. That's harsh.

00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:32.393
[SENGOKU]
Yanagi is tardy quite a bit.

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:33.563
Go to bed early.

00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:36.485
Well, I tried that,
but woke up at odd hours,

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:37.654
so I still felt tired.

00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:39.784
Yeah, it's a vicious cycle.

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:41.996
We just have
two more days left, though!

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.625
-I'll tough it out!
-Cool.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.587
As long as your alarm's set,
you'll be golden.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.714
[YANAGI]
That's right!

00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:48.092
Even set a backup alarm

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:50.012
in case the first one
didn't cut it.

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:51.223
Oh.

00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:53.561
I guess I should say
I was setting a backup.

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:56.108
It stopped yesterday
and I barely made it in time.

00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:57.026
[ISHIKAWA]
Dead battery?

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.195
I wish.

00:09:58.278 --> 00:10:00.366
I found it broken on the floor
next to my bed.

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:03.414
-Like, beyond repair.
-[ISHIKAWA] Okay?

00:10:03.497 --> 00:10:05.794
[YANAGI] I don't think
I remember moving it at all.

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:08.508
But it was just lying there
when I got home from school.

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:09.593
[gasps]

00:10:11.054 --> 00:10:13.475
[YANAGI]
My bed was a mess as well.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.064
But my parents said
they hadn't gone near my room.

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.526
I don't know what's going on,

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:19.822
but it's strange
and, well, scary.

00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:21.408
Uh-huh.

00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:22.870
[YANAGI]
Oh, but I digress.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:24.832
None of you care about that.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:26.794
Yes, we do. Go on.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.675
That does sound scary.

00:10:29.758 --> 00:10:30.594
I know you aren't hurt,

00:10:30.677 --> 00:10:31.846
but shouldn't you
be more concerned?

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:34.058
Carry some salt with you
everywhere you go!

00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:35.227
Wait, why salt?

00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:36.606
So when you can't wake up,

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:38.317
is it due to sleep paralysis,
or what?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.360
[ISHIKAWA gasps]

00:10:39.444 --> 00:10:40.614
[laughs]

00:10:40.697 --> 00:10:42.576
I just oversleep out of habit.

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:44.078
[ALL]
Oh.

00:10:44.162 --> 00:10:46.458
And your sleepy self is
down an alarm clock.

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.212
Will one be enough
to do the job?

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:49.339
[YANAGI]
Hmm.

00:10:49.422 --> 00:10:51.677
What if I gave you
a wake-up call?

00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:52.638
[YANAGI]
Huh?

00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:54.140
[ISHIKAWA]
Yeah! Good idea!

00:10:54.224 --> 00:10:55.769
[MIYAMURA] You should
still set your alarm clock,

00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:56.938
to be on the safe side.

00:10:57.021 --> 00:10:58.482
But I'll ring your cell
tomorrow morning

00:10:58.566 --> 00:10:59.944
and make sure
that you get out of bed.

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:00.862
[YANAGI]
Uh.

00:11:00.946 --> 00:11:02.783
And you send him a text.
Do it for the lulz.

00:11:02.866 --> 00:11:04.285
[SENGOKU]
I'd rather call like Miyamura

00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:05.997
if you're just gonna tease me
about the text!

00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.001
But Yanagi needs your text,
prez.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.547
Calls work, too.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.132
The thought of you all
calling that early

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.385
when I don't do mornings--

00:11:12.468 --> 00:11:14.598
You have full permission
to hang up without talking.

00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:16.309
Waking you up is what matters.

00:11:16.393 --> 00:11:18.480
I apologize in advance!

00:11:18.565 --> 00:11:20.944

No, but thank you.

00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:23.391
[groaning]

00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:25.103
[YANAGI]
The damage is done!

00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:26.982
Huh?

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:27.984
[gasps]

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:29.403
[ISHIKAWA]
That's some aura!

00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:31.992
Wonder why mister doom-and-gloom
is so down in the dumps.

00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:33.411
What's the matter?

00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:35.040
Well? I'm all ears, pal!

00:14:35.123 --> 00:14:36.250
Gimme them details!

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.963
Go on and
get it off of that chest!

00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:40.175
Then shake 'til you feel better!

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:41.344
[SENGOKU]
Up yours.

00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:43.849
-[gasps]
-[ISHIKAWA] Sengoku!

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:46.104
Okay, that's on Shu
for being a pest.

00:14:46.187 --> 00:14:47.607
I'm a lovable goofball!

00:14:47.691 --> 00:14:49.485
Did you and your girl
have an argument?

00:14:50.905 --> 00:14:51.865
[SENGOKU]
Rejection.

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:54.370
[ISHIKAWA] Shu!
He says Ayasaki's single now!

00:14:54.453 --> 00:14:55.957
-[gasps]
-No, I did not!

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.502
We're still dating!

00:14:58.003 --> 00:15:00.173
[ISHIKAWA]
So Yanagi rejected you.

00:15:00.257 --> 00:15:01.760
And here I thought
you were tight.

00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:03.054
He said he's polite with me

00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:05.518
because he has zero intentions
of getting any closer.

00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:07.354
That's why he's polite?

00:15:07.438 --> 00:15:08.273
Oh.

00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:10.903
[ISHIKAWA] You want half
of this chocolate danish thing?

00:15:10.987 --> 00:15:12.615
[YANAGI]
Sure. How kind.

00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:14.160
[ISHIKAWA]
I can't finish it on my own.

00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:16.330
[YANAGI]
So it's a danish?

00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:18.334
[ISHIKAWA]
A really sweet danish.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.213
All that chocolate gave me
heartburn.

00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:22.384
-You like it?
-Uh-huh.

00:15:22.468 --> 00:15:23.929
It's yummy.

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:26.894
Oh. Cool deal.

00:15:26.977 --> 00:15:29.106
Just, um, pace yourself, 'kay?

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:30.777
Roger.

00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:33.532
[scoffs]

00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:35.745
[SENGOKU] Stop smirking
like you beat me at something.

00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:36.914
[IURA]
And you stop acting

00:15:36.997 --> 00:15:39.503
like you're the only one
that he's overly formal with.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.255
What Shu said. It's no biggie.

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:43.009
[SENGOKU]
I know, but still.

00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.763
[ISHIKAWA]
The prez, Ayasaki.

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:47.267
Everyone and their grandmother
likes Yanagi.

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.313
Okay, I won't let it bother me.

00:15:49.396 --> 00:15:52.152
I'll treat him the same way
that I always have.

00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:53.154
[sighs]

00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:54.991
Stuck in the friend zone.

00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:57.664
You know what it means to be
"out" of the friend zone, right?

00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:00.168
â™ª

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:04.385
Huh?

00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:05.345
[sighs]

00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:06.890
-Uh, Sengoku.
-[gasps]

00:16:06.974 --> 00:16:08.393
[thuds]

00:16:09.145 --> 00:16:10.272
[YANAGI]
S-sorry.

00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:11.650
-Please forgive me!
-[SENGOKU chuckles]

00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.111
I assure you it's okay.

00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:14.781
As long as it quenches
my thirst.

00:16:15.448 --> 00:16:16.284
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:17.787
[YANAGI]
I don't think it did.

00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:20.167
You know,
if it tastes too strong,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.047
I wouldn't mind drinking
it in your stead, so--

00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:25.678
I'll snag you another drink
real quick-like.

00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:27.682
-It'll def taste better!
-Thank you.

00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:30.353
-But only if you really want to.
-[YANAGI] Totes!

00:16:30.437 --> 00:16:31.272
Uh...

00:16:32.734 --> 00:16:34.946
[electronic dings, thuds]

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.744
Here you- I mean, trade ya.

00:16:37.827 --> 00:16:39.121
Cool deal?

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:40.833
Uh, yeah. That's great.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.589
Lots of kids in my class
don't like this juice.

00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:46.553
I've heard its flavor can
be best described as "sucky."

00:16:47.597 --> 00:16:50.435
[SENGOKU] Is he trying
to be more casual with me?

00:16:51.312 --> 00:16:52.690
[SENGOKU]
Hey, listen.

00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:55.445
Talk to me however you prefer.

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:58.451
Don't force yourself
to use slang and stuff.

00:16:58.535 --> 00:17:00.205
But, I um--

00:17:00.288 --> 00:17:02.710
Right! Yes! Ten-Four!

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:07.302
All right.

00:17:07.386 --> 00:17:08.555
Glad you understand.

00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:13.732
[ISHIKAWA]
Sengoku's creepin' me out.

00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:15.235
Oh! How come?

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:16.863
Because of that big, dopey grin?

00:17:16.947 --> 00:17:19.118
Holy cow! That is really creepy!

00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:20.161
[slaps]

00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:21.748
The creep slapped me!

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.086
[ISHIKAWA] Sengoku's
a pretty straightforward guy.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.090
He probably made up with Yanagi.

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:31.100
Yay! Yanagin's here!

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:33.606
Where is he heading to, though?

00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:35.025
I'm returning to the classroom.

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:36.695
Remi won't let you
take another step

00:17:36.778 --> 00:17:38.406
until you talk more casually!

00:17:38.489 --> 00:17:40.745
-[laughs]
-Aw! Don't laugh me off!

00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:42.456
[YANAGI]
If only Sengoku were as blunt

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.376
as Ayasaki when he spoke.

00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:46.965
Yay! Yanagin's here!

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:48.384
Where's he headed to, though?

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:50.765
You're stuffier
than a box of tissues!

00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:53.394
We're friends, aren't we?
Talk casually!

00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:54.606
[YANAGI]
No.

00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:56.484
That would just be an imposter!

00:17:56.568 --> 00:17:57.987
You look like you're gonna cry.

00:17:58.071 --> 00:17:59.532
What's wrong, huh?

00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:02.037
[school bell ringing]

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.379
-I kid you not.
-[BOTH laughing]

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:10.387
Right. You ready for this, Iura?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.391
Yea-yuh! Don't hold back!

00:18:12.474 --> 00:18:13.476
'Cause I sure won't!

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.480
-[ISHIKAWA] Huh?
-[YANAGI] Here I go!

00:18:15.564 --> 00:18:16.858
-[hits]
-[IURA groans]

00:18:16.942 --> 00:18:18.486
The heck is this game?

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.825
He said he could catch a blade
with his hands.

00:18:20.908 --> 00:18:22.662
Since I thought
it was a bold claim,

00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:23.997
I asked for a demonstration.

00:18:24.081 --> 00:18:24.999
Which he then failed.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:29.049
Man! I so would've caught it
if it had been a katana!

00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:31.387
You would make a murderer
of our sweet Yanagi?

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.640
[laughs]

00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:34.686
Tell Shu how nuts he is.

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:35.730
I wonder.

00:18:36.272 --> 00:18:38.652
Suppose I took a page
out of Iura's book,

00:18:38.735 --> 00:18:40.865
and said I could catch
a blade with my hands.

00:18:40.948 --> 00:18:43.746
would Yanagi have asked me
to demonstrate my skills, too?

00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:46.083
Um, hard to say.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.670
The people he's drawn to.

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:50.175
[IURA, [YOSHIKAWA]]
Ah-ha-ha! Ah-ha-ha!

00:18:50.258 --> 00:18:51.511
[SENGOKU]
They tend to possess

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:53.515
rather cheerful demeanors,
don't they?

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.895
[ISHIKAWA] You mean
airheads like Yoshikawa?

00:18:56.187 --> 00:18:57.022
[SENGOKU]
If air--

00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:58.817
Cheerful people are easier
for him

00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:01.238
to get along with,
I don't stand a chance.

00:19:01.322 --> 00:19:03.201
Just embrace
your inner airheadedness.

00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:05.455
When I saw Yoshikawa
the other day,

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:08.169
And he's not even
listening to me.

00:19:09.923 --> 00:19:11.425
[SENGOKU]
Oh. Where's she going?

00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:12.929
-[thuds]
-[YOSHIKAWA groans]

00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:15.058
Oh, I'm so sorry!

00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:18.105
She mistook the wall
for a person and apologized?

00:19:18.189 --> 00:19:19.274
Well, I've done that.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.694
Oh, but wait, there's more.

00:19:20.778 --> 00:19:22.113

[grunting]

00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:25.078
[SENGOKU]
Yes.

00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:27.583
She glared daggers
at the wall she bumped into.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.506
I will never be anything
like Yoshikawa.

00:19:30.589 --> 00:19:31.675
[ISHIKAWA]
Me either.

00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:32.927
-Hi-yah!
-Okay!

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.096
[IURA]
But how?

00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:36.183
Shu might be the type of person
to imitate

00:19:36.267 --> 00:19:37.435
if you wanna act friendlier,
dude.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.354
[gasps]

00:19:38.437 --> 00:19:39.941
Imitate Iura?

00:19:40.024 --> 00:19:42.195
I'd compromise far too much,
so no.

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:43.406
[ISHIKAWA]
Better him than the girl

00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:44.951
who glares at walls.

I'll show you how it's done,
okay?

00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:47.707
Hang tight and watch.

-[ISHIKAWA] Yanagi!
-That's me.

on the soles of his feet, too!

No way!

Nope! Nuh-uh!
Not a chance! Never!

-[ISHIKAWA] Idiot!

00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:02.319
That kind of talk
won't get you anywhere!

You're better friends
than you used to be.

and tickle that man!

All right!

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:09.124
I have to practice
before the real thing, though!

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:11.963
You're seriously practicing
for a tickle fight right now?

00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:13.967
[SENGOKU]
There.

00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:16.430
[yelps] I feel violated
from how sensual that was!

00:20:16.514 --> 00:20:17.642
-Huh?
-Yo.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:19.269
That took me
by complete surprise!

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:20.355
Keep it rated G!

00:20:20.438 --> 00:20:21.816
I don't know what I did.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.612
Or why you're angry with me.

00:20:23.695 --> 00:20:26.033
What you did
is called "a grope."

00:20:26.116 --> 00:20:27.787
[SENGOKU]
Thank goodness I practiced.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.624
Yanagi would've hated that.

00:20:29.707 --> 00:20:31.460
So you're groping people now?

00:20:31.544 --> 00:20:33.882
[SENGOKU] Why do you pop in
at the worst possible times?

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.761
Doing a bit of roleplay, are we?

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:37.515
And Sengoku's playing
the handsy pervert.

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:38.432
Hey, now!

00:20:38.517 --> 00:20:40.103
[MIYAMURA]
What part are you playing, then?

00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:41.397
Yanagi.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.442
Throw in a setting
while you're at it!

00:20:43.527 --> 00:20:45.405
How about a train or something?

00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:48.494
If the scene's Akane
getting felt up on a train,

00:20:48.578 --> 00:20:49.914
who should I be?

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.125
[sighs]

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.962
Since it's a role you know
inside and out,

00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:53.964
just be an airhead.

00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:55.926
He really called somebody
an airhead just now!

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.431
[MIYAMURA] Is the class
president bullying me?

00:20:58.515 --> 00:20:59.684
No. Calm down.

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:00.894
He's just frustrated.

00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:02.606
Wants to bridge a gap
between a friend,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.650
but is missing parts.

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:05.738
What gap?
We're all peas in a pod.

00:21:05.821 --> 00:21:07.157
But he's unsatisfied?

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:09.912
Am I the only one who thinks
we're friends?

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:12.292
[SENGOKU] This isn't about you,
and your life's not in danger,

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:13.252
so cut it out!

00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:14.171
[IURA]
Aw, come on.

00:21:14.547 --> 00:21:15.674
Don't fight, guys.

00:21:15.758 --> 00:21:17.427
[SENGOKU]
Really, people? Timing!

00:21:17.511 --> 00:21:19.347
[MIYAMURA]
The prez is being mean to me!

00:21:19.431 --> 00:21:20.517
[IURA]
You're bullying?

00:21:20.601 --> 00:21:22.813
-Say it ain't so!
-[SENGOKU] You two need to hush!

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:26.320
I really can't see Sengoku
as a bully.

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:27.238
[gasps]

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.702
[YANAGI chuckles]

00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:31.831
You take his side

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:33.585
like it's the one
with the cream.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.046
Guess I never noticed.

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:38.094
Sengoku and Yanagi
sure are good friends.

00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.306
[SENGOKU grunts]
Discretion, please?

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:41.225
Guess what?

00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:43.479
Sengoku told me
he wants to be like Shu.

00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:44.397
[YANAGI]
He did?

00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:45.609
But why?

00:21:45.692 --> 00:21:47.530
I like him just the way he is.

00:21:47.613 --> 00:21:48.447
[gasps]

00:21:48.532 --> 00:21:49.700
[IURA]
What a surprise!

00:21:49.784 --> 00:21:51.913
To walk in Shu's shoes,
I suggest you start

00:21:51.996 --> 00:21:52.832
with a new 'do--

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:54.209
[SENGOKU]
I didn't mean your looks!

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:55.712
First, you're a pervert,

00:21:55.796 --> 00:21:57.340
and now you're Iura.

00:21:57.423 --> 00:21:58.969
Talk about a busy day.

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:01.473
-Huh?
-[YANAGI, ISHIKAWA, IURA] Uh...

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:02.475
[SENGOKU yelps]

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.603
A "pervert?"

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:05.231
[SENGOKU]
No! He's confused!

00:22:05.314 --> 00:22:07.193
Meet me in the student
council room later!

00:22:07.277 --> 00:22:09.030
[MIYAMURA]
Me? Why? What did I do?

00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:11.828
-[SENGOKU] Infuriated me!
-[MIYAMURA] Wait. Why's that?

00:22:12.412 --> 00:22:14.040
You know, Miyamura and Sengoku

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:16.003
-sure have a great friendship.
-Uh-hmm.

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:17.171
[MIYAMURA]
Why's that?
