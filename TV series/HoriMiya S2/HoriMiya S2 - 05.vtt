00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:17.536
and less obnoxious.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.416
Oh, I was only half-listening
to you.

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:23.088
Could you, um, repeat that?

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:24.382
Uh-huh.

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:29.351
-[MOTOKO] Don't come in again!
-[IURA] Moto.

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:31.648
That's a shared living space,
you know?

00:08:35.238 --> 00:08:36.658
[MOTOKO]
This stinks.

00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:39.872
I thought I understood Kitahara,
but now I'm not so sure.

00:08:40.414 --> 00:08:42.628
That's one puzzle
I can't solve either.

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:45.884
Like, I would even argue that
I'm more confused than you are.

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:47.721
How can you sit there
and claim you're confused

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:49.266
when you're the whole root
of the issue?

00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:51.103
Are you really so oblivious
you can't see

00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:52.523
that all of this is your fault?

00:08:52.606 --> 00:08:55.403
Huh? You're pinning this on me?

00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:56.906
Got some seaweed in your brain?

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.950
You're the blockhead

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:00.162
who won't acknowledge their
past actions, you algae ball!

00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:01.916
What? "Algae ball?"

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.133
Give me back the Kitahara
I used to know!

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:08.638
-[cries]
-I, um, I'm sorry?

00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:10.308
Talk to me, sis.

00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:12.186
Do you not like the kid anymore?

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.274
It would be easier
if that were true.

00:09:14.357 --> 00:09:16.069
He and I are still friends,

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:18.490
so we chat pretty much
on a daily basis.

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:21.288
But, it's like he loses interest
when we talk.

00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:22.791
He's after something else.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:25.296
Oh, such sad eyes.

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:26.799
'Cause, agh!

00:09:26.883 --> 00:09:29.638
I get the feeling he's just
using me as a stand-in for you

00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:31.183
'cause we look so much alike!

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.563
[IURA] Has he seriously strayed
so far in your mind?

00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:34.565
Shut up!

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:36.819
This wouldn't be half as bad
if I'd been born cuter,

00:09:36.903 --> 00:09:38.197
but, instead,
I have the misfortune

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.784
of looking like your equally
unattractive twin!

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:41.579
You take that back and apologize
to Mom right now!

00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:43.207
Also, take a look in the mirror!

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.669
'Cause we're very attractive!

00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:47.298
At school, I'm constantly
getting told how cute I am!

00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:48.593
[MOTOKO]
Liar!

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:50.388
Then you should have
a harem of girlfriends,

00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:51.849
but you don't even have one!

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:53.937
[IURA]
Who said anything about a harem?

00:09:54.772 --> 00:09:56.358
[ISHIKAWA]
What kinda question is that?

00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:01.243
Most guys say, "What's up?"
when they bump into a bro,

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:03.455
but I get, "Am I cute?"

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.794
-You hit your head?
-Not lately, no.

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:07.673
[ISHIKAWA]
Skeptical.

00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:09.384
It's not about me.

00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:12.850
Motoko doesn't think she's cute
because of how identical we are.

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.396
Whaat?
Your sister's pure adorable!

00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:17.024
I'm feeling better already!

00:10:17.108 --> 00:10:18.068
Thank ya, Hori!

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.489
[HORI] I was complimenting her,
not you.

00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:23.162
What about a longer hairstyle?

00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:24.749
For me?

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.919
[ISHIKAWA]
Dude, no. Your sister.

00:10:27.003 --> 00:10:29.382
A new 'do might bring out
her confidence.

00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:33.641
Nah, her hair gets real unruly,
so she refuses to grow it out.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:37.398
Well, her shorter hairstyle's
totally cute if you ask me.

00:10:37.482 --> 00:10:39.653
You wouldn't be talking
about me, would you?

00:10:39.737 --> 00:10:40.947
Or me?

00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:42.492
[HORI]
That's sure a confident grin.

00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:44.412
Considering I said "her."

00:10:44.496 --> 00:10:45.498
-[chuckles]
-Meh.

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:47.920
I guess hair's
a sensitive subject, huh?

00:10:48.003 --> 00:10:49.840
And while she does resemble you,

00:10:49.924 --> 00:10:51.511
your sister's cuter, hands down.

00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:53.138
Am I ugly?

00:10:53.222 --> 00:10:55.434
Motoko's the focus right now,
not you.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:58.148
Well, it's probably
just a puberty thing.

00:10:58.232 --> 00:11:00.695
You should enjoy the time
she has before she's in heat.

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:03.450
I hope you're not suggesting
my sister is a dog.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:06.039
Yeah, um, humans don't go
into heat, dude.

00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:07.668
I aced health class, so.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.670
Makes sense!

00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:11.174
We probably wouldn't have that
declining birth rate dilemma

00:11:11.258 --> 00:11:12.719
if we did!

00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:15.182
[HORI]
This is a dumb conversation.

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.186
Yo, I'm going through puberty
as we speak!

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.731
If you were actually
going through puberty,

00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.694
you wouldn't proudly declare it
to the world!

00:11:20.777 --> 00:11:21.821
[MIYAMURA]
Then you'll be in heat

00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:23.533
before you know it, Yoshikawa.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.829
[YOSHIKAWA]
Which is fine by me!

00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:28.000
[IURA] I'm starting to wonder
if puberty's responsible

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.589
for the weird stuff
Motoko's been saying.

00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:31.674
Define "weird."

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:35.180
She told me to stop flirting
and just hook up with Sengoku.

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:36.642
[all shocked]

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.480
[IURA]
And every time she hears me

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.067
get a message from you
or Miyamura,

00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:43.280
she asks, "Is it from a girl?"

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:44.449
[scoffs]

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:46.996
It sounds like she doesn't
realize Sengoku's a guy!

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:48.541
Or she might just
be messing with you.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.210
[IURA]
It's possible.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.633
I think Ayasaki
is more attractive

00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:54.052
than Sengoku, though.

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.431
[ISHIKAWA] Yeah, from what
I know about you, you would.

00:11:56.724 --> 00:11:58.978
You know,
speaking of love interests,

00:11:59.062 --> 00:12:00.899
her crush was
all Motoko could talk about

00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:02.234
when she came over.

00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:03.988
So if she's feeling unpretty,

00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:07.704
it could just be
misplaced frustration?

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:10.710
[IURA] It's funny
you mention her crush.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:14.425
Because the person Moto likes
appears to like me.

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.514
[all speechless]

00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:20.855
So, Motoko bats for the ladies?

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:22.358
No, that's not it.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.362
Does this diagram explain it?

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:26.241
It seems kinda hard to believe.

00:12:26.324 --> 00:12:28.746
[IURA]
Yep, that about sums it up.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.249
It is hard to believe.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.420
[YOSHIKAWA]
I feel sorry for Motoko.

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:33.130
[IURA]
Not me?

00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:35.217
[HORI] She'll never be able
to rest in peace.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.764
Please don't kill off my sister!
Okay, Hori?

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:39.601
And it's not like I stole him!

00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:41.856
Sorry, but that qualifies
as theft in my book.

00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:43.860
[IURA] I wanted nothing to do
with this relationship

00:12:43.943 --> 00:12:45.530
from the get-go, I swear!

00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.619
I'm a twenty-four-seven
ladies' man!

00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:49.872
[ISHIKAWA]
That sentence out of context

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:52.544
will get you in a different kind
of trouble.

00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:54.422
And before we forget,

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.301
wanna share how you feel
about the prez?

00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:58.388
[IURA] Not sure why
this is a misunderstanding,

00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:00.058
but if you must know,

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:01.645
I clearly like Sengoku!

00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:02.689
[speechless]

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.528
[IURA]
Uh, hey, prez!

00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:08.200
So Iura likes both ladies
and Sengoku?

00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:10.872
Oh, wow.
This is getting so complex!

00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:12.333
Just drama, drama, drama!

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:13.628
[IURA]
It is not!

00:13:13.711 --> 00:13:16.049
You're the only ones
making it complex!

00:13:17.636 --> 00:13:18.763
My apologies!

00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:20.057
[IURA]
Stop, Sengoku.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.560
You'll wound me.

00:13:21.644 --> 00:13:22.813
Get a girlfriend,

00:13:22.896 --> 00:13:24.691
and all misunderstandings
go away.

00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:25.610
Sure.

00:13:25.693 --> 00:13:27.823
I'll go and "get one"
from the store.

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:30.202
Will a woman
made entirely out of plastic

00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:32.081
be able to love me?

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:34.628
[HORI] Is there an actual person
you're into?

00:13:34.711 --> 00:13:36.966
[YOSHIKAWA] Someone
in your class you see every day?

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.093
[IURA]
Nah.

00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:39.930
Not now, at least.

00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:42.476
[ISHIKAWA]
He almost seems normal for once.

00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:44.773
Um, I'm lost.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:45.984
Same.

00:13:51.244 --> 00:13:52.581
You feeling sick?

00:13:52.664 --> 00:13:54.500
Or just feel like
skipping school?

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:57.214
[birds chirp]

00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:00.722
[screams]

00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:02.893
[MOTOKO]
For the record, I came in

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:04.980
and tried to wake you up
once before.

00:14:05.063 --> 00:14:06.482
[IURA]
Did you really?

00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:08.486
Was I simply dead to the world?

00:14:08.571 --> 00:14:10.407
You said, "I know,"
and pulled the covers

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.577
right back over your head.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.455
[IURA] That means
I didn't get the memo!

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:15.459
Um, you gonna eat
some breakfast?

00:14:15.543 --> 00:14:18.256
[IURA] And wind up later
than I already am?

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:20.887
[MOTOKO] You need to eat
at least a slice of toast.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.972
Mom's orders.

00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:23.809
I'll dine and dash.

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:25.813
You should be making your way
to school, too.

00:14:25.897 --> 00:14:26.941
[MOTOKO]
I will.

00:14:28.026 --> 00:14:29.362
And have a good day!

00:14:31.407 --> 00:14:32.869
[MOTOKO]
It's my first time seeing

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:36.000
someone actually run to school
with toast in their mouth.

00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:41.929
[IURA]
Sprinting, while eating bread.

00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:44.266
Dries your mouth out like crazy!

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.563
I can't eat and run
at the same time!

00:14:49.193 --> 00:14:50.487
Walking it is.

00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:56.625
[YOSHIKAWA]
I'm late, I'm late!

00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:58.461
-[gasps]
-[bumps]

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:00.508
I just experienced

00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:02.512
the bump-into-a-boy-with-toast
in-your-mouth-trope,

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:03.346
so there's a decent chance

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.810
he's a super hot
transfer student!

00:15:05.893 --> 00:15:07.104
Hey, Yoshikawa?

00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:08.983
You know that I can hear you,
right?

00:15:09.066 --> 00:15:10.277
"I" being Iura.

00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:12.782
[glass shatters]

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.623
Fancy running into you here.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.834
Good morning.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.253
Is it, though?

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:22.176
-I take it you overslept, too?
-Uh-huh.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:24.013
I should've gone to bed
way earlier.

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:25.432
Doubt we'd make it
even if we ran,

00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:26.560
so let's just walk.

00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:30.317
[ISHIKAWA]
I'm late, I'm late!

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.653
[gasps] What?

00:15:31.737 --> 00:15:32.947
Are you guys on a stroll?

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:34.701
You're both as late as I am!

00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:36.872
[IURA]
Says you with your onigiri.

00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:40.462
We woefully realized
we'll be late no matter what.

00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:42.424
Man, now I'm woeful, too.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:44.596
-Flavor? Sad.
-It only has salt.

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:47.351
[MIYAMURA]
I'm late! I'm late!

00:15:47.434 --> 00:15:49.105
What are the three of you doing?

00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:50.608
We all need to hurry!

00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:52.612
[ISHIKAWA] Then why'd you stop
at the store?

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:55.325
-Flavor?
-It's a meat bun.

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:56.703
All of you yelled
about being late,

00:15:56.787 --> 00:15:58.707
as if shouting
it would up your speed.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:15:59.626
True.

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.880
[MIYAMURA]
Is there morning assembly today?

00:16:01.964 --> 00:16:03.091
[YOSHIKAWA]
Nope.

00:16:03.174 --> 00:16:04.761
[ISHIKAWA]
Let's take our time, then.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.606
[all confused]

00:16:11.942 --> 00:16:12.944
Oh, hey.

00:16:13.027 --> 00:16:14.280
You're here bright and early.

00:16:14.363 --> 00:16:15.240
Good morning.

00:16:15.323 --> 00:16:16.242
-What?
-I can't believe

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:18.706
-what I'm seeing!
-The Sengoku is late?

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:21.252
-That never happens!
-[SENGOKU] Um.

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:24.216
We third-years only have classes
in the afternoon today.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.262
I'm early on account of student
council matters.

00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.264
[YOSHIKAWA, ISHIKAWA]
Huh?

00:16:27.347 --> 00:16:28.809
Oh, I think I remember
hearing that

00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:30.395
in homeroom yesterday. Oops.

00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:33.861
I would have slathered my toast
in jam if I had known!

00:16:33.944 --> 00:16:36.032
[SENGOKU] What wavelength
are the four of you on?

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.034
[ISHIKAWA]
I dunno, man,

00:16:37.117 --> 00:16:39.205
I just wish I could've put
something in my rice ball!

00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:40.248
Like shiso leaves!

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:41.627
Prez gets it!

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.465
[SENGOKU]
Uh, sh-shiso leaves?

00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:47.012
Those middle schoolers?

00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:49.266
[laughs]

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.728
You guys thought
that you were late

00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:52.481
only to show up
the earliest of all?

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:53.776
You dummies!

00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:56.239
Hey, together we dumb,
divided we fall.

00:16:56.322 --> 00:16:57.700
They gave us the morning off

00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.453
because prospective students
were coming

00:16:59.537 --> 00:17:00.706
to get a look at the place.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.504
Ah! Those kids I saw
were middle schoolers, then!

00:17:03.587 --> 00:17:04.756
Yep. They were.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.344
Where's Yuki? And Miyamura?

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.641
They left a minute ago
to buy some drinks.

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.187
What I wanna know is
why you're here early.

00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:13.649
Oh. It's silly.

00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:16.153
-Kyon-Kyon!
-Hey.

00:17:16.237 --> 00:17:19.034
[excited]
Ready to hit the school store?

00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:20.997
Let's do it.

00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:22.875
[AYASAKI]
You know what you wanna buy?

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.253
-[HORI] Uh-huh!
-Remi's been looking forward

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.923
-to this all morning!
-Since it's a ghost town,

00:17:26.007 --> 00:17:28.136
there won't be any lines.

00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:30.098
Wanna follow their lead
and snag some lunch?

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:31.309
Yeah.

00:17:32.227 --> 00:17:34.649
[Hori, Ayasaki giggle]

00:17:35.483 --> 00:17:38.657
[IURA] There are more
middle schoolers down there.

00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:40.828
Wonder if there's a lot
or just a few.

00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:42.247
I have no idea.

00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:45.420
My head's too busy reeling
'cause they all look so young.

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:47.215
Is your sister coming?

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.303
There isn't a snowball's chance
in hell.

00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:51.432
Motoko hates doing stuff
with groups.

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:54.313
If she tours this place,
she's on her own-

00:17:54.396 --> 00:17:55.983
So, while I'm not positive,

00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:58.446
I'm pretty sure that
we're somewhere around here.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.953
-[IURA] Ki-ta-ha-ra!
-[ISHIKAWA] Hey. What's up, Shu?

00:18:02.329 --> 00:18:05.586
Go! Disappear, body.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.922
[ISHIKAWA]
Are you in pain or something?

00:18:07.005 --> 00:18:08.634
[KITAHARA]
Um, excuse me.

00:18:09.552 --> 00:18:10.846
We got a little lost.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.224
[panic]

00:18:12.683 --> 00:18:14.228
You know the place
you're trying to go?

00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:15.648
The edge of this field.

00:18:15.731 --> 00:18:16.608
We're supposed to meet up

00:18:16.691 --> 00:18:18.236
with the rest
of our class there.

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.238
Oh.

00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:20.616
You'll get there quicker
through the exit

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.743
on the side of the building.

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:23.580
Follow this hallway

00:18:23.664 --> 00:18:25.333
till you reach the staircase
on the right.

00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:27.714
The doors at the bottom
lead outside.

00:18:27.797 --> 00:18:29.258
Great! Thanks so much.

00:18:29.634 --> 00:18:31.011
Shu, get over here!

00:18:31.095 --> 00:18:33.767
[IURA] Why call my name?
I don't understand!

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:39.571
Man, what's with him?

00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:41.658
[KITAHARA]
Well, um, we should get going.

00:18:41.742 --> 00:18:43.787
Right. Take care and whatnot.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.670
Yes, please leave.

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:49.507
Do I wanna know?

00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:50.509
Stop goofing off

00:18:50.593 --> 00:18:52.722
and let's get
to the cafeteria, okay?

00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:55.770
We gotta beat the lunch crowd
while we have a chance, Iura.

00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:58.024
[IURA]
Ayasaki, no!

00:18:58.107 --> 00:18:59.944
-[AYASAKI] Iura! C'mon!
-Huh?

00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:01.782
Did you see something?

00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:04.579
[IURA] The one time
a girl calls my name.

00:19:04.662 --> 00:19:06.415
[AYASAKI]
Earth to Iura!

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:07.543
Hello?

00:19:07.627 --> 00:19:09.379
-Earth to Iura!
-[IURA] Kitahara's still close!

00:19:09.463 --> 00:19:10.674
-Hello?
-He'll spot me for sure!

00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:12.803
Sorry, ladies! Go on without me!

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:15.183
Stop holding up that wall
and move.

00:19:15.518 --> 00:19:16.603
Oh. Right.

00:19:16.686 --> 00:19:17.730
I'm sorry.

00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:19.692
[KITAHARA]
Wait.

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:20.694
[gasps]

00:19:20.778 --> 00:19:22.197
[jarring indication]

00:19:23.282 --> 00:19:24.409
Is that you?

00:19:25.453 --> 00:19:26.706
Senpai?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.502
[IURA]
I'm "senpai" now?

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:29.963
If he'd called me anything else,

00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:32.552
I could've played it off
like he had the wrong guy!

00:19:34.137 --> 00:19:36.058
[KITAHARA]
Senpai, um.

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.479
[IURA] Ah! It's hard to pretend
I'm a total stranger

00:19:38.564 --> 00:19:39.691
when he calls me that.

00:19:39.774 --> 00:19:41.570
Just scram, kid!

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.790
What're you still doing up here?

00:19:47.874 --> 00:19:50.671
You're supposed to be outside,
so hurry up and get going!

00:19:50.754 --> 00:19:51.798
[foot step taps]

00:19:51.882 --> 00:19:52.925
[groans]

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:55.054
[YASUDA] Don't bully
the middle schoolers!

00:19:55.639 --> 00:19:58.102
Look, the poor kid's shaking
from head to toe!

00:19:58.185 --> 00:19:59.731
I think they're more afraid
of you

00:19:59.814 --> 00:20:01.943
and your lethal
surprise attacks, Yasuda.

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:05.366
So how do you know Iura?

00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:07.580
[AYASAKI] Do you go
to the same middle school

00:20:07.663 --> 00:20:08.832
that he did?

00:20:08.915 --> 00:20:11.170
Sorry, but,
do either of you know

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.673
if my senpai has a girlfriend?

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:14.176
[gasps]

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:16.347
[both holding laughter]

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.852
[IURA] I get stifled giggles
and sympathy?

00:20:18.935 --> 00:20:19.896
[AYASAKI]
What do we do?

00:20:19.979 --> 00:20:22.526
Should we just lie
and say that he does?

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.947
I'm thinking we dodge
the question altogether.

00:20:25.031 --> 00:20:26.951
[IURA]
Now I feel even worse!

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.955
That's enough questions
out of you for one day,

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.709
so time to say goodbye!

00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:35.051
[HORI] Wanna tag along with us
to the school store?

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.470
[IURA]
No!

00:20:37.472 --> 00:20:39.393
[KITAHARA] We have to go back
to our school for lunch,

00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:40.478
but thank you.

00:20:40.562 --> 00:20:41.480
Oh.

00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:42.983
[sighs]

00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:44.821
Was that a sigh of relief?

00:20:44.904 --> 00:20:46.533
[IURA]
This kid just needs to leave.

00:20:46.616 --> 00:20:48.119
He's stressing me out.

00:20:48.202 --> 00:20:50.123
-Senpa--
-[YASUDA] Okay, okay, okay.

00:20:50.206 --> 00:20:52.628
Beat it if you got somewhere
to be, guys.

00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:55.007
And since you all are having
navigation issues,

00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:56.720
I'll act as your personal guide.

00:20:56.803 --> 00:20:58.305
[KITAHARA]
I appreciate it?

00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:59.266
[ISHIKAWA]
What the heck?

00:20:59.349 --> 00:21:01.646
Be nice to your actual students,
too.

00:21:02.022 --> 00:21:03.399
[YASUDA]
Why would I do that?

00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:05.612
I can't recall
you ever being nice to me.

00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:07.157
[ISHIKAWA]
Huh?

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.288
[IURA]
Yasuda. I thank you.

00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:15.173
[MIYAMURA]
Wow!

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:17.260
Somebody who looks up to Iura?

00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:18.930
I would've loved to see that!

00:21:19.014 --> 00:21:20.893
Can't deny, I would have, too.

00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:22.479
Why? It was boring.

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:24.609
Nothing at all worth seeing.

00:21:24.692 --> 00:21:26.445
[AYASAKI]
Remi has to disagree!

00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:27.698
Seeing you get flustered

00:21:27.782 --> 00:21:29.702
every time he called you
"senpai" was so worth it!

00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:31.371
[IURA] That's a normal reaction
to have!

00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:32.457
Perfectly normal.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.629
What isn't "normal"
is how averse you were

00:21:34.712 --> 00:21:36.381
to simply being around this kid.

00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:37.551
Bad terms?

00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:40.682
Can't be that bad considering
how comfortable the kid was.

00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:42.728
[IURA] I didn't know
he'd be here today,

00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:45.734
but, he's one of my
little sister's classmates.

00:21:45.818 --> 00:21:48.573
Huh?! Then try and get along
for her sake, yeah?

00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:50.326
[IURA]
No, it's complicated, Hori.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.495
What's the catch?

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:52.998
What am I missing here?

00:21:53.082 --> 00:21:55.963
Stop being wishy-washy
and just say it!

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:57.465
[gasps]

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.012
Is that kid possibly "The one?"

00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:03.435
[HORI]
He is, isn't he?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.147
[YOSHIKAWA]
Aw, I didn't see him!

00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.776
[MIYAMURA]
Man, we missed out!

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.949
[ISHIKAWA]
Shu. For real? No joke?

00:22:10.032 --> 00:22:12.203
[Iura screams]

00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:15.001
Um, what'd she mean
by "the one", Remi? I'm lost.

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:16.295
Same.
