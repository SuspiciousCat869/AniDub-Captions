Clearly.

00:17:26.257 --> 00:17:28.512
I never should've applied
to Katagiri.

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:29.639
But without this school,

00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:31.560
you wouldn't have met Hori,
so fair trade.

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:34.649
Don't sell me short.
I still would've met her.

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:37.195
-Watch your tongue, old man.
-I'll expel you, punk.

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:40.870
Four days from now, I hope
my arm explodes when I wake up.

00:17:40.953 --> 00:17:42.582
[YASUDA]
Can't you just fake a cold?

00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:44.586
Fine, a cold it is.

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:47.049
A cold that makes
my entire arm explode.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.178
What kind of colds
do you typically catch?

00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:51.390
At least you can wear
a swimsuit, Prez.

00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:53.436
While I'm left to suffer.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.608
Whatever it is you're hiding
sounds tremendous.

00:17:55.691 --> 00:17:58.112
I see. All this
because you're ashamed

00:17:58.196 --> 00:17:59.741
to be seen without a shirt?

00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:02.705
How is wearing shorts in a pool

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:05.043
any different from going
to English naked?

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.005
Are those two things
not the same?

00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:09.385
[YASUDA] You're talking
to your English teacher, idiot.

00:18:09.928 --> 00:18:11.807
I'd rather be
publicly guillotined

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.351
than be seen in a swimsuit.

00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:14.646
Okay, I really don't get

00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:16.900
why this is a matter of life
and death for you, Prez.

00:18:16.983 --> 00:18:18.194
[sighs]

00:18:18.277 --> 00:18:20.908
What I do get is that you boys
don't want in that pool.

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:24.164
So, I'll talk to Sasaki
and see what I can do.

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:27.170
[BOTH] You're kidding!
Except you better not be!

00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:29.174
Speak to your elders politely.

00:18:29.258 --> 00:18:30.719
[BOTH]
You really rock!

00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:33.517
-That your idea of polite?
-I can't believe my ears!

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.437
You'll actually talk
to Coach Sasaki?

00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.069
Yeah, I'll talk to him, happy?
No promises, though.

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:41.616
It's a teacher's duty to listen
to students' concerns

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.869
and find proper solutions!

00:18:42.952 --> 00:18:44.706
[YASUDA] Don't put it like that.
Now I'm nervous.

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:47.169
In four days' time
the clothes will stay on!

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.547
[YASUDA]
What's with the aggression?

00:18:49.047 --> 00:18:51.218
I still need a valid reason
from both of you.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.517
I was in an explosion,
and it's his time of the month.

00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:55.519
That's all.

00:18:55.603 --> 00:18:57.732
Those are the excuses
you want me to tell 'em?

00:18:57.815 --> 00:18:58.817
Honestly, no.

00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:01.113
Compromises led us
to those results.

00:19:01.197 --> 00:19:02.909
This is gonna be a pain.

00:19:02.992 --> 00:19:04.119
[sighs]

00:19:04.203 --> 00:19:07.000
What a relief.
I wasn't sure what I'd do.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.795
Could go for a beach day.

00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:09.631
-What?
-Huh?

00:19:12.177 --> 00:19:13.722
[IURA]
Woo-hoo!

00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:17.479
Come on!
No cannonballs allowed!

00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:18.815
Nothin' beats the pool!

00:19:18.899 --> 00:19:20.611
How are you not hot
in that getup?

00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:22.072
Oh, I'm very hot.

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:24.326
-But I'll be okay.
-You're making me hot!

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:27.249
Hey, get to work, slackers!
I want it spotless!

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.585
[MIYAMURA, SENGOKU]
Yes, sir.

00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:30.798
[SENGOKU]
Jeez!

00:19:30.881 --> 00:19:32.384
It's like walking on lava!

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.263
Did you not think
to bring some sandals?

00:19:34.346 --> 00:19:36.308
Remi took them
before I got here.

00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:40.024
-Then take a dip and cool off!
-I would if I was alone.

00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:42.070
What're you, a girl?

00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:45.786
-Sengoku Splash!
-You're asking for it!

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.748
That's right, so bring it, Prez!

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.588
[SENGOKU]
Ouch.

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:52.424
[MIYAMURA] We were just
clowning around a little.

00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:54.721
[SASAKI]
I want a clean deck, not clowns!

00:19:54.804 --> 00:19:56.390
[ISHIKAWA]
You guys good?

00:19:56.473 --> 00:19:59.438
[HORI] How's it goin',
shrinking violets? Working hard?

00:19:59.522 --> 00:20:02.695
-[SENGOKU] Whoa! Kyo-chan!
-It's not that shocking.

00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:05.450
-You skipping class?
-[HORI] Girls got out at noon.

00:20:05.534 --> 00:20:06.953
-See ya!
-Oh, hey, Remi?

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:09.458
-Can I have my sandals?
-No way, José!

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.880
I'm not ever giving them back!

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.261
-[HORI] They look comfy.
-[AYASAKI] They are!

00:20:15.345 --> 00:20:16.723
[STUDENT 1]
I hear the sweet sound of babes!

00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:17.725
[STUDENT 2]
Where?

00:20:17.808 --> 00:20:19.604
Ayasaki's feet
are ours to behold!

00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:21.858
Look how cute her
little tootsies are.

00:20:23.027 --> 00:20:26.534
[SENGOKU] Get back in the pool,
you sleazy water demons!

00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:28.412
Man, he is royally pissed at us!

00:20:28.496 --> 00:20:29.331
What happened?

00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:31.920
What part of the word "clean"
don't you understand?

00:20:32.003 --> 00:20:32.963
[MIYAMURA, SENGOKU]
Sorry.

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:37.180
Why are we scrubbing the deck

00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:38.642
when it's not even dirty,
though?

00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:41.230
-My thoughts exactly.
-[YASUDA] Hey.

00:20:41.313 --> 00:20:43.735
How goes, guys?

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:45.698
-Savior.
-Messiah.

00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:47.743
[YASUDA] Don't call me that.
It bothers me.

00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:50.624
How are you not burning up
in that thing?

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:53.212
Oh, I am.
My answer never changes.

00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:55.258
Getting tired of hearing
that one, huh?

00:20:55.341 --> 00:20:56.886
So, did you just stop by
to say hey?

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.474
Got bored 'cause the girls
were released early.

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:01.019
[groans] It's a sausage fest.

00:21:01.103 --> 00:21:02.648
I kinda figured
that was the case.

00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:04.109
[TERAJIMA]
Mister Yasuda!

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:05.153
Miss Terajima.

00:21:05.236 --> 00:21:06.740
You're outside
when I put you in charge

00:21:06.823 --> 00:21:08.034
of the boys' supplemental class.

00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:12.125
-Are you stupid or something?
-Yeah. Very possible.

00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:14.589
He said he was intelligent
four days ago.

00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:17.595
Honestly! I don't have time
for this nonsense!

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:20.141
Your legs are like, the size
of my pinky, man!

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:23.899
That isn't by choice you know.

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.026
Do you know your hip
measurements?

00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:25.944
No.

00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:28.407
Better question for you.
Never learn how to swim?

00:21:28.491 --> 00:21:30.996
I did.
I'm practically like a fish.

00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:33.459
I become invincible
as soon as I hit the water.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:36.048
Far more than my element,
it's also my domain.

00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:37.843
[ISHIKAWA]
Could've fooled me, landlubber.

00:21:37.927 --> 00:21:40.223
Technically,
I really like swimming, too!

00:21:40.306 --> 00:21:42.728
[ISHIKAWA] That's rich coming
from a guy skipping pool day.

00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:45.776
But, I know that's only 'cause
he wants to keep his ink secret.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.243
-My foot cramped! Help me!
-Shuu! Don't die!

00:21:51.286 --> 00:21:54.042
You did that Inugami
Clan handstand thingamajiggy,

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:54.961
didn't you?

00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:57.048
I won't deny it
but, yeah, I did.

00:21:57.131 --> 00:21:58.259
So you did.

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:00.722
[IURA]
Come to think of it,

00:22:00.764 --> 00:22:03.603
why were the two of them
excused from actual swimming?

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:04.814
Seems fine to me.

00:22:04.897 --> 00:22:08.445
Sengoku's arm combusted,
while Miyamura is on his period.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.786
-Uh-huh.
-...personalities ever.

00:22:12.162 --> 00:22:14.709
Well, it is summertime.

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:17.005
-Bound to be a big bang or two.
-Huh?
