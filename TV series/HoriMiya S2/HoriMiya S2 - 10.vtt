WEBVTT

00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:07.348
[WATABE]
To each their own.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:10.855
But, personally,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.318
I think Miyamura looks best
with long hair.

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.949
[HORI]
They're making a sequel!

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:18.328
Part two of that horror flick
I love is in the works!

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:19.831
Wow, really?

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:25.008
[WATABE] I felt drawn to him as
a fellow bespectacled classmate,

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.887
since our numbers are few.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.225
And his long hair gave him
an air of mystery.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:32.481
It was sensational.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.901
[ISHIKAWA]
Watabe!

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:36.489
Did you find that reference
book I asked for, or?

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.703
I say we go see it
on opening day!

00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:42.836
Uhh. Sure. It's a date. Yay.

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:45.132
[WATABE] That said,
this fun-loving Miyamura

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.217
is nice too.

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:48.723
-I approve.
-[clicks]

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:51.979
[ISHIKAWA] Yo! Why'd
you snap a pic of Miyamura?

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:53.524
[WATABE]
To memorialize him.

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:55.987
[ISHIKAWA]
Now I have even more questions.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.475
What're you reading there,
Watabe?

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.479
Huh! It's a mystery!

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:38.526
Oh! Is it any good?

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.613
Hmm! Quite a phenomenal read!

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.575
Though there are some
intense horror scenes.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.411
They only add
to the great story!

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.708
Cool.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.837
You're a big fan of the genre,
right?

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.465
I've heard you
and your friends gush.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.386
I'm actually partial
to it as well

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.265
and Japanese horror
reigns supreme!

00:02:54.348 --> 00:02:57.772
Oh. Hori's the huge horror buff,
not me.

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:00.151
Bet the pair of you would be
friends at first fright, huh?

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:05.078
Ah. Well, it's hard to say.

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.834
[MIYAMURA]
Huh! But, uh. I still enjoy it,

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.295
even though I'm not a fanatic!

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:13.303
Oh, you do? That's so great!
Means we share a hobby now!

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:14.598
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.352
[MIYAMURA]
It's like I can feel the hearts

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:20.025
floating off his sleeves
and into my personal space.

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:23.156
[WATABE] Ah, common interests
are so fun! Here!

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.035
Check these other books out,
Miyamura!

00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:27.205
'Kay.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.919
Hey, everybody!

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.049
You're just in time
for a special treat!

00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:34.679
How does a steaming cup
of chawanmushi sound?

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:37.142
Cooked by yours truly,
so you know it's delish!

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:39.689
Aw, thanks, Kyosuke.

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:41.985
But what makes this one special
is the ginko nuts,

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.574
and it was my idea to add them
in the first place!

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.620
Oh-ho, that was a good call.

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:48.456
[MIYAMURA]
Like father, like son.

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:53.299
Huh! Hey,
I was wondering when you...!

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:54.928
[HORI]
Stop!

00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:59.729
[sniffing]

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:01.858
Uh! Do I stink?

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:03.862
Of Watabe funk.

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:04.989
Huh!

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:07.704
[HORI] Normally, there's
a trace of Toru or Shindo.

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:10.041
This is crushing my windpipe
and I can't breathe!

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.295
Well, I'm choking
on that stench!

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.301
How you know what Watabe smells
like is the real question.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.559
[HORI] I took samples in case
this scenario played out.

00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:20.186
[MIYAMURA]
What scenario?

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.484
You can smell people's scent
on me, even if we just talk?

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.950
Female scents do not compute.
The only ones that do are male.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.453
[MIYAMURA]
And now you're a robot.

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.167
I don't smell a thing.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.672
You don't have to detect
any strange aromas.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.509
What counts is I can.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.387
But, I kinda want to.

00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:38.557
So, I'll be able to tell

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.934
if you've been
with someone else.

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:41.020
Be it hanging out, or...

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:42.774
Huh!

00:04:42.857 --> 00:04:44.151
I see.

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:46.155
What you really want
is a means to determine

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:47.909
if I surround myself with guys
all day,

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:49.286
the same way that you do.

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:51.583
That phrasing irked me
a little bit.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.960
But, yeah, basically.

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:55.758
Well, I don't.

00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:59.599
Um, we both know that's a lie.
I can think of two.

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.187
You always hang around
with Ishikawa and the prez.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.528
But I'd never know that just
by getting a good whiff of you.

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:07.573
How 'bout we make a deal, then?

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:09.536
If I cheat,
I'll tell you to your face.

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:12.625
Haa! That'd be a big help.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:13.919
Thought so.

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:15.088
[KYOSUKE]
Dinner's ready!

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.560
She went ballistic.
I'm talking vein-popping mad.

00:05:21.643 --> 00:05:23.479
Like, I've never been
the best at studying,

00:05:23.564 --> 00:05:24.858
so I have no clue why.

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:25.818
[chuckles]

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.866
But. I guess I could buckle down
and really apply myself, huh?

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.451
Worth a try.

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:33.124
It could be a whole lot worse,
Ishikawa.

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.671
If I so much as play a CD,
the cord gets yanked out!

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:36.673
No tunes!

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:39.386
Music helps stimulate the brain,
though, doesn't it?

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.641
All of their expectations
are sky-high.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.562
Can't they see
we're doing our best down here?

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.651
-[chuckles]
-[sniffs]

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:48.321
[ALL]
The heck?

00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:50.450
[MIYAMURA]
I can't tell.

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:52.788
Yeah. How much you wanna bet
it's Hori-related?

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.584
Two... No, three million.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.965
They're just weirdos.
It's the core of who they are.

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.263
[SHINDO]
What's up?

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.225
I hardly ever get invited
to your place.

00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:05.856
Though I always
love it when I do!

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.781
Oh, but you can hang onto that
controller. I have more at home.

00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:11.910
That's not the reason
I asked you to come over!

00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:14.164
And even if you want it,
you can't have it!

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.753
[SHINDO]
Then what's the deal, dude?

00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:22.765
I, I want
you to close your eyes.

00:06:22.848 --> 00:06:24.226
Aah!

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.399
A-Are you gonna
do something to me?

00:06:27.482 --> 00:06:31.490
Yeah, no way.
It'll be over quick.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:32.743
[SHINDO]
What will?

00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:36.250
You can end so many things
in a moment. Including my life!

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.880
[MIYAMURA] I'd explain
if I thought you'd get it.

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.884
-Just close your eyes.
-[screams]

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:41.928
What for?

00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:42.847
What are you gonna do

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.474
once you rob me of my life,
Miyamura?

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:47.648
[MIYAMURA] Fine! You can look,
but shut up and sit still!

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:52.365
[sniffs]

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:56.750
There. If anyone made a move,
it'd be you.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.004
But I have your
scent memorized now.

00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:02.302
[SHINDO] Time out.
W-Who am I making moves on?

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:03.930
Shaddup.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:09.066
â™ª

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:11.320
[clicks]

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.543
[clicks]

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:22.551
[clicks]

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.227
Question. And while
it's against my better judgment,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.191
I'm gonna ask it anyway,
'cause no one else will.

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:31.945
[clicks]

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:33.364
You listening?

00:07:33.447 --> 00:07:34.992
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:37.122
Once I save these babies
in my Miyamura folder,

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:38.332
I'll be all ears.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.587
I hear your camera
snapping pictures

00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:41.965
like there's no tomorrow...

00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:43.760
You have a folder
just for Miyamura?

00:07:43.844 --> 00:07:45.096
That's sketch.

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:48.854
[ISHIKAWA] But, yeah, so.
My hesitant question.

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:52.277
Are you crushing on Miyamura?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.447
It goes far beyond
that level of attachment.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.330
I find him greatly fascinating.
I can't explain it.

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:00.919
[ISHIKAWA]
Uh-huh.

00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:03.299
But there's Hori,
his ever-charming girl.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:04.635
I don't follow.

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:06.764
You speak as
if that's a bad thing.

00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:09.604
Miyamura dating
the opposite sex is moe.

00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:12.358
If you're a fan, then you're
aware he has guy friends

00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:13.612
from other schools, yeah?

00:08:13.695 --> 00:08:15.239
Y'know, like Shindo?

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:18.370
There are boys outside
of school he has affection for?

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:20.834
Wow!

00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.715
[ISHIKAWA] He-he! Creepy!
No, he's a pal, not a creep!

00:08:23.798 --> 00:08:25.719
Don't think of pals as creeps!

00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:30.562
[ISHIKAWA] Okay, so,
you just admire him from afar?

00:08:30.646 --> 00:08:32.650
No, I'd love
to touch him one day!

00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:35.488
[ISHIKAWA] Oh, wow.
Okay, let me rephrase that.

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:37.743
Like, do you ever
wanna talk to the guy?

00:08:37.826 --> 00:08:40.498
I don't have that desire,
since I recorded him!

00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:41.793
[MIYAMURA]
<i>What's up, Watabe?</i>

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.466
[ISHIKAWA]
I am extremely concerned.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.803
-Hey!
-Huh!

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:48.974
Come play some ping-pong!

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:51.478
[laughs]

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:53.190
Ishikawa.

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:55.361
If an asteroid
that was two kilometers in width

00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:57.240
crashed into me
at this very moment,

00:08:57.323 --> 00:09:00.454
I'd die a happy soul.
No regrets.

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.833
A space rock that size

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.170
would kill Miyamura on impact,
too, you know.

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:07.511
[HORI]
You reek!

00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:11.561
Watabe's stench!
I can smell it all over you!

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:14.232
But for some reason,
it's much stronger today!

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:15.944
He thinks he's marking
his territory?

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:18.115
Hori! My collar's
gonna rip! Mercy!

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.248
You're saying
I smell worse than usual?

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:24.545
I didn't even notice him
get that close!

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:27.091
There are also hints of Shindo
and Tanihara on you,

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.597
but Watabe's stank overpowers
them both!

00:09:30.222 --> 00:09:31.684
[HORI]
And why wouldn't it?

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:34.356
His odor is as intense as
his interest in you.

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.151
An obsession
that puts the other boys

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:37.571
in your life to shame.

00:09:37.654 --> 00:09:40.117
[MIYAMURA] How can you know
all that from someone's BO?

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:41.954
I'm telling you.

00:09:42.038 --> 00:09:43.332
Despite what your nose detects,

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.044
I didn't lay a finger
on that kid.

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:47.800
Doesn't matter how many fingers
came into contact with him.

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:51.348
[sighs]

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:01.451
[sniffs]

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:05.459
Your scent is the only one
I would know anywhere.

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:07.213
You'd think that'd also be
true for girls like

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.217
Yoshikawa or Ayasaki.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.887
[whimpers]

00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:14.770
I thought you'd finally do it.

00:10:14.854 --> 00:10:17.526
-Huh?
-The way you whipped around.

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:20.824
I thought you were gonna
manhandle me into next week!

00:10:20.907 --> 00:10:22.870
Quit getting my hopes up,
you tease!

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:24.330
[MIYAMURA] I can't believe
they were high enough

00:10:24.414 --> 00:10:26.460
to make you cry
when they fell. I'm sorry!

00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:30.301
Aah! You dummy!
Don't you dare touch me now!

00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:33.683
[MIYAMURA] Enough
with the deodorizer spray!

00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:44.622
[ISHIKAWA]
Traffic accident?

00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:46.626
No. It was man-made.

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:47.586
[ISHIKAWA]
Hori, huh?

00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:50.007
Hoo, boy.
So you two fought again?

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.009
Hmm-mmm!

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:53.472
Dunno who won,
but she got you good.

00:10:53.556 --> 00:10:55.351
I don't care
what she says or does,

00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:57.438
I'm not apologizing
this time around.

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:00.737
Morning.

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:02.699
[FEMALE STUDENT 1] Hori,
what happened to your face?

00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:03.868
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
That must hurt!

00:11:03.952 --> 00:11:06.206
Dude. Did you hit her back?

00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:07.500
No! No!

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:10.464
[slaps]

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:12.970
You are such a dummy, I swear!

00:11:13.053 --> 00:11:16.101
Go on! If you've got something
to say, by all means, say it!

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:18.272
Nah, I'm set.

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:20.192
If you're just gonna have
a dumb tantrum, though,

00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:21.696
then I'll leave. Dummy.

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:23.866
That's rich!
The dummy's calling me dumb!

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.870
Man, you piss me off so much!

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:27.039
[thuds]

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:28.000
Uh!

00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:29.878
[MIYAMURA]
Got so worked up

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:32.885
she smacked right into
the doorframe. Hard.

00:11:32.968 --> 00:11:34.262
Aw!

00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:37.226
Okay, but what
sparked this fight?

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.063
I forgot like I always do.

00:11:40.357 --> 00:11:44.533
This time, though, I won't budge
until Hori says she's sorry!

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:47.121
-How manly.
-Yeah. Good luck.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.754
[HORI]
The sheer nerve of this guy!

00:11:50.837 --> 00:11:53.635
It didn't faze him! Not one bit!

00:11:53.718 --> 00:11:56.891
Uh! Miyamura's such a dummy!

00:11:56.974 --> 00:11:58.895
[KONO]
There, there. Don't cry.

00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:01.901
It's fine. There isn't even
another woman involved,

00:12:01.984 --> 00:12:03.905
so why are you getting
this upset about it?

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.619
Guys are just as dangerous.

00:12:06.702 --> 00:12:09.792
[AYASAKI] I forgot you hit
your head. Get well soon, okay?

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:11.587
[HORI]
Wake up and tune in!

00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:13.549
Uh! Huh!

00:12:14.384 --> 00:12:15.804
[SENGOKU]
Just dump the guy.

00:12:15.887 --> 00:12:17.431
No! Why should I?

00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:20.187
Look, I'll put it to you
this way.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.653
What'll you do
when you push him too far?

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:25.489
And Miyamura
stops caring about you

00:12:25.573 --> 00:12:27.619
romantically or otherwise?

00:12:28.788 --> 00:12:30.332
Nothing's guaranteed.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.673
Even somebody you share a past
with can always choose to leave.

00:12:33.756 --> 00:12:36.219
[HORI] When Sengoku says it,
I wanna punch him.

00:12:36.302 --> 00:12:38.933
But when Kono says it,
I suddenly see the light.

00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:41.396
Yeah. Thanks, Kono.

00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:42.691
Hey.

00:12:42.774 --> 00:12:46.114
Huh! I'm still angry as hell.

00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:47.826
[BOTH]
This might take a minute.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.249
Time to submit
our group's opinion,

00:12:51.332 --> 00:12:52.460
ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:57.637
[ISHIKAWA] Know what?
I'll make it just my opinion!

00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:58.931
[BOTH]
Go right ahead.

00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:02.229
[ISHIKAWA]
Who cares if you answered

00:13:02.313 --> 00:13:03.858
at the same time?

00:13:04.693 --> 00:13:08.241
Damn, I'm more worn out
than the combatants.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:10.622
I'm sorry you got involved, man.

00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:13.753
Oh, but, why am I angry? Huh.

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:16.801
My brain's so exhausted,
it can't remember now.

00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:17.844
[ISHIKAWA]
If you're serious,

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:20.432
this is gonna go in
an endless loop of spite.

00:13:20.517 --> 00:13:22.854
Just kiss and make up already.

00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:25.234
I really would like to.

00:13:25.317 --> 00:13:27.196
-[blares]
-Oh. New text.

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.037
[purring]

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.500
-[coughing]
-I see you've chosen death.

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:35.045
[beeps]

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.260
Urgh!

00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:40.557
Nab some paper towels.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.103
Ew, you smell!
Like bad apple juice!

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:47.863
[HORI]
What am I doing? Jeez.

00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:50.702
It's my fault.

00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:54.375
So just say sorry and end it.
Stop being stupid.

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:01.891
[YASUDA] Hey, Miyamura.
Have you seen Hori?

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.018
Why?

00:14:03.978 --> 00:14:05.940
[YASUDA] She was absent
from that last class.

00:14:07.276 --> 00:14:09.071
I went and checked
the nurse's office

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.992
and the girls' locker room.

00:14:11.075 --> 00:14:11.911
But no dice.

00:14:11.994 --> 00:14:14.248
[MIYAMURA] You...
Went in the girls' locker room?

00:14:14.332 --> 00:14:16.044
Well, I'm getting kinda worried
about her now.

00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:17.797
[MIYAMURA]
And I'm worried you went in.

00:14:17.881 --> 00:14:19.843
Wherever she went,
she left her bag.

00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:21.680
Hope she's not out in that cold.

00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:23.433
Yeah.

00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:25.187
Wait. Outside?

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.953
â™ª

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:34.246
[creaks]

00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:39.800
[MIYAMURA]
There she is.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:43.223
-[HORI] What?
-Hmm!

00:14:47.565 --> 00:14:48.776
Oh, um, nothing.

00:14:51.114 --> 00:14:54.705
So, it's over, right?
You stopped caring about me.

00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:55.957
Huh?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.251
[HORI]
Just 'cause we have a past

00:14:57.334 --> 00:14:58.963
doesn't mean we have a future.

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.340
Huh!

00:15:01.342 --> 00:15:03.221
[HORI]
I imagine you already hate me.

00:15:04.306 --> 00:15:05.518
Why, Hori?

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:10.945
Why? Well, because... [sobs]

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:13.116
[MIYAMURA]
Um. You're crying? Seriously?

00:15:15.078 --> 00:15:17.416
Come on, now.
There's nothing to cry about.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.380
[sobs] But, I!

00:15:20.464 --> 00:15:23.721
But, I!
I constantly get irritated.

00:15:23.804 --> 00:15:28.063
And then I take it out on you!
It's so unfair!

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:31.402
-[HORI sobs]
-Who knew she knew?

00:15:31.486 --> 00:15:34.283
I wanna look at you.
Just move your hands.

00:15:35.243 --> 00:15:37.582
Please? There!

00:15:40.713 --> 00:15:43.009
Aw.
You're really crying a river!

00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.971
[laughs]

00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:47.392
Proof that even monsters need
a good cry.

00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:50.232
Your ears and nose
turned crimson red, too!

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:51.610
[gasps]

00:15:51.693 --> 00:15:54.699
Bawling like a baby?
In the middle of school?

00:15:54.783 --> 00:15:56.452
That's tragic.

00:15:58.039 --> 00:16:00.460
Shut your face!

00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:03.174
How? How are
you always so freaking nice?

00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:05.303
Makes me think about dumb stuff,

00:16:05.387 --> 00:16:07.684
like what I'd do if you started
hating me!

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:11.190
[MIYAMURA] Is that really
what got you this worked up?

00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:12.694
Jeez, Hori.

00:16:12.777 --> 00:16:15.867
I swear. Though you named me
the reigning dummy king,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.329
the crown suits you just
as well.

00:16:18.413 --> 00:16:20.417
I know I'm the queen
to your king, okay?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.505
But you're
still dumber by a mile!

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:25.218
[MIYAMURA]
You're surprisingly self-aware.

00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:28.391
Granted, there is one thing
you haven't realized.

00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:31.857
And that's how very hard
I've fallen for you.

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.654
Hating you would be difficult.

00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:40.081
Dummy-mura strikes again!
With the words! And the eyes!

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.629
[MIYAMURA]
But, I-I was being honest.

00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:46.887
My bad. Sorry I like you.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.976
â™ª

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.980
[MIYAMURA]
Damn it. I wasn't at fault,

00:16:52.064 --> 00:16:53.817
but I apologized anyway.

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:58.744
Yeah! Duh! You didn't
do anything wrong! Got that?

00:16:58.827 --> 00:17:01.917
I'm at fault a hundred out
of a hundred times, all right?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.253
[MIYAMURA]
All right.

00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:06.551
Context would def help
if I had it.

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:08.388
But from up here, that sure
looked like a direct kick

00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:09.724
to the gut to me.

00:17:09.808 --> 00:17:11.645
[YOSHIKAWA]
It did.

00:17:11.728 --> 00:17:13.607
[BOTH]
Scary.

00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:19.076
[MIYAMURA]
Good morning.

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:22.499
[ISHIKAWA]
Hey! Morning, Miyamura.

00:17:24.796 --> 00:17:26.340
-[ISHIKAWA] A hoodie?
-[YOSHIKAWA] A hoodie?

00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:28.136
So, that look is a choice.

00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:30.850
You shouldn't have been the one
making it, though. For real.

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:34.106
That's not quite your style.
It looks warm, though!

00:17:34.189 --> 00:17:35.358
Gee, thanks.

00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:37.446
Wow, this is a first.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.491
[laughs] Guess so.

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:41.872
I wore this since my
normal clothes were in the wash.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:45.755
Ah. Sometimes
it's nice to spice it up.

00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:50.472
-You really think?
-[HORI] Mhm!

00:17:50.556 --> 00:17:54.229
Hey, friendos! Someone
lend me their Japanese book!

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.610
Whoa, Miyamura!
Is that a hoodie?

00:17:56.693 --> 00:17:58.530
Trying to jock my style?

00:17:58.614 --> 00:17:59.574
Negatory.

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:01.912
[IURA]
He's not! But yay, matching!

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:04.375
I struggle to get this look
to catch on each year

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.007
when the cold is at its worst,
but it never ever does!

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:10.888
[YOSHIKAWA] Well,
it is against the dress code.

00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:12.934
You're lookin' a little too
sharp, though, Miyamura,

00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:15.523
so why not add some flair
to show it off, yeah?

00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:16.608
[MIYAMURA]
But, okay?

00:18:16.691 --> 00:18:18.612
[ISHIKAWA]
He's violating the dress code.

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:20.281
And you want him to flaunt it?

00:18:21.158 --> 00:18:22.578
[IURA]
Aw, that's lit!

00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:25.543
Put those shades back in
the student council room, Shu!

00:18:25.626 --> 00:18:28.924
[IURA] Pose your fingers
more like this. Doped!

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:29.968
[MIYAMURA]
D-Dope.

00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:32.472
[HORI] Enough! Take your
modern Japanese textbook

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:34.184
and go bother your own class!

00:18:34.268 --> 00:18:35.270
Argh!

00:18:35.353 --> 00:18:37.567
Now I'm gonna wonder
why Shu's so big on hoodies

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.819
for the rest of the day.

00:18:38.902 --> 00:18:40.447
Maybe they're like
the ultimate item

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.533
that he can equip.

00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:44.288
Whereas my stats probably
take a hit

00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:45.583
while I'm wearing a hoodie.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.589
Seems I gotta channel Iura,
I guess, to rock this look.

00:18:48.672 --> 00:18:49.716
[laughs]

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:53.557
No. Do not make Iura
your finish line.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.228
Strive to be like anybody
except him.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:18:57.481
[MIYAMURA]
Poor Iura.

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.441
[creaks]

00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:01.447
Ha! So it's true!
You are breaking dress code!

00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:02.992
[MIYAMURA]
Morning, Mister President.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:03.994
Good morning!

00:19:04.704 --> 00:19:07.167
I ran into Iura in the hall
just now.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.839
He was thrilled to tell me
you've adopted "his style?"

00:19:09.923 --> 00:19:12.595
More like
I'm borrowing it for the day.

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:15.099
Did you tell off Iura
for his hoodie?

00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.268
Don't play faves.

00:19:16.352 --> 00:19:17.980
[SENGOKU]
He's a lost cause.

00:19:18.064 --> 00:19:20.360
I don't waste my breath on him.
So, no.

00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:22.657
[MIYAMURA]
Poor Iura.

00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:24.869
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Yes! Lunch time!

00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:29.671
Hey. The school got a new flavor
of hot tea today. You see it?

00:19:29.754 --> 00:19:31.257
Not yet! What is it?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.135
One you'll like, I'm sure.

00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.306
[YOSHIKAWA]
To the tea!

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.897
[HORI] Hold up, Miyamura.
Your hood's rumpled.

00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:40.901
Oh. Is it?

00:19:40.985 --> 00:19:42.112
Thank you.

00:19:42.195 --> 00:19:44.784
If you're gonna break
school rules, make it look good.

00:19:45.536 --> 00:19:48.165
[BOTH sigh]

00:19:48.249 --> 00:19:51.506
Aah! Jeez! What prompted you
to do that?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.009
[HORI]
Curiosity. Because that hoodie.

00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:56.056
That's all right.
[sighs]

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.810
[MIYAMURA]
I can't fool Hori.

00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:01.442
[ISHIKAWA]
Whatcha think?

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:02.528
Gonna wear it again?

00:20:02.612 --> 00:20:04.741
Nah. Tomorrow,
it's back to my cardigan.

00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:06.703
[HORI]
Stare.

00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:08.582
[sobs]

00:20:12.632 --> 00:20:14.927
[HORI]
Stare.

00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:16.305
[clamoring]

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:18.518
Miyamura, you coming over?

00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:21.691
No! I need to head
home today! See ya later!

00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:24.739
Do not tell me
they had another fight.

00:20:24.822 --> 00:20:26.660
'Kay.

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.460
Hey, good morning, Hori.

00:20:31.544 --> 00:20:34.174
Great morning!
This warm weather rocks!

00:20:34.257 --> 00:20:36.345
Yeah. Very sunny.

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:39.226
You're warm enough
to ditch your scarf?

00:20:39.309 --> 00:20:41.313
-[HORI] Stare.
-Hmm!

00:20:42.273 --> 00:20:43.442
[MIYAMURA]
What's wrong?

00:20:46.073 --> 00:20:47.283
[HORI]
Come here a sec.

00:20:50.206 --> 00:20:52.252
[MIYAMURA] I'm getting
kinda anxious about this.

00:20:55.341 --> 00:20:56.636
[sighs]

00:20:57.847 --> 00:20:58.724
-[sniffs]
-What're you...?

00:20:59.892 --> 00:21:01.228
[whimpers]

00:21:01.855 --> 00:21:04.443
Yay! You smell
like yourself again!

00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:06.488
[MIYAMURA]
Uh! That's, uh, awesome.

00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:09.746
I should've known
that's what she was up to.

00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:12.835
Miyamura, you have
a wonderfully unique smell.

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:14.505
I was surprised
when I couldn't pick it up

00:21:14.589 --> 00:21:15.507
from that white hoodie.

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:16.760
[gasps]

00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:19.640
-[HORI] Stare.
-[MIYAMURA] Um.

00:21:19.724 --> 00:21:21.603
'Cause it's Shindo's.

00:21:21.686 --> 00:21:24.316
He left it at my apartment
the last time he stayed over.

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:25.443
[HORI]
I knew it.

00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:29.075
I ran it through the wash,
so how did your nose know?

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.788
Because it was obvious to me.

00:21:31.497 --> 00:21:34.002
[MIYAMURA]
Well, that makes one of us.

00:21:34.587 --> 00:21:36.925
I mean, your scent
is my favorite smell

00:21:37.008 --> 00:21:38.762
in the entire world, Miyamura.

00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:39.847
[laughs]

00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:43.814
Make sure that you return
Shindo's hoodie, okay?

00:21:43.897 --> 00:21:46.611
[sighs] Ah! You're cold!

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:53.917
â™ª

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.086
[MIYAMURA]
Let's go.

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:56.798
[HORI]
Oh. Yeah, let's.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.469
[HORI]
Just gonna leave it at that?

00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:03.603
Ah!

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:06.150
-Ha!
-Oh! Good morning!

00:22:06.776 --> 00:22:07.778
[MIYAMURA]
G-Good morning!

00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:09.699
[AYASAKI]
Uh-oh. What's up?

00:22:09.782 --> 00:22:13.372
[HORI] Nothing but the sky.
And it's a beautiful day.
