But, personally,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.318
I think Miyamura looks best
with long hair.

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.949

They're making a sequel!

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:18.328
Part two of that horror flick

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:19.831
Wow, really?

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:25.008
[WATABE] I felt drawn to him as
a fellow bespectacled classmate,

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.887
since our numbers are few.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.225
And his long hair gave him
an air of mystery.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:32.481
It was sensational.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.901
[ISHIKAWA]
Watabe!

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:36.489
Did you find that reference
book I asked for, or?

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.703

[ISHIKAWA] Yo! Why'd
you snap a pic of Miyamura?

[WATABE]
To memorialize him.

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:55.987
[ISHIKAWA]
Now I have even more questions.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.475
What're you reading there,
Watabe?

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.479
Huh! It's a mystery!

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:38.526
Oh! Is it any good?

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.613
Hmm! Quite a phenomenal read!

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.575
Though there are some
intense horror scenes.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.411
They only add
to the great story!

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.708
Cool.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.837
You're a big fan of the genre,
right?

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.465
I've heard you
and your friends gush.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.386
I'm actually partial
to it as well

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.265

friends at first fright, huh?

Ah. Well, it's hard to say.

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.834
[MIYAMURA]
Huh! But, uh. I still enjoy it,

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.295
even though I'm not a fanatic!

Yeah.

It's like I can feel the hearts

and into my personal space.

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:23.156
[WATABE] Ah, common interests
are so fun! Here!

You're just in time
for a special treat!

00:03:32.132 --> 00:03:34.679
How does a steaming cup
of chawanmushi sound?

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:37.142
Cooked by yours truly,
so you know it's delish!

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:39.689
Aw, thanks, Kyosuke.

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:41.985
But what makes this one special
is the ginko nuts,

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.574
and it was my idea to add them
in the first place!

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.620
Oh-ho, that was a good call.

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:48.456
[MIYAMURA]
Like father, like son.

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:53.299
Huh! Hey,
I was wondering when you...!

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:01.858
Uh! Do I stink?

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:03.862
Of Watabe funk.

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:04.989
Huh!

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:07.704
[HORI] Normally, there's
a trace of Toru or Shindo.

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:10.041
This is crushing my windpipe
and I can't breathe!

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.295
Well, I'm choking
on that stench!

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.301
How you know what Watabe smells
like is the real question.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.559
[HORI] I took samples in case
this scenario played out.

00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:20.186
[MIYAMURA]
What scenario?

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.484
You can smell people's scent
on me, even if we just talk?

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.950
Female scents do not compute.
The only ones that do are male.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.453
[MIYAMURA]
And now you're a robot.

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.167
I don't smell a thing.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.672
You don't have to detect
any strange aromas.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.509

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.387

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:46.155

is a means to determine

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:47.909
if I surround myself with guys
all day,

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:49.286

Well, I don't.

Um, we both know that's a lie.

00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:28.136
So, that look is a choice.

00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:30.850
You shouldn't have been the one
making it, though. For real.

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:34.106
That's not quite your style.
It looks warm, though!

00:17:34.189 --> 00:17:35.358
Gee, thanks.

00:17:36.193 --> 00:17:37.446
Wow, this is a first.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.491
[laughs] Guess so.

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:41.872
I wore this since my
normal clothes were in the wash.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:45.755
Ah. Sometimes
it's nice to spice it up.

00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:50.472
-You really think?
-[HORI] Mhm!

00:17:50.556 --> 00:17:54.229
Hey, friendos! Someone
lend me their Japanese book!

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.610
Whoa, Miyamura!
Is that a hoodie?

00:17:56.693 --> 00:17:58.530
Trying to jock my style?

00:17:58.614 --> 00:17:59.574
Negatory.

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:01.912
[IURA]
He's not! But yay, matching!

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:04.375
I struggle to get this look
to catch on each year

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.007
when the cold is at its worst,
but it never ever does!

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:10.888
[YOSHIKAWA] Well,
it is against the dress code.

00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:12.934
You're lookin' a little too
sharp, though, Miyamura,

00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:15.523
so why not add some flair
to show it off, yeah?

00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:16.608
[MIYAMURA]
But, okay?

00:18:16.691 --> 00:18:18.612
[ISHIKAWA]
He's violating the dress code.

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:20.281
And you want him to flaunt it?

00:18:21.158 --> 00:18:22.578
[IURA]
Aw, that's lit!

00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:25.543
Put those shades back in
the student council room, Shu!

00:18:25.626 --> 00:18:28.924
[IURA] Pose your fingers
more like this. Doped!

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:29.968
[MIYAMURA]
D-Dope.

00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:32.472
[HORI] Enough! Take your
modern Japanese textbook

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:34.184
and go bother your own class!

00:18:34.268 --> 00:18:35.270
Argh!

00:18:35.353 --> 00:18:37.567
Now I'm gonna wonder
why Shu's so big on hoodies

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.819
for the rest of the day.

00:18:38.902 --> 00:18:40.447
Maybe they're like
the ultimate item

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:41.533
that he can equip.

00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:44.288
Whereas my stats probably
take a hit

00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:45.583
while I'm wearing a hoodie.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.589
Seems I gotta channel Iura,
I guess, to rock this look.

00:18:48.672 --> 00:18:49.716
[laughs]

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:53.557
No. Do not make Iura
your finish line.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.228
Strive to be like anybody
except him.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:18:57.481
[MIYAMURA]
Poor Iura.

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.441
[creaks]

00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:01.447
Ha! So it's true!
You are breaking dress code!

00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:02.992
[MIYAMURA]
Morning, Mister President.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:03.994
Good morning!

00:19:04.704 --> 00:19:07.167
I ran into Iura in the hall
just now.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.839
He was thrilled to tell me
you've adopted "his style?"

00:19:09.923 --> 00:19:12.595
More like
I'm borrowing it for the day.

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:15.099
Did you tell off Iura
for his hoodie?

00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.268
Don't play faves.

00:19:16.352 --> 00:19:17.980
[SENGOKU]
He's a lost cause.

00:19:18.064 --> 00:19:20.360
I don't waste my breath on him.
So, no.

00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:22.657
[MIYAMURA]
Poor Iura.

00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:24.869
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Yes! Lunch time!

00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:29.671
Hey. The school got a new flavor
of hot tea today. You see it?

00:19:29.754 --> 00:19:31.257
Not yet! What is it?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.135
One you'll like, I'm sure.

00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.306
[YOSHIKAWA]
To the tea!

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.897
[HORI] Hold up, Miyamura.
Your hood's rumpled.

00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:40.901
Oh. Is it?

00:19:40.985 --> 00:19:42.112
Thank you.

00:19:42.195 --> 00:19:44.784
If you're gonna break
school rules, make it look good.

00:19:45.536 --> 00:19:48.165
[BOTH sigh]

00:19:48.249 --> 00:19:51.506
Aah! Jeez! What prompted you
to do that?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.009
[HORI]
Curiosity. Because that hoodie.

00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:56.056
That's all right.
[sighs]

I can't fool Hori.

[ISHIKAWA]
Whatcha think?

00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:02.528
Gonna wear it again?

00:20:02.612 --> 00:20:04.741
Nah. Tomorrow,
it's back to my cardigan.

Miyamura, you coming over?

00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:21.691
No! I need to head
home today! See ya later!

00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:24.739
Do not tell me
they had another fight.

Great morning!
This warm weather rocks!

Yeah. Very sunny.

to ditch your scarf?

-Hmm!

Come here a sec.

kinda anxious about this.

Uh! That's, uh, awesome.

I should've known
that's what she was up to.

Miyamura, you have
a wonderfully unique smell.

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:14.505
I was surprised
when I couldn't pick it up

00:21:14.589 --> 00:21:15.507
from that white hoodie.

He left it at my apartment
the last time he stayed over.

[HORI]
I knew it.

00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:29.075
I ran it through the wash,
so how did your nose know?

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.788
Because it was obvious to me.

Well, that makes one of us.
