[MIYAMURA]
Morning, Hori household.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.179
[KYOSUKE]
Kyoko. Sweetie?

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:09.561
Look who came by to
escort you to school today.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.064
Hey, Hori. Good morning.

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:12.274
[Hori groggy]

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:14.403
Walking together was your idea.

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:16.074
[Hori groggy]

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:18.663
In fact, you were the one
who said we should leave early.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.833
[KYOSUKE] There was a horror
special on last night

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:21.919
that kept her up late.

00:00:22.294 --> 00:00:23.673
Yeah.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.052
You've gotta go get changed.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.433
-[groggy]
-Wash your face really well.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.404
[KYOSUKE] Since she'll be
a minute, want some coffee?

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.617
Sure. 'Preciate you, Kyosuke.

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:40.455
[FEMALE REPORTER] We're at the
scene of the alleged murder.

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:42.001
Do you know where that is?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.299
A neighboring prefecture.
I just got chills.

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.227
[FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR 213A]
For our next top story--

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:55.695
[KYOSUKE]
Ooh. It's cold.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.201
Thanks for
all the delicious food.

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:00.370
[WEATHER WOMAN]
So it's going to be

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.749
unseasonably warm up north.

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.126
[MIYAMURA]
Good grief!

00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:07.259
If it's cool, may I please go
knock on Hori's door?

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:08.637
[KYOSUKE]
Do whatcha gotta.

00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:11.392
Wait a sec! She hasn't
finished getting dressed?

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:14.148
[MIYAMURA]
[knocking] Hori?

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.194
I'm coming in, okay?

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.661
Huh?
She fell back asleep.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.749
You. Have.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.462
To. Wake. Up. Hori!

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:27.926
[MIYAMURA] Just gonna leave
without brushing your hair?

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:29.888
[HORI]
No.

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.973
[MIYAMURA]
That's what I thought.

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.894
Sit up,
and face that direction.

00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.303
Better get a move on.

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:52.099
-Don't wanna be late.
-Hmm?

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:54.521
[HORi]
Bathroom first.

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:57.443
'Kay.
Meet ya by the front door.

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:00.365
[SOTA]
Later, bro!

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:02.954
Bye. Have a good day.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.585
Come on.

00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:07.881
-[Hori screaming]
-Huh?

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:09.509
[Hori pants]

00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:12.014
Miyamura!
What happened to my hair?

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.855
[MIYAMURA] Well,
it was really messy, so.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.151
We get invited to a party
and no one told me?

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:20.698
Figured I shouldn't do a
ponytail with all the cowlicks.

00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.119
-Oh, man!
-Are you ditching it?

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.207
It doesn't go with my uniform!

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:27.712
You're ditching it.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:29.340
Uh-ah--

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.139
You, um, really think
it looks good on me?

00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:42.115
Yeah!

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:44.245
Fine! The fun bun stays!

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:45.915
Fun bun!

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.129
[HORI]
It's not weird? You promise?

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:50.967
[MIYAMURA]
I promise. It's super cute.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:53.514
[HORI]
I'm cute?

00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:57.605
[MIYAMURA] Huh. Guess I'm
good at baking and making buns.

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.966
[YOSHIKAWA] Oh! Hori!
You're cuter than cute!

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.137
Can I, like, copy you?

00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:38.974
-Go right ahead.
-Yeah, it does look nice.

00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:41.312
-[ISHIKAWA] Do it yourself?
-Possibly. [giggles]

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:42.940
I totes have to try it!

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.611
Your hair might be
a little too short

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.155
to rock the fun bun style.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.660
-Aww. You think?
-Ten billion percent.

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:50.455
Womp, womp, womp.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.589
Oh? Kyon-Kyon!
You look so cute!

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.092
There's some kind of occasion?

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:58.179
-Not exactly.
-A change of hair...

00:04:58.262 --> 00:05:00.141
[MIYAMURA]
Her hair's probably too fine.

00:05:01.018 --> 00:05:03.439
[SENGOKU] Hey. Care to share
what you're staring at?

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:05.694
Ah! What now?

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:07.405
And as for you.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.243
Yeah, I don't see that
working out.

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:10.913
You just don't have enough.

00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:13.000
You're saying I'm lacking
in something?

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:15.756
[MIYAMURA]
Hmm? But Kono.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.887
A side braid would suit her
better than a bun.

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:21.433
Hmm. Everybody's different.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:23.062
Thanks for waiting!

00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:25.400
I swear! I've gotten
compliments nonstop!

00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:26.695
Well, yeah.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.199
Cuteness
should get compliments.

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:32.122
And you're the cutest of all,
no contest.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.546
[MIYAMURA]
Senseless violence!

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:38.594
You'll have to play
with my hair more often.

00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:40.263
Hmm?

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.019
Maybe I'll try a braid the
next time you let me style it.

00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:45.649
[MIYAMURA] So, she really
does like the bun.

00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:48.404
[HORI]
Oh! My neck feels cold.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.450
[MIYAMURA]
Does it?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.497
-Ah!
-Don't you dare ruin it!

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:55.878
[ISHIKAWA]
What are they doing?

00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:59.092
Miyamura's hair is too silky,
and it bugs me.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.640
Zero cowlicks. And combs
pass through it like butter.

00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:03.977
Aah. You don't say.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:06.650
It's not fair! He's a boy!

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:10.031
Then make artificial cowlicks,
so it's not as perfect.

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:11.743
[HORI]
So I say I have no bread,

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:13.245
and you say,
"Let them eat cake?"

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.043
[SENGOKU] No, I said make it
"not as perfect."

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.713
Like, by tying it up
for a while.

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:20.218
That'd leave temporary
creases in it, at least.

00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:23.307
I gotcha! And it's much easier
than using a flatiron, too!

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.063
[SENGOKU]
Don't go overboard. okay?

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:28.694
Ah!

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:31.115
All finished!

00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:33.077
[MIYAMURA]
What did I do to deserve this?

00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:42.053
[groans]

00:06:43.264 --> 00:06:44.809
There! Aah!

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:47.648
That takes care of that.

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:48.942
[KONO]
Thank you, Sengoku.

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.321
Oh, um, it was nothing.

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:53.994
[KONO] I've always thought
we did a decent job

00:06:54.077 --> 00:06:55.622
of keeping files organized.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.545
But we've actually got way
more stuff than I realized.

00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:01.885
Well, we do constantly
receive paperwork.

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:04.347
All that aside, though.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.893
[gasps]

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.855
[SENGOKU]
That was some balancing act.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.359
I almost had a heart attack
seeing you up on that chair.

00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:12.238
-What if you fell?
-[KONO] Sorry,

00:07:12.322 --> 00:07:14.201
but someone had to clean
that dusty cabinet.

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:16.497
[SENGOKU]
You a clean freak?

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.167
Well, Yoshikawa and Iura

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:19.921
both cough a lot
when they visit here.

00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:21.549
Maybe dust could be
the cause of it.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.096
Were you two discussing
how amazing I am?

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:25.223
-Oh?
-[SENGOKU] Nope.

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:27.227
-[KONO] Sure weren't.
-I heard my name!

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.314
-Getting organized?
-[KONO] Mm-hm.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.276
Let the students who inherit it
next term

00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:32.863
have a fresh start
in every way.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.702
[IURA] Careful. This box
looks like it might fall.

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:38.415
Oh. Literal seconds ago,
Sengoku--

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.128
I'll take it down to be
on the safe side.

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:42.257
This, another box that was
on top of that cabinet?

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:43.844
Um! Uh-huh!

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.014
Gosh, you guys are great!

00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:48.185
Thank you!
[gasps]

00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.526
[SENGOKU]
Ishikawa is an athlete,

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:53.445
so his strength
makes total sense.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.907
What I can't figure out

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:57.538
is where Iura's extra muscle
came from.

00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:58.957
Guess I could've bulked up

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.003
from helping my grandpa
move furniture.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.925
-Furniture?
-Trash duty complete!

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.428
Welcome back, Remi.

00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:07.933
Huh?
And Hori? Wait.

00:08:09.352 --> 00:08:10.981
Before you give
the trash to Ayasaki,

00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:13.068
please sort it for her.
I just caught her dumping

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:14.530
all of it into the same bin.

00:08:14.614 --> 00:08:15.616
[KONO]
Remi!

00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:16.993
[AYASAKI]
Won't happen again!

00:08:17.493 --> 00:08:20.333
Thank you for setting
her straight, Hori. Really.

00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:22.963
But, I doubt
we'll have another trash run

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:24.132
before we graduate.

00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:25.928
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:27.640
Hey, is Ayasaki here?

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:29.351
Oh, you're all here.

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:30.979
Hi, Yanagin!

00:08:31.104 --> 00:08:33.192
Do you need Remi
for something special?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.779
Sorry, but no.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.618
I just found your cell phone
over by the trash area.

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:39.914
I do remember you
setting it down

00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:41.584
when we were
throwing stuff away.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:42.836
Thanks, Yanagin!

00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:45.049
-Lucky thing you walked by.
-Sure.

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:47.262
Are you all fixing up the room?

00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:49.391
-May I help?
-That's okay.

00:08:49.474 --> 00:08:51.103
This stuff is heavy
and hard to...

00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:53.232
You know,
someone might trip over this.

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:54.860
The corner's
a much better spot.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.908
[SENGOKU] Miyamura,
get your butt over here!

00:08:57.992 --> 00:08:58.994
Why, though?

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:00.454
'Cause he'd feel better
in the presence
