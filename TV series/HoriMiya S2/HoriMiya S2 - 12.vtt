00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:31.893
You see? It fits!
So there! Hah!

00:09:33.062 --> 00:09:34.523
Isn't a hoodie, like, cheating?

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.694
They're all designed to be
big and baggy.

00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:37.780
Ah.

00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:40.994
In tighter clothes, y'know
your chest looks a bit bigger.

00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:43.082
That's quite a shocking feat.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.211
[HORI]
Shut up! You suck!

00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:46.964
[KYOSUKE]
But...

00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:48.593
[both]
It's normal for a high schooler

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:51.390
to not fit in an elementary
schooler's clothes.

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.394
[calling bell rings]

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:54.814
-Huh?
-Ah?

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:56.567
Will you get the door?

00:09:57.318 --> 00:09:59.114
[HORI] Huh.
Let's see him argue with this!

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:02.370
Fits like a glove!

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:04.457
Hey. that's Sota's shirt.

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.296
Huh? Aah!

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.136
Miyamura!
What are you doing here?

00:10:10.595 --> 00:10:11.806
[KYOSUKE]
You said I could invite him.

00:10:12.014 --> 00:10:13.016
I did not!

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:14.895
Aah! I'm mortified!

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:16.774
Must be cold
with your bellybutton out.

00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:18.737
Meaning his eyes are going
straight to your "pudge."

00:10:18.903 --> 00:10:21.283
So what part of the cow do we
get pudge meat from, then?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.578
[HORI]
Shut up!

00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.124
Your family's always
so much fun, Hori.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.462
Why am I not having
any fun, then?

00:10:28.297 --> 00:10:30.510
'Cause I gained weight
from eating mochi, that's why.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.058
[MIYAMURA] Girls really stress
about how much they weigh, huh?

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:37.524
So, why did you put on
a fashion show?

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:39.444
Hmph. That is the question.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.033
I asked Kyosuke for a shirt,
and it went downhill.

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:45.122
'Cause she got possessed
by a creepy devil ant!

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:47.084
-Huh?
-Wait, I think

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:48.671
she was possessed by a deviant?

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.884
What? Just because she asked
to borrow a shirt?

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.930
Hey, Sissy?
If you're possessed,

00:10:53.013 --> 00:10:54.307
then is our house haunted now?

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.392
[HORI]
Shut up!

00:10:55.977 --> 00:10:56.979
You shut up!

00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:58.691
I swear,
when you shout like that,

00:10:58.775 --> 00:10:59.777
you're the loudest one here!

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.739
-If you want me to stop--
-Since you're here,

00:11:01.864 --> 00:11:03.325
might as well join us
for dinner.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:04.745
Oh! I appreciate you

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.081
-for letting me stay.
-Start taking responsibility

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.335
for your own actions
or you'll live to regret it.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.420
You could even wind up in jail

00:11:09.588 --> 00:11:11.132
-like some criminal. -Let's
dig in before it gets cold.

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.260
-Okay!
-[HORI] A criminal?!

00:11:12.426 --> 00:11:13.470
[HORI]
If anyone in our family

00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:14.932
is looking at doing time,
it's you!

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:17.019
Your life needs a do-over,
stat!

00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:19.482
Even if I do it over,
I would still be your father!

00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:22.405
Every time in every life!
Rest assured!

00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:23.490
[HORI]
How can I rest?

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:27.248
[chuckles] Oh, man. Never
a dull moment at the Hori's.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.515
[giggles]

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:37.310
[HORI]
Sota!

00:11:39.147 --> 00:11:40.316
You made another mess!

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.821
I'm gonna clean it all up
the second I get done!

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:43.948
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.409
I'm telling the truth!

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.204
You always
leave your messes behind.

00:11:47.288 --> 00:11:48.833
I wasn't gonna this time!

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.421
Just what are you kiddos
so angry about?

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:53.175
He leaves his messes
all over the place

00:11:53.258 --> 00:11:54.929
-and doesn't clean them.
-Nuh-uh!

00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:56.181
She started griping at me

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:58.185
before I even had a chance
to clean my stuff!

00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.941
-She does love griping.
-Kyosuke.

00:12:01.232 --> 00:12:03.403
So you're brushing me off
and taking his side, then?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.744
I brewed us some tea.
You all thirsty?

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:09.625
[ALL]
Listen to this!

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:12.129
Um. Sure.

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.050
But why don't we have
a seat first?

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:19.435
Uh.

00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.402
Lately, I noticed that Sota's
been cleaning up really well.

00:12:25.406 --> 00:12:26.867
So he gets the benefit
of the doubt

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.538
if he says he was gonna
clean it up later.

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.084
You get really angry,
and it's so unfair!

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.754
Stop! It's not nice!

00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:33.923
Oh-oh.

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:35.677
[KYOSUKE]
Poke, poke.

00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:39.058
Hey. Your daddy's
on your side, okay?

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.479
[gasps]
Do you mean it?

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.862
You're trying to teach
your little bro some manners.

00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.241
But you always jump the gun
and end up getting so mad.

00:12:47.617 --> 00:12:48.619
It's beyond short-tempered,

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.790
so I have to wonder
if you're all right sometimes.

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:52.376
-[chuckles]
-[MIYAMURA] Bad move!

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.299
I said not to upset her,

00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:57.971
but you went and did it without
a second thought anyway!

00:12:58.096 --> 00:12:59.892
It was purely by accident,
though!

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:02.689
Hmm. Open up, Sissy!

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:04.526
C'mon, sweetheart!

Your daddy's on your side,
remember?

There's nothing to be
upset about!

Oh. She's out.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.460

-Hori, pl--
-Hands to yourself.

00:13:18.303 --> 00:13:20.517
Where'd this "Hands
to yourself" stuff come from?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.269
Uhh. My guess?

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.525
It's her way of letting us know
she's mad.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.946
[MIYAMURA]
Look! He's cleaning!

00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:29.117
Sota's cleaning the mess

-Hori.
-Same to you.

I don't understand
what's wrong!

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.982
Seems bleak.

00:13:45.232 --> 00:13:47.696
We'll have to work our way to
her good side little by little.

00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:53.206
Hey, want some pudding?

00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:55.460
-I gave it up.
-You look tense.

00:13:55.628 --> 00:13:57.089
-Want a shoulder rub?
-Hands to yourself.

00:13:57.632 --> 00:13:59.260
[KYOSUKE] But, Kyoko--
[HORI] Hands to yourself.

00:13:59.636 --> 00:14:00.638
[KYOSUKE] Aw.

[door opens]

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:11.827
Guess what?
Now we're in outer space!

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:16.670
What are you talking about?
We're inside.

00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:19.091
-[gasps]
-Do you have to be so blunt?

00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.680
This is outer space,
and we're in a spaceship,

00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:22.807
and if you go outside,
you'll die

00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.477
a horrible death
by suffocating!

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:27.191
Then the aliens will come
and eat all of your organs!

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:29.111
-Don't die!
-Speak for yourself!

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.074
I wanna go to outer space!

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.326
[HORI] Pull your notes
and textbooks

00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:33.579
back out this second!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.294
[SOTA]
If you leave this blue rug,

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:38.756
you'll die
'cause there's no air.

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:41.386
Huh. Where did you even
find this rug?

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:43.139
A previous space odyssey?

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:44.935
It's a spaceship,
and it's gonna help us

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.020
build a moon villa!

00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:47.106
[MIYAMURA]
Sounds good!

00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:48.483
Hmm.

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:51.197
-Uh.
-Huh?

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:55.999
[screaming]

00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:58.546
My big sister murdered me!

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:01.760
[laughing]
Address me as "Captain" now!

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:04.432
[MIYAMURA]
Captain Cold-blood, maybe.

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:07.772
Hang on tight,
'cause we're circling Mars!

00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:08.941
[gasps]

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:14.536
Aw! This Martian just agreed
to be my best friend! Yay!

00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.122
You're best friends?

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:19.170
Why am I dead?

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:21.007
[MIYAMURA]
She hijacked the ship

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.261
and instantly
started replacing the crew.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:25.223
Just who is this woman?

00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:27.394
-Oh-oh.
-Sissy!

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:29.775
-No. Lemme see it!
-Ooh.

00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:30.943
Gonna have to try
harder than that!

00:15:31.027 --> 00:15:32.906
Hey, so, Hori.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.287
How 'bout
we let Sota come back?

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.420
If we do,
he'll grow into a weak man.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:42.801
He'll think if he simply asks,
he'll get his way.

00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:46.057
He was the one who decided
we'd die if we left the rug.

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:47.769
I didn't do that.

00:15:48.938 --> 00:15:51.067
The only thing I did was
push him.

00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:54.281
Hmm.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.539
-Hmm.
-What's that?

00:15:58.248 --> 00:15:59.375
You got yourself a new ship?

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:00.920
Yeah.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:03.843
I successfully boarded
one of the escape pod thingies.

00:16:04.928 --> 00:16:07.182
Fueled by the sorrow
of your remorseless betrayal,

00:16:07.892 --> 00:16:09.436
I will set out on
my quest for revenge.

00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:10.690
[HORI] Do you even know
what that means?

00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:12.652
-Hmm.
-You can do it, Sota!

00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:14.113
That's right!

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.411
To think we had a spy
in our midst the entire time!

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:19.708
It's an OG crew member
that I'm cheering for!

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:21.795
Well, I suppose,

00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:23.799
I'll have to turn into
one of those captains,

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.720
who can only put faith
in herself.

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:29.018
Man. This is a lot.

00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:31.397
[Hori laughing]

00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:33.401
Hi-yah!

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:36.365
All right! I beat her!
