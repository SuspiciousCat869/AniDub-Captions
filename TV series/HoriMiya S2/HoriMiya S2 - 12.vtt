00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.310
[sighs]

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:11.231
Hey.

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:12.817
Hmm?

00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:14.655
[YURIKO]
Are you a first-year?

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:17.117
Depends. Who's askin'?

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.040
This place isn't exactly
a parking lot.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.712
Maybe leave your bike
somewhere else.

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:26.762
[KYOSUKE] Shouldn't she tell me
not to ride this to school?

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:28.933
What an odd upper classman.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.820
Driving motorbikes to school
was against the rules.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.285
But my buddy told me the area
behind the old club building

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:39.871
was a great place to hide one.

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:52.689
[MALE TEACHER] Leave something
behind the old club building?

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:53.774
[gasps]

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:55.570
If what I just said
rings a bell,

00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:56.947
then please step forward.

00:00:58.408 --> 00:00:59.619
[KYOSUKE] Turns out
the teachers found

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.915
that hiding spot
by the end of my last class.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.713
Lucky for me,
I'd taken that girl's advice

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.382
and parked my bike
somewhere else.

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.227
Jerk! You stay away from me!

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:14.566
Yeah, I got it.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.277
[growls]

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:19.033
[KYOSUKE]
I wasn't a delinquent,

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.327
and I definitely wasn't stupid.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.373
But I was popular
with the girls,

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:23.918
and pressed my luck
a time or two.

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:26.590
[groans]

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.093
[KYOSUKE]
That one stung.

00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:30.765
[YURIKO] The previous girl
was a little friendlier.

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.271
Anyway.
Since you're, uh, "free."

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:35.900
Could you lend a hand?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.029
They aren't that heavy,
but it's a lot to carry.

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:39.156
Ah!

00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:42.622
[KYOSUKE] So,
you're on the student council?

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.041
Kind of, yeah.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.003
The stuff I do
is mostly grunt work, though.

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:48.634
It's too many boxes
for just one person.

00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.513
No one even helps you out?

00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:53.769
The rest of the council
is tied up with other things.

00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:55.021
Oh, speaking of.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:56.567
Sengoku!

00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.488
Hmm? Koyanagi.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.702
Took you long enough.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.622
Do you realize
we're in a time crunch?

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.712
Any delays on your end
impede the entire council.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:07.964
I'll try to be quicker.

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:13.224
Everything's here.
Good. Nice work.

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:15.479
You're free to go now.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.232
You and your helper.

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.157
Hmm. Is there something else?

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:23.621
You made a girl lug
a ton of boxes here.

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:25.666
And "Nice work" is all you got?

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.256
Can't even spare a "Thank you",
Mister President?

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:30.968
Ah...

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.516
[TAKERU] What's your name?
And what class are you from?

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.105
The name's Kyosuke Hori.
Class one-nine.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:42.115
I'm Takeru Sengoku,
of class three-one.

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:46.959
I advise you
to wear your uniform correctly.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.169
Ah!

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.673
Oh, and...

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.469
Koyanagi. Thank you.

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:53.931
[gasps]

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.356
â™ª

00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:01.445
Sorry for butting in like that.

00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:02.699
Like what?

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.828
Calling out the Prez,
and making it awkward

00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:06.707
for you to be involved
with the council now.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:09.420
If it really does get awkward,
then I'll just quit.

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:12.134
[KYOSUKE]
Ah. She's all right.

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:15.432
You're, um, Koyanagi.

00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:16.977
-Huh?
-Right?

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:19.148
[smiles]

00:03:19.273 --> 00:03:20.610
[YURIKO]
Yuriko Koyanagi.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:22.572
Should've introduced myself
sooner.

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:24.074
[smirks]

00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:26.580
[KYOSUKE]
Yuriko.

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.211
Sounds nice. Yuriko Koyanagi.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.804
I went to a dog cafe
the other day,

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:36.892
and there was a pup
that looked just like you!

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.229
[KYOSUKE] They say a person's
name captures who they are.

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.570
Hers definitely does.

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.406
'Cause she is truly
as beautiful

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.369
as a lily when she smiles.

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.047
After you graduate,
what's next for you?

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:56.097
Hmm. I haven't
made a decision yet.

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:58.017
-Have you, Hori?
-Me?

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.940
Um. No clue at all.

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:02.234
It's tough.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.486
[chuckles]

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.535
Say, Koyanagi.

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:09.081
When you graduate.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.630
And even after you graduate...

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:16.722
Nah. Forget it.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:18.767
Oh.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.648
[KYOSUKE] I was afraid
if I held on too tight,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.527
I'd crush that flower.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:29.288
[FEMALE STUDENT 212C]
Fess up. What's Kyosuke to you?

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.212
When I heard that he was
crazy about some third-year,

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:35.216
I figured you had to be
drop-dead-gorgeous,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.720
but you're, like,
not even cute?

00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:40.060
-'Kay.
-Ah.

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:43.107
Did a single thing I just said
get through to you?

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:44.778
Hurry up and graduate

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:46.907
so you can get your
frumpy ass away from him!

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:51.123
-Yuriko!
-Oh. Hi.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.837
-Kyosuke?
-I'd be downright amazed

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.925
if she deserved this treatment,
so back off!

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:58.221
This is between us girls,
so you back off!

00:04:58.304 --> 00:05:00.141
-Oh, you wish!
-That's enough, Kyosuke.

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:01.227
Uh.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.651
A man should never raise
his hand against a woman. Ever!

00:05:05.193 --> 00:05:07.030
Ah. Yeah, I know--

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:08.617
Oh.

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:11.873
[YURIKO] But, women
can smack each other.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:13.919
If they ask for it.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.927
[KYOSUKE]
She was as gentle as a flower.

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:20.056
Except this lily...

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:22.477
had a rose's thorns.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:27.112
That's when I knew
I was gonna make

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:28.657
Yuriko my wife one day.

00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:30.911
Cool story, man.

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.584
Listen, a slap from Kyoko's
a sign of love.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.211
She gets it from her mom.

00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:36.673
I'll keep that in mind.

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:39.011
[KYOSUKE]
So. Why'd she slap you?

00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.808
[MIYAMURA]
Huh. Why did she slap me?

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:45.106
Ah. You forgot?
Happens to me, too.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:48.237
Well, her wrath may come
from a place of affection,

00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:49.908
but you should still proceed
with caution.

00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:53.039
Right. Oh, my gosh!

00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.544
Hmm? What is it?
You remember?

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:57.798
No,
but, for some strange reason,

00:05:57.882 --> 00:05:59.594
my cheek just started hurting
a lot more!

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:00.971
I didn't realize
Yuriko passed on

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:02.558
the aftershock effect, too!

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:04.854
-[Miyamura groans] Ow.
-[KYOSUKE] Okay.

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:07.944
-Why does it hurt? Tell me.
-Just stay strong, son.

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.906
Why does it hurt?

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:46.933
[HORI]
Hey, Kyosuke?

00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:48.770
Can I borrow
one of your shirts?

00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:49.856
A T-shirt's fine.

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:52.402
What for?
You gotta clean up a mess?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.822
Not today.

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:56.076
All the shirts I usually wear
after I take a bath

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.080
are in the laundry, so I need
a sub for tonight.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.168
My shirts aren't cute, though.

00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:02.923
If you gave me a cute one,
I'd throw it in your face.

00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:06.263
Every shirt I own's just gonna
swallow you whole.

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:09.060
-You okay with that?
-Do I have a choice?

00:08:09.854 --> 00:08:11.273
Look, Sissy! Check it out!

00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:13.277
Mom bought me
this super awesome cat!

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:14.947
[HORI]
W-Wow.

00:08:15.198 --> 00:08:17.912
And this kitty floats in water!
Isn't that cool?

00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:19.039
[chuckles]

00:08:22.128 --> 00:08:23.757
You're a devil ant!

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.884
"A devil ant?"

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:26.930
Hang on, did you mean
to say, "Deviant?"

00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:29.602
Oh, Kyoko. Honey.

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:33.192
Have you developed a...
brother compound?

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:36.031
[HORI] "Compound?"
You mean "Complex?"

00:08:36.156 --> 00:08:37.534
Of course not!
I was just wondering

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.329
if I could squeeze
into Sota's clothes!

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:41.584
They're probably too small.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.590
Over New Year's, you ate mochi
like it was going outta style.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.468
Wait. What?

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:48.765
Are you calling me fat,
'cause sure sounds like it!

00:08:49.182 --> 00:08:51.103
No.
I said you ate a lot of food.

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:52.355
Same difference, idiot!

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:54.067
Well, someone's cranky.

00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:57.240
If you want proof I can fit
in his clothes, fine by me!

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.327
Hey, grab me a shirt
from your closet, all right?

00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:02.000
Me? No, I don't wanna.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.004
[HORI] Never mind!
I'll get it myself!

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.385
Is it cool if I invite
your boyfriend to see?

00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:08.680
Sure! Why the hell not?

00:09:10.308 --> 00:09:12.563
It's an average evening,
yet so lively.

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:14.859
Miyamura? Are you busy?

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:17.906
We're holding HFW here.
You should come.

00:09:18.073 --> 00:09:20.244
-HFW?
-[KYOSUKE] What?

00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:22.290
[KYOSUKE] You've never heard of
Hori Fashion Week?

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.795
Well, I guess tonight's
is the first one ever.

00:09:25.087 --> 00:09:27.300
Oh! It's a play on
Paris Fashion Week!

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:31.893
You see? It fits!
So there! Hah!

00:09:33.062 --> 00:09:34.523
Isn't a hoodie, like, cheating?

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.694
They're all designed to be
big and baggy.

00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:37.780
Ah.

00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:40.994
In tighter clothes, y'know
your chest looks a bit bigger.

00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:43.082
That's quite a shocking feat.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.211
[HORI]
Shut up! You suck!

00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:46.964
[KYOSUKE]
But...

00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:48.593
[both]
It's normal for a high schooler

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:51.390
to not fit in an elementary
schooler's clothes.

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.394
[calling bell rings]

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:54.814
-Huh?
-Ah?

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:56.567
Will you get the door?

00:09:57.318 --> 00:09:59.114
[HORI] Huh.
Let's see him argue with this!

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:02.370
Fits like a glove!

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:04.457
Hey. that's Sota's shirt.

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.296
Huh? Aah!

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.136
Miyamura!
What are you doing here?

00:10:10.595 --> 00:10:11.806
[KYOSUKE]
You said I could invite him.

00:10:12.014 --> 00:10:13.016
I did not!

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:14.895
Aah! I'm mortified!

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:16.774
Must be cold
with your bellybutton out.

00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:18.737
Meaning his eyes are going
straight to your "pudge."

00:10:18.903 --> 00:10:21.283
So what part of the cow do we
get pudge meat from, then?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.578
[HORI]
Shut up!

00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.124
Your family's always
so much fun, Hori.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.462
Why am I not having
any fun, then?

00:10:28.297 --> 00:10:30.510
'Cause I gained weight
from eating mochi, that's why.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.058
[MIYAMURA] Girls really stress
about how much they weigh, huh?

00:10:35.352 --> 00:10:37.524
So, why did you put on
a fashion show?

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:39.444
Hmph. That is the question.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.033
I asked Kyosuke for a shirt,
and it went downhill.

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:45.122
'Cause she got possessed
by a creepy devil ant!

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:47.084
-Huh?
-Wait, I think

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:48.671
she was possessed by a deviant?

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.884
What? Just because she asked
to borrow a shirt?

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.930
Hey, Sissy?
If you're possessed,

00:10:53.013 --> 00:10:54.307
then is our house haunted now?

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.392
[HORI]
Shut up!

00:10:55.977 --> 00:10:56.979
You shut up!

00:10:57.104 --> 00:10:58.691
I swear,
when you shout like that,

00:10:58.775 --> 00:10:59.777
you're the loudest one here!

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.739
-If you want me to stop--
-Since you're here,

00:11:01.864 --> 00:11:03.325
might as well join us
for dinner.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:04.745
Oh! I appreciate you

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.081
-for letting me stay.
-Start taking responsibility

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.335
for your own actions
or you'll live to regret it.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.420
You could even wind up in jail

00:11:09.588 --> 00:11:11.132
-like some criminal. -Let's
dig in before it gets cold.

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.260
-Okay!
-[HORI] A criminal?!

00:11:12.426 --> 00:11:13.470
[HORI]
If anyone in our family

00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:14.932
is looking at doing time,
it's you!

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:17.019
Your life needs a do-over,
stat!

00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:19.482
Even if I do it over,
I would still be your father!

00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:22.405
Every time in every life!
Rest assured!

00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:23.490
[HORI]
How can I rest?

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:27.248
[chuckles] Oh, man. Never
a dull moment at the Hori's.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.515
[giggles]

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:37.310
[HORI]
Sota!

00:11:39.147 --> 00:11:40.316
You made another mess!

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.821
I'm gonna clean it all up
the second I get done!

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:43.948
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.409
I'm telling the truth!

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.204
You always
leave your messes behind.

00:11:47.288 --> 00:11:48.833
I wasn't gonna this time!

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.421
Just what are you kiddos
so angry about?

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:53.175
He leaves his messes
all over the place

00:11:53.258 --> 00:11:54.929
-and doesn't clean them.
-Nuh-uh!

00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:56.181
She started griping at me

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:58.185
before I even had a chance
to clean my stuff!

00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.941
-She does love griping.
-Kyosuke.

00:12:01.232 --> 00:12:03.403
So you're brushing me off
and taking his side, then?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.744
I brewed us some tea.
You all thirsty?

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:09.625
[ALL]
Listen to this!

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:12.129
Um. Sure.

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.050
But why don't we have
a seat first?

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:19.435
Uh.

00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:23.402
Lately, I noticed that Sota's
been cleaning up really well.

00:12:25.406 --> 00:12:26.867
So he gets the benefit
of the doubt

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.538
if he says he was gonna
clean it up later.

00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.084
You get really angry,
and it's so unfair!

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.754
Stop! It's not nice!

00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:33.923
Oh-oh.

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:35.677
[KYOSUKE]
Poke, poke.

00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:39.058
Hey. Your daddy's
on your side, okay?

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.479
[gasps]
Do you mean it?

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.862
You're trying to teach
your little bro some manners.

00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.241
But you always jump the gun
and end up getting so mad.

00:12:47.617 --> 00:12:48.619
It's beyond short-tempered,

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.790
so I have to wonder
if you're all right sometimes.

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:52.376
-[chuckles]
-[MIYAMURA] Bad move!

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.299
I said not to upset her,

00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:57.971
but you went and did it without
a second thought anyway!

00:12:58.096 --> 00:12:59.892
It was purely by accident,
though!

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:02.689
Hmm. Open up, Sissy!

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:04.526
C'mon, sweetheart!

Your daddy's on your side,
remember?

There's nothing to be
upset about!

Oh. She's out.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.460

-Hori, pl--
-Hands to yourself.

00:13:18.303 --> 00:13:20.517
Where'd this "Hands
to yourself" stuff come from?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.269
Uhh. My guess?

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.525
It's her way of letting us know
she's mad.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.946
[MIYAMURA]
Look! He's cleaning!

00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:29.117
Sota's cleaning the mess

-Hori.
-Same to you.

I don't understand
what's wrong!

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.982
Seems bleak.

00:13:45.232 --> 00:13:47.696
We'll have to work our way to
her good side little by little.

00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:53.206
Hey, want some pudding?

00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:55.460
-I gave it up.
-You look tense.

00:13:55.628 --> 00:13:57.089
-Want a shoulder rub?
-Hands to yourself.

00:13:57.632 --> 00:13:59.260
[KYOSUKE] But, Kyoko--
[HORI] Hands to yourself.

00:13:59.636 --> 00:14:00.638
[KYOSUKE] Aw.

[door opens]

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:11.827
Guess what?
Now we're in outer space!

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:16.670
What are you talking about?
We're inside.

00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:19.091
-[gasps]
-Do you have to be so blunt?

00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.680
This is outer space,
and we're in a spaceship,

00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:22.807
and if you go outside,
you'll die

00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.477
a horrible death
by suffocating!

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:27.191
Then the aliens will come
and eat all of your organs!

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:29.111
-Don't die!
-Speak for yourself!

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.074
I wanna go to outer space!

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.326
[HORI] Pull your notes
and textbooks

00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:33.579
back out this second!

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.294
[SOTA]
If you leave this blue rug,

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:38.756
you'll die
'cause there's no air.

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:41.386
Huh. Where did you even
find this rug?

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:43.139
A previous space odyssey?

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:44.935
It's a spaceship,
and it's gonna help us

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.020
build a moon villa!

00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:47.106
[MIYAMURA]
Sounds good!

00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:48.483
Hmm.

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:51.197
-Uh.
-Huh?

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:55.999
[screaming]

00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:58.546
My big sister murdered me!

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:01.760
[laughing]
Address me as "Captain" now!

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:04.432
[MIYAMURA]
Captain Cold-blood, maybe.

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:07.772
Hang on tight,
'cause we're circling Mars!

00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:08.941
[gasps]

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:14.536
Aw! This Martian just agreed
to be my best friend! Yay!

00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.122
You're best friends?

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:19.170
Why am I dead?

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:21.007
[MIYAMURA]
She hijacked the ship

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.261
and instantly
started replacing the crew.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:25.223
Just who is this woman?

00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:27.394
-Oh-oh.
-Sissy!

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:29.775
-No. Lemme see it!
-Ooh.

00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:30.943
Gonna have to try
harder than that!

00:15:31.027 --> 00:15:32.906
Hey, so, Hori.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.287
How 'bout
we let Sota come back?

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.420
If we do,
he'll grow into a weak man.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:42.801
He'll think if he simply asks,
he'll get his way.

00:15:43.426 --> 00:15:46.057
He was the one who decided
we'd die if we left the rug.

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:47.769
I didn't do that.

00:15:48.938 --> 00:15:51.067
The only thing I did was
push him.

00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:54.281
Hmm.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.539
-Hmm.
-What's that?

00:15:58.248 --> 00:15:59.375
You got yourself a new ship?

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:00.920
Yeah.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:03.843
I successfully boarded
one of the escape pod thingies.

00:16:04.928 --> 00:16:07.182
Fueled by the sorrow
of your remorseless betrayal,

00:16:07.892 --> 00:16:09.436
I will set out on
my quest for revenge.

00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:10.690
[HORI] Do you even know
what that means?

00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:12.652
-Hmm.
-You can do it, Sota!

00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:14.113
That's right!

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.411
To think we had a spy
in our midst the entire time!

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:19.708
It's an OG crew member
that I'm cheering for!

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:21.795
Well, I suppose,

00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:23.799
I'll have to turn into
one of those captains,

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.720
who can only put faith
in herself.

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:29.018
Man. This is a lot.

00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:31.397
[Hori laughing]

00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:33.401
Hi-yah!

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:36.365
All right! I beat her!

00:16:36.575 --> 00:16:38.954
Vengeance!
How cool was that, bro--

00:16:39.163 --> 00:16:40.917
[screaming]

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.089
[whimpering]

00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:45.885
[MIYAMURA]
Sota, run for it!

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.641
The captain is immortal!

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:58.786
Practicing kanji?

00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:00.413
Mm-hmm.

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:04.714
Lucky. I wish that was
my homework assignment.

00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:06.425
You're a third-year
in high school.

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:10.058
Okay, next are compound words.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.064
"Make one using
the character for woods."

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:14.191
Woodland.

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:16.320
Come on, Hori.

00:17:16.947 --> 00:17:18.909
At least let him
think about it first, yeah?

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.078
Oh!

00:17:20.663 --> 00:17:21.790
[KYOSUKE]
I'm home!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.420
Yeah, that's my smart boy!

00:17:24.629 --> 00:17:26.633
If you need some help
with your homework, just ask!

00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:28.469
You smell like cigarettes, Dad!

00:17:28.846 --> 00:17:29.973
That came outta nowhere!

00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:32.937
-You stink, Kyosuke.
-'Cause of my smokes!

00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:34.733
You make it sound like
I don't take showers!

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:36.110
-Stinky.
-Ah?

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:37.905
[MIYAMURA]
A one-two punch.

00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:41.495
The "So" in your name
is hard to write, huh?

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:43.834
But still, it's impressive

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.921
that you're even learning kanji
at your age.

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:47.884
Uh. We all do?

00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:51.015
Well, let's just say the kanji

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:52.643
for my first name was hard,
too.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.945
[both chuckling]

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:00.659
Huh?

00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:15.271
[footsteps]
Hmm?

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:24.541
Aw, it's so nice when you help
mommy out with the chores!

00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.085
Will you do it again?

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.462
Sure!

00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:31.930
â™ª

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.173
Hey, Sota?
Let's finish up your homework.

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:51.343
Oh?
What are you doing?

00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:53.766
-Hmm? Um!
-Didn't I tell you

00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:55.268
I was going to wash those?

00:18:55.644 --> 00:18:57.189
Yeah. But, I, uh...

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.692
-[HORI] No buts!
-[gasps]

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:05.330
[HORI] He could've
cut himself on the knives.

00:19:06.248 --> 00:19:08.169
-[Sota sobs]
-Ah.

00:19:09.004 --> 00:19:10.841
[crying]

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:12.970
You're a big, dumb Sissy!

00:19:13.137 --> 00:19:15.058
-Huh?
-[crying]

00:19:15.308 --> 00:19:17.020
[HORI] It's dangerous for you
to touch this stuff

00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:18.147
without supervision!

00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:21.403
[SOTA] You always get mad
right away!

00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:23.157
It's not fair!

00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:25.704
[crying]

00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:26.998
Hey, what's wrong?

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:28.292
His attitude!

00:19:28.544 --> 00:19:30.506
He was washing dishes,
by himself.

00:19:30.923 --> 00:19:33.094
-Mm-hmm?
-There are knives and stuff!

00:19:33.469 --> 00:19:34.471
True.

00:19:35.724 --> 00:19:38.187
Well, her wrath may come
from a place of affection,

00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:39.941
but you should still
proceed with caution.

00:19:40.943 --> 00:19:42.947
Don't you think
there was a better way

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.032
to say that, though?

00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.201
Huh?

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:48.625
Dishes are a chore, and he was
just trying to give you a hand.

00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:50.420
He's a first-grader now.

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:53.050
Plus, you've washed 'em before.

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:55.138
-Right, Sota?
-Uh-huh.

00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:59.104
But you understand what
your sister is saying, too,

00:19:59.354 --> 00:20:00.356
don't you?

00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:01.526
Hmm.

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:04.406
You see? He gets it--

00:20:04.532 --> 00:20:05.534
Huh?

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:07.747
Now you're crying?

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:09.834
[sobbing]
I was...

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.380
-just worried about him.
-Oh.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.345
Right! It's not like what you
said and did was wrong!

00:20:15.554 --> 00:20:16.430
It's okay!

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:19.896
-You aren't mad at me?
-[MIYAMURA] I-- wha?

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:22.985
Why would I be mad at you
over something like this?

00:20:23.152 --> 00:20:24.989
I promise I'm not,
cross my heart!

00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:26.576
I was trying to moderate!

00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:28.872
'Cause, both of you were right
in your own way!

00:20:31.962 --> 00:20:33.799
[MIYAMURA]
I-I don't know what to do!

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:37.389
What is this? What's happening?

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:39.434
[all crying]

00:20:39.936 --> 00:20:41.940
Ah. You havin' fun?

00:20:42.482 --> 00:20:43.484
Please help me.

00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:44.696
Well...

00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:47.033
Looks like a nuisance,
I'mma pass.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.087
[MIYAMURA]
Sorry I made you cry.

00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:57.638
Sota's still just a kid,
and I never had siblings.

00:20:58.305 --> 00:21:00.351
I'm a novice when it comes
to disciplining.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.527
You were only trying to do
what's best for him, I'm sure.

00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:05.821
'Cause you love him so much.

00:21:12.877 --> 00:21:14.589
[MIYAMURA]
Guess I was a little too harsh.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:16.885
-I...
-Huh?

00:21:17.803 --> 00:21:20.893
I really hate
when you don't take my side.

00:21:21.728 --> 00:21:22.730
Jerk.

00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:28.658
Ah. I've been on your side
from the start!

00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:30.662
Oh? Huh? Ah.

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:32.917
Well, good.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.258
But, if I do ever think
you're in the wrong,

00:21:37.635 --> 00:21:39.179
you can bet
I'll be angry with you.

00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:40.516
[smiles]

00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:42.393
[MIYAMURA]
She smiled?

00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:44.356
[HORI]
So, this anger you speak of.

00:21:44.607 --> 00:21:47.111
Will you yell, "Don't you dare
do that!" and smack me?

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.241
No! No smacks, Hori!

00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:25.266
I wrote an essay
at school today!

00:23:25.474 --> 00:23:26.728
My teacher says it's great!

00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:28.314
You hear that?

00:23:28.982 --> 00:23:30.986
Sota's teacher really liked
the essay he wrote.

00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:32.363
Oh, my!

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.244
Aww. So family was the topic,
huh?

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:37.123
Excellent choice! Can I see?

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.543
Sure!

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.630
It's called, "My Big Bro!"

00:23:43.135 --> 00:23:44.930
Sorry. Truly, guys.

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.058
Hmm?
