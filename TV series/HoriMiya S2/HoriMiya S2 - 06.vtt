[KONO]
Good morning.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:06.531
Uh. Ah! Sakura!

00:21:06.614 --> 00:21:08.952
Why'd you leave
without me yesterday?

00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.329
Where did you go?

00:21:10.413 --> 00:21:11.541
[KONO]
Sorry about that.

00:21:11.624 --> 00:21:14.046
I was getting a little...
sweet treat.

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:16.926
[gasps] The cookies? How come?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.222
Remi got less
than a 60 on the mock exam.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:21.059
Which is irrelevant.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.067
I was just in that area
and decided to treat myself.

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:29.744
♪

00:21:29.827 --> 00:21:31.079
[KONO]
Wow, you were right.

00:21:31.163 --> 00:21:32.123
These are good!

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:33.502
[gasps] Wait a second!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.046
Remi wants some, too, please!

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.340
[KONO]
Go right ahead.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.099
[KONO] I bake my own cookies
every once in a while,

00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:43.312
but it's hard to pass up
a nice shop like that.

00:21:44.439 --> 00:21:45.399
[munching]

00:21:47.153 --> 00:21:48.280
Thanks, Sakura.

00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:49.449
You're awesome.

00:21:49.534 --> 00:21:51.704
Hm? You say something?

00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:54.126
Mm! Sure didn't!

00:21:54.209 --> 00:21:55.336
[KONO]
Oh, okay.

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:58.342
[AYASAKI] Oh! We should save
some cookies for Sengoku!

00:21:58.425 --> 00:21:59.344
[KONO]
No, we shouldn't.

00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:02.475
"Remi would have that much less
if I ate any cookies."

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.689
-[Ayasaki, Kono laugh]
-I'm sorry.

00:22:04.772 --> 00:22:06.358
It was like
you were the real Sengoku!

00:22:06.441 --> 00:22:08.530
[Ayasaki, Kono laugh]

00:22:08.613 --> 00:22:10.659
Don't praise her!
I'm not like that!

00:22:10.742 --> 00:22:12.370
You're doing a crap job
of staying hidden, buddy.

00:22:12.453 --> 00:22:14.374
[SENGOKU]
Damn you, Sakura!

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:16.588
[ISHIKAWA]
Aw. There, there, there.
