00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:07.473
[MIYAMURA]
I'm wiped. Let's turn in.

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:08.809
-[thuds]
-[IURA] Ah!

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:10.647
Stupid table,
where'd you come from?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.690
[SENGOKU]
Keep it down, would you?

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:12.734
It's late!

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:15.782
[ISHIKAWA] I'm putting my stuff
over here, 'kay?

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.665
Kakeru has friends close enough
to invite for a sleepover?

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:21.167
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:23.421
Ay! Sengoku!

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:24.967
Can I have the loft? Please?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.304
That's fine,
but I still need to tidy it up.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:29.100
[IURA]
I don't mind a little mess!

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:31.062
It's a lot of mess,
not a little.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:32.691
[IURA]
You really don't have to clean!

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.402
That many books
cannot be considered safe,

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:35.655
so I really do.

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:37.491
It's like a falling rock zone
up here.

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:39.746
-[grunts]
-No way!

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.001
Falling rock zones rule!
I love them!

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:43.211
[SENGOKU]
What is with you?

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:44.631
Fine.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:47.052
I guess if you're okay with it,
I can be, too.

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:49.808
-[Sengoku sighs]
-Good grief.

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.269
Such a fuss.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.814
The floor is plenty comfy.

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:54.442
[SENGOKU]
Compared to the loft?

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.487
Well,
somebody certainly thinks so.

00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:58.909
Sawing logs
like a pro lumberjack.

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:00.830
No way!
The lights aren't even out!

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:02.876
You're going to need
to scoot down a little, dude.

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:05.380
[groaning]

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.967
It is rather cramped.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:08.011
I'm sorry.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:09.472
Nah, it's cool.

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:11.142
[Miyamura groans]

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:13.773
I'm too hot.

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:15.067
[ISHIKAWA]
Stop stripping, ya dingus!

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.985
If the shirt goes,

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.947
all your hard work
goes along with it!

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.241
Um, what?

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:20.410
Just tucking him in!

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:21.664
-Good night, guys!
-[Sengoku groans]

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.251
[switch clicks]

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:25.672
[SENGOKU]
See ya in the morning.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.426
[SENGOKU]
Sleep sounds so good.

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:29.428
Hm?

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:34.523
There's no space
for me to lie down.

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:35.608
None.

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:10.506
Hm...

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.681
[SENGOKU]
If Ishikawa goes here,

00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:17.436
and Miyamura goes here...

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.689
[SENGOKU]
Um, Ishikawa--

00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:19.941
He's asleep!

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:23.574
Hey. Wake up, Miyamura.

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:25.243
Please wake up.

00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:26.454
[groans]

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.333
Hori, no.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.211
Those are my organs.

00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:31.923
[SENGOKU]
What on this twisted earth

00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:32.925
are you dreaming?

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.013
-Huh?
-[IURA] Motoko! Wait.

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.476
That's--
Oh, it's just a goldfish.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.896
[SENGOKU]
A goldfish?

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.440
And who's Motoko?

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.486
[groans]

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:45.158
[SENGOKU]
Now what?

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:46.662
Never have I been
more remorseful

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.582
for not keeping my room clean.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:51.505
[KOZUE] Looks like
an actual pig sleeps in here.

00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:52.965
Sheesh. Clean it up!

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.095
[SENGOKU]
Mom. You were right!

00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:57.307
No! Wait! It's not messy!

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.228
My room's just small!

00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:01.232
And it's filled wall-to-wall
with books!

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.737
Even Dad puts his books in here!

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.658
Of course
there's no space to sleep!

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.160
It's a miniature library!

00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:08.121
[Miyamura startled]

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:09.289
Oops, sorry.

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.755
Oh. Iura. You okay?

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.258
I got to use the bathroom.

00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:17.180
What about you? Not tired?

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:18.600
Uh...

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:22.357
Dude. Use your words!

00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.946
We're the ones imposing
by crashing here!

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.533
I did try.

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.660
-But I felt kind of bad.
-[inhales]

00:04:27.744 --> 00:04:29.706
All right, gents!
Wake up and fall in!

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.670
Ah! That's okay!
At ease, Sergeant!

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.175
Oh, no.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:37.889
The president has nowhere
to sleep in his own home?

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:39.809
You should've spoken up
way sooner.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:41.061
I'm sorry.

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.232
I'll shove the sleeping dead
to the TV,

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.736
then I'll scooch
a little closer to the wall,

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.199
and bada-bing, bada-boom,
problem solved.

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:48.409
[ISHIKAWA]
Sengoku,

00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:50.288
can you cut yourself in half
by chance?

00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:51.541
-[SENGOKU] No.
-I know,

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.294
why don't you and Miyamura
go sleep in the loft

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:54.589
instead of me?

00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:56.050
Then I can move down here.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:57.093
That won't work.

00:04:57.177 --> 00:04:58.722
Two people aren't going to fit
up there!

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:00.183
The two of you will.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.561
You guys are each a half.

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.022
Two halves make a whole!

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:06.112
[SENGOKU]
Damn, I hate that logic,

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:07.405
but we have no choice.

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:08.992
We're going up, Miyamura!

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.955
[MIYAMURA]
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:12.457
Forgive me, Kyosuke.

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:14.712
-But I'm going home today.
-Come on!

-[thuds]
-[panting]

00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:18.637
[sighs]

00:05:19.848 --> 00:05:20.850
[SENGOKU]
There is enough room

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:22.435
for both of us up here.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.481
But I don't like it.

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:26.110
Mm?

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:28.824
[ISHIKAWA]
Stop stripping, ya dingus!

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.370
[MIYAMURA]
[sighs] Screw the pool.

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:33.207
Oh, I'll go change over there!

00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.548
Remi accidentally sprayed
Miyamura with the hose

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:37.465
the other day.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.516
What's weird is he insisted
on wearing his soggy uniform.

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:43.854
[gulps]

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:45.398
[AYASAKI]
I wonder why.

00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:48.822
I left my cell! Whoopsie!

00:05:48.906 --> 00:05:50.701
-[gasps]
-[IURA] I'll grab it real quick

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.329
and leave you be...

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:55.669
Uh. I just remembered.

00:05:55.753 --> 00:05:58.341
I snapped my phone in two parts,
then crushed it to powder

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.928
and washed it all
down the drain.

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:01.640
-That's right.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:02.975
It's not what you're thinking!

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.522
Please. Don't pay me any mind.

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:08.737
No matter what you do,
you'll always be Sengoku to me.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.408
Well, of course, I mind
an interpretation like that!

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:12.870
You misread everything!

00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:14.666
Stop running away
and let me explain!

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.126
[IURA]
I've seen all I need to see,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.838
and have drawn my conclusion.

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.007
Save your breath.

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.218
I won't be swayed.

00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:22.723
[SENGOKU]
It's not good to be so stubborn!

00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:25.854
[IURA] I have the utmost respect
for you, Sengoku.

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:28.484
So I do want to hear you out.

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.117
But it's just, well, um...

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.662
Use your words, Iura!

00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:34.831
But first, listen!

00:06:34.914 --> 00:06:36.417
The only goal
I was trying to accomplish

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:38.964
was stripping him,
which I have my reasons for!

00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:40.258
That's all I wanted, I swear!

00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.304
So your only goal
was stripping him?

00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:43.264
Uh...

00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:45.686
I have the utmost respect
for you.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:48.274
[SENGOKU]
No! I made it worse!

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:49.819
Okay, let me try again!

00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:51.573
I did want
to take his shirt off, but--

00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:53.034
Wait! Don't silently retreat!

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:55.288
[ISHIKAWA]
Homeboy's suspicious.

00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.791
The Prez doesn't miss much.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.835
[gasps]

00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:59.797
[ISHIKAWA]
Yo, Sengoku.

00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:01.676
I just realized
you can sleep down here.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.887
We've already established

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.599
there isn't enough room
for three!

00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:06.060
Sure, now.

00:07:06.143 --> 00:07:07.980
But that'd change
if we move the table.

00:07:08.774 --> 00:07:10.318
We can just stand it
on its side.

00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:12.238
Shove all those books
in a corner somewhere.

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.497
[SENGOKU] How did that solution
not occur to me?

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.044
So much time was wasted.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.508

-It's too early for, um...

-Shu was laughing in his sleep,

00:07:39.877 --> 00:07:41.798
and it freaked me the hell out,
so I hit him.

00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:43.175
[IURA]
I was laughing in my sleep,

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.138
and he's a freak, so he hit me.

00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:47.601
[SENGOKU] Those don't sound
like pleasant ways to wake up.

00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:49.772
Nope! But good morning anyway.

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:51.233
Good morning to you, too.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.611
Yes. Good morning.

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.615
I feel like
I didn't get much sleep.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:56.870
Miyamura?

00:07:57.955 --> 00:07:59.124
-Seize the day!
-[rails sliding]

00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:01.128
Or keep snoozing.

00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:02.463
Man, that guy can sleep.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:04.677
On our days off from school,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.514
he'll cop Z's
until it gets dark out.

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:07.892
That's excessive.

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.019
[gasps]

00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:11.148
I volunteer to wake him up!

00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:12.066
[sighs]

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.402
[SENGOKU]
Don't look at me like that!

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:15.657
All I intend to do
is get him out of bed!

00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:16.951
I volunteer, too!

00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:19.916
-Miyamura wake-up squad go!
-It doesn't require a squad!

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.460
[IURA]
Too late! I'm going!

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:23.005
[ISHIKAWA]
Hold up, Shu! I'll do it!

00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:24.090
Get back down here!

00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:25.761
[SENGOKU]
It's my loft! I should do it!

00:08:25.844 --> 00:08:27.055
-[Iura laughs]
-[groans]

00:08:27.138 --> 00:08:29.309
-Stop, guys.
-Get off him, Iura!

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:31.021
Why? He's still breathing, guys!

00:08:31.104 --> 00:08:33.526
Um... Good morning to you,
Miyamura.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.029
Yeah. What he said.

00:08:35.112 --> 00:08:36.073
Morning.

00:08:36.908 --> 00:08:38.244
[wincing]

00:08:38.703 --> 00:08:39.747
[MIYAMURA]
It's morning?

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.832
[IURA]
It is.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:42.920
[MIYAMURA] Why are all of you
here, watching me sleep?

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:44.422
That is so beside the point!

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:46.468
Bro! Can't you see
you're in danger?

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:47.513
What danger?

00:08:48.013 --> 00:08:49.349
Hey. Let's swap.

00:08:49.432 --> 00:08:50.811
I'll lead the wake-up squad.

00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.313
But if we try
to trade positions,

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:53.733
we might crush him for real.

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.862
Shu! Keep your butt planted
right where it is!

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.367
Sengoku's acting
like he might pull something,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.620
if you know what I mean!

00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:01.248
[Miyamura gasps]

00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:03.377
-[whimpering]
-I absolutely will not!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.381
Point that judgy stare
somewhere else!

00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:10.224
[MIYAMURA]
I trust you, Mister President.

00:09:10.308 --> 00:09:12.646
[SENGOKU] Yeah right!
Why are you stuttering, then?

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.942
[MIYAMURA] It's too early
for this much excitement.

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.904
It's your wake-up call, sleepy.

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:18.490
[MIYAMURA]
More like an ambush.

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:19.910
And I need a bathroom.

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:23.543
[IURA]
Back it up, Ishikawa.

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:25.589
Beep, beep, beep.

00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:28.052
[ISHIKAWA] And give the Prez
an opening to get to Miyamura?

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:29.179
I don't think so!

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.932
[MIYAMURA]
It's a risk I'm willing to take,

00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.603
so please let me through!

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:34.189
[ISHIKAWA]
I warned you.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:35.776
[IURA] It's a long wait,
can you hold it?

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:38.364
Yes, thanks
to 18 years of experience.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:39.282
[door clicks]

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:43.374
So, why're you gunning
for Miyamura all of a sudden?

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.419
Watch how you phrase things,
please!

00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:47.215
For the record,
I was just doing my job

00:09:47.298 --> 00:09:49.010
as a class representative, okay?

00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:50.639
Since when is it
a class rep's job

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:52.475
to undress other people
in their sleep?

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.730
[SENGOKU]
It's not, but please.

00:09:54.814 --> 00:09:56.274
Please tell me
why he hides his skin

00:09:56.358 --> 00:09:58.404
and sate my curiosity.

00:09:58.487 --> 00:09:59.740
[groans]

00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:01.577
[SENGOKU]
I don't understand.

00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:04.124
You really want to know?

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:06.128
I'll tell you.

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.046
[gulps]

[sighs]

00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:13.392
It's a bit of a hike to get
to your restroom, Mister Pre--

00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:15.146
-[IURA, SENGOKU] Hm...
-[door clicks]

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:16.440
What? What's wrong?

00:10:16.524 --> 00:10:17.526
Who died?

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:18.653
-Nobody.
-Huh?

00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:21.659
I just majorly covered for you.

00:10:21.742 --> 00:10:22.661
Is that right?

00:10:23.287 --> 00:10:24.414
[SENGOKU]
He can shoot a bazooka?

00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:25.917
-[IURA] Out of his solar plexus.
-Yeah, uh...

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.633
What did you "cover"?
They're talking about a bazooka.

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:32.054
[ISHIKAWA]
You know, that thing you have.

00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:34.894
â™ª

00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:36.773
Even when Remi soaked him
with water,

00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:38.651
he refused to shed his uniform.

00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:41.156
Who? Miyamura?

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:42.910
Who else would I mean?

00:10:42.993 --> 00:10:44.162
[ISHIKAWA]
That came out of left field,

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:45.498
so I wasn't sure.

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.420
But, yeah. It's a mystery.

00:10:48.505 --> 00:10:52.011
Hm... A mystery
you've already solved, perhaps?

00:10:52.094 --> 00:10:53.556
Negatory!

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.683
[Sengoku groans]

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:56.436
-[door sliding]
-[MIYAMURA] Brr, it's cold!

00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:58.858
Hey, Prez.
Lemme warm up in here.

00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:02.616
Oh. What's going on, Ishikawa?

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:05.830
'Sup? Like a Miyamura-moth
to the flame, here you are.

[MIYAMURA]
What? There's no fire.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.045
Come right on in!

00:11:09.128 --> 00:11:11.551
[MIYAMURA] You're
a little too happy to see me.

00:11:11.634 --> 00:11:14.472
Miyamura. Aren't you hot?

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.186
I told you I came
'cause I'm cold.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.982
[SENGOKU] You'll heat up
pretty quick, though.

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:21.027
See how Ishikawa ditched
his blazer?

00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:22.196
That's how toasty he is.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.660
[ISHIKAWA]
Dude. How obvious can you be?

00:11:24.743 --> 00:11:26.204
He got that warm?

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:28.668
Maybe I'll ditch it
a little later.

00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:30.839
[SENGOKU]
Blast!

00:11:30.922 --> 00:11:33.595
Have I ever seen you
in a school sweater before?

00:11:33.678 --> 00:11:34.930
I don't own one.

00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:37.059
It'd look nice.

00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:38.521
Snug in all the right spots.

00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:39.940
Hey, why don't you try mine on

00:11:40.024 --> 00:11:41.611
and see if you like
how it fits you?

00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:42.654

You're scaring me.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.867
[SENGOKU]
Here.

00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:46.954
[MIYAMURA]
Ooh! Feels legit!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.503
[SENGOKU]
My plan actually worked!

00:11:50.587 --> 00:11:52.214
At last,
he'll change his clothes

00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:54.177
and I'll see
what he's been hiding!

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.972
[ISHIKAWA]
Miyamura said his tattoos show

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:57.601
through a white button-down.

00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:59.688
He's totally caught
onto Sengoku's scheme,

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:00.774
and is just going to--

00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:01.942
You've got to be kidding.

Yes. Take off your sweater!

for these things is top-notch!

today would be the day.

What day?

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.422
I'm just going to come right out
and ask.

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:35.760
Why are you so against removing
your clothes?

00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:37.681
'Cause I'm rational.

00:12:37.764 --> 00:12:40.352
[SENGOKU] I'm not suggesting
you prance around stark naked!

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:42.774
I meant when you change
for PE and stuff!

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.026
What's this?

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.947
Is the president obsessed
with me?

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.285
As if! I just really, really
want to know!

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:49.454
[MIYAMURA]
Why is that?

00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:51.667
[SENGOKU] That should go
without saying, shouldn't it?

00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:53.921
Because it's clearly not
normal behavior.

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:55.049
[MIYAMURA]
And why is that?

00:12:55.132 --> 00:12:56.552
[SENGOKU]
Calm down, Miyamura!

00:12:56.635 --> 00:12:59.432

bullying me!

you have on right now.

Oh. Welcome home, son.

00:13:59.553 --> 00:14:00.470
Huh?

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:02.224
Here.

00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:05.272
[gasps]

00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:08.696
Yes, Remi. You're very cold!

00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:10.490
Nuh-uh. Remi's warm.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:12.453
[SENGOKU]
But I'm cold.

00:14:12.537 --> 00:14:15.710
You took the cold from me,
and now I'm warm as I can be!

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:17.171
Is that a fact?

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:19.425
Hand.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:20.469
[SENGOKU]
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:24.895 --> 00:14:25.855
Hm...

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:27.984
Uh...

00:14:30.447 --> 00:14:31.992
[breathes]

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.502
Hm?

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.215
Hold my hand, silly!

00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:40.467
[SENGOKU]
She's angry?

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.806
[yawns]

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:46.229
[giggles]

00:14:46.772 --> 00:14:48.191
Walk properly, please.

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.243
[SENGOKU]
She feels warm.

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.038
â™ª

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:57.544
Sengoku. You warming up?

00:14:57.627 --> 00:14:58.461
[SENGOKU]
Mm-hm.

00:14:58.546 --> 00:15:00.465
Then I guess
that only makes one of us.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.386
Remi's hand is still ice cold.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:04.683
Because yours are bony enough
to be a skeleton's.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:06.019
[SENGOKU]
Oh.

00:15:06.102 --> 00:15:07.731
You want to let go?

00:15:07.814 --> 00:15:09.108
[AYASAKI]
Not at all!

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:10.820
Remi's hands
aren't perfect either.

00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:12.031
They're tiny!

00:15:12.114 --> 00:15:13.324
[SENGOKU]
They're fine.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.790
Do you feel like
going somewhere, or...

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.586
Hm...

00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:19.796
Nah.

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.309
You picked up the pace.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.188
[SENGOKU] Because
I wasn't paying attention.

00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:30.317
[AYASAKI]
Then pay attention.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.528
[SENGOKU]
Right.

00:15:31.612 --> 00:15:34.158
[AYASAKI]
Remi wants to walk slower.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.329
[SENGOKU]
Any slower, and we would--

00:15:36.412 --> 00:15:38.333
Ah! Stop.

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:39.293
[AYASAKI]
Ah...

00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:41.255
You're almost home.

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:44.303
Went from freezing cold
to just freezing in place.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:45.430
What's going on?

00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.900
Hug.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:52.444
[gasps]

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.285
[Sengoku grunts]

00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:57.622
[sighs]

00:15:58.707 --> 00:15:59.960
Never mind.

00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:04.385
[AYASAKI]
Hug?

00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:05.470
Hm?

00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:10.230
-Okay.
-[gasps]

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:12.861
[grunts]

00:16:12.944 --> 00:16:14.280
Yay! Hug!

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:19.708
[SENGOKU]
Let me have my arms back

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.793
for a minute, Remi.

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:22.129
Ah.

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:25.302
[gasps]

00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:27.139
Much better.

00:16:33.151 --> 00:16:34.153
[AYASAKI]
Kiss.

00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:36.658
No. We're on the street.

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:39.831
I understand.

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:40.791
[SENGOKU]
Good.

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:48.641
[KONO]
Hey, we better get going.

00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:51.187
The library's going to close
in five.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.982
[gasps] You're right!

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:54.569
Oh, man.

00:16:54.653 --> 00:16:57.282
Remi's head feels
like it's going to explode.

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:59.078
You did use it a lot today.

00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:00.288
And you're sure
you don't want me

00:17:00.372 --> 00:17:01.625
to go over your math homework?

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:02.794
[AYASAKI]
Positive.

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:05.131
I can do that assignment
by myself!

00:17:05.215 --> 00:17:06.133
Think so?

00:17:06.217 --> 00:17:07.637
-[AYASAKI] Yep!
-Mm-hm.

00:17:08.346 --> 00:17:09.683
[AYASAKI]
Let's go, Sakura.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:15.653
[zipper rustling]

00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:16.822
[KONO]
Sengoku.

00:17:17.782 --> 00:17:19.410
Would you like
to walk home together?

00:17:20.997 --> 00:17:22.959
-[chair sliding]
-[SENGOKU] Sure.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.003
[KONO]
Got everything?

00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:25.130
Yeah, I'm good.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:27.885
Huh...

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:29.848
[SENGOKU]
You look ready for a blizzard.

00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:31.183
[KONO]
Because I'm "coldhearted"?

00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:32.562
[SENGOKU]
I didn't say that.

00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.191
Hori, what you looking at?

00:17:35.735 --> 00:17:37.572
Huh? Where's Remi?

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:38.574
[HORI]
Don't know.

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.622
[YOSHIKAWA] It's pretty unusual
to see those two by themselves.

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:42.623
[HORI]
Yeah.

00:17:42.707 --> 00:17:44.293
I was thinking the same thing.

00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:45.796
[HORI, YOSHIKAWA]
Hm?

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.053
Well, whatever.

00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:51.265
It's not like
I spend every waking second

00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:53.687
-with my boyfriend.
-Yeah, exactly!

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:56.860
Hey! Real quick question
for you ladies!

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.989
Have you seen Sengoku or Sakura?

00:17:59.073 --> 00:17:59.991
Huh?

00:18:00.075 --> 00:18:01.327
[AYASAKI]
They were here a minute ago,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.206
but then Remi went
to the bathroom.

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:04.709
And now they're gone!

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.880
Huh. Hm...

00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:08.216
You ready for a storm?

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:10.220
The one in my heart.

00:18:10.303 --> 00:18:12.474
-Well! You're in luck, because--
-[grunts]

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.896
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ouch! What was that for?

00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:16.399
[HORI]
Take a guess!

00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:17.777
[YOSHIKAWA]
It's fine!

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.071
We both agreed it was fine!

00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:20.490
[HORI]
It is, but hush!

00:18:20.574 --> 00:18:21.576
[Yoshikawa, Hori grunting]

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.954
[YOSHIKAWA]
I would if it was like that,

00:18:23.037 --> 00:18:24.999
-but it's not!
-Huh? Like what?

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.170
You aren't hiding something,
right?

00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:29.007
No! What would we have to hide?

00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:30.385
Hori.

00:18:30.468 --> 00:18:33.015
They could've stopped
in the student council room.

00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:34.476
I'll try giving them a call.

00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:37.274
-[gasps and screams]
-[yelps] Everything okay?

00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:39.194
[HORI] Do you see that
over on the window

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:40.321
straight across from us?

00:18:40.405 --> 00:18:41.992
There's a giant,
really weird-looking bug

00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:43.119
just chilling out!

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:44.496
[AYASAKI]
I want to see the giant bug!

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.292
-[HORI] Look! Dead ahead!
-[YOSHIKAWA] Leave it to Hori

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.131
to worry about a problem
that doesn't exist.

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:50.383
[EMPLOYEE 206A]
Hey, boss!

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:51.720
Is the ice cream machine
fixed yet?

00:18:51.803 --> 00:18:53.181
-[SENGOKU] Here okay?
-[KONO] Sure.

00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:57.439
Huh...

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:02.157
How much trash
did you throw away?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.994
Got distracted by the president.

00:19:04.077 --> 00:19:05.205
He's here with Kono.

00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:06.123
Mm.

00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:07.710
[ISHIKAWA]
What caught me off guard

00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:09.672
is Ayasaki's MIA.

00:19:09.756 --> 00:19:11.175
And the bag
that Kono had with her

00:19:11.258 --> 00:19:12.762
looked like it might be a gift.

00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:13.764
-[drink splashes]
-[ISHIKAWA] Dude!

00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:15.058
You spilled everywhere!

00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:16.520
Then he's cheating?

00:19:16.603 --> 00:19:18.189
[ISHIKAWA]
Don't jump to conclusions!

00:19:18.272 --> 00:19:21.530
Oh! Ayasaki's
on the market again now!

00:19:21.613 --> 00:19:22.657
It's my chance!

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.619
I repeat,
don't jump to conclusions.

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.540
And why am I
the one cleaning your mess?

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:27.834
You do it!

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.171
Iura. Yep.
Knew that loud voice was yours.

00:19:30.255 --> 00:19:31.423
[screams]

00:19:31.508 --> 00:19:33.219
I wasn't having shady thoughts!

00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:34.304
[SENGOKU]
Huh?

00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:37.687
Noticed you're sans Ayasaki
for today, huh?

00:19:38.437 --> 00:19:39.691
Yes, for today.

00:19:39.774 --> 00:19:42.822
I'm not sure
how to interpret that response.

00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:44.659
Don't tell her that I was here.

00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:47.582
Oh-ho! What exactly
will happen if I do?

00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:48.875
Shu, shut the hell up.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:49.794
Huh?

00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:52.048
Do not tell her I was here.

00:19:52.132 --> 00:19:53.886
[IURA] My bad,
I'll take it to the grave.

00:19:55.346 --> 00:19:56.181
What was that?

00:19:57.475 --> 00:20:00.440
-[KONO] See you later.
-Bye. Till tomorrow.

00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:05.659
[chuckles]

00:20:06.243 --> 00:20:10.628
Aw, please don't ask
the impossible of me, Sakura.

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.923
I've never scored
above a 40 in math ever,

00:20:13.007 --> 00:20:15.345
so it's a no-go.

00:20:15.428 --> 00:20:16.598
Just 60 points.

00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:18.100
No...

00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:19.186
Hm...

00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:20.396
Score at least 60,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.442
and we'll visit
that chocolate shop you like.

00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:25.073
-[gasps] The premium cookies?
-[KONO] We can get--

00:20:25.156 --> 00:20:26.534
[KONO]
Mm-hm. Yeah, those ones.

00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:27.452
[gasps]

00:20:27.536 --> 00:20:29.039
Heh! Nice try.

00:20:29.122 --> 00:20:31.711
But Remi isn't motivated
by material things.

00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:33.507
[KONO]
Well, good luck anyway.

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:36.930
â™ª

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:38.725
Right. Next here, we have...

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:40.228
[SENGOKU]
Nice job.

00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:43.234
You finally scored higher
than a 40 on a test!

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:44.987
[Ayasaki sighs]

00:20:46.323 --> 00:20:49.580
Remi said that she isn't
motivated by material things.

00:20:49.664 --> 00:20:50.749
[SENGOKU]
Huh?

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.170
Hm...

00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:04.276
[KONO]
Good morning.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:06.531
Uh. Ah! Sakura!

00:21:06.614 --> 00:21:08.952
Why'd you leave
without me yesterday?

00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.329
Where did you go?

00:21:10.413 --> 00:21:11.541
[KONO]
Sorry about that.

00:21:11.624 --> 00:21:14.046
I was getting a little...
sweet treat.

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:16.926
[gasps] The cookies? How come?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.222
Remi got less
than a 60 on the mock exam.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:21.059
Which is irrelevant.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.067
I was just in that area
and decided to treat myself.

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:29.744
â™ª

00:21:29.827 --> 00:21:31.079
[KONO]
Wow, you were right.

00:21:31.163 --> 00:21:32.123
These are good!

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:33.502
[gasps] Wait a second!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.046
Remi wants some, too, please!

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.340
[KONO]
Go right ahead.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.099
[KONO] I bake my own cookies
every once in a while,

00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:43.312
but it's hard to pass up
a nice shop like that.

00:21:44.439 --> 00:21:45.399
[munching]

00:21:47.153 --> 00:21:48.280
Thanks, Sakura.

00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:49.449
You're awesome.

00:21:49.534 --> 00:21:51.704
Hm? You say something?

00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:54.126
Mm! Sure didn't!

00:21:54.209 --> 00:21:55.336
[KONO]
Oh, okay.

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:58.342
[AYASAKI] Oh! We should save
some cookies for Sengoku!

00:21:58.425 --> 00:21:59.344
[KONO]
No, we shouldn't.

00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:02.475
"Remi would have that much less
if I ate any cookies."

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.689
-[Ayasaki, Kono laugh]
-I'm sorry.

00:22:04.772 --> 00:22:06.358
It was like
you were the real Sengoku!

00:22:06.441 --> 00:22:08.530
[Ayasaki, Kono laugh]

00:22:08.613 --> 00:22:10.659
Don't praise her!
I'm not like that!

00:22:10.742 --> 00:22:12.370
You're doing a crap job
of staying hidden, buddy.

00:22:12.453 --> 00:22:14.374
[SENGOKU]
Damn you, Sakura!

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:16.588
[ISHIKAWA]
Aw. There, there, there.
