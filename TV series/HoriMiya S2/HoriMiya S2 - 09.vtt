00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:10.813
Hey, wake up.

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:13.193
It's nearly time
for class to start.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:14.529
Mister Yasuda?

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.157
[snoring]

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.078
Don't say I didn't try,
at least.

00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:19.080
Let's go.

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:21.084
We gotta hurry and get back
before the bell rings.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.298
Whoa. Yasuda's out.

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:29.433
His hair is, like,
crazy smooth and soft!

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:30.895
[FEMALE STUDENT 1]
Stylin'.

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:36.907
[TERAJIMA]
Yasuda. Mister Yasuda!

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.120
Was there someone behind me
just a second ago?

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:42.418
Yup. Pretty sure
they were senior students.

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:44.756
I have a feeling
they were girls, too!

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.134
And I missed them!

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:48.556
So, uh.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:50.810
My class has started
without me. Damn it.

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:52.522
[TERAJIMA]
Um, just so you're aware.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:53.816
Aware of what?

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:59.285
It's your head.
There's something wrong with it.

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:00.913
Yes! Every day!

00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:02.458
Ah!

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.713
But why'd you bring that up
now of all times?

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.341
Can't you see
I'm in a rush here?

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.138
[TERAJIMA] You misunderstood,
yet you're still correct.

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:10.933
I've got a class to teach!

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:45.957
[YASUDA]
Your average on the last exams

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.086
was lower than
the other classes'.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.217
Get in the habit of answering
even if you're unsure.

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:54.599
You throw away points
for every blank question.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:56.227
Seriously.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.730
Is this a joke to you?

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.738
[ALL]
He's wondering if we're joking?

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:05.245
Question. So, um.

00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:07.332
[gasps]

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:08.334
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Do it!

00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:09.629
[FEMALE STUDENT 1]
Ask him, Hori!

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.768
[HORI]
It's not worth mentioning.

00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:18.104
[ALL sigh]

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.901
Well, your English score
was as awesome as ever, Hori.

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:23.574
Ah! Um, thank you?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.788
[HORI] Come on, brain,
think of something to say.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.878
Does that bother you?

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.047
[HORI]
No.

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:33.468
Sir?

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:36.265
Lemme guess. Need a potty break?

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.604
No, but.

00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:40.190
[MALE STUDENT 2]
Ask him, ask him!

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:41.902
[FEMALE STUDENT 2]
I believe in you!

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.408
The theme.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.245
[YASUDA]
Um. What theme?

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.584
Theme for today.

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:51.003
[YASUDA]
Today has a theme?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.301
This have anything at all to do

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:57.182
with our discussion regarding
exam grades, Miyamura?

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.521
Ah! No, sir! It doesn't!

00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:02.109
[YASUDA]
Spectacular. Then sit.

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.073
All right, what's up?

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:07.995
You appear to be very distracted
and confused.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.415
[ALL]
And it's all your fault!

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.049
[YOSHIKAWA] Ah!
I just had to go and oversleep!

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.178
What class are
we on now, anyway?

00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:19.268
I'm sorry for being late!
Forgive me!

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:22.315
[YASUDA] Decided to grace us
with your presence, huh?

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.443
Oh!

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.712
[giggles]

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:34.841
Okay, you're gonna have to stop!

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:36.636
I can't with you this early,
Yasuda!

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.807
Really! I'm, like, dying!

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:40.895
[ALL laughing]

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:42.523
Oh, my gosh! Too funny!

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:44.986
Were you just feeling extra
cute today or what, Yasuda?

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.117
What? You all think
I look "cute?".

00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:49.871
Do you wanna explain why?

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:51.583
This will. Feast your eyes!

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:56.092
[YASUDA]
The heck is this?

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:59.306
[ALL laughing]

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:04.191
Teens, I swear.

00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:05.694
If girls are gonna play
with my hair,

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:07.239
I should be conscious!

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:09.159
I wanna feel the gentle touch
of their fingers

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:10.621
while I'm wide awake!

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:13.042
[TERAJIMA] There really is
something wrong with his head.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.004
Wasted opportunity. Oh!

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.304
Hey, Miss Terajima.

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:22.060
You know where the reference
room key disappeared to?

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:25.568
[TERAJIMA] I don't. Try asking
the one who's in charge of it.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.283
And who would
this fabled "keeper of keys" be?

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.997
Nakamine, last I checked.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.461
In fact, I believe he used that
room himself just yesterday.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:40.890
[YASUDA]
Mister Nakamine!

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.019
Huh!

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.816
Will you please return
the reference room key?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.070
[NAKAMINE]
I did.

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:50.450
It should be hanging up
where all the other keys are.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:53.039
Nope, it ain't there.

00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:54.166
[NAKAMINE]
But I put it back.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.586
It's not there.

00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:57.506
[NAKAMINE]
That's so weird.

00:05:58.174 --> 00:05:59.468
Hmm! Mm!

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:02.224
Oh! My bad, man!

00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:05.355
Guess it's been stuck in
my coat pocket since yesterday.

00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:07.275
[YASUDA] Why's this scatterbrain
in charge of anything,

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:08.361
let alone keys?

00:06:08.444 --> 00:06:10.198
[NAKAMINE]
Well, I'm glad we found it.

00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.578
[clanks]

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:14.582
[YASUDA] You really are some
kind of "keeper of keys."

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.418
Oops. Wait!

00:06:16.503 --> 00:06:17.797
It's the key to my bike lock

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.717
that I thought I lost
over summer break!

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.011
[YASUDA]
Back during the summer?

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:23.140
That was two seasons ago!

00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:26.815
Thanks, I really owe you one!
Now I can ride my bicycle again.

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:30.154
Uh, good for you.
But I didn't do anything.

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:31.825
[NAKAMINE]
What a modest guy.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:32.952
[laughter]

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.960
[YASUDA] Maybe we should entrust
the key to somebody else.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.464
Did you pocket any other keys
you forgot about?

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.095
[NAKAMINE]
Hmm, that's a good question.

00:06:42.178 --> 00:06:43.180
Uh!

00:06:43.264 --> 00:06:44.976
Hey, it's Yasuda.

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:46.604
What's the other dude's name?

00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:49.986
Mister Nakamine.
He's the physics teacher.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.535
Eh!

00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:57.042
[ALL]
Oh. Wow!

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.087
Did that lab coat
come with trick pockets?

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.298
Looked straight up magical!

00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:01.968
That's a lot of keys
you have on you!

00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:04.974
Yeah, it's quite a few.
Not magic, though.

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:06.811
I could also pull
a crap-ton of keys

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:08.230
out of my pockets, you guys!

00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:09.609
This isn't a competition,

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:11.278
so you can tone down
the aggression.

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.742
[YASUDA] I know! I'm just
saying, I could do that!

00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.917
You missed one.
Must have dropped it before.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.254
Good eye! You just saved me
a lot of trouble.

00:07:20.338 --> 00:07:22.760
It's probably the key
to something pretty important.

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:25.014
Uh-oh.

00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:31.068
I'm not sure where the reference
room key is now.

00:07:31.736 --> 00:07:33.155
Mister Nakamine!

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.459
Uh?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.718
Aah!

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:47.810
[footsteps]

00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:49.104
[YOSHIKAWA]
Wait up!

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:50.189
Hmm!

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:51.943
You dropped all these.

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.195
[NAKAMINE]
Oh, gosh!

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:56.619
I didn't even notice.
Thank you so much. Wow.

00:07:56.703 --> 00:07:59.834
You're welcome. But you might
have a hole in your pocket.

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:03.340
Nah. This coat's
really sturdy, so.

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:05.888
[clanks]

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:09.687
â™ª

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.235
No worries! I just happen
to have a sewing kit with me!

00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:15.489
Well, well.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.293
You're quite skilled
with your hands, young lady.

00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:22.963
"Young lady?".

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:25.343
I'm Yoshikawa
from class 3-1, sir.

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:28.558
Oh. Right. I'm sorry.

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:32.524
You know, to be fair,
I don't teach class 3-1.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.365
True, but you did teach us
when we were first-years here.

00:08:37.492 --> 00:08:38.870
Am I ringing any bells?

00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:42.252
[NAKAMINE] Ever since
I was about knee-high,

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:44.924
I've been terrible at
remembering faces and names.

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.934
That said,
I actually do remember you.

00:08:50.017 --> 00:08:51.144
Hmm!

00:08:51.938 --> 00:08:53.148
Hmm!

00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:55.862
He-he!

00:08:57.741 --> 00:09:02.041
â™ª

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.335
An affair?

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:06.133
It should have been me in there!

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:08.304
Gosh darn that man's
ditzy charm!

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:09.472
How?

00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:12.437
How'd he get a teenage girl to
sit in a closed room with him?

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.734
No clue. Now shut
the hell up and die, loser!

00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:16.988
Casually demanding
that people die is wrong!

00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.577
You almost sounded like
a real teacher for a second!

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:22.833
Gotta say, a sewing kit's
the last thing I would expect

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.920
someone as breezy as Yoshikawa
to have stowed

00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:26.298
in her school bag.

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:29.220
Well, that goes
double for me. 'Cause...

00:09:30.264 --> 00:09:32.603
[YOSHIKAWA]
Toru. Where's your button, dude?

00:09:32.686 --> 00:09:34.940
[ISHIKAWA]
Oh! I didn't even notice!

00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:38.280
[YOSHIKAWA] Looks sloppy.
Make sure you sew on a new one.

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:40.619
Yep! No help!

00:09:40.702 --> 00:09:43.666
Me and my button less cuff
were left to fend for ourselves!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.171
It sounds like
she has zero love for you, man.

00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:48.008
No different than
some random lunkhead

00:09:48.092 --> 00:09:49.219
she passes on the street.

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:51.056
You don't know what's going on
in that cute,

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:53.477
kooky head of hers, so quit
acting like you do, perv!

00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:56.316
Hey! Nakamine's the person
who got her alone in a room!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.235
Hate on him!

00:09:57.318 --> 00:10:00.074
I can't detect the slightest
scent of ulterior motives,

00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:03.330
criminality,
or indecency from Nakamine.

00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:04.875
You, on the other hand?

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.546
I'll have you know that
my intentions

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:08.257
come from a pure
and wholesome place!

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.259
Bull!

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.386
[NAKAMINE]
Haa!

00:10:12.975 --> 00:10:16.189
You did it so fast, and it's
such amazing craftsmanship!

00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:17.150
[chuckles]

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:18.653
From now on, come to me

00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:20.281
if you get holes
in your clothes.

00:10:20.364 --> 00:10:21.993
And take better care
of those keys.

00:10:22.076 --> 00:10:22.953
[laughs]

00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:24.707
[NAKAMINE]
Just wondering,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.963
but, do you always have a needle
and thread handy?

00:10:28.046 --> 00:10:29.884
Mhm, yeah!

00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:31.094
There's this guy I know

00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:33.140
who keeps losing
his buttons left and right.

00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:36.731
His dumb face doesn't tell me
when it happens, though.

00:10:36.814 --> 00:10:39.695
[NAKAMINE] He's missing out
on some first-rate tailoring.

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:41.574
Hey, thirsty?

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:44.622
How about I treat you to a
drink to show my gratitude?

00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:47.460
[YOSHIKAWA] Thanks, but I'm
still working on my peach tea.

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:50.341
Oh! Know what I want?
Show me your hand!

00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:51.969
Uh!

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:56.478
[YASUDA]
What are they talking about?

00:10:56.562 --> 00:10:58.232
Again, no clue.

00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:00.862
She finished sewing, now leave.

00:11:00.946 --> 00:11:04.369
â™ª

00:11:16.434 --> 00:11:17.604
Huh!

00:11:18.272 --> 00:11:19.482
[YOSHIKAWA]
Toru?

00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:20.819
Well, well.

00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:25.662
[footsteps]

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:28.458
[ISHIKAWA] So, um.
What were you doing back there?

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:30.045
Hmm!

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:32.300
-With his hands?
-Yeah.

00:11:33.176 --> 00:11:35.557
Intrigued, huh? I read his palm!

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.642
Ah!

00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:38.938
Since when do you read palms?

00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:40.775
Since recently,
'cause it's neat!

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:42.361
Want me to read yours, too?

00:11:42.445 --> 00:11:43.823
Nah, think I'll pass.

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:45.577
Why? Not like I mind!

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:48.666
Hmm!

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.507
â™ª

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:56.974
Your lines are super-duper-mega
faint!

00:11:57.058 --> 00:11:59.062
Mister Nakamine's
are the exact same!

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:00.899
[ISHIKAWA] Wait,
that counts as a "reading?"

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:04.280
Thought you would
say how lucky I am and stuff.

00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:06.535
[YOSHIKAWA]
How am I supposed to know that?

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:08.121
Go check your daily horoscope.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.250
Talk about a total cop-out.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:14.843
Well, anyway. Have you tried
reading anyone else's palm yet?

00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:17.348
[YOSHIKAWA]
Nope. Oh, except for Hori!

00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:20.187
Nice big 'n' bold lines!
Why'd you ask?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.318
[ISHIKAWA] 'Cause people
might think you're a weirdo.

00:12:24.195 --> 00:12:25.865
Not that I do, though.

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.078
[sighs]

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.298
Aah! Wait, so getting into a
hobby like fortune telling

00:12:34.382 --> 00:12:35.593
makes me weird in your eyes?

00:12:35.677 --> 00:12:36.637
No!

00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.727
[YOSHIKAWA] Plenty of people
read palms! It's fun, not weird!

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.854
[ISHIKAWA]
I know, I know.

00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:42.649
Yo, Ishikawa!

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:45.697
Good news! Miyamura
says he's in for tomorrow!

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.953
All right! Now,
where should we do this?

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:50.164
[laughs]

00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:53.336
I suggest we find
an empty classroom, my old chum!

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.715
Don't call me "chum."

00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:56.635
I want in on this secret, too!

00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:57.721
[IURA]
Oh, you know.

00:12:58.556 --> 00:13:00.810
Just a little
bro-tastic bro fun!

00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:03.231
-Sounds dumb.
-[IURA] Really?

00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:09.368
[sighs]

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.047
[MIYAMURA] I had a hard time
sneaking in here.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.466
Hmm!

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.347
Whoa, that thing is colossal!

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.727
Bigger is better,
and we all know it.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.733
[MIYAMURA] I think looks
are important, too.

00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:27.614
[IURA] No way!
Size is where the romance lies.

00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:32.791
How's it hanging,
adolescent boys?

00:13:32.874 --> 00:13:36.799
Or should I say,
"What's got you so. Excited?"

00:13:38.928 --> 00:13:41.349
So, where ya
living nowadays, Yasuda?

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.648
Why ask?
You wanna set it on fire?

00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:46.317
I'm just curious.

00:13:46.944 --> 00:13:49.156
You don't need to be curious
about where your teachers live.

00:13:50.492 --> 00:13:53.498
Besides, you three
are in trouble. You got that?

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.170
[ALL]
Sorry.

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:58.133
But, sir, I can't think
of one school rule

00:13:58.216 --> 00:14:00.889
that forbids us from eating cake
inside a classroom.

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:04.145
[YASUDA] Because bringing a cake
that massive is unprecedented.

00:14:04.228 --> 00:14:05.397
Oh, yeah, hey.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.944
You live a stone's throw away
from the school, don't you?

00:14:08.028 --> 00:14:09.071
If it's the same address

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.867
that I used
for your New Year's card.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.411
Ooh.

00:14:12.494 --> 00:14:14.415
Are you planning to visit me?

00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:15.752
Don't you dare!

00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:18.173
And we aren't finished talking
about your dumb cake!

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:20.887
Cake has lost our interest.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.058
We wish to know
about your lifestyle.

00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:24.603
[YASUDA]
Jeez, you're blunt.

00:14:25.312 --> 00:14:27.358
Do you live alone?

00:14:27.441 --> 00:14:30.489
Well, yeah. Suppose I do.

00:14:30.573 --> 00:14:31.784
Got a girlfriend?

00:14:31.867 --> 00:14:34.957
[YASUDA] Not presently, but why
does that even matter to you?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.459
Because you're you.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.591
The lewd dude who raves about
his love for high school girls.

00:14:39.675 --> 00:14:41.971
If you had a normal,
non-spicy lady waiting

00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:43.849
for you at home, I'd be mad.

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:45.185
[YASUDA]
"Non-spicy?"

00:14:45.268 --> 00:14:46.814
Yeah, I feel that.

00:14:47.691 --> 00:14:50.112
The thought of him in an
average relationship is rough.

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:53.159
Right? Luckily,
I'm not. So you're safe.

00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:56.959
For now. But if you land
a perfectly normal,

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:59.589
non-spicy babe, tell us.

00:14:59.673 --> 00:15:01.467
[YASUDA] What kind
of woman are you imagining?

00:15:02.428 --> 00:15:04.306
So, you don't intend
to get married?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.605
I'm lacking a partner for such
an event. Are you keeping up?

00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:09.943
Commitment's hot.

00:15:10.027 --> 00:15:12.574
Put a ring on your normal,
non-spicy girlfriend.

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:15.328
Guys, who the hell
are you talking about?

00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:19.546
Though, I do wanna
wed before Nakamine. So...

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:21.800
[ISHIKAWA]
He's uber-fixated on that dude.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.939
I really wanna see
where you live, Yasuda!

00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:30.192
Same!

00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:31.570
You jerks aren't welcome!

00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:34.993
Unless! You come knocking
with your lady friends!

00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:36.496
Ishikawa brings Yoshikawa!

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:37.707
Miyamura brings Hori!

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:40.045
And, Iura,
you bring Ayasaki and Kono!

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.634
Then piss off.

00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:50.482
You're the all-time worst.

00:15:50.566 --> 00:15:52.570
No New Year's card
for you next year.

00:15:52.862 --> 00:15:54.073
I wasn't expecting one.

00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.580
Speaking of expectations,
I'm not sure how we look to you,

00:15:57.664 --> 00:15:59.793
but Kono and Ayasaki hardly
tolerate me!

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.672
[YASUDA]
Oh, I see.

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:02.715
Sorry.

00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:06.389
Now, as for the matter
of the giagantic cake.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:09.604
[ALL sigh]

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:13.486
Never mind.
Go back to class.

00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:15.700
Wow! Really? Wahoo!

00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:20.793
Don't worry!
We'll visit again real soon!

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:21.879
Great. But whenever you do

00:16:22.004 --> 00:16:24.258
just remember to bring me
some cake too, all right?

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:25.928
[ISHIKAWA]
Total teacher fail.

00:16:26.012 --> 00:16:29.393
Oh, but, we are coming back
for the cake after school.

00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:31.105
Will you please keep it cold
for us?

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.819
You bet, of course I will.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.672
[TERAJIMA]
What kind of experiment is this?

00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:11.102
[SENGOKU]
It's nine o'clock at night

00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:12.730
in the student council room.

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:16.613
The door's
locked from the outside.

00:17:17.657 --> 00:17:20.161
And there's a slumbering demon.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:22.834
[snores]

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:25.213
How could
we both conk out so easily?

00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:29.054
Is it drugs?
Did someone drug us somehow?

00:17:30.473 --> 00:17:32.603
Well. Regardless,

00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:35.776
it's best to let
sleeping demons lie.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.491
If I call the school, it should
ring in the faculty office.

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:41.245
[beeping]

00:17:42.247 --> 00:17:43.249
Why?

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:44.544
Huh!

00:17:44.627 --> 00:17:46.297
Whoa, it's dark.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.053
Aw, man!
What time is it? Do you know?

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.347
[SENGOKU]
Time to die.

00:17:51.432 --> 00:17:53.896
Kyo-chan, please don't panic.

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:57.277
But it seems someone locked
the door while we were sleeping.

00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.406
-We're trapped.
-Trapped?

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.369
How could you let
this happen, you dummy?

00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:03.666
Me? You woke up
a few seconds ago!

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.418
You're as much to blame as I am!

00:18:05.503 --> 00:18:06.880
[HORI]
Well, this timing sucks!

00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:08.466
I was gonna buy carrots
on the way home,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.387
but that's obviously out now!

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.682
I know the gardening club's

00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:13.226
growing a whole bunch
of carrots.

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:15.188
Take some of theirs
and be happy, okay?

00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:17.985
And you call yourself
our class president?

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:19.906
Your cell phone!
Call the school!

00:18:19.989 --> 00:18:22.035
Or anybody! Just hurry!

00:18:23.831 --> 00:18:26.878
Is that how your mother taught
you to ask people for help?

00:18:26.962 --> 00:18:30.051
[SENGOKU]
Aah! I'm sorry. Please hurry.

00:18:30.135 --> 00:18:31.805
All right. Chop, chop.

00:18:31.888 --> 00:18:33.767
What's the phone number
for the school?

00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.019
[gasps]

00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:38.484
[SENGOKU] You should have that
stored in your contact list!

00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:40.155
Bite me.

00:18:40.238 --> 00:18:42.200
Bet it's in the student
handbook, right?

00:18:42.284 --> 00:18:45.373
It is! Come on! Quit dawdling!

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.795
Why are you in such a rush, huh?

00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:50.008
Is it because you need
to use the dang bathroom, too?

00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:51.260
Quit copying me.

00:18:51.343 --> 00:18:52.597
[SENGOKU]
It's a natural function!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.099
Wait, you also have to go?

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:58.441
Honestly.
What the hell are you two doing?

00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:00.278
I was getting ready
to head home when...

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.242
You could at least say,
"thanks for saving us"

00:19:03.326 --> 00:19:05.497
before dashing off
to who knows where!

00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:12.302
So, what kept you at school
until this time of night?

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:14.264
He was out like a light, sir.

00:19:14.348 --> 00:19:17.229
Now, hang on!
This one was fast asleep, too.

00:19:17.437 --> 00:19:19.191
Are you sure?

00:19:19.818 --> 00:19:22.865
You weren't up
to anything obscene, were you?

00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:24.117
Excuse me?

00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:25.746
Obscene? Like what?

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:28.209
Freak-nasty hoohoo-haha.

00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:30.631
Students will stay late
every once in a while

00:19:30.673 --> 00:19:32.593
and get it on, undisturbed.

00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:35.850
Disgusting! Don't lump me in
with all those nymphos!

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:38.605
And isn't this the fault
of whoever locked the door

00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:41.528
to the student council room
without checking inside first?

00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:44.199
What? Speak up.
I can't hear you, Sengoku.

00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:47.957
You know. I do have
other ways of figuring out

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:49.627
if you were getting frisky.

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:53.050
Hori! Take off
all your clothes right now!

00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:56.140
What sort of situation
did I stumble upon?

00:19:56.265 --> 00:19:59.229
Oh, hello Miss Terajima,
thank goodness you're here!

00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:01.860
Check Sengoku for love bites
while I check Hori!

00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:05.910
It'd be the other way.
If it wasn't purely absurd.

00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:08.874
We'll learn everything
if we can see below the belt.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:11.420
[TERAJIMA] All skirts and pants
will be staying on.

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:13.466
I certainly hope you haven't
used that excuse

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.719
to do inappropriate things

00:20:14.802 --> 00:20:16.640
with other female students
in the past.

00:20:19.227 --> 00:20:21.650
Go home
and have a good night, kids.

00:20:21.733 --> 00:20:24.864
I need to have a word in
private with this deviant, okay?

00:20:24.947 --> 00:20:26.158
[BOTH]
Okay!

00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:28.872
Hang on, "Deviant"
is a little uncalled for

00:20:28.914 --> 00:20:29.874
don't you think?

00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:31.460
[BOTH]
If you'll excuse us.

00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:33.130
Wait! Come back!

00:20:33.214 --> 00:20:35.928
[TERAJIMA] Now, we're going
to go over this in detail.

00:20:37.097 --> 00:20:38.391
I need to hurry home.

00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:40.979
[SENGOKU]
Argh! The hallway's freezing!

00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:49.371
Whoa! You got locked
in the student council room?

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:53.421
You should've called. I would've
rushed over to let you out.

00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:55.718
I wasn't trapped long.
It was no big deal.

00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:58.557
[MIYAMURA]
Were you all alone? Or afraid?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.019
Neither! Sengoku was with me.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.202
[MIYAMURA]
You okay, Mister President?

00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.498
I heard you were stuck
in a room with Hori.

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:13.085
Did she do anything to you?

00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:15.339
Not this time. I'm fine.

00:21:15.423 --> 00:21:16.593
[HORI]
Hey.

00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:20.349
Do tell
what you're trying to imply.

00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:24.024
Um! I meant...
the power dynamic! Right?

00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:26.361
She's talking to you!
Leave me out of it!

00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:28.742
Elaborate now, Miyamura.

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:30.788
[SENGOKU] This behavior
is exactly what he meant!

00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:32.499
â™ª

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.002
[HORI]
What?

00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:36.298
Be calm.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.429
Please don't resort to violence.

00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:40.599
Uh!

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:42.435
Deep breaths.

00:21:42.477 --> 00:21:45.609
Have to process that anger
and purge it from your soul.

00:21:45.651 --> 00:21:47.487
It's a chance
to improve yourself.

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:52.832
That can't be the real Yasuda.

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:54.752
A non-evil twin, perhaps?

00:21:54.836 --> 00:21:56.380
No, that's the guy.

00:21:56.463 --> 00:21:58.217
He just had
a change of heart, is all.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.764
Compliments of our
own Miss Terajima.

00:22:00.848 --> 00:22:02.601
That seemed more
like a change of a person

00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:04.354
than a change
of heart if you ask me!

00:22:04.437 --> 00:22:06.609
Maybe she brainwashed him!

00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.613
I love that woman! She rocks!

00:22:08.697 --> 00:22:09.657
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:11.034 --> 00:22:13.205
[YASUDA]
Life is precious.
