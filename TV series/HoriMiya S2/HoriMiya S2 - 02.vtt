WEBVTT

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:08.058
Guys, fall is here.
You're excited, yeah?

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.356
Yeah.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:14.571
[HORI]
Yeah?

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:17.953
Yeah?

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:21.209
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:24.006
We weathered the swimming crisis
over summer.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.804
Only for an autumn challenge
to rear its ugly head.

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:29.183
I'm aware. It sucks.

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:31.437
[ISHIKAWA]
They holding a wake over there?

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.193
The party's here!

00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:38.577
And he has his class's sports
day team assignments, oh yeah!

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.205
Oh, wait.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.752
Do I not hand 'em off
to you guys?

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:44.171
No. You do.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.390
Feels as if sports day
creeps closer and closer

00:00:49.473 --> 00:00:51.520
every time a class
turns in a form.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:52.897
Hate to break it to you, pal,

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:54.651
but it is getting closer
every time.

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.197
[screams]

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.921
-Let's pray for rain!
-Let's do a rain dance!

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:07.426
[MIRAMUYA, SENGOKU]
Rain dance! Rain dance!

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.721
-[MIRAMUYA, SENGOKU] Rain dance!
-Hey, everyone.

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.182
-[MIRAMUYA, SENGOKU] Rain dance!
-Our roster's ready.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.854
-Rain dance! Rain dance! Rain-!
-What's going on?

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.255
So each class
decides their teams

00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:50.841
by having students draw lots?

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:54.516
They're divided by sex first,
then assigned teams.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.935
It keeps things balanced.

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:57.856
Then, yes,
I assume they draw lots.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.693
[SENGOKU] It's not really
the type of thing

00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:01.530
one can decide
through discussion.

00:03:01.613 --> 00:03:03.742
Not too sure I'm on board
with making "enemies"

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:05.830
out of our classmates,
you know what I mean?

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:06.748
Me neither.

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:09.754
Glad the two of us
are on the same team, at least.

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:11.717
Which team are you on, Sengoku?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.219
The East.

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:14.598
Yay!

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.477
Don't go "Yay" just because
we aren't on the same team!

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.691
-[HORI] Sengoku.
-Huh?

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:22.655
-Do the East proud.
-[SENGOKU] Seriously?

00:03:24.618 --> 00:03:27.624
So, as fate would have it,
you and Miyamura split up.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.337
Nothing has been split.
Your lip might, though.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.090
[SENGOKU]
I meant for sports day.

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:34.804
[HORI] Toru and Miyamura
can eat our dust!

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:37.309
[SENGOKU]
'Kay. Good luck to you.

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:38.896
[HORI]
I said "Our dust".

00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:42.444
^Iura and Yuki
are also on the East team!

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:44.741
[SENGOKU]
You're kidding me.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:46.536
With those gung-ho teammates,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.832
no way am I gonna be able
to stay out of sight

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:49.876
and do nothing.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.379
[ISHIKAWA]
Such a loaded confession,

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:53.216
yet spoken so casually.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:57.140
[KONO] I thought he was absent,
but he was just slacking off.

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:58.769
[ISHIKAWA]
Oh! The girls are performing

00:03:58.852 --> 00:04:00.731
a cheer routine, right?

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:03.737
Will you be cheering, too?
Sakura?

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:08.496
Will I cheer? Yes. I will.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.460
Even if we possess
no sense of rhythm at all,

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:13.507
it's mandatory.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.262
Hey. Your voice
went down a few octaves.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.894
-Gotta make our pom-poms, yeah?
-Indeed.

00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:22.482
I hope the routine
isn't too hard.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.738
I haven't even asked
if you're East or West.

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.288
-West, thankfully. Remi is, too.
-Meaning we'll be rivals.

00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.169
At least you'll have Toru
and Miyamura.

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:35.383
[KONO] I'm on the same team
as Ishikawa.

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.644
And he's going to see me
out there,

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.147
flailing like an idiot!

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.696
[screams] Can rhythmless people
rain dance, you think?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.909
-Yes!
-Come and chant with me!

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:50.790
[KONO, SENGOKU]
Rain dance! Rain dance!

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.504
-Rain dance! Rain dance!
-Is the student council okay?

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.177
What's his deal?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.060
I mean, the guy's been a klutz
since we were little kids, sure.

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.147
But as our student council
president,

00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:04.526
he has got to suck it up.

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:06.320
So I take it his clumsiness

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:08.241
didn't make him much
of an athlete, huh?

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:11.163
Not at all.
Always crying and falling down.

00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:13.669
It'd be nice
if he could take a page

00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:15.673
out of Sota's book.

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:20.641
You, think? 'Cause I, uh...
[sighs]

00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:22.895
I don't have any good sports day
memories either,

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.607
so I sympathize.

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.241
You're lightning on your feet,

00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:30.703
which makes you
a great competitor

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:31.705
for the hundred meter!

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:34.293
-Bleh.
-Don't give me "Bleh!"

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:36.756
What you should be giving
is your all!

00:05:38.217 --> 00:05:40.514
'Cause I intend to give it
the exact same!

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.144
So absolutely zero slacking,
or else!

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.192
As far as sports go,

00:05:46.275 --> 00:05:48.154
I'm really not
that gifted either.

00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:50.366
But I think
I'll surpass last year.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.287
Call it a hunch.

00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:56.128
[MIYAMURA] You honestly want me
to go all out in that race?

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:57.130
[HORI]
Mm-hm!

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.969
And you want me to cheer
when I'm on the sidelines?

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:01.681
Yep, that's right!

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:04.353
Then, when I take the field,
will you cheer for me?

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:06.566
Of course, I will, duh!

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.029
[MIYAMURA] We're
on different teams, though.

00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:11.660
Well-- Yeah, I know that.

00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:14.707
But I'll still be watching.

00:06:16.795 --> 00:06:17.755
Right.

00:06:18.422 --> 00:06:19.634
How strange.

00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:22.932
I wanted it to be over
as soon as possible before.

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.480
[MIYAMURA] But now I'm genuinely
looking forward to it.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.781
[SHINDO] Yo, Miyamura!
Can I swing by tomorrow night?

00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.079
Sorry, but, no.
Gotta prep for sports day.

00:06:34.622 --> 00:06:35.666
[SHINDO]
Really?

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:38.379
My school held our sports day
back in June.

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:41.343
What events are you doing?
Or are you skipping?

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:43.640
[MIYAMURA]
I'm still debating,

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:47.022
but I might do
the hundred-meter dash. Maybe.

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:48.107
Whoa.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.529
[SHINDO]
Someone sounds motivated.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.869
[MIYAMURA]
Yeah. Surprisingly, I am.

00:06:54.787 --> 00:06:55.706
[laughs]

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:56.875
Well, cool.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.714
[SHINDO] Might have to come,
see this passion firsthand!

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:01.551
No, don't you dare.

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:05.141
[MIYAMURA]
I'd be willing to bet anything.

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:08.857
The days ahead will be
a bit crazier than usual.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.363
[STUDENT 1]
That's it for today, girls.

00:07:12.447 --> 00:07:13.784
Good work!

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.788
[panting]

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:17.708
It so hard.

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:22.133
[KONO] I'm the only one
having trouble with the moves.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:24.972
I'll be as humiliated
as I was last sports day.

00:07:25.473 --> 00:07:26.893
Maybe more.

00:07:27.477 --> 00:07:28.437
Because this year,

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.110
Ishikawa could see me
make a fool of myself.

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:34.407
[YOSHIKAWA]
Hey there, Kono.

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:38.165
-[KONO] Yoshikawa.
-Are you alright?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.585
You aren't feeling sick,

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:40.712
-are you?
-No!

00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:44.010
-That's not it!
-Okay, then. What's wrong?

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:47.518
Guess I'm wiped from practicing
our cheer routine.

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:49.730
Omigosh, we had practice
and I spaced!

00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:52.443
Oh. I'm a West team member,
so you should be fine.

00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:54.740
Gotcha. Hope the East
didn't rehearse.

00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:57.663
There's not a sporty bone
in my body.

00:07:57.746 --> 00:08:01.921
And I have no rhythm.
Cheering takes a toll on me.

00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:06.346
Never mind,
forget I said any of that!

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.017
I think
I'll practice a little extra

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.269
before heading home.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.526
Right, pump.
Then left goes twice.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.448
[KONO] Then right or,
was it left again?

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:19.080
[YOSHIKAWA] Um, that looks like
the part both teams do.

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.041
It, uh...

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:21.753
-Right first!
-Huh?

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.470
When your right hand goes up,
put your left to your chest.

00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:28.725
-Do it with me!
-Uh. sure.

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:32.065
Next, do two pumps on the left!

00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:34.737
Then turn your whole body
and throw a left punch!

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.741
Oh, right, the punching part.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:39.747
Put both hands up
and shakey-shake, shake!

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.085
[YOSHIKAWA]
One, two, three, four!

00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:44.966
[KONO]
One, two, three, four.

00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:47.721
[YOSHIKAWA]
One, two, three, four!

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.101
Right, punch. Now left.

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:52.230
-Then shakey, shakey, shakey!
-[SENGOKU] Wait.

00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:54.735
I thought those two
were on opposing teams.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:57.323
I'd rather not do the cheer.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.586
-See? You're killing it!
-Thanks to you.

00:09:06.551 --> 00:09:08.470
[SENGOKU]
As long as they're having fun.

00:09:14.692 --> 00:09:17.614
[KONO] I have nothing
but love for Sengoku and Remi.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:19.577
I really do.

00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:22.498
All you had to do was mix.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.461
You're mad, aren't you?

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:27.467
Whatever emotion
I may be processing now

00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:29.346
is entirely beside the point.

00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:30.891
Should Remi mix in this?

00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:32.853
You have to read the labels
more carefully,

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:35.609
or risk botching
the entire thing!

00:09:35.692 --> 00:09:37.821
Wait, that isn't right.
Try this stuff here.

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:39.909
No! Apart from reading
the labels,

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:42.497
you have to read the recipe
as well, Sengoku!

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.798
It's getting everywhere!

00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:49.929
Though it says "Salt",
is it actually salt,

00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:51.014
or something else?

00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:53.895
Most things labeled "Salt"
are going to be salt, okay?

00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:56.943
And why's our workstation
messier than a death scene

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.028
from a horror movie?

00:09:58.404 --> 00:10:01.326
Their group isn't done mixing
in the ingredients yet?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.414
Class is just about over.

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:06.420
[KONO]
Chop the veggies, Sengoku.

00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:08.048
You can handle that, right?

00:10:08.132 --> 00:10:11.138
Me? Wi-with weaponry?

00:10:13.058 --> 00:10:16.022
-Peel it!
-Uh. Slipped my mind.

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:18.903
How slippery is your mind
to not see the skin?

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:20.657
[gasps] What's Remi doing?

00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:22.911
Are you a killer?

00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:25.458
No! You hereby lose
all knife privileges!

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.963
Remi wants to slice up
veggies, too.

00:10:28.046 --> 00:10:29.800
Then learn
how to hold kitchen knives!

00:10:29.884 --> 00:10:32.890
I'm gonna have nightmares
about that sight for a week!

00:10:33.348 --> 00:10:35.311
You just stir this
very carefully

00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:36.939
while I add in the ingredients.

00:10:37.023 --> 00:10:39.027
Nothing less,
and not a smidge more, okay?

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.532
Oh, just stirring?
Piece of cake!

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:42.785
[SENGOKU]
Ow.

00:10:42.868 --> 00:10:47.293
I cut me.
'Least it's small, though.

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:49.047
[KONO]
Wash it with soap,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.424
and then we'll get you
a bandage.

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:52.261
[SENGOKU]
Oh, right.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:54.934
[KONO] Come on, soldier.
Let's patch you up.

00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:59.359
Sakura. Hey!
Think this is good?

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:01.279
Looks yummy!

00:11:01.363 --> 00:11:04.578
[AYASAKI]
Time to add that stuff in! Wait.

00:11:04.662 --> 00:11:06.039
Why is it all wibbly?

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.505
[sigh] Are you finished?

00:11:09.588 --> 00:11:11.634
Is it supposed to look this way?

00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:14.013
It's smoking like a chimney!

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:16.226
[STUDENT 2]
Quick, we need ventilation!

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.731
[STUDENT 3]
Ack! It's making my eyes sting!

00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.652
[STUDENT 4]
Open the windows!

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:24.702
[KONO]
Even now...

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.668
the memories of
our last cooking class haunt me.

00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:33.468
Look me in the eye.

00:11:33.553 --> 00:11:35.097
[AYASAKI, SENGOKU]
But you're angry.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.767
[KONO]
Look at me so you understand!

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:39.063
What will we be making today?

00:11:39.773 --> 00:11:40.901
[AYASAKI, SENGOKU]
Curry.

00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:42.153
[KONO]
Good.

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:44.365
Now what ingredients
did you bring?

00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:46.369
-A radish.
-Why, though?

00:11:46.453 --> 00:11:48.373
-Tofu.
-But, why?

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.712
Are daikon radishes
included in the curry

00:11:50.795 --> 00:11:52.131
you eat at home, Sengoku?

00:11:52.214 --> 00:11:55.095
Well, uh.
No, I don't believe they are.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:56.724
Then what's it doing here?

00:11:56.807 --> 00:11:58.352
The only time I've seen curry,

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:00.899
it's been fully cooked in a pot
and ready to go.

00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:01.942
Wasn't sure how to start,

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.155
but the radish felt
like a good choice.

00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:06.409
Any veggie
you actually see in curry

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.246
would've been a better choice.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.710
Then placing all those
vegetables around the pot

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.213
slowly brings forth the curry.

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:13.633
No! We're cooking it!

00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:15.929
Our entire class
lowered their standards

00:12:16.012 --> 00:12:18.392
and picked curry in hopes
you would be able to do this.

00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:20.981
Okay. If not curry,
what can you make?

00:12:21.064 --> 00:12:23.485
-Pasta.
-Croquettes.

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:26.074
The prepackaged food
you simply have to unwrap

00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:27.619
and warm-up doesn't qualify

00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:30.542
-as a dish you make.
-I, I know that!

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.546
Luckily, I brought stuff, too,

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:34.382
so let's start
by cutting up the--

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:37.221
Your knife privilege
was revoked!

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.687
I want you to pay
very close attention

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.273
to what you're doing, Sengoku.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.907
[KONO]
He-- he's gotten better!

00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:50.247
Wow. When did you become
an expert peeler, huh?

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.586
Awesome job!
Once peeled, we'll--

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:56.050
Um, the potato disappeared!

00:12:56.092 --> 00:12:57.763
[KONO] 'Cause you whittled it
to nothing!

00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:00.476
The onion disappeared, too!

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.522
[KONO] You're supposed
to stop peeling at some point!

00:13:02.606 --> 00:13:03.733
[sighs]

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.279
Thank goodness
our classmates saw this coming.

00:13:06.362 --> 00:13:09.745
All the other groups donated
a portion of their curry to us.

00:13:09.828 --> 00:13:11.206
[AYASAKI, SENGOKU]
They know us too well.

00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:13.210
Sengoku will be in charge
of heating the pot.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.757
Remi can plate the rice
while we wait.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.263
Will dreams be the only place
I win at cooking?

00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:22.771
Work hard enough,
and those dreams will come true.

00:13:22.854 --> 00:13:25.192
[KONO] Why in the world
are the flames so high?

00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:29.492
-High heat means high flames.
-No way! That was high heat?

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:31.539
You lie. What did you do?

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:34.001
[AYASAKI]
Sakura.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.553
Remi tried, but, she's so sorry!

00:13:39.513 --> 00:13:42.686
[AYASAKI] The rice I made
somehow turned into gruel.

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:45.692
Please don't cry.
Just let it go.

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:50.325
-Rice gruel is fine, yeah?
-Uh, yeah!

00:13:50.409 --> 00:13:54.125
We have to eat Remi rice gruel
with gooey curry now?

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.753
Yes. Bon Appetit.

00:13:57.339 --> 00:13:58.926
[KONO]
Hey, it's pretty good.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.597
Isn't it, Remi?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.936
Yeah. Wish the rice was cooked
all the way, though.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.652
-Thanks a lot for sharing.
-It's totally cool, I promise.

00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:09.823
Hope things turn out better
next time.

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:12.662
I'm sorry. Again.

00:14:12.746 --> 00:14:15.835
-[AYASAKI] Remi's a failure.
-No, you aren't!

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:18.423
We all have things
we don't really excel at.

00:14:18.966 --> 00:14:21.639
One thing you'll excel at
is being someone's wife.

00:14:22.557 --> 00:14:25.521
Cooking isn't the only thing
that makes or breaks a spouse.

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:28.653
You can't deny
it's definitely an advantage.

00:14:28.736 --> 00:14:30.280
So what should Remi do?

00:14:30.364 --> 00:14:32.744
No soul on Earth
will wanna marry me.

00:14:32.827 --> 00:14:33.913
Me either.

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:36.417
No cooking skills,
no wedding rings.

00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:40.760
Don't you worry.
If nobody else will have you,

00:14:40.843 --> 00:14:43.766
I'll take both your hands
in marriage.

00:14:45.728 --> 00:14:46.981
[SENGOKU]
You will?

00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:50.320
[AYASAKI] Thank you, Sakura!
You're so cool!

00:14:50.404 --> 00:14:53.159
[CLASS]
Kono is boyfriend material.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.420
[YOSHIKAWA]
Ta-da! Sports day T-shirts!

00:14:58.504 --> 00:15:00.591
All the West shirts
are over there.

00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:01.927
This one here's a medium.

00:15:02.011 --> 00:15:05.643
-What size are you? A medium?
-No, uh, I'm a large.

00:15:05.727 --> 00:15:06.562
So small?

00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:08.398
Let's save the smalls
for girls.

00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.156
No mercy for the West!
I'm just playing with you!

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:15.245
Who's gonna pick up
this pushover's slack?

00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:18.919
So, absolutely zero slacking,
or else, Miyamura!

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:23.679
That sounds like something
a pushover-over would say.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:25.432
Way too many overs!

00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:27.269
-Hey, Yoshikawa.
-Huh?

00:15:27.352 --> 00:15:28.939
There a large
West shirt in there?

00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:31.110
Sure is.
Shouldn't you be helping me,

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:33.532
since you're also
on the committee?

00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:34.701
I want my shirt, too!

00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:36.955
Got any East smalls?

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:39.126
[STUDENT 5] Yoshikawa!
Where are the West mediums?

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.507
[STUDENT 6] Ooh, yeah!
And can I get a West small?

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.721
Is this a joke? You needy jerks.

00:15:44.805 --> 00:15:46.182
[YOSHIKAWA]
Get your own!

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:49.438
Well, anyway.

00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:51.902
What sports day events
did you sign up for?

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:55.325
I went with
the hundred-meter dash.

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:57.162
You could always join the relay.

00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:59.960
What? No,
that's too much pressure!

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.755
Members of the track team
compete in that one.

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:03.299
Not exclusively, though.

00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:06.055
Back when he was a first-year,
Shu participated.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.145
And was thoroughly smoked,
of course.

00:16:09.228 --> 00:16:10.565
[groans]

00:16:10.648 --> 00:16:13.946
Well, at least the East
has the president on their side.

00:16:14.029 --> 00:16:14.865
Truth.

00:16:14.948 --> 00:16:18.079
Honestly, that alone should be
enough to up our odds, huh?

00:16:18.163 --> 00:16:21.335
Really hoping he doesn't decide
to play hooky.

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.339
This sports day
will be our last one.

00:16:23.423 --> 00:16:26.345
-He'll come.
-Please rain!

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:28.308
Guys have to do topple-the-pole,

00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:30.855
and there's also the mock
cavalry battle.

00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:33.944
Apart from those and cheering,
the rest is all co-ed.

00:16:34.028 --> 00:16:36.449
And speaking of,
cheer practice looks rough.

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:38.871
[MIYAMURA] But there's a payoff
for that hard work.

00:16:38.954 --> 00:16:40.958
[STUDENT 7]
Hori, you look great.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:43.756
-OMG! So stinkin' cool!
-Really?

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.676
You have to wear that!

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.972
[HORI]
Well, Miyamura? You like?

00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:49.350
I feel betrayed.

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.774
[MIAMURA]
Not really what I had in mind.

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:56.489
[YASUDA] Listen up,
'cause this can get confusing.

00:16:56.573 --> 00:17:00.497
In this particular sentence,
this noun here gets modified.

00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:01.792
Got it?

00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:06.133
Remember, a modifying noun
gives more information

00:17:06.217 --> 00:17:08.263
[ISHIKAWA] It's the return
of the ice queen.

00:17:08.346 --> 00:17:10.100
[YADUDA]
AKA the noun being modified.

00:17:10.183 --> 00:17:11.979
Still with me so far?
