WEBVTT

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:03.591
[sighs]

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.513
[MIYAMURA] I need to score
better outside of classic lit.

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:09.060
Won't be able to get
a doctor's note for the quiz.

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:11.272
[HORI] Too bad "quiz allergies"
aren't real.

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.700
-Kotatsu study party?
-Exams are almost here.

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:19.413
Looks cozy.
How's about I join you kiddos?

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:20.750
Go away.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:25.552
Um. There actually
isn't room for you.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.139
Just Sota, Miyamura, Mom,
and me. That's it.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:29.225
[KYOSUKE]
Hey, now.

00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:32.899
Are you treating me worse
by the day? I'm gonna cry.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.755
[TELEVISION HOST 1]
I swear my wife

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.634
doesn't understand
this language sometimes.

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:11.387
[TELEVISION HOST 2]
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:12.974
[TELEVISION HOST 1]
So, we were having dinner a meal

00:02:13.057 --> 00:02:15.479
she cooked to cheer me up
'cause I was feeling depressed.

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:17.650
-[snores]
-She sounds like a winner to me!

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:19.153
[TELEVISION HOST 1]
Yeah, but then she grabbed me

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:21.491
by the shoulder
and said, completely serious, "

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:25.583
A journey of a thousand miles
begins with fifty to a hundred"

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:26.710
[sighs]

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.718
Bathroom.

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:32.972
[thuds]

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.272
[groans]

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:42.282
Ow. What are you doing,
Miyamura? And what time is it?

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.409
[yells]

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:44.913
[MIYAMURA]
For the love of all things pure,

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.415
please lie back down!

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:50.758
-Leg, leg, leg, leg, leg, leg!
-Your leg?

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.427
Somebody's leg
is locking my knee

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:54.181
and I can't get up
because of it!

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:56.269
It isn't mine, so stop yelling.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:57.479
Nature's calling.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.068
And I would really like
to answer.

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:01.362
Answer where you are.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:03.826
I am not wetting the carpet!

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.959
Oh, wow. I guess I dozed off.
What's it, like, ten?

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:09.713
[yells]

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:10.881
[KYOSUKE]
Keep it down, Kyoko.

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:12.342
[HORI] I would if you didn't
wrench my leg

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:13.637
with every move you make!

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.681
[KYOSUKE]
You're being ridiculous,

00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:15.725
but what else is new?

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:18.229
Right, Miyamura?
Wait, what's wrong?

00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:20.233
[MIYAMURA]
I need to take a leak.

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.487
Oh, but, I should wake
Sota first.

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.408
Might get sick if he sleeps here
all night.

00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.578
Hey, little buddy.

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:27.665
[yells]

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.794
[KYOSUKE] You're twisting
my leg funny! And it hurts!

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.380
[HORI] Will you quit moving,
Kyosuke?

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:33.343
[screams]

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.596
[MIYAMURA]
We created a world

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.142
where we endlessly
wound each other.

00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:39.146
Should we call for help,
or simply pray?

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.983
Calling for help would be
too embarrassing

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:44.365
since we're all tangled up like
a pose from some ecchi manga.

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:46.995
-Aren't we, Miyamura?
-It's about to break!

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.247
Kyosuke, why are you here?

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.503
Things were fine
'til your stupid self joined in!

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.588
Well, excuse me.

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:53.884
If I could get out,
I already would have!

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:57.349
I'm done. My body's paralyzed
by the need for a bathroom.

00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:58.644
It's up to you guys now.

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:00.606
[HORI]
Don't you dare call it quits!

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.405
Let's assess the dilemma.
One of us must be sacrificed.

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:07.327
All right. I can try
and yank my way free.

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:08.914
[MIYAMURA]
Wait. Timeout.

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:11.670
Kyosuke's right leg is currently
trapped between my legs.

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.299
Hori's are also wrapped
pretty tightly around me.

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:16.722
Pulling will only cause
excruciating pain

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.391
before ultimately failing.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:19.476
[HORI]
Valid points.

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.690
[KYOSUKE]
Then, what's the plan?

00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:24.571
You two bite the bullet
while I tear my way outta here!

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:25.656
[HORI]
Hold it, buster!

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.036
Just what kind of idiotic idea
is that?

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:29.622
If someone needs the restroom
more than me,

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:31.167
speak now or forever
hold your pee!

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.129
I'm uncomfortable, too!
My skirt flipped,

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:34.674
but you don't
hear me whining, do ya?

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:38.682
What? How's that even an issue?
You're hidden!

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:41.813
-Don't go back to sleep!
-Oh, man.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.485
Really wishing I hadn't drunk
all that tea about now.

00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:49.161
Hey. wait. There.
If I do that, then.

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:50.413
[pops]

00:04:50.497 --> 00:04:52.502
Holy stinking crap!
It's actually free!

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:56.635
It is? That's great!
I got one out, too!

00:04:56.718 --> 00:04:58.262
Rise 'n' shine, sleeping ugly!

00:04:58.346 --> 00:04:59.473
[groans]

00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:00.810
[MIYAMURA]
Freedom is mine!

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:02.270
[pants]

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.826
[KYOSUKE] Whatcha think?
He make it in time?

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.205
[HORI] I think I'm just glad
the crisis has ended.

00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:15.714
Just spitballing.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:18.762
But instead of lying down
in three different directions,

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:20.683
let's try facing the same way.

00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:22.854
Yeah, okay.

00:05:22.937 --> 00:05:24.356
[snores]

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.538
I woke up well after dark
the last time I was here.

00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:33.917
So, I'll head home around
seven today.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.886
-Which gives us about an hour.
-Just enough time for a nap.

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.471
Don't even play.

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.142
[both chuckle]

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.693
[snores]

00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:53.289
[KYOSUKE]
Hey, aren't you Sengoku's boy?

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:56.086
[sighs]

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.005
Remember me?

00:05:57.088 --> 00:05:58.466
You used to come over
to our house

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.178
and play all the time
when you were little.

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.225
Kyo-chan's dad.
Yeah, I remember.

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:07.484
Dang! You sure grew up.

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:10.406
Well, you are Kyoko's age,
right? Puberty at work.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.952
[chuckles]

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.834
[TAKERU] Listen, Kakeru.
The Horis are bad news.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.588
Have been ever
since high school.

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:19.592
Hold your ground,
or they'll lead you by the nose,

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:20.844
and that's all she wrote!

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:22.472
Wait, that's all who wrote?

00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:24.602
[TAKERU] I'm just telling you
they're trouble!

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:28.192
So. Kak, I mean, Takeru,
how's your old man been doing?

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.654
[SENGOKU]
My name's Kakeru!

00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:31.992
And my dad's doing well,
thank you.

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.833
He's doing well, is he?

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.004
[SENGOKU] Something tells me
he wants to change that!

00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:39.297
Pardon me, sir.

00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.513
But, I was on my way home
from buying erasers.

00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:43.849
Aww!

00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:46.020
Stop by our place for a visit
while you're in the area!

00:06:46.103 --> 00:06:47.313
Come warm yourself up

00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:50.028
before you start trekking back
to your house.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:51.531
[gasps]

00:06:53.952 --> 00:06:54.912
[ticks]

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.461
[snores]

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.139
Uh. Hey, tall, dumb, and lazy.

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:07.353
You had to wait
until I'd just fallen asleep?

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:09.650
When'd Sengoku get here?
And how?

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:11.696
Duh. He walked.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.617
Ran into him
around nine o'clock.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.497
Brought him over, and then,
in the middle of our chat,

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.336
-we both got really sleepy.
-Miyamura.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.340
It's midnight already.

00:07:21.423 --> 00:07:23.887
[sighs]

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.686
Save it. Always save
before you go in dungeons.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.191
-Huh?
-Mister President knows.

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:32.988
Forgetting to save's, like,
the worst ever.

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:36.704
Yeah, but, before that,
buy magic recovery items

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:39.209
-while you're in town.
-Yeah.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.046
A surprise monster encounter,
ahh.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.340
[both scream]

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:45.096
What? No!
How'd that golem get here?

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:47.350
-Was that directed at me?
-Calm down.

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.605
I'll make quick work of the
beast with a destruction spell!

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:52.277
-[HORI] How 'bout you calm down?
-Yay, we're saved!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.615
-The heroes are here!
-[HORI] You stay out of this!

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.495
Wait. Is the prez here,
or am I dreaming?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.542
[SENGOKU]
I was abducted nearby.

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.003
Kyosuke's doing.

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:03.884
[sighs] I haven't had
a bath or eaten dinner.

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:05.846
Just plopped down
and passed out.

00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:07.683
[MIYAMURA]
I still gotta wash up, too.

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:08.727
[HORI]
We have a tub.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.731
Go take your baths together,
for all I care.

00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:13.778
Hori! There's kinda, sorta
something that he shouldn't see.

00:08:13.862 --> 00:08:15.991
[SENGOKU] What?
Like a secret birthmark, or?

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:17.578
Oh, nothing!

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.920
I just remembered that
during our school trip,

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:24.216
you waited 'til late to use
the public baths!

00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:25.384
I can't seem to recall.

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:26.888
You wouldn't get in the pool,
either.

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:29.142
But I could never understand
why.

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:33.902
Um. Well, you see, I'm all
skin and bone. [chuckles]

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:37.367
If you're categorized as "skin
and bone," I'm already dead.

00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.628
Hey! Stop! That wasn't meant
to be any form of funny!

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.013
[doorbell rings]

00:08:58.409 --> 00:08:59.787
[sighs]

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:06.300
Uh-oh.

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:09.557
[HORI] Looks like
we succumbed yet again.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.811
This kotatsu is dangerous.

00:09:11.894 --> 00:09:13.105
Wake up, Miyamur.

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:16.988
C'mon. Don't leave
your phone open.

00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.490
Texts piling up.

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.461
[SHINDO] I guess I sent
those last texts to Miyamura

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:25.547
on accident.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.634
Ahh, so that's why Chika
hasn't shown.

00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:29.555
[HORI] "Where are you? I know
it's been cold lately and all,

00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:31.475
but I'd like to apologize for
what happened the other day.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.770
Can you come to the park
near school?

00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:34.064
I'll be waiting at
our usual spot."

00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:35.567
"You can say whatever
you like and I promise,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.320
I'll still love you, even though
I don't say it much.

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.657
I know you'll understand."

00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:42.246
"I'll still love you?"

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.629
Wake up! I want an explanation!

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:47.423
[yawns]

00:09:47.508 --> 00:09:50.179
Shindo, your voice is
annoying as ever.

00:09:50.262 --> 00:09:52.433
[groans]

00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:54.312
[MIYAMURA]
Huh?

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:56.483
Feels like someone smashed
their fist into my forehead

00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:58.655
with every ounce of strength
they had.

00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:00.701
Nah. Must've imagined it.

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:05.292
Hori? You asleep?

00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:10.052
Oh. Just faking?
Well, you might wanna stop.

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:12.933
-It's eight o'clock.
-I'm aware of that.

00:10:13.016 --> 00:10:15.522
You're angry, aren't you?
But why?

00:10:15.605 --> 00:10:17.191
The world may never know.

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:20.615
-[HORI] I'm not angry.
-[MIYAMURA] Really?

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:22.493
[HORI]
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:10:24.038 --> 00:10:25.917
Hey, looky here.

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:28.422
We've got some mandarins,
your favorite.

00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.009
I'll peel one for you.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.949
[MIYAMURA] Wow.
That actually got her up?

00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:45.916
-Don't laugh.
-Oh, that's right!

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:48.755
I made myself a promise that
I would only eat two a day!

00:10:48.838 --> 00:10:51.009
So, you hate 'em now?
What gives?

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:52.805
[HORI] I don't like
mandarin-flavored things.

00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:54.642
Same with yuzu, citron,
and grapefruit.

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:59.192
All the citrus!
I can't even bear to look at it!

00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:02.323
Hori.
But it's peeled and ready to go.

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:03.785
-Come on.
-Get it away!

00:11:03.868 --> 00:11:05.747
One slice. What's the harm?
Eat it.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.462
I'm gonna kiss you
if you don't eat it.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.930
I'll also kiss you if you do.

00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:24.117
Good. The storm has passed.
You're not mad anymore.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.037
[HORI] So, that's what
he was trying to do.

00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:29.168
There was a text that said...

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:39.940
[HORI] He keeps feeding me
things like this.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.028
Is it out of habit?

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:45.619
Want some candy?

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:48.833
-Here.
-No!

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:53.885
I will not stand for that.

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:56.222
It's like clockwork, I swear.

00:12:03.153 --> 00:12:05.533
[SENGOKU] That's from
our grade school camping trip.

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:07.370
I didn't expect to
find pictures like this here

00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:08.623
at your place, dude.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:11.044
Well, we kinda grew up together
and all.

00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:12.296
[ISHIKAWA]
You haven't changed a bit.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.508
Except for like, your height.

00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:16.639
Oh? You think so?

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:19.477
In that album.
It has pictures we haven't seen?

00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:20.814
-Give it here.
-Oh, um!

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:23.528
It's nothing worth seeing!
Pretty boring, really.

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:25.740
What's in there?
Did you see anything good?

00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:27.243
Why don't we play some games,
Miyamura?

00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:29.163
We've still got
an old Super Nintendo!

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.961
Put the album down and let's go!

00:12:33.088 --> 00:12:34.215
[laughs]

00:12:34.298 --> 00:12:35.802
[MIYAMURA] Twelve-year-old
Sengoku screwed up

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:36.846
cutting his hair.

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:38.766
I have gotta see that kind of
gold with my own eyes!

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.352
Do you guys want me to die
from embarrassment?

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:43.316
Man, this is too funny.
Resistance is futile, prezzy!

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.237
[SENGOKU]
Heartless jerks!

00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:53.086
-[BOTH] You lolicon.
-No! I am not, I swear!

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.508
So if three's as low as you go,
what's the max age

00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:57.470
before your interest
goes out the window?

00:12:57.554 --> 00:12:58.931
[MIYAMURA] I don't go
lower than high school,

00:12:59.015 --> 00:13:00.602
so let's drop this joke.

00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:03.190
Kyo-chan still changes clothes

00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:05.110
in front of other people
to this day.

00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:10.830
I'm pretty sure zero high school
girls change clothes

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:12.584
with an audience.
That includes Hori.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.801
Oh. But she did it fairly
recently, and I was there.

00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:19.640
I have gym first period today!

00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:21.977
I'm borrowing this room
for, like, five minutes, okay?

00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:23.188
Sure, whatever.

00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:26.069
I don't have time to go
to the locker room.

00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:30.369
Kyo-chan. You're not
self-conscious at all, are you?

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:32.958
-Even though I haven't moved.
-And?

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.170
If I'm being honest,
I could still use the toilet

00:13:35.254 --> 00:13:37.424
or take a bath with you
in the same room.

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:38.636
So, what?

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:40.138
She thinks so little of him,

00:13:40.222 --> 00:13:41.892
he might as well be a fly
on the wall.

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.688
I found her rationale
very strange,

00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.442
so I asked if she would strip
in front of Miyamura, too.

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:48.405
And she said.

00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:51.662
No. Never in a million years.

00:13:51.745 --> 00:13:54.877
-Rather aggressively.
-Oh, I see.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.421
Sorry, I guess.

00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:59.010
I suppose we did take baths
together all the time

00:13:59.093 --> 00:14:02.433
-when we were little kids.
-Well, as kids, sure.

00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:08.111
Wait. At what age did
we stop that? Um. Uh.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:13.204
I feel like it dragged on for
an inappropriately long time.

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:15.167
I'm scared to remember.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.089
-Kindergarten or so?
-Yeah! That sounds right.

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:19.968
Maybe first grade,
but not past that.

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:21.805
-I can't say it!
-[both laugh]

00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:24.143
-Makes sense.
-Yeah.

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:28.527
[HORI]
They're in stock!

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:32.493
Sota said he really likes these,
so I wanna give 'em a try!

00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:35.040
-Oh.
-I'll go and check out.

00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:37.879
[hits]

00:14:39.967 --> 00:14:42.806
Gosh, I am so sorry. Thank you.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:47.147
-Aren't you Koyanagi?
-No, sir. You're mistaken.

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.744
-[HORI] Sengoku?
-[TAKERU] Wait.

00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:56.124
Would you happen to be
Hori's daughter?

00:14:56.207 --> 00:14:59.463
Yeah! And you must be
Sengoku's father!

00:14:59.548 --> 00:15:03.138
Kakeru is always helping.
He's just such a good boy.

00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:05.475
Kind of you to say.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.605
So, you're
the president's father?

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:09.985
It's nice to meet you,
I'm Miyamura.

00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:12.699
Your son and I have become
really great friends.

00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.245
What a difference!

00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:18.669
You mustn't be corrupted
by the Hori family, okay?

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:21.675
You know,
I'm standing within earshot.

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:24.263
[munches]

00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:27.520
[MIYAMURA] His dad seems nice.
Think I'm a fan.

00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:29.273
[HORI]
Kakeru's like his clone!

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:32.237
[MIYAMURA] We were looking at
the future president in a way.

00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:34.366
But why did he call you,
Koyanagi?

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.622
Oh. That's my mom's maiden name.

00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:39.043
My parents went to the same
high school as Sengoku's dad,

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:41.715
so they've known each other
for, like, ever.

00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:45.640
[MIYAMURA] I wonder
what they were like back then.

00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:48.521
Hey. How would you describe
your parents, huh?

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:51.652
My folks? Normal?

00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:54.825
Well, I guess that's one more
thing we have in common, then.

00:15:57.371 --> 00:16:00.168
How could you drop it
when you had half left, dummy?

00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:02.757
[cawing]

00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:12.527
[bell rings]

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.533
You guys, uh.
Are men of very few words, huh?

00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:17.286
[TAKERU] It's not that
we're staying quiet.

00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:19.248
The conversation
just keeps dying.

00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:22.087
Help me explain how terrible
he is at this, Kakeru.

00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:24.049
[KYOSUKE]
I'm not terrible at anything.

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:26.638
I was simply reminiscing
about the good ol' days.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:29.561
-Ain't that right, red?
-Uh. Sure.

00:16:29.644 --> 00:16:32.191
[TAKERU] You can be honest.
In fact, you should be honest.

00:16:32.274 --> 00:16:34.361
[KYOSUKE] There you go,
brushing off someone's opinion

00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:35.948
-'cause you don't like it.
-[SENGOKU] I hate it here.

00:16:36.032 --> 00:16:37.619
[HORI]
Gosh, is it cold outside!

00:16:37.702 --> 00:16:40.583
[MIYAMURA] Whoa. Now
there's a face I didn't expect!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.046
-Welcome back.
-His dad's here, too?

00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:46.302
Ah, the pleasant one.
Hurry in and warm up.

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:50.853
[groans]

00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:53.651
Hey! Why did you two
decide to flank me?

00:16:53.734 --> 00:16:55.947
You realize there's more room
on the other sides.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.827
It's cold over by the window,
so deal.

00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:01.625
Now can you please explain why
you and your dad are even here?

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:04.255
[SENGOKU] Your father ran into
mine coming home from work.

00:17:04.338 --> 00:17:06.718
I happened to be there, too,
and he abducted us both.

00:17:06.802 --> 00:17:09.056
Does getting kidnapped run
in your family, or what?

00:17:09.139 --> 00:17:11.435
You're thin enough that
I can feel a draft blowing

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.563
right through you, prez.

00:17:12.647 --> 00:17:14.567
-[chuckles]
-I apologize.

00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:16.822
You live here, too?
Seems like it.

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:19.911
You waltzed in so casually,
one could only assume you do.

00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:22.291
[MIYAMURA]
Well, kind of.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.378
Believe it or not,
he's dating Kyoko.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:27.593
-They're such a cute couple.
-Ahh.

00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:29.639
Well, Kakeru has no time
for dating

00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:31.058
or silly school drama.

00:17:31.142 --> 00:17:32.562
-What?
-Not that it's wrong,

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:35.776
mind you, my son just
doesn't need a love interest.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.572
It would interfere
with his studies.

00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:40.160
[all gasp]

00:17:41.412 --> 00:17:44.251
So is he joking with us?
Or have you been lying?

00:17:44.335 --> 00:17:46.130
I wouldn't call it
outright lying.

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:48.594
I just haven't gotten around
to telling him the truth.

00:17:48.677 --> 00:17:50.347
I thought I'd force
an opportunity

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.019
by inviting Remi
over on Christmas, but.

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:55.482
[AYASAKI]
I want it to be in my room!

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:58.697
[SENGOKU] I wound up
going to her place instead.

00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:00.367
And I was surrounded by insects.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.703
Yikes.

00:18:01.787 --> 00:18:04.667
Though I've kept quiet till now,
I do intend to tell him.

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.670
[sighs]

00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:08.007
[glares]

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:09.719
Are you cold, President?

00:18:09.803 --> 00:18:12.099
The way you're shaking
is concerning.

00:18:12.182 --> 00:18:14.061
-Don't you say a word.
-Oh?

00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:16.482
-And what word would that be?
-What's up?

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:18.152
Playing a word game?

00:18:18.236 --> 00:18:20.198
[scoffs]

00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:22.703
Jeez, Sengoku.
Just get it off your chest

00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:24.373
and tell him you've been dating
for a while.

00:18:24.456 --> 00:18:25.918
[SENGOKU]
Will it be the loose cannon?

00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:27.462
How's Ayasaki been?

00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.093
You see her today at school?
Oh! I forgot!

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.472
Or the oblivious time bomb?

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:34.519
[SENGOKU] The time bomb
is the real danger here.

00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:37.441
-That's you!
-[MIYAMURA] But I'm human!

00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:38.986
He's a freakin' teenager.

00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:41.365
Falling in love is kinda
what they do.

00:18:41.449 --> 00:18:44.455
Isn't it a little excessive
to say he can't date at all?

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:46.960
[SENGOKU] This could work!
A peaceful resolution!

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.296
Mind your own business.

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.425
Our family affairs have nothing
to do with you.

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.347
Why latch onto those outdated
beliefs, grandpa?

00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:55.603
-It ain't hip, yo.
-We're parents, not hippies.

00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:57.857
And did you actually bring me
here on my personal time

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.069
to lecture me when I'm older
and smarter than you are?

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:02.449
You forget who bought you bread
that time you left your lunch!

00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:04.119
You mean the bread
that cost eighty yen?

00:19:04.203 --> 00:19:05.956
You tricked me and said it
cost a hundred!

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.417
I want my twenty yen!

00:19:07.502 --> 00:19:09.463
[MIYAMURA] They completely
veered off topic.

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:11.050
It's almost as if.

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:13.471
[HORI] This isn't an
adult conversation.

00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:15.935
[Both] It's a high school fight.

00:19:16.937 --> 00:19:18.397
Don't make me tell 'em, dude.

00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:19.943
Remember when you walked
through what seemed to be

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:22.364
a normal puddle and got soaked
up to your knees my friend?

00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:25.245
-You want the kids to know?
-[TAKERU] You just told them!

00:19:25.328 --> 00:19:27.542
Though remind me,
which moron arrived at school

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.877
after all our exams were over?

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:29.879
[KYOSUKE]
That only happened

00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:32.092
because someone stole
the front wheel of my bike!

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:33.720
You should've left the bike
and walked!

00:19:33.804 --> 00:19:36.643
Good grief. It's like
a bad dream, but it's real.

00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:40.066
Oh, really? This is par
for the course for us.

00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:42.028
Wow, I can tell
how close you guys are.

00:19:42.112 --> 00:19:44.449
Lifelong pals.

00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.495
Sengoku and I
are the bestest friends!

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.332
Ha! Bestest friends my ass!

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.590
I won't ever forget what you did
to me on graduation day!

00:19:51.673 --> 00:19:54.679
Right as I was giving my speech
as student council president.

00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:56.140
-[sneezes]
-[laughs]

00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:57.727
[TAKERU] I know that sneeze
was planned!

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.146
Don't deny it!

00:19:59.229 --> 00:20:00.774
I didn't sneeze.

00:20:00.858 --> 00:20:02.027
It was the student body rep.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.614
[TAKERU]
Our school had no such rep!

00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:06.118
Let's circle back to talking
about Sengoku's love life.

00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:08.122
-That was fun.
-Oh, boy!

00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:11.295
I sure wish you'd keep telling
stories from the good ol' days!

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.634
[TAKERU]
Don't laugh off my humiliation!

00:20:13.717 --> 00:20:16.973
[MIYAMURA]
It seems, even years later.

00:20:17.057 --> 00:20:20.396
The Sengokus are still
at the mercy of the Horis.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.025
[chuckles]

00:20:22.108 --> 00:20:24.488
[sobs]

00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:27.285
[TAKERU]
But seriously,

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:29.999
a girlfriend isn't a temptation
you need right now.

00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:33.297
Especially if she's anything
like Hori's daughter.

00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:35.134
[SENGOKU]
It got harder to tell him!

00:20:37.472 --> 00:20:39.727
[MIYAMURA]
Imports are like in-ports,

00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:42.065
'cause they come into Japan.

00:20:42.148 --> 00:20:43.527
[sighs]

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.948
Hope I can score at least
a forty.

00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:49.121
But that might be pushing it.
I dunno.

00:20:49.204 --> 00:20:50.456
Did you do
your math homework yet?

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.002
[MIYAMURA]
Nope. I'm dropping it.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:55.216
I recall you dropping it
at the start of the term, too.

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:57.680
Try picking math
back up sometimes.

00:20:59.266 --> 00:21:02.857
[MIYAMURA] Careful, Hori.
Your nails will turn orange.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.694
I'm not eating that many.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.200
I told you so.

00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.706
[sighs]

00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:11.875
Here.

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.381
Sharing it won't do anything to
save your fingernails, but okay.

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:17.970
I never thought it would.

00:21:27.907 --> 00:21:29.535
[HORI]
Oh, my gosh.

00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:31.998
It's like feeding an animal!
One more!

00:21:59.302 --> 00:22:01.516
I cleaned all the orange off
for you.

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:10.158
[HORI] Not what I would
call "clean."

00:22:11.953 --> 00:22:14.709
[MIYAMURA] Hori. I'm dropping
everything but classic lit.

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.336
[HORI]
Uhh, no.
