[MALE PRINCIPAL]
[clears throat] Students,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.722
we have been blessed
with cerulean skies.

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:08.016
Couldn't have asked
for better weather

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.603
this fine sports day.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.569
Remember.
Demonstrate good sportsmanship.

00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:15.072
And just have fun out there.

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:18.579
Very stirring words.
Thank you for that, sir.

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:21.794
And now,
the pledge of fair play.

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:31.855
The pledge...

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.362
We, the proud student body
of Katagiri High School...

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:36.532
[MALE STUDENT 1]
Is it me,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.201
or is the prez looking
a little blue?

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:39.871
[MALE STUDENT 2]
Yeah, despite his red hair.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.334
[MALE STUDENT 3]
That contrast is crazy.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:45.340
[MIYAMURA] Looks like both
of his arms are still intact.

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:48.973
Hey. Good thing
it's cool outside, huh?

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:51.394
Lots of people
are in long sleeves.

00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:53.524
Oh. You're right.

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:54.483
[crying]

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:55.987
[HORI]
Sengoku had a fit

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.364
when he heard
you were fired up for this.

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:58.868
-Called you a traitor.
-That traitor!

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:00.120
-[gasps]
-[crying]

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.170
[MIYAMURA]
Truth be told,

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.049
I think this kind of stuff
is boring.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.055
I never had a reason to try
before.

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:11.810
But, this year,

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:13.648
I'll have to actually
put in effort.

00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:14.775
To beat you.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:17.154
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Now, without further ado,

00:01:17.237 --> 00:01:20.118
let the Katagiri High School
sports day begin!

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:22.957
[students cheering]

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:56.812
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Right off the bat,

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:59.024
the East and West
are neck and neck!

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.153
No doubt
the second-year girls' hurdle

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:02.782
had everyone sweating!

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.869
Any thoughts, Mister Nakamine?

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:06.247
It was insane.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.332
Yeah, it was!

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.546
Second-year ladies came
to represent!

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.257
So, the third-year teams

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.136
are running
the hurdle race next, right?

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.179
Yep, yep.

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:15.725
It's go time!

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:18.564
Hm. Have fun, but safety first.

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:19.900
'Kay!

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:22.864
Since you have legs,

00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:25.076
and I'm partnerless
for the three-legged race,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.289
what do you say we team up, huh?

00:03:27.372 --> 00:03:29.335
Sign up for topple-the-pole
while you're at it.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:30.921
The East is short one guy.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:32.925
I would rather be a shellfish
right now.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.844
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Next up

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.931
is the third-year girls'
hurdle race.

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.063
Well, I got to run!

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:40.941
Go and kick all the butt!

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.367
-Ah!
-Ah.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.747
I didn't realize
you were racing, too.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.168
I bet that you're
super-duper quick, aren't you?

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.339
Nah,
I'd say I'm average at best.

00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:54.301
[AYASAKI] Yeah, right.
Like I believe that.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:57.099
[HORI] I shall mow down any
who stand in my way.

00:03:57.182 --> 00:03:58.476
You've got this!

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.604
You do!

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:01.357
-Go for broke!
-West is the best!

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.275
Hear that?

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.073
Miyamura is cheering
his heart out for Remi to win!

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.492
I believe that he's cheering

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:08.664
for the entirety
of the West Team.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.751
[FEMALE OFFICIAL]
Next heat, line up.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.260
Since he's watching,
I'm going to work extra hard!

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:17.890
Yeah, um,
he wasn't cheering just for you.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.147
If Remi wins,
Miyamura belongs to her.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.399
'Kay, Kyon-Kyon?

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:24.069
Huh? Kyon? What?

[MALE STUDENT 4]
Whoa! Ayasaki's fast!

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.791
[MALE STUDENT 5]
She the dark horse?

[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Team West's Ayasaki

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.296
is leading heat five!

Uh-oh!

-That blunder is going to...
-Oof! That sounded painful.

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:41.228
I think she kicked it
on purpose.

Metal.

to get under my skin.

Damn it!

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:51.499
Look, folks!
Team East is trailing behind!

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.044
[HORI]
Thanks, Captain Obvious!

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:55.173
The East girl
bringing up the rear

00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:56.760
is looking really intense.

00:04:56.843 --> 00:04:59.097
Yeah.
We kind of sort of know her.

00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.058
[Miyamura whimpers]

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:01.978

East takes first,

00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:03.816
and West takes second!

[HORI] I tell my boyfriend
not to slack,

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.366
then come in dead last.

Man. What is my deal?

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:14.838
Huh?

Ah!

She's the enemy. No cheering!

[MALE STUDENT 6] Finish strong!
Even if it's last place, okay?

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:37.132
Check the bat out of hell!

a burst of speed from nowhere!

-[AYASAKI] Kyon-Kyon!
-Uh.

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:47.360
[HORI] Could you not
with the "Kyon-Kyon" stuff?

00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:50.701
Because you and Miyamura are
so lovey-dovey with each other,

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:54.166
Remi can hardly bear the thought
of stealing him away.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.462
[HORI]
Freaking puppet master!

00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:59.636
Just kidding!
Remi's heart belongs to Sengoku.

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.096
You just get flustered
so easily,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.600
but it's really adorable.

00:06:02.683 --> 00:06:04.228
Ah! Now listen, you!

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.733
Hey. There you are. Got a sec?

-Uh!
-[MIYAMURA] Did I interrupt you?

00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:11.408
We're through.
So I'll be going now.

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:13.120
I'll even take your sign.

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:14.999
[MIYAMURA]
Oh. How nice.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.253
Is your leg okay?

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:19.466
That hurdle race was impressive.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.844
I was last place.

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:23.892
You looked like a regular pro
during your practice sessions.

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:26.731
But then you stalled out
for the real thing. Why?

00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:29.111
-Because of you, that's why!
-Ah!

00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:31.908
[MIYAMURA] Wait, then,
why did you speed up at the end?

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.369
[HORI]
That was also your fault!

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:36.000
[MIYAMURA]
What? I'm confused.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:37.920
[HORI] And I'm going
to watch the next race.

00:06:38.004 --> 00:06:39.632
You should make your way back,
too.

00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:40.968
[MIYAMURA]
Okay.

00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:42.262
[HORI]
Before you go!

00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:44.767
Thanks for cheering.

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:47.523
Made me happy.

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:50.278
[MIYAMURA]
Sure.

00:06:54.912 --> 00:06:56.833
Miyamura. Check it out.

[ISHIKAWA] Look,
who's also repping team West.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:03.847
[MIYAMURA] Can she even lift
the tug-of-war rope?

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:05.809
[gasps]

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.439
Hori-senpai!

00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:10.193
Watch me compete, okay?

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:12.072
She is on the other team, right?

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:13.032
Think so.

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:15.036
Go, Sawada!

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.497
Give it all you got, girl!

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:17.541
Mm? Huh.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:18.710
[ISHIKAWA]
Or not.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.718
[chuckles]

00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:25.223
[giggles]

00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:28.688
For a quick second, I thought
our cheering was too loud.

00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:31.276
Dude, who doesn't love
having people in their corner?

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.782
You eat that stuff up, too,
don't you?

00:07:34.992 --> 00:07:36.871
[MIYAMURA] I've never really
done the "cheer thing"

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.040
on sports day.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.710
And nobody ever cheered for me.

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:42.967
I suggest that you start
by cheering more for your team

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.469
than your opponents, rookie.

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:46.473
[MIYAMURA]
I got caught up in the moment.

00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:48.227
Sorry.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.439
Be real nice if you could
drown out the other team

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:52.862
while I compete
in the upcoming obstacle course.

00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:54.114
If there's one person

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:55.784
who won't snub you
for cheering loud,

00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:56.911
it's your boy.

00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.540
[MIYAMURA]
Right.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.378
[groans]

00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:03.340
[SAWADA]
I tried so hard.

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:04.677
But the West Team lost.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.723
Hey, don't let it get you down.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.058
There
were a whole bunch of jocks

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:09.645
on Team East's side.

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.695
I wanted you to see me
emerge victorious and look cool!

00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:15.991
[YOSHIKAWA] Take your tears off
Team East's turf.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.961
Ishikawa is next up!
Cheer really loud!

00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.422
Um. Mm-hm.

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:25.636
[both breathes deeply]

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:28.015
Iura! You had better dominate!

I wish I were on the West side.

in the mandatory stuff.

to brave the obstacle course!

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.652
First up is the balance beam,

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:57.992
and neither team is ready
to give up the lead just yet!

Yeah. Except there's also
one high-pitched guy mixed in.

00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:23.877
[ISHIKAWA]
How about that?

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.549
Finally found your voice.

Gosh!

will pull off the win?

[MIYAMURA, AYASAKI, KONO]
Ishikawa's!

00:09:35.483 --> 00:09:37.111
So you two you tied?

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:40.117
"That's pretty darn good
for somebody like Iura, right?"

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:42.455
[SENGOKU]
Yoshikawa's words, not mine.

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:44.250
Though you have my praise
as well.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.587
That's praise?

Speaking of,
where are the girls at?

They're getting ready.

It's almost time
for the cheer competition.

[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
All right, guys!

00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:55.064
The moment of pompoms
is upon us!

First up,
the East Team third-years!

Oh, absolutely!

00:10:11.471 --> 00:10:13.434
Never seen a cheer
like this before!

00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:15.814
That officially makes two of us.

00:10:15.897 --> 00:10:17.943
I wonder
how Kyo-chan's boyfriend feels

00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:19.822
watching this unique display.

00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:21.826

Oh. We lost him.

Here we go!

and Team West won over the guys.

Wasn't Remi a little too cute?

-Thank you.
-Huh?

You could've let me struggle
all on my own.

But you took the time
to help me learn the routines.

I should've thanked you sooner,

Stay focused, Kyo-chan.

what side you're on, right?

The sidelines, preferably.

to even out the count
for this very event,

Okay, will you two explain
already?

who fit the description
of what you needed to find?

00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:34.993
-Hip, hip!
-Hip, hip.

00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:36.997
-Hip, hip!
-Hip, hip.

00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:39.460
Dude!
You're supposed to say "hurray!"

00:15:39.544 --> 00:15:40.963
The first victim
will be Sengoku.

00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:42.884
-Understood.
-Yeah!

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.638
[grunts]

00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:46.140
-Yanagi is a rider, too?
-Hey, feel secure?

00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:47.101
Yes, thanks!

00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:49.898
All the riders are the least
competitive people here.

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.152
-And up you go!
-Oh.

00:15:52.612 --> 00:15:53.446
Whoa.

00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:56.369
Ah, whoa!

00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:57.454
[whistles]

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:59.041
I may be getting
into this a little now.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.795
-Are ya?
-'Bout time.

00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:03.592
The view from the top
is a beautiful sight to see.

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:05.972
[IURA] Sounds like we got
a real general on our hands.

00:16:06.055 --> 00:16:07.266
Literally!

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:09.980
[ISHIKAWA] Amazing what a change
of scenery can do.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:12.317
Let's do it to it, guys!

00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:13.529
-Right!
-Uh-huh!

00:16:13.612 --> 00:16:16.577
Sengoku! Score at least
one point or die trying!

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.912
No mercy!

00:16:17.996 --> 00:16:20.167
[ISHIKAWA] Wow. Hori's cheering
for the prez.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.922
That's what teammates do.
So of course she is.

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:25.427
Yeah. But,
aren't you kinda ticked off?

00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:28.601
So, like, what's the game plan?

00:16:28.684 --> 00:16:31.565
Well. Since the prez
is so clever and all.

00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:34.445
Ah! Listen! I have an idea.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.038
So, who do we cheer for?

00:16:39.121 --> 00:16:40.583
The rider snatching
all the headbands,

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.710
or everyone involved?

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.547
Both! 'Cause
they're all working hard.

00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:44.966
But a lot's riding
on the riders,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.012
so maybe save most
of your cheers for them.

00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:49.643
Okay.
This game's pretty complex.

00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:52.314
[KONO, AYASAKI]
Miyamura!

00:16:52.397 --> 00:16:53.734
We're rooting for you!

00:16:53.817 --> 00:16:55.529
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:58.535
[ISHIKAWA] Is Miyamura
the only one they care about?

00:16:58.619 --> 00:16:59.537
Sengoku!

00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:00.957
Doesn't listening
to your girlfriend

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.044
cheer on Miyamura
get you fired up?

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:05.716
Teammates are supposed
to encourage each other.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.720
What exactly
are you trying to imply?

00:17:07.804 --> 00:17:08.806
[IURA]
Ignore me!

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.312
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER] It's time!
Take your places, everyone!

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:15.443
Keep it clean, and
to the best team go the glory!

00:17:16.863 --> 00:17:17.991
Ready!

00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:18.993
[pistol shot]

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.997
-Let's flank 'em, fellas!
-Go around back!

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.836
â™ª

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:26.299
[grunting]

00:17:26.382 --> 00:17:28.679
Wait! I feel like
I was pretty close!

00:17:28.762 --> 00:17:31.100
This Team West guy
is just grabbing at random!

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.311
Holy crap!

00:17:32.394 --> 00:17:34.941
Hey, keep your eyes
open up there, buddy!

00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:36.862
It won't help.
I forgot my glasses.

00:17:36.945 --> 00:17:39.325
Yanagi is doing way
better than I thought he would.

00:17:41.872 --> 00:17:43.291
Mister President.

00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:46.422
This point is mine!

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:48.217
So give it here!

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:51.223
[grunts]

00:17:51.307 --> 00:17:53.604
It seems Team West is
as nimble as a feather

00:17:53.687 --> 00:17:54.773
in the summer breeze.

00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:57.486
Anybody could've dodged
those wimpy swipes.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.616
Think it's time
we took the offensive, yeah?

00:17:59.699 --> 00:18:00.743
You got it!

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:02.914
[grunts]

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.339
Where'd his dog-eat-dog
spirit come from?

00:18:07.422 --> 00:18:09.301
I think he tapped
into his inner general.

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:10.805
[grunting]

00:18:10.888 --> 00:18:11.890
Okay.

00:18:11.973 --> 00:18:12.892
[groans]

00:18:12.975 --> 00:18:15.690
Concentrate! You're still
in the game, Sengoku!

00:18:15.773 --> 00:18:17.150
Yeah, what Hori said!

00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:18.779
Behead 'im if you have to!

00:18:18.862 --> 00:18:20.281
Do you want Miyamura to die?

00:18:21.242 --> 00:18:23.831
[MIYAMURA] Got his evasion
techniques down to an art.

00:18:24.624 --> 00:18:25.543
[ISHIKAWA]
Miyamura.

00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:29.299
I'm about at my limit here.
Could you get it in one go?

00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:30.928
You're tired?

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:34.059
Makes sense.
Playing as a horse is no joke.

00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:35.563
Something on your mind?

00:18:35.646 --> 00:18:37.315
My nose is itching like crazy.

00:18:37.399 --> 00:18:39.319
What a coincidence! Mine, too!

00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:43.077
[MIYAMURA] It's gonna come down
to who wears out first.

00:18:43.161 --> 00:18:44.329
Unless!

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.839
Ah, ah...

00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:52.179
What's with the face?

00:18:55.018 --> 00:18:56.479
So, prez.

00:18:57.439 --> 00:18:58.817
Just wondering.

00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:04.537
But have you noticed that
strange girl on your shoulder?

00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:08.461
Right there?

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:09.714
Um.

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:11.510
[screams]

00:19:16.853 --> 00:19:17.730
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Um...

00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:22.740
Looks like Team West takes
the win for the cavalry battle!

00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:24.827
So they were at a standstill,

00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:27.542
and Sengoku turned his head
for no reason.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.752
Yep.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.965
[MALE STUDENT 7]
Awesome job, Miyamura!

00:19:31.048 --> 00:19:32.092
[HORI]
Man.

00:19:32.552 --> 00:19:34.471
Well, guess it's whatever.

00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:36.810
[YOSHIKAWA]
[gasps] It is not whatever!

00:19:36.893 --> 00:19:38.564
Have you seen the score?

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.840
Come on, Remi.

00:19:51.923 --> 00:19:53.635
Gotta move these chairs.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:56.516
Until the afternoon,
we were the ones ahead.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.522
But isn't it nice that Sengoku
could be on the winning team?

00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:00.899
[chuckles]

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:03.530
[AYASAKI]
You practiced the cheer enough

00:20:03.614 --> 00:20:06.118
to win the whole sports
day for us.

00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:07.037
Huh?

00:20:07.955 --> 00:20:08.915
[chuckles]

00:20:11.003 --> 00:20:12.632
Not entirely accurate.

00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:15.554
You did it enough to be
the cutest one out there!

00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:18.017
Like,
it wasn't even a contest.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.353
[KONO]
If you say so.

00:20:22.442 --> 00:20:24.196
[MIYAMURA]
No wonder my nose hurt.

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:26.200
It's already red from sunburn.

00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:31.460
Shindo is gonna
make so much fun of me.

00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:32.880
Hm?

00:20:34.216 --> 00:20:36.387
Hey, Hori. That you?

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.391
Oh, you're still here?

00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:40.771
Yeah. But more importantly,

00:20:40.854 --> 00:20:42.900
where are you off to?

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.660
And why're you wearing that?
Sports day's over now!

00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:48.620
Yeah, I know,

00:20:48.704 --> 00:20:50.666
but the girls
are taking a group shot

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.043
before we leave for the day!

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.632
I wore the boys' uniform
for the actual event,

00:20:54.716 --> 00:20:56.135
so I thought
I'd change for the pic.

00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:58.055
I did hand-make these pom poms.

00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:00.393
Well, the boys' uniform
looked great on you.

00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:01.563
Did it?

00:21:01.646 --> 00:21:03.984
I have a hunch I'm the reason
we won the cheer battle!

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:05.361
[giggles]

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:07.700
[MIYAMURA] At least my sunburn
hides my blush.

00:21:09.453 --> 00:21:10.873
[chuckles softly]

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.214
I had a cheerleader long before
sports day even started.

00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:17.845
-She's been in my corner...
-Are you blushing?

00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:19.891
...rooting for me to succeed.
I got sunburned.

00:21:21.393 --> 00:21:23.899
And she's shining
brighter than ever.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:28.324
Am I cute?
I was, uh, copying Ayasaki.

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.244
[MIYAMURA]
You are cute.

00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:32.625
Cute beyond belief.

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:35.672
Ah!

00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:37.718
[chuckles softly]

00:21:37.802 --> 00:21:39.639
â™ª

00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:41.391
You big dummy!

00:21:41.475 --> 00:21:43.897
Dummy, dummy, dummy,
dummy, dummy!

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.943
Uh...

00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:51.036
[MIYAMURA]
As far as I'm concerned...

00:21:52.581 --> 00:21:55.002
today wasn't just
my last sports day.

00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:01.724
It was my first.

00:22:04.437 --> 00:22:06.150
And it was a lot of fun.

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:10.951
â™ª

00:22:11.493 --> 00:22:14.625
The day may have ended.
But that feeling stayed with me.
