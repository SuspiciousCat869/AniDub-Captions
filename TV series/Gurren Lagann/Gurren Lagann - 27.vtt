00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.759
&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: YOUR ACTIONS

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.097
ARE BAFFLING, IRREGULAR.

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:17.636
WHY DO YOU RESIST US SO?

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:20.040
&gt;&gt; Nia: [grunts]

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.042
&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: YOU ARE A

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.044
VIRTUAL LIFE‐FORM THAT WAS

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:23.046
SPLICED INTO THE GENOME OF THE

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:26.019
SPIRAL RACE.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.021
WHEN THE REMNANTS OF THAT

00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:28.023
SPIRAL RACE ROSE UP

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:29.793
IN REBELLION AGAINST US,

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:30.795
YOU WOULD BE AWAKENED AND

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.568
BECOME OUR MESSENGER.

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:36.072
THAT IS YOUR REASON FOR BEING.

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:37.576
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE BORN TO

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:39.646
AND LOVED BY A SPIRAL WARRIOR

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:40.648
IS NOTHING MORE THAN

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:41.784
A COINCIDENCE.

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:43.588
THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL OR

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:46.359
UNIQUE ABOUT YOU.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.129
IT IS QUITE A RARE THING

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.198
FOR A MESSENGER TO BE

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:50.367
THIS RECALCITRANT.

&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: THE REASON

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:53.340
BEHIND YOUR DEFIANCE AND

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.643
THE REASON BEHIND

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:56.212
THEIR OBSTINANCE...

00:00:56.212 --> 00:00:58.116
DETERMINING THOSE COULD GIVE US

00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.720
THE KEY TO EXTERMINATING ALL

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.089
SPIRAL LIFE‐FORMS.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.759

MY BODY, YOU WILL

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.136
NEVER UNDERSTAND!

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.138
&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: WE HAVE NO NEED

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:10.040
TO UNDERSTAND.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.677
WE ONLY NEED TO KNOW.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:12.679
&gt;&gt; Nia: THEN YOU MAY AS WELL

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.181
GIVE UP, BECAUSE YOU’LL NEVER BE

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.752
ABLE TO DEFEAT THEM.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.154
HE WILL COME.

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:18.791
YOU CAN BE SURE OF THAT.

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:45.645
JUST LIKE I PROMISED.

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:47.114
&gt;&gt; Nia: [grunts]

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:56.533
&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: IMPOSSIBLE!

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.203
SENTIENT LIFE‐FORMS CAN’T

00:01:58.203 --> 00:01:59.372
POSSIBLY ESCAPE FROM

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.111
A MULTI‐DIMENSIONAL LABYRINTH!

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:03.113

US!

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.183
WE DON’T CARE ABOUT TIME OR

WE DON’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:11.664
FORCE YOUR WAY DOWN A PATH YOU

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.233
CHOOSE TO TAKE, AND DO IT

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.268
ALL YOURSELF!

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.272
THAT’S THE WAY TEAM DAI‐GURREN

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:17.408

KARMA’S CYCLE...

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.734
&gt;&gt; Yoko: THE DREAMS WE LEFT

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.671
BEHIND WILL OPEN THE DOOR!

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:49.673
&gt;&gt; Ron: EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE

00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:51.409
STANDS IN OUR WAY...

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.411

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.221
TIME AND SPACE...

00:02:57.221 --> 00:02:58.223

YOU THINK WE ARE?!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.635
&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: THIS IS

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:21.870
SURPRISING.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.306
NO SPIRAL RACE HAS EVER MADE IT

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.611
THIS FAR.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.949
BEING EXPOSED TO SUCH SPIRAL

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.220
POWER, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.289
OUR MESSENGER WAS MADE

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.692
IRREGULAR.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.328
AS YOU WISH.

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:35.330

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.616
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: IT IS HIS WAY.

00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:47.922
ABSOLUTE DESPAIR ON US BY

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:49.258
FIGHTING AND DEFEATING US

A BODY.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.801

SUPER SPIRAL UNIVERSE WHERE

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:57.341

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.978
LET ME JOIN THIS FIGHT,

00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:01.382
THOUGH MY BODY IS TEMPORARY.

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:02.986

YOUR FATHER, BUT YOU’VE

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:10.568
DONE WELL.

SPIRAL KING?

00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:19.285
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: I AM NO KING,

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.324
JUST A SIMPLE WARRIOR,

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.363
THE SAME AS YOU ARE, VIRAL.

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:26.432

ABSOLUTELY ZERO!

EVOLUTION OF SPIRAL POWER

00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:02.024

OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.585
WE HALTED OUR OWN EVOLUTION

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.555

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:19.526
THIS POCKET UNIVERSE.

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:21.362

THE RESOLVE TO DO THAT?

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:42.505
WE DEFENDED THE UNIVERSE BY

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:43.908
KILLING OUR FELLOW SPIRALS

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:45.711

SATISFY YOUR OWN DESIRES
