A MINUTE.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.655
DON’T YOU SUPPOSE WE MIGHT FIND

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:08.991
THE RECALL POINT FASTER IF WE

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.026

UNDERSTAND US?

00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:57.454
&gt;&gt; Yoko: I WONDER IF THERE’S A

00:07:57.454 --> 00:08:01.530

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:31.823
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: SOMEHOW THIS BUILDING

00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:33.560
IS TERRIBLY SUSPICIOUS.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.163
THE AIR HERE IS PRETTY WARM.

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:37.535
AND IT’S GIVING OFF STEAM.

00:08:37.535 --> 00:08:38.136

WE SHOULD LEAVE NOW, AND‐‐

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:43.547

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.054
&gt;&gt; Kamina: YEAH.

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.624
HEY, MAYBE HE’S GONNA GIVE US

00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:52.765
A REWARD OR SOMETHING.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.938
&gt;&gt; girls: HELLO, AND WELCOME!

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.207
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: IT’S GETTING MORE AND

00:08:57.207 --> 00:08:58.042
MORE SUSPICIOUS.

00:08:58.042 --> 00:08:58.811

ISN’T THE MIGHTY KAMINA.

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:06.960
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ASK,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.266
"HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?"

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:11.536
THERE ISN’T A SINGLE HUMAN

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.204

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.565
IT MAY LOOK REALLY DELICIOUS,

00:09:42.565 --> 00:09:43.834
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT ALSO

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.170
MIGHT CONTAIN A TERRIBLE POISON

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.272
SO POWERFUL AND DEADLY,

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:47.340
IT CAN KILL WITH A SINGLE‐‐

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.342

00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:20.306
WE’RE THE THREE SISTERS

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.310

TO TAKE CARE OF.

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:44.021
SO WE’RE ALL ON OUR OWN TODAY.

00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:45.056
