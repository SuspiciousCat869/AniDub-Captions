00:07:06.152 --> 00:07:07.689
TO YOUR HEART.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:08.691
I REALLY ENVY HIM.

00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:09.960
I DO.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.865
&gt;&gt; Yoko: "THAT GUY."

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:13.867
&gt;&gt; Kittan: I FEEL IT MORE AND

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.170
MORE WITH EVERY PASSING DAY.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.840
I TELL YA, THAT KAMINA

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.978
WAS ONE HELL OF A MAN.

00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:19.713
&gt;&gt; Yoko: [gasps]

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:21.550
BUT DON’T FORGET, KITTAN...

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.484
&gt;&gt; Kittan: [grunts]

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.152
&gt;&gt; Yoko: TEAM DAI‐GURREN NEVER

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.856
WOULD HAVE COME THIS FAR HAD IT

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:25.691
NOT BEEN FOR YOU.

00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:26.693
SIMON WAS PULLING US FROM ABOVE

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:28.897
WHILE YOU PUSHED AND SHOVED

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:29.699
FROM BELOW.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.135
THAT’S HOW WE MANAGED TO GET

00:07:31.135 --> 00:07:32.739
HERE, AT LEAST THAT’S THE WAY

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:33.106
I SEE IT.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:36.847
&gt;&gt; Kittan: UH...UH...

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:37.849
&gt;&gt; Yoko: YOU CAN BE JUST AS

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.519
PROUD OF DOING THAT FOR US,

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.788
DON’T YOU THINK?

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:42.224
&gt;&gt; Kittan: UHH...

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:43.761
WE’RE WASTING GOOD TIME HERE.

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.729
LET’S GO!

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.132
[clang]

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.699
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: THAT KITTAN!?

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:03.934
SPACE KING KITTAN WORKS

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.103
IN THIS SOUP?

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:06.105
&gt;&gt; Leyte: ITS SPIRAL ENGINE

00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:07.942
ISN’T ITS ONLY POWER SOURCE.

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:08.944
GUNMEN COULD RUN ON ELECTRICITY

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:09.946
BACK WHEN WE WERE ON THE

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:11.883
SURFACE, REMEMBER?

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:12.719
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: OH, I GET IT!

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:13.821
SO THEN THE SPACE GUNMEN

00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:14.889
SHOULD HAVE BACKUP POWER

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:20.634
SOURCES AS WELL!

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.572
&gt;&gt; Yoko: [gasps]

00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:24.241
&gt;&gt; Kittan: LOOK OUT!

00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:28.951
DON’T MESS WITH ME!

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.521
&gt;&gt; Yoko: ARE YOU OKAY?!

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:31.523
&gt;&gt; Kittan: I LOST AN ARM,

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:32.525
THAT’S ALL.

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:33.961
IT’S NO BIG DEAL.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:34.963
&gt;&gt; Yoko: THAT WAS A ROOKIE

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:35.664
MISTAKE.

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:36.900
SORRY.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.902
&gt;&gt; Kittan: NAH, DON’T SWEAT IT,

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:38.771
YOKO.

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:39.639
YOU FILL IN THE BLANKS WITH

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.712
LIFE’S EXPERIENCES, RIGHT?

00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:43.279
MAN, THEY’RE COMING IN

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.218
SWARMS NOW.

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.922
HEY, YOKO...

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:49.258
WHEN WE GET BACK TO EARTH,

00:08:49.258 --> 00:08:50.895
HOW ’BOUT YOU INTRODUCE ME

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:51.863
TO THOSE KIDS OF YOURS?

00:08:51.863 --> 00:08:52.832
&gt;&gt; Yoko: [gasps]

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.602
&gt;&gt; Kittan: I’M KINDA GRUFF.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:55.070
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.673
I LOVE KIDS.

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:58.711
ONCE WE WASTE THESE BASTARDS,

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.013
TAKE OUT THE ANTI‐SPIRALS,

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:01.115
AND GO HOME TO EARTH,

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:02.852
WELL, THAT’S WHEN I’LL‐‐

00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:10.901
DAMN IT, LET ME FINISH TALKING!

00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:17.147
&gt;&gt; Gimmy: ARE YOU TWO OKAY?!

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.049
&gt;&gt; Kittan: ARE YOU CRAZY?!

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:19.318
SHOW SOME COMMON SENSE!

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:20.320
&gt;&gt; Gimmy: BUT WE KICK LOGIC OUT

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.790
AND MAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.658
POSSIBLE!

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:23.660
ISN’T THAT THE WAY TEAM GURREN

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.763
ROLLS?

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:25.865
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WELL, YEAH, BUT‐‐

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.867
&gt;&gt; Darry: LOOK, WE’RE DOING

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:27.702
THIS BECAUSE IT’S WHAT WE

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:28.136
WANT TO DO.

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:29.138
PLEASE, KITTAN, LET US FIGHT BY

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:30.608
YOUR SIDE.

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.210
&gt;&gt; Kittan: AW, YOU WIN.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.947
I JUST CAN’T SAY NO TO WOMEN

00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:35.818
AND KIDS.

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:36.820
OKAY, YOU THREE!

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.122
WE’RE GONNA RIP THOSE MONSTERS

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:39.859
OFF THE SHIP!

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.195

THAT’S ABOUT ALL OF ’EM.

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:07.582

THE HELL’S GOING ON?

&gt;&gt; Anti‐Spiral: THAT IS EXACTLY

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.959
WHAT IT MEANS,

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:31.061
FOOLISH PEOPLE OF THE SPIRAL.

00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:32.798
DO NOT DELUDE YOURSELVES INTO
