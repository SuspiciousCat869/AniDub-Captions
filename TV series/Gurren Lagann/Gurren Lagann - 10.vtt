I’M THE ELDEST OF THE BLACK

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:00.975
SIBLINGS, AND NOT ONLY THAT,

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:02.679
I’M THE LEADER OF TEAM GURREN,

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:03.479
THAT’S WHO I AM!

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.551
&gt;&gt; Nia: KITTAN, YOU SAY?

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.522
IT’S A PLEASURE.

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:08.824
&gt;&gt; Kittan: ALL RIGHT, LOOK, JUST

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:09.859
BECAUSE YOU’RE SWEET AND CUTE

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:11.095
AND NICE AND ALL DOESN’T CHANGE

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.497
THE FACT THAT YOU’RE THE ENEMY!

00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:13.199
&gt;&gt; SHE ENEMY!

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.435
&gt;&gt; HE’S RIGHT!

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:15.938
&gt;&gt; both: LITTLE GIRL ENEMY!

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:16.873
&gt;&gt; Nia: TELL ME, KITTAN?

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:20.715
WHAT DOES "ENEMY" MEAN?

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:21.783
&gt;&gt; Kittan: AN ENEMY IS A BAD

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:22.685
PERSON!

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:23.721
SOMEONE YOU JUST GOTTA BEAT THE

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.090
CRAP OUT OF!

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.025
&gt;&gt; Nia: "BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF"?

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:27.829
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:29.933
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WELL, UH, IT’S WHEN

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.703
YOU TAKE YOUR FIST AND YOU BELT

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:32.137
THE OTHER GUY, AND‐‐

00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:33.774
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHAT DOES "FIST" MEAN?

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:35.544
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WELL, OKAY, LOOK,

00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:36.012
A FIST IS‐‐

00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:36.913
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:37.481
TO SOMEBODY?

00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:39.084
&gt;&gt; Kittan: BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:39.753
PISSED ME OFF!

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:40.955
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:41.757
"PISSED OFF"?

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.092
&gt;&gt; HE’S SUPPOSED TO INTERROGATE

00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:43.694
HER...

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:44.696
&gt;&gt; BUT SHE’S INTERROGATING HIM

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:45.463
INSTEAD.

00:07:45.463 --> 00:07:47.467
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, OUR BRO WAS NEVER

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.570
TOO GOOD AROUND HER TYPE.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.973
&gt;&gt; Kittan: HEY, BUTT OUT!

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:50.975
&gt;&gt; Nia: KITTAN, YOU ARE...

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.979
YOU ARE A‐‐LET’S SEE.

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.716
YOU’RE A "NOT‐PISSING‐OFF

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.118
PERSON," AND YOU’RE SWEET.

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:57.087
I THANK YOU!

00:07:57.087 --> 00:07:59.058
OUR TALK HAS BEEN INFORMATIVE!

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:01.530
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WELL, NO PROBLEM!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.565
I’M THE LEADER HERE, SO IT’S

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.468
ONLY NATURAL.

00:08:04.468 --> 00:08:07.107
[murmuring from crowd]

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:17.695
&gt;&gt; Kittan: NOW LISTEN UP.

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:19.866
AS TEAM LEADER, I GOT AN ORDER

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:20.601
FOR YOU.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.037
I WANT YOU TO GET ALL THE ENEMY

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:23.473
INTEL YOU CAN OUT OF HER.

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:24.909
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHY ME?

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:25.811
&gt;&gt; Kittan: COME ON.

00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:26.713
JUST DO IT, SIMON.

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:27.849
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT

00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:28.216
HER HERE.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.051
SHE’S HERE BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.521
MAN UP AND FIX IT.

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:31.890
SHE’S A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.059
KNOW THAT YOU’RE IN FOR A TOUGH

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.499
FIGHT.

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:37.602
&gt;&gt; Nia: I HEARD MANY THINGS FROM

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.104
KITTAN.

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:40.808
HE SAID MY FATHER IS DOING

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:42.077
TERRIBLE THINGS TO PEOPLE

00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:42.879
ON THE SURFACE.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.083
IT’S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT FATHER

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:46.686
WOULD DO SUCH THINGS WITHOUT

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:47.287
GOOD REASON.

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:49.692
AND YET, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:51.530
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE BAD.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.230
&gt;&gt; Simon: WE DIDN’T DO ANYTHING

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.700
WRONG, NIA.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.836
IT’S THE SPIRAL KING WHO’S THE

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.506
BAD GUY HERE,

00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:57.709
HIM AND HIS PEOPLE.

00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:59.612
&gt;&gt; Nia: DO YOU HATE MY FATHER?

00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:01.115
&gt;&gt; Simon: OF COURSE I DO.

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:03.620
&gt;&gt; Nia: DO YOU ALSO HATE ME?

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.556
&gt;&gt; Simon: I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.691
SAY TO THAT.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:06.626
&gt;&gt; Nia: SO THEN, WHY IS IT THAT

00:09:06.626 --> 00:09:08.096
YOU FIGHT?

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:09.966
&gt;&gt; Simon: IT WAS MY BRO WHO GAVE

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:10.935
ME THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT.

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:13.172
I FOUGHT BECAUSE HE

00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:15.310
BELIEVED IN ME.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.015
Nia: SIMON.

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:21.122
TELL ME, WHO IS THIS BRO PERSON?

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:23.292
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: SO DO YOU THINK

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:24.696
SIMON WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:25.831
&gt;&gt; Ron: DON’T YOU HAVE OTHER

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.602
THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT?

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:28.737
IF I DON’T FINALLY GET

00:09:28.737 --> 00:09:30.106
DAI‐GURREN HERE RUNNING AGAIN,

00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:31.308
A LOT MORE THAN TEARS WILL BE

00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:33.680
SPILLED.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.016
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: YES, I SUPPOSE,

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:36.653
BUT IN SIMON’S CASE....

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:38.557
&gt;&gt; Ron: LOOK, WE’RE ALL FIGHTING

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:39.124
HERE, AREN’T WE?

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.761
AND THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO?

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.164
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: YES, BUT...

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:44.067
&gt;&gt; Ron: BESIDES, IF THE REASON

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:45.336
THAT LAGANN ISN’T WORKING IS

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.338
BECAUSE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:47.708
HELPING A KID WHO’S LOST THE

00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:48.744
WILL TO SURVIVE...

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:52.752
I THINK IT HAS THE RIGHT IDEA.

00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:54.221
&gt;&gt; Nia: OH, HOW SAD.

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.258
SO HE WAS KILLED IN A BATTLE.

00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:57.695
&gt;&gt; Simon: THAT’S RIGHT.

00:09:57.695 --> 00:09:58.664
&gt;&gt; Nia: THEN I SUPPOSE IT’S

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.333
LITTLE WONDER THAT EVERYONE HERE

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.235
HATES ME.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:02.738
I REALLY CAN’T BLAME THEM.

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:04.108
&gt;&gt; Simon: DON’T YOU WORRY ABOUT

00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:04.809
THAT, NIA.

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:06.345
NOBODY HERE HATES YOU.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:08.216
ACTUALLY, I DON’T THINK THAT

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:10.855
BRO EVER FOUGHT OUT OF HATRED.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:13.359
IT’S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT NO

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:15.230
MATTER HOW BAD THE SITUATION,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.200
HE WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.739
I GUESS, IN A WAY, HE WAS...

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:20.708
&gt;&gt; Yoko: A MAN OF UNLIMITED

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:24.782
STUPIDITY!

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:25.985
I’D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT HIM,

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:26.786
TOO, SIMON.

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.222
PLEASE KEEP GOING.

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:29.626
&gt;&gt; Simon: THIS HAPPENED A LONG

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:30.794
TIME BEFORE WE MET YOU.

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.698
IT WAS BRO’S IDEA TO BREAK OUT

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:33.967
FROM OUR UNDERGROUND VILLAGE AND

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:34.903
THEN DIG OUR WAY UP

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:35.771
TO THE SURFACE.

00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:37.340
BUT ALONG THE WAY, THE TUNNELS

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.610
COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF AN

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.278
EARTHQUAKE, AND WE WERE

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:40.280
ALL TRAPPED.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.720
&gt;&gt; Yoko: HEY, THIS STORY IS...

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.356
NEVER MIND.

00:10:45.356 --> 00:10:46.960
&gt;&gt; Simon: IT WAS SCARY.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.362
I WAS TERRIFIED THAT I

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:49.766
WAS GOING TO BE BURIED ALIVE

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.103
JUST LIKE MY MOM AND DAD WERE.

00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:54.642
BUT BRO URGED US ON, YELLING,

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.947
"COME ON, ONWARDS AND UPWARDS,

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:57.715
MEN..."

00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:00.286
LAUGHING THE WHOLE TIME.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.290
MY HANDS FINALLY STOPPED

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.392
SHAKING.

00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:05.096
WHEN I’M FOCUSED ON DRILLING, I

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:06.833
CAN HEAR THE SOIL AND THE ROCKS

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:07.300
CALLING TO ME.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.304
"IT’S SOFTER THIS WAY," OR

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:10.641
"TRY DIGGING OVER HERE!"

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.981
I FOLLOW THEIR ADVICE AS I DIG.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:16.085
IF WE HAD ALLOWED OURSELVES TO

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:17.254
JUST GIVE UP THAT DAY,

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:19.659
THEN WE ALL WOULD HAVE DIED.

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.095
THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN’T GIVE

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:22.698
UP WAS ’CAUSE BRO WAS WITH US.

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:24.434
AND HE DIDN’T GIVE UP.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.272
HE REFUSED.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.075
THAT’S HOW HE ALWAYS WAS.

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:30.346
WITHOUT HIM, I CAN’T DO

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:32.685
ANYTHING.

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.789
THAT’S WHY I HAVE TO DO WHAT I

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:36.893
CAN TO BECOME LIKE HIM, SO I

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:38.931
CAN DO HIS SHARE FOR HIM.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.035
&gt;&gt; Nia: THAT’S NOT TRUE.

00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.039
YOU RESCUED ME FROM THAT AWFUL

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.107
GUNMEN ALL BY YOURSELF,

00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:44.909
REMEMBER?

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:45.878
&gt;&gt; Simon: BUT THAT WASN’T...

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:47.180
&gt;&gt; Nia: I BELIEVE YOU CAN DO

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.249
FINE ON YOUR OWN.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.953
WHY DO YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:51.823
OBSESSING OVER THIS BRO PERSON?

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.159
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHY?

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:55.196
YOU’RE JUST... SAYING THIS

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:56.933
BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T KNOW HIM.

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.336
&gt;&gt; Nia: I CANNOT GET TO KNOW

00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:00.106
SOMEONE WHO ISN’T HERE.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:02.912
BUT ALSO YOU CANNOT RELY ON

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:04.281
SOMEONE WHO ISN’T HERE.

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:05.149
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA!

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.051
&gt;&gt; Yoko: YOU CAN’T POSSIBLY HAVE

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:08.222
ANY IDEA HOW SIMON IS FEELING!

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:09.224
YOU CAN’T, ’CAUSE YOU DIDN’T

00:12:09.224 --> 00:12:10.928
KNOW KAMINA!

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:12.130
&gt;&gt; Nia: I MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.332
THIS BRO PERSON, BUT I

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.368
UNDERSTAND SIMON.

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:16.372
HE IS NOT A HELPLESS PERSON.

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:17.909
BUT IF HE KEEPS DWELLING ON THE

00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:19.411
MEMORY OF SOMEONE WHO’S GONE,

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.213
THEN...

00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:21.783
&gt;&gt; Yoko: YOU LITTLE...

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:22.885
DON’T TALK LIKE YOU’RE

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:24.288
SOME INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:25.758
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHOSE

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:27.394
FAULT IT IS THAT KAMINA’S DEAD!

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.298
SO DON’T YOU DARE STAND THERE

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:33.941
AND CALMLY LECTURE SIMON.

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.316
&gt;&gt; Nia: I APOLOGIZE.

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:40.486
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WHAT YOU SAID IS RIGHT.

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:42.223
NO AMOUNT OF CRYING OR GRIEVING

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:43.459
WILL BRING KAMINA BACK.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:45.496
WE’RE WELL AWARE OF THAT.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.367
MAYBE IT WOULD BE EASIER IF WE

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.237
COULD FORGET ABOUT HIM.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:50.908
BUT WE CAN’T JUST...

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.012
WE CAN’T JUST...

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.314
WE CAN’T FORGET ABOUT HIM LIKE

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:56.118
HE WAS NOTHING!

00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:11.248
&gt;&gt; Nia: SHE HAD TEARS IN HER

00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:12.350
EYES.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.854
&gt;&gt; Simon: IT ISN’T YOUR FAULT,

00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:14.889
NIA.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:16.993
&gt;&gt; Nia: I WANT SO VERY MUCH TO

00:13:16.993 --> 00:13:18.864
LEARN ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE.

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:42.344
&gt;&gt; WH‐‐WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:43.379
WE GOT TROUBLE!

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:44.448
A WALL OF WATER IS COMING

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:45.116
THIS WAY!

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:45.918
&gt;&gt; WATER?

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:47.153
&gt;&gt; MAYBE HE’S SEEING THINGS

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:48.356
AFTER BEING COOPED UP‐‐

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.415
&gt;&gt; ENEMY GUNMEN ON OUR DECK!

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.419
&gt;&gt; I’VE RETURNED, JUST AS I

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.354
PROMISED I WOULD.

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:05.524
STINKING HUMANS!

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:07.060
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: WHAT THE HELL WAS

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.595
THAT ALL A‐‐

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:08.597
&gt;&gt; Kittan: HEY, IT’S THAT CHICK

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:09.297
WITH THE FINS!

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:10.901
&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, WOULD YOU

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:11.569
PLEASE LET ME SEE OUR DEAR

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:12.538
PRINCESS NIA?

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:14.174
I NEED TO KNOW SHE’S SAFE.

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:15.878
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HER FOR

00:14:15.878 --> 00:14:16.913
BEING KIND TO ME.

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:17.915
&gt;&gt; Kittan: SHE’S GOT NERVE,

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.217
COMING HERE ALONE LIKE THAT!

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:20.621
I’M GONNA DECK HER!

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.556
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: DON’T FORGET.

00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:22.558
DAI‐GURREN STILL ISN’T READY

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:23.392
YET.

00:14:23.392 --> 00:14:24.294
WE MIGHT NEED TO FIND A WAY TO

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:25.898
BUY SOME TIME.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:26.533
&gt;&gt; Kittan: GOOD POINT.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.902
OKAY, LET’S HAND OVER THE GIRL.

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:29.204
&gt;&gt; Simon: NO!

00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:30.941
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WHAT’D YOU JUST SAY?!

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.077
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE

00:14:32.077 --> 00:14:33.079
DECISIONS MADE BY YOUR MIGHTY

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:34.147
LEADER, HUH, DO YA, DO YA?

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:35.383
&gt;&gt; Simon: I’M NOT SURE WHY, BUT

00:14:35.383 --> 00:14:37.320
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT’D BE

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.888
RISKY.

00:14:37.888 --> 00:14:38.523
&gt;&gt; Kittan: DON’T GIVE ME THAT

00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:39.257
HALF‐ASSED CRAP!

00:14:39.257 --> 00:14:40.527
COME OUT AND SAY IT!

00:14:40.527 --> 00:14:41.428
QUIT YAMMERING...

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:42.531
&gt;&gt; Nia: IT’S FINE.

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:45.504
I WILL GO TO HER.

00:14:45.504 --> 00:14:46.539
&gt;&gt; Kittan: HEAR THAT?

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:47.541
SHE SAYS SHE’S OKAY WITH IT!

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.543
SO LET’S JUST TURN HER OVER AND

00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:49.144
BE DONE WITH IT!

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:50.547
&gt;&gt; Simon: YEAH, BUT...

00:14:50.547 --> 00:14:51.883
&gt;&gt; Yoko: DON’T WORRY, YOU GUYS.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.052
I HAVE A FEELING THAT NIA HERE

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:55.056
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO AVOID

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:56.258
A BATTLE.

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:57.561
&gt;&gt; Nia: MISS YOKO, THANK YOU FOR

00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.997
ALLOWING ME TO DO THIS.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:14:59.565
&gt;&gt; Yoko: DON’T GET

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.466
THE WRONG IDEA.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:01.468
THIS DOESN’T MEAN THAT I

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.337
TRUST YOU.

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:03.372
I’M GONNA HAVE THIS RIFLE

00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:04.542
TRAINED ON YOUR BACK

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:05.878
THE ENTIRE TIME.

00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:07.247
IF I SEE ANY FUNNY BUSINESS,

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:09.619
I WON’T HESITATE.

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:11.623
&gt;&gt; Nia: RIGHT.

00:15:11.623 --> 00:15:13.125
&gt;&gt; I’M GLAD YOU’RE SAFE,

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:14.595
PRINCESS NIA.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.966
&gt;&gt; Nia: TELL ME, ADIANE.

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:18.235
ARE YOU AND THE OTHERS FIGHTING

00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:19.605
THE HUMANS ON THE SURFACE AND

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:22.110
TRYING TO MAKE THEM SUFFER?

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.153
&gt;&gt; IT’S AS YOU SAY, PRINCESS.

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:29.090
OUR DUTY IS TO SEEK OUT EVERY

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.326
LAST HUMAN ON THE SURFACE

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:31.696
AND TO SLAUGHTER EVERY ONE.

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:33.332
&gt;&gt; Nia: AND TELL ME, WAS IT MY

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.535
FATHER WHO ORDERED YOU TO CARRY

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:35.403
OUT THESE ACTIONS?

00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:36.405
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:37.942
&gt;&gt; Nia: AND UPON RECEIVING THESE

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:39.177
ORDERS FROM MY FATHER, YOU

00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:40.647
HARBORED NO DOUBTS ABOUT THEM?

00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:42.518
&gt;&gt; DID I "DOUBT" THEM? NEVER!

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:45.223
HUMANS ARE AS LOWLY AS WORMS,

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:46.458
MAYBE EVEN LOWLIER.

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.962
THEIR SUFFERING AND THEIR

00:15:47.962 --> 00:15:49.231
PITIFUL LITTLE DEATHS ARE

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:50.266
BENEATH OUR NOTICE,

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:50.701
PRINCESS NIA.

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:51.636
&gt;&gt; Kittan: AS LOWLY AS WORMS.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:53.005
&gt;&gt; Nia: I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!

00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:54.942
I WANT TO DISCUSS THIS WITH MY

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:55.376
FATHER!

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:56.078
ADIANE, THE ELEGANT,

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:57.648
IN THE NAME OF THE SPIRAL KING,

00:15:57.648 --> 00:15:59.552
I ORDER YOU TO TAKE ME TO HIM!

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.121
&gt;&gt; YOU REALLY PISS ME OFF!

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:02.157
IF YOU WANNA GO, TAKE YOUR OWN

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:04.060
SORRY ASS!

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.964
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.068
&gt;&gt; HAS IT NOT SUNK IN YET,

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:09.404
YOU, LITTLE DARLING, AREN’T A

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:10.306
PRINCESS ANYMORE!

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:12.578
THE SPIRAL KING HAS ABANDONED,

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:15.116
ABANDONED, ABANDONED YOU!

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:16.553
I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU DID,

00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:18.155
BUT HE SAID I SHOULD KILL YOU

00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:19.324
WITH THE REST OF THE WORMS!

00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:20.727
&gt;&gt; Nia: HE ABANDONED ME?

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.063
KILL ME?

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:23.533
HE REALLY SAID YOU SHOULD

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:24.301
KILL ME?

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.606
&gt;&gt; Simon: SHE WAS ABANDONED?

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.152
LAGANN!

00:16:33.152 --> 00:16:34.287
COME ON.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:35.156
PLEASE JUST WORK.

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:36.124
I WAS RIGHT!

00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:37.393
THAT WOMAN DID NOT COME HERE TO

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:38.730
TAKE NIA BACK!

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.665
&gt;&gt; Nia: YOU’RE LYING!

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.034
IT CAN’T BE‐‐ FATHER WOULD NEVER

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.270
DO SUCH A HORRIBLE THING.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.607
&gt;&gt; OH, HE WOULDN’T?

00:16:43.607 --> 00:16:44.642
YOU JUST THINK WHATEVER YOU

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:45.409
WANT!

00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:47.180
EITHER WAY, I’M SENDING YOU OFF

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.184
TO THE NEXT WORLD, MISSY!

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:50.554
&gt;&gt; Nia: SO DOES THIS MEAN

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:51.589
YOU HATE ME TOO, ADIANE?

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:53.192
&gt;&gt; HATE YOU?

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:54.294
I REALLY COULDN’T CARE LESS

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:57.267
ABOUT YOU.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.371
I WAS TOLD TO KILL YOU,

00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:01.141
SO THAT’S PRECISELY WHAT I’M

00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:02.443
GOING TO DO!

00:17:02.443 --> 00:17:04.247
WHETHER OR NOT I HATE YOU

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:05.617
IS IRRELEVANT!

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:07.053
&gt;&gt; Nia: SO YOU’RE SAYING THAT

00:17:07.053 --> 00:17:08.055
YOU’RE WILLING KILL ME...

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:09.559
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WERE ORDERED

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:10.727
TO DO SO?

00:17:10.727 --> 00:17:11.729
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I AM!

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:12.497
WHAT OF IT?!

00:17:12.497 --> 00:17:13.733
&gt;&gt; Nia: IF MY FATHER ORDERED YOU

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.102
TO TAKE YOUR OWN LIFE, WOULD YOU

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:18.710
DO THAT, TOO?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.712
YOU HAVE GOT THIS ALL WRONG,

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:21.081
ADIANE!

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.417
THESE PEOPLE ARE DECENT AND

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.120
GOOD, AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:24.589
WRONG!

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.358
THEIR ONLY WISH IS TO LIVE

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:27.695
ON THE SURFACE IN PEACE!

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:29.231
