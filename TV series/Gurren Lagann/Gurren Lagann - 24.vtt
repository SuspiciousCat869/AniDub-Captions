DAI‐GURREN’S PRODUCTION CAPACITY

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:29.866
IS DOWNRIGHT TERRIFYING.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.102
YOU GUYS DON’T REALLY NEED

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:32.004

TIME FOR ONE LAST BRAWL.

00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:10.915
I DON’T WANNA SEE ANYBODY

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:12.752
HOLDING ANYTHING BACK, OKAY?

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:14.154

&gt;&gt; Yoko: [giggles]

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:25.010
A LADY’S GOT TO HAVE A FEW

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.546

THAT THING IS TOO BIG.

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:43.099
I JUST DON’T THINK OUR DRILL

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:44.268
IS GONNA BE ENOUGH!

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:45.571
&gt;&gt; Simon: YOU MEAN, WE’RE GONNA

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.338
NEED TO USE AN EVEN

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:47.675
BIGGER DRILL?

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:48.944
WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:51.950
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.952

&gt;&gt; Simon: LEYTE!

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.196
&gt;&gt; Leyte: IF YOU TRANSFORM

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.033
THE SUPER GALAXY DAI‐GURREN

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.603
INTO HUMANOID MODE, YOU SHOULD

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:02.839
BE ABLE TO USE ITS DRILLS!

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:03.306
&gt;&gt; Simon: TRANSFORM?

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.776
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THAT IS CORRECT.

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.112
IT IS THE HUMAN FORM IN WHICH

00:10:06.112 --> 00:10:08.182
SPIRAL POWER IS MANIFESTED

00:10:08.182 --> 00:10:09.017
MOST POWERFULLY.

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:11.255
TRANSFORMING SUPER GALAXY

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:12.658
DAI‐GURREN INTO HUMANOID MODE

00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:14.662
WILL GREATLY AMPLIFY ITS

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:15.698
SPIRAL ENERGY,

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:16.867
AND IT WILL COME TO POSSESS

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.236
A POWER RIVALING THAT OF

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:21.008
A MICRO COSMOS.

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:22.244

GURREN LAGANN, HUH?

00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:24.616
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: IT IS NOT THAT

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.651
SIMPLE.

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.622
TO TRANSFORM SO VAST A VESSEL,

00:10:27.622 --> 00:10:29.024
IT IS NECESSARY TO FUNNEL

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:30.326
MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF SPIRAL

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.097
POWER DIRECTLY INTO

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.366
THE MAIN ENGINE.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.769
THE ONLY PERSON POSSESSING

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:37.742
SUFFICIENT SPIRAL POWER‐‐

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.011
&gt;&gt; Simon: IS ME.

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:40.280
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.015
LIKE WE DON’T HAVE ANY

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.150
OTHER OPTIONS.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.919
&gt;&gt; Kittan: THAT’S RIGHT.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.321
GET GOIN’, SIMON.

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.724

00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:12.865
THE JOB WE WERE GIVEN.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.167

THOSE BIG THINGS HAVEN’T

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.417
BOTHERED TO ATTACK US YET?

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.386

00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:24.789
OF SOME KIND OF TRAP.

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.091

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.247
LONGER WILL THIS TAKE?

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:38.784
&gt;&gt; Leyte: WE NEED TO GENERATE

00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:40.119
48% MORE POWER.

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:42.892
ANOTHER TEN MINUTES OR SO.

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.194
I’LL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:45.798
IS READY ON THIS END.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.900
