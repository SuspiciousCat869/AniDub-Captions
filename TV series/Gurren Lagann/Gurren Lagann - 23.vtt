00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:23.621
&gt;&gt; Simon: HUH?

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:25.658
&gt;&gt; Magin: SO, WHAT ARE YOU

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:27.662
DOING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:28.831
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I COULD ASK THE

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:30.768
SAME OF YOU.

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:31.435
&gt;&gt; Magin: IT’S THE

00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:32.939
STRANGEST THING.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:34.509
THIS PLACE IS HARDLY FULL OF

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.145
HAPPY MEMORIES FOR ME, AND YET,

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:37.749
IT SEEMS TO BE THE ANCHOR

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:40.721
OF MY SOUL.

00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:45.865
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FOR YOU.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.469
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO, SIR.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:49.673
HERE.

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:51.042
&gt;&gt; Magin: ISN’T THAT...

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:54.716
OUR HOLY BOOK?

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:57.154
YOU KEPT IT ALL THIS TIME.

00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:58.122
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I’M RETURNING IT

00:07:58.122 --> 00:07:58.824
TO YOU.

00:07:58.824 --> 00:07:59.626
&gt;&gt; Magin: EH?

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:00.628
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I’M NOT THE RIGHT MAN

00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:01.697
TO HOLD IT.

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:03.834
&gt;&gt; Magin: HAVE YOU READ IT?

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.036
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO, THAT BOOK CANNOT

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:06.205
BE READ.

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:07.174
&gt;&gt; Magin: WHAT?

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:08.176
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I COMPARED THE

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:09.512
WRITING IN IT TO EVERY KNOWN

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:10.781
FORM OF ANCIENT LANGUAGE.

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:11.750
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.152
IT ANYWHERE.

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:14.254
&gt;&gt; Magin: WHAT IS IT, THEN?

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:15.524
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: SOMEONE PROBABLY MADE

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:17.995
IT AS A PRACTICAL JOKE.

00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:19.699
&gt;&gt; Magin: A JOKE?

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.004
OUR HOLY BOOK WAS JUST NONSENSE?

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:22.772
[laughing]

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:26.212
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: YEP.

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:34.228
[laughter]

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:35.798
&gt;&gt; Magin: SO ALL THE TIME, I WAS

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:36.833
PREACHING GOD’S WORD HOLDING

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:37.969
SOMEONE’S PRACTICAL JOKE

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:39.238
IN MY HAND?

00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:41.877
I’D SAY THAT’S RATHER RICH!

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:42.945
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: YOU EVENTUALLY LEARN

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.214
THAT SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT WAS

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:45.216
A PRECIOUS TREASURE IS NOTHING

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:46.686
BUT JUNK.

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:47.755
I WONDER IF THAT QUALIFIES AS

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:48.724
EVOLUTION?

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:51.062
&gt;&gt; Magin: YES, IT’S POSSIBLE.

00:08:51.062 --> 00:08:53.066
WHAT A STRANGE THING.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.201
[chuckling]

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.240
BUT YOU KNOW, ROSSIU...

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.076
THAT’S WHAT MAKES HUMANS

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:00.046
SO FASCINATING.

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:03.587
DON’T YOU THINK THAT’S SO?

00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:05.591
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO, I DON’T THINK SO.

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:08.997
I DON’T SEE IT THAT WAY AT ALL.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:14.843
&gt;&gt; Kinon: ARTENBOROUGH SAYS HE

00:09:14.843 --> 00:09:16.178
SAW ROSSIU.

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:17.548
HE SAID THAT HE FLEW OFF

00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:20.921
SOMEWHERE IN A GUN‐SPINNER.

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:22.124
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NEVER THINK THAT YOU

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.226
CAN GO IT ALONE.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:24.596
GET THE JOB DONE WITH THE

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:26.165
PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.702
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT.

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:30.674
THAT IS ALL I CAN TELL YOU.

00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:33.212
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:35.183
KINON, I AM GRATEFUL FOR

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:38.222
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:09:38.222 --> 00:09:39.291
&gt;&gt; Kinon: HE’S BEEN ACTING FUNNY

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:40.928
FOR A LONG TIME, EVER SINCE

00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:42.698
WE RETURNED TO THE SURFACE,

00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:43.634
LIKE HE WAS HAUNTED BY

00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:44.201
SOMETHING, OR‐‐

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:46.272
&gt;&gt; Simon: STAY CALM, KINON.

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:47.140
ARE YOU ABLE TO TRACK HIS

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.911
GUN‐SPINNER’S SIGNATURE?

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:49.879
&gt;&gt; Kinon: EH?

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.852
UH, YEAH!

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:54.021
IT’S A LITTLE FAINT, BUT I’M

00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:54.989
GETTING SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.292
THE EAST‐NORTHEAST.

00:09:56.292 --> 00:10:00.166
&gt;&gt; Simon: ROGER.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.202
&gt;&gt; Magin: ROSSIU,

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.270
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.206
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: THE GROUND’S BEEN

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.241
DISTORTED BY THE MOON’S

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:05.644
APPROACH.

00:10:05.644 --> 00:10:06.680
I DON’T WANT MY HOMETOWN TO BE

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.715
DESTROYED, SO I’LL GO CHECK

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:09.051
IT OVER.

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:10.086
&gt;&gt; Magin: THEN LET ME.

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.690
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.725
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS, FATHER.

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:15.296
WAIT UP HERE.

00:10:15.296 --> 00:10:16.800
&gt;&gt; Magin: ROSSIU!

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.979
I THINK YOU DID A FINE JOB.

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:26.018
YOU DID, AN EXCELLENT JOB.

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:27.120
NOT EVERYONE COULD’VE DONE WHAT

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.324
YOU DID.

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:34.669
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: [chuckling]

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:40.346
&gt;&gt; Magin: [grunts]

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:42.384
&gt;&gt; Kinon: THE READING IS CLOSE!

00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:46.325
&gt;&gt; Simon: THAT’S IT?

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:47.829
COME IN, PILOT!

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:48.897
STATE YOUR DESTINATION!

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:49.899
&gt;&gt; Pilot: OH, COMMANDER,

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.101
IS THAT YOU?

00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:52.237
WE’RE JUST RETURNING THE ANIMALS

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:57.214
TO THEIR NATURAL HABITATS.

00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:59.051
&gt;&gt; Simon: SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:00.286
CONTINUE DOING YOUR JOB.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:01.322
&gt;&gt; Kinon: WE WERE CHASING THE

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:02.090
WRONG HEAT SOURCE THIS

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.259
WHOLE TIME.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.063
&gt;&gt; Simon: BE PATIENT, KINON.

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:06.365
&gt;&gt; Kinon: ROSSIU DIDN’T...

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.434
HE DIDN’T OVERTHROW YOU FOR

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.340
PERSONAL GAIN, SIMON.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.981
AFTER THE TRIAL, I‐I SAW HIM.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.053
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: [crying]

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.280
&gt;&gt; Simon: I KNOW HE DIDN’T.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.448
&gt;&gt; Kinon: THAT’S IT!

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:33.019
WHAT ABOUT HIS VILLAGE?

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:34.388
THE ONE WHERE ROSSIU WAS BORN?

00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:35.858
HE SPEAKS ABOUT THAT VILLAGE

00:11:35.858 --> 00:11:37.227
ALL THE TIME!

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:38.429
HE’S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:39.364
HALF OF HIS SOUL IS STILL

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:40.768
BURIED THERE DEEP UNDERGROUND.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:42.137
&gt;&gt; Simon: OH, ADAI!

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:43.239
YOU’RE RIGHT!

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:44.274
HE’S GOTTA BE THERE!

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:45.343
I’M PUNCHIN’ IT, KINON!

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:46.680
&gt;&gt; Kinon: RIGHT!

00:11:50.053 --> 00:11:51.288
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: ONCE, THIS

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:52.424
IMPOVERISHED VILLAGE COULD

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:57.167
SUPPORT NO MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:58.436
BACK THEN, SURVIVAL WOULD

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:01.075
ALWAYS MEAN THAT SOMEONE MUST

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:04.047
BE SACRIFICED.

00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:05.183
ON THE SURFACE, THERE EXISTS

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.955
A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE CAN LIVE.

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:09.157
THAT’S WHAT I BELIEVED AS I

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:10.059
FOUGHT.

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.328
BUT I WAS WRONG.

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:15.203
IN THE END, I WAS GOING TO

00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:16.806
SACRIFICE MORE LIVES THAN

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:21.248
EVER BEFORE.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:25.189
I MUST ATONE FOR THAT SIN.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.095
YOU SHOULD BE SLUGGED

00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:42.898
BY SOMEONE.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.334
I MEAN, THERE’S NO NEED TO

00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:47.440
PUNISH YOURSELF.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.211
AT THE TIME, YOU MIGHT THINK

00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:50.346
THAT IT’S A MISTAKE YOU CAN

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:52.250
NEVER UNDO.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.653
EVEN IF IT IS, IF WE KICK AND

00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:55.223
SCREAM AND FIGHT LIKE HELL,

00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:57.293
WE’LL MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE BIT.

00:14:57.293 --> 00:15:00.166
I WAS TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN THE

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.972
ME THAT BELIEVES IN MYSELF.

00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:04.274
THAT’S PROBABLY HOW IT

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:05.309
SHOULD BE.

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:07.915
LEAST THAT’S WHAT I THINK.

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.384
YOU HAD THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH

00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:10.353
TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING THAT I

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:11.321
NEVER COULD HAVE DONE,

00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:12.223
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:14.327
WHAT’S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT?

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:18.402
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: SIMON...I‐‐

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:19.639
&gt;&gt; Simon: COME ON, ROSSIU.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.408
I NEED YOU.

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:30.527
ACTUALLY, I’M PRETTY SURE

00:15:30.527 --> 00:15:32.130
THERE’S SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.365
WORLD WHO NEEDS YOU EVEN MORE

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.537
THAN I DO.

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:51.435
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I’M SORRY, KINON.

00:15:57.715 --> 00:15:59.217
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT DO YOU THINK,

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:00.453
ROSSIU?

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:01.388
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK IN

00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:02.190
THE COCKPIT AGAIN?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.459
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: IT TAKES ME BACK.

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:04.194
THAT’S FOR SURE.

00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:05.363
&gt;&gt; Simon: I BET.

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:07.500
&gt;&gt; Kinon: I, UM‐‐I’M NOT HEAVY,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.537
AM I?

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.406
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: OH, YEAH, YOU ARE.

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:11.576
YOU’RE VERY HEAVY.

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:12.978
&gt;&gt; Kinon: THEN I’LL‐‐I’LL CLIMB

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:14.080
DOWN IN THAT CASE.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.349
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO, YOU’RE OKAY

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.287
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:18.289
BESIDES, RIGHT NOW, I WANNA

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:20.393
FEEL IT.

00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:21.563
I WANT TO FEEL WHAT THE WEIGHT

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.232
OF A SINGLE HUMAN LIFE IS LIKE.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.969
&gt;&gt; Kinon: YOU JERK.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:30.446
&gt;&gt; Magin: HUMAN BEINGS ARE

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:33.219
FASCINATING INDEED, AREN’T THEY,

00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:36.258
ROSSIU?

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:37.093
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: HOW COULD I HAVE

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:37.995
BEEN SO BLIND?

00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:39.599
THAT’S HOW THEY ELUDED US.

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:40.701
THEY WERE ABLE TO EVADE OUR

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.403
SWEEPS BY CREATING AN IMAGINARY

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:44.575
OSCILLATING TIME‐SPACE BETWEEN

00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:46.613
THE MEMBRANES OF THE UNIVERSES

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:48.115
WE CALL THE 10th AND

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:52.390
11th DIMENSIONS.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.492
&gt;&gt; Ron: SORRY, BOYS.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:54.461
I CAN’T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF

00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:56.498
IT, EITHER.

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:57.635
BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY THE

00:16:57.635 --> 00:16:59.539
ANTI‐SPIRAL HOME WORLD.

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.441
&gt;&gt; Simon: HOW CAN YOU TELL?

00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:03.379
THAT’S...

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:04.314
THAT’S HER RING!

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:05.617
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WHAT’S GOING ON?

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:06.586
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THE UNIVERSE IS

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:07.788
AN ABSTRACT.

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:09.457
IS IT A FIXED REALITY ONLY

00:17:09.457 --> 00:17:10.527
WHEN OBSERVED.

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:11.228
THAT IS ONE OF THE

00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:13.265
FUNDAMENTAL LAWS.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.334
EVEN IN A POCKET UNIVERSE, AN

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.138
OBJECT THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED

00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:17.173
JUST ONCE CAN BE PICKED UP

00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:23.452
ON A SPIRAL SCAN.

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:24.387
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: IT MAY BE THE QUANTUM

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:25.356
UNIVERSE THEORY.

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:26.158
&gt;&gt; Kittan: DO YOU KNOW

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.460
EVERYTHING, ROSSIU?

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.395
&gt;&gt; Viral: THIS ISN’T LIKE

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.032
YOU PEOPLE.

00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:31.134
"EXPLAIN?"

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.303
WHO CARES?

00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:33.339
WE FOUND THEIR HOME WORLD, SO

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:34.074
WE’RE GOING THERE.

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.076
&gt;&gt; Ron: VIRAL’S RIGHT!

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:36.211
WE KNOW WHERE WE’RE GOING.

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:37.347
LET’S GO.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:38.449
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: WITH A SET OF

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:39.752
PERCEPTUAL DIMENSIONAL

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:40.754
COORDINATES, TELEPORTATION

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:42.357
IS POSSIBLE.

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:44.160
AND THAT’S THE PERCEPTUAL

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.496
TELEPORTATION SYSTEM.

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:47.100
&gt;&gt; Ron: IF YOU THINK OF SOMEONE,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.202
IT’LL SEND YOU STRAIGHT INTO

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.237
THEIR ARMS!

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:50.273
JUST THINKING OF THEM GIVES

00:17:50.273 --> 00:17:51.041
YOU WINGS!

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.043
&gt;&gt; Viral: THINK OF ME,

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:52.578
AND YOU DIE.

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:54.147
&gt;&gt; Simon: THAT WARP...

00:17:54.147 --> 00:17:55.651
WE’VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED IT.

00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.220
BASICALLY, IF YOU HAVE FIGHTING

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.422
SPIRIT, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE!

00:17:58.422 --> 00:17:59.725
&gt;&gt; all: [oohing]

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:00.694
&gt;&gt; Simon: EVEN SO, WE SHOULD

00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:02.631
ALSO ASSUME THAT THE ENEMY HAS

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:04.568
THIS WARPING CAPABILITY AS WELL.

00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:05.704
&gt;&gt; Ron: A GOOD POINT.

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:07.240
&gt;&gt; Simon: IF THAT’S THE CASE,

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.475
I’M NOT SO SURE IF IT’S A GOOD

00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:09.612
IDEA FOR GURREN LAGANN TO LEAVE

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:11.381
EARTH RIGHT NOW.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:12.317
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO, FEEL FREE TO GO

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:12.818
WITH THEM, SIMON.

00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:14.120
&gt;&gt; Simon: ROSSIU?

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.855
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: AND DON’T WORRY ABOUT

00:18:14.855 --> 00:18:16.124
EARTH WHILE YOU’RE GONE.

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:17.493
I’LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:19.230
SO PLEASE, ACCOMPANY THEM.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.799
&gt;&gt; Kittan: HE’S ABSOLUTELY

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.234
RIGHT, SIMON!

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.270
IF YOU DON’T GO AFTER IT,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.740
ALL THAT MACHO’LL GO TO WASTE!

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.675
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WE’VE FOUND THE ENEMY’S

00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:26.078
STRONGHOLD, SO LET’S GO SMASH

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:27.280
IT UP.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.550
THAT’S HOW WE’VE ALWAYS FOUGHT

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.152
OUR BATTLES IN THE PAST.

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:31.522
AM I RIGHT?

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:33.125
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:35.363
&gt;&gt; Simon: YOU GUYS?

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:36.298
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WE AIN’T DOIN’ THIS

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:37.534
FOR YOU, SIMON.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.536
WE JUST WANNA PUT AN END TO ALL

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:40.106
THIS CRAP.

00:18:40.106 --> 00:18:41.174
WE’RE SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THAT

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:42.210
DAMN RATTLING AND RUMBLING

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.649
ON THE SURFACE!

00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:52.631
[exhales]

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.300
&gt;&gt; Kittan: OKAY, LISTEN UP.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.537
UNCLE KITTAN’S HEADING OFF

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.539
TO THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:58.175
FOR A BIT, SO...

00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.745
I’LL HAVE A BUNCH OF COOL

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:01.616
STORIES WHEN I GET BACK.

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:05.323
&gt;&gt; Anne: [chuckling]

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:06.659
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: KIYOH, CAN WE TALK‐‐

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:07.661
&gt;&gt; Kiyoh: YOU CAN GO, HONEY.

00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:08.530

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:12.671
&gt;&gt; Kiyoh: THIS IS TEAM

00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:13.640
DAI‐GURREN’S LAST BIG FIGHT,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.875
ISN’T IT?

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:16.144
HOW CAN LITTNER VILLAGE’S VERY

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:16.879

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:17.748
THE SIDELINES?

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:19.552
WELL?

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:20.787

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.899
I’M SO LUCKY I MARRIED YOU!

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.435
&gt;&gt; Kiyoh: YOU BIG LUG.

YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOU PROTECT

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:31.408
OUR PLANET, OKAY?

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:32.343
AND MAKE SURE YOU COME HOME

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:33.713

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:34.548
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: I WILL!

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.218
I PROMISE!

00:19:36.218 --> 00:19:36.853
&gt;&gt; Kiyoh: OH, COME ON.

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:38.288
QUIT CRYING!

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:39.324
&gt;&gt; Kiyal: GUYS SURE ARE IDIOTS

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:42.765
SOMETIMES, AREN’T THEY?

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:52.584
&gt;&gt; Cybela: DIMENSIONAL ANCHORS

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.655
HAVE PENETRATED IMAGINARY SPACE.

00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:55.857
THEY’VE SUCCESSFULLY LATCHED ON

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:56.692
TO THE MOON.

00:19:56.692 --> 00:19:58.195
&gt;&gt; Ron: GIVE THE WORD, DAYAKKA.

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.297
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: INCREASE ENGINE

00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:05.209
INCREASING ENGINE OUTPUT TO 50%!

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:06.746
ALL AHEAD SLOW!
