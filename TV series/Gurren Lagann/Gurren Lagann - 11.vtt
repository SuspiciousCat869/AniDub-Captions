00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:28.062
&gt;&gt; Girl: WELL, YOU SEE,

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:29.198
I DON’T KNOW HOW TO TELL

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:30.066
YOU THIS BUT...

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.104
&gt;&gt; Beastman: HEH HEH!

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:33.874
STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND DON’T

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:35.443
MOVE, HUMANS!

00:07:35.443 --> 00:07:36.713
&gt;&gt; Kittan: IMPOSSIBLE!

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:37.682
ALL THIS WAS JUST A BEASTMEN

00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:38.651
TRICK?

00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.519
&gt;&gt; Ron: WE TOLD YOU IT WAS

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.153
FISHY.

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:44.929
&gt;&gt; Kittan: YOU BASTARD!

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:47.935
[guns clicking]

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.104
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WHAT THE HELL WERE

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:51.843
YOU THINKING, MORON?

00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:52.845
&gt;&gt; Beastman 2: SIR,

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.181
DAI‐GUNZAN HAS BEEN SECURED.

00:07:54.181 --> 00:07:55.851
WE’LL NOW BEGIN SEARCHING THE

00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:57.154
AREA FOR NIA AND THE MINIATURE

00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:58.524
GUNMEN.

00:07:58.524 --> 00:07:59.859
&gt;&gt; Guame: VERY WELL.

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.028
AND PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT.

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:05.103
&gt;&gt; Beastman 2: YES, SIR.

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:06.038
&gt;&gt; Guame: BEASTMEN ARE THEIR

00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:07.842
ENEMY, SO THEY ASSUME ALL

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:09.846
HUMANS WILL BE THEIR ALLIES.

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:12.150
WHAT FOOLS.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.152
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY’RE

00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:14.856
SO STUPID THEY, DON’T EVEN KNOW

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:18.564
WHO THEIR NUMBER ONE ENEMY IS.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.799
&gt;&gt; Beastman 3: QUIT RESISTING

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.168
US, YOU LITTLE PUNK!

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.139
YOU’RE PRINCESS NIA, AREN’T YOU?

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.043
GENERAL GUAME SAYS HE WANTS

00:08:25.043 --> 00:08:25.945
TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.147
&gt;&gt; Nia: GUAME?

00:08:27.147 --> 00:08:29.886
VERY WELL THEN, I WILL SEE HIM.

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.890
BUT FIRST PROMISE NOT TO HURT

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.959
THIS PERSON.

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:34.228
&gt;&gt; Beastman 1: RELAX, LADY.

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:35.263
WE HAVEN’T BEEN ORDERED

00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.198
TO KILL ANYONE YET.

00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:37.735
&gt;&gt; Simon: N‐NIA!

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:39.104
&gt;&gt; Beastman 3: STAY PUT!

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:40.173
&gt;&gt; Nia: DON’T WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:42.110
I’LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.916
&gt;&gt; Simon: BUT, NIA...

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:46.252
&gt;&gt; Nia: YOU KNOW...

00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:48.156
YOU’LL NEVER BE YOUR BRO.

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:49.526
I THINK YOU SHOULD ALWAYS

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:50.694
BE YOURSELF.

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:52.164
[giggles]

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:56.038
&gt;&gt; Simon: [whimpering]

00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:57.140
&gt;&gt; Beastman 3: YOU’RE WITH ME.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.879
NOW COME ALONG.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.683
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA...

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:02.117
&gt;&gt; Kittan: DAMN IT!

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:04.254
LET GO OF ME, YOU FURBALL!

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:05.223
&gt;&gt; Guame: HUMANS!

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:07.094
NO MANNERS AT ALL.

00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:09.164
IT’S "MR. FURBALL" TO YOU.

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:10.801
I’M GUAME, THE IMMOVABLE,

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.803
ONE OF THE FOUR GENERALS OF

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.239
THE SPIRAL KING!

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:15.878
AND I AM TAKING BACK DAI‐GUNZAN.

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:17.214
BUT FIRST I’M GOING TO EXECUTE

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.917
YOU PUBLICLY AS A WARNING TO

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:20.286
THE OTHERS.

00:09:20.286 --> 00:09:21.890
STAY IN HERE UNTIL WE’RE READY

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.761
FOR YOU!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.002
THE SPIRAL KING HAS ISSUED

00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:30.941
ORDERS TO HAVE YOU ELIMINATED.

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:32.144
&gt;&gt; Nia: THEN I GUESS THAT MEANS

00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:34.114
WHAT ADIANE SAID IS TRUE?

00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:35.951
&gt;&gt; Guame: YES, INDEED, IT IS.

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.287
YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU’D DIED

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:39.091
IN THAT BOX IN THE VALLEY,

00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.959
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A QUIET,

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:45.036
PAINLESS DEATH.

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.573
HI MAJESTY IS IMBUED WITH

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:48.844
IMMORTALITY AND HAS LIVED FOR

00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:50.815
A THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE.

00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:52.284
CREATING AND RAISING CHILDREN

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.987
IS A PASTIME FOR HIM.

00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:55.958
HE DISPOSES OF THOSE HE TIRES

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.262
OF, AS HE WOULD A DOLL.

00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:02.304
THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:07.114
&gt;&gt; Nia: LIKE A DOLL?

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:08.249
&gt;&gt; Guame: NOW I’VE BEEN TOLD

00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:10.120
YOU ACTUALLY ASKED HIM STRAIGHT

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.758
TO HIS FACE, "WHY WAS I BORN?"

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:14.361
THAT WAS A BAD MOVE.

00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:16.265
HIS MAJESTY DETESTS HUMAN

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:16.933
SELF‐AWARENESS.

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:18.269
BUT WHO CAN BLAME HIM?

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:19.672
WHY WOULD A PUPPET, A SIMPLE

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:26.218
PLAYTHING, NEED SELF‐AWARENESS?

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:27.889
&gt;&gt; Nia: SO I’M...

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.859
I’M JUST LIKE THAT DOLL.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:32.097
&gt;&gt; Guame: [laughs]

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:35.136
WELL, TRUTH BE TOLD, YOU ARE FAR

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:38.009
TOO LOVELY TO DO AWAY WITH.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.344
I’VE GIVEN SOME THOUGHT OF

00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:40.614
FINDING A WAY FOR YOU TO

00:10:40.614 --> 00:10:43.286
CONTINUE LIVING.

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.023
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN BEING

00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:47.194
VILLAGE CHIEF?

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.797
&gt;&gt; Nia: VILLAGE CHIEF?

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:50.066
&gt;&gt; Guame: WHY NOT?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.202
THE GIRLS HERE COME FROM

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:52.972
VILLAGES FAR AND WIDE, AND WE

00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:54.074
NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE THEM

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.410
UNDER WING AND TEACH THEM ALL

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.047
ABOUT PROPER ETIQUETTE AND

00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:58.349
DECORUM BEFORE THEY’RE SENT OFF

00:10:58.349 --> 00:10:59.351
TO THE PALACE TO BEGIN THEIR

00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:00.788
TIME IN THE SERVICE OF

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:02.023
HIS MAJESTY.

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.059
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHAT KIND OF SERVICE?

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:04.261
WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AFTER

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.163
THEY’RE SENT TO LIVE

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:06.065
WITH THE KING?

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.234
&gt;&gt; Guame: THE SPIRAL KING

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.269
LAVISHES THEM WITH HIS

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:09.238
AFFECTIONS.

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:11.008
IT’S A FAIR EXCHANGE.

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:12.043
THEY GET TO EXPERIENCE LUXURY

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:13.312
THEY COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM OF

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:14.414
KNOWING LIVING IN THEIR

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:16.051
UNDERGROUND HOVELS.

[Nia gasps]

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:20.426

00:11:20.426 --> 00:11:22.063
AWAY TO BE WITH THE KING,

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:23.734
THEY’RE DOLLS TOO, RIGHT?

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.370
&gt;&gt; Guame: YES, THAT’S RIGHT.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.274
AND SOMEDAY THEY’LL BE DISCARDED

00:11:27.274 --> 00:11:30.179
EXACTLY LIKE YOU WERE!

HERE.

00:13:07.207 --> 00:13:08.476

00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:11.315
HE MEANT.

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:13.553
KAMINA ONCE SAID TO ME...

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:14.822
"HE’S ALWAYS THE ONE WHO SAVES

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:16.325

GIVES UP, NEVER."

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.940
&gt;&gt; Kittan: HE DID?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.312
&gt;&gt; Kamina: IT WASN’T GOING WELL.

00:13:26.312 --> 00:13:27.515
MY CONFIDENCE WAS SHOT, AND I

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.349
THOUGHT WE WERE HEADING IN THE

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.886
WRONG DIRECTION.

00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:31.355
I FREAKED OUT AND KEPT ASKING

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:32.958
MYSELF, "WHY DID MY DAD MAKE IT

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.361
UP TO THE SURFACE AND I CAN’T?"

00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:35.798
HONESTLY, I WAS JUST ACTING

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:37.033
TOUGH.

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:38.904
EVERYONE WAS WHINING, AND THEY

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:40.239
STOPPED DIGGING.

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:41.910
I GUESS I WAS FINALLY AT THE END

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.081
OF MY ROPE.

00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:45.450
BUT SIMON, HE KEPT ON DRILLING

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.920
AWAY.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.590
HIS DRILLING LET ME PUT ON

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.059
A BRAVE FACE.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:51.596
BY DUMB LUCK, HE BROKE THROUGH

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:54.434
THE LAST BOULDER RIGHT THEN.

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.405
WE GOT REALLY LUCKY.

00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:57.942
BUT I HAVE FAITH

00:13:57.942 --> 00:13:58.877
IN ALL THAT LUCK...

00:13:58.877 --> 00:14:00.413
AND IN SIMON, WHO BROUGHT US

00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:01.583
THAT LUCK IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.419

ALL HUNCHED OVER, DIGGING AWAY.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.569
I THINK TO MYSELF, "I REFUSE TO

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:16.145
BE LAUGHED AT BY THAT BACK."

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.480
LISTEN, SIMON.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.984
NEVER FORGET THIS.

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.219
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:21.890
NOT IN THE SIMON THAT I HAVE

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.591
FAITH IN.

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:23.593
NOT IN THE KAMINA THAT YOU

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.430

IT’S GOT TO BE THERE SOMEWHERE!
