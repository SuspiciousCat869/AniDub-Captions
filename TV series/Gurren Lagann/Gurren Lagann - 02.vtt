00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.008
&gt;&gt; Kamina: THE MOON AND STARS.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:03.514
SIMPLE NAMES, AIN’T THEY?

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:05.150
&gt;&gt; Simon: SORTA MAKES YOU WONDER

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.787
WHY THEY GOT THOSE NAMES.

00:07:06.787 --> 00:07:08.590
I MEAN, IF THE LIGHTS IN THE

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.793
SKY HAVE NAMES, THEN MAYBE THE

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:10.861
PEOPLE IN THE PAST USED TO LOOK

00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:11.863
UP AT THEM TOO, RIGHT?

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:13.634
JUST LIKE WE’RE DOING.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.769
&gt;&gt; Ron: WELL, YOU’RE NOT JUST

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:15.871

00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:16.707
HONEYBUNCH?

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:18.911
AND I THINK YOUR MECHA’S

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:19.746
FASCINATING!

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:20.781
IT MAY BE SMALL, BUT IT’S

00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:22.518
PACKING A LOT OF POWER!

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:23.453
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT ARE YOU

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:24.021
DOING THERE?

00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:25.524
&gt;&gt; Ron: RUNNING NUMBERS.

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:26.760
WANNA SEE?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.829
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT ARE THOSE

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:28.530
SQUIGGLY LINES?

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.164
&gt;&gt; Ron: OOH!

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:30.735
YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO READ?

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:31.837
&gt;&gt; Simon: "READ"?

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:32.939
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:33.741
&gt;&gt; Kamina: UH‐UH.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:34.709
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WOW, WHAT A COUPLE

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:35.611
OF BUMPKINS!

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:36.613
&gt;&gt; Ron: YOU’RE NOT EXACTLY

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:37.849
A BOOKWORM YOURSELF, MISSY.

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.153
&gt;&gt; Yoko: I CAN READ FINE.

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:41.757
THAT ONE SAYS "STARS,"

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.059
AND THIS ONE SAYS "MOON."

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:44.896
&gt;&gt; Simon: OH.

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:45.965
&gt;&gt; Ron: I JUST HAD A THOUGHT.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.434
IT’S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.038
PEOPLE USED TO LIVE UP HERE ON

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:51.576
THE SURFACE A LONG TIME AGO.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:52.912
&gt;&gt; Kamina: YOU’RE KIDDING.

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:53.814
&gt;&gt; Ron: SOME RECORDS SAY THEY

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:55.885
DID, AND OTHERS SAY THEY DIDN’T.

00:07:55.885 --> 00:07:56.687
&gt;&gt; Kamina: WHICH IS IT?

00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:57.789
&gt;&gt; Ron: A BIT OF BOTH, LIKE HOW

00:07:57.789 --> 00:07:59.224
I’M KIND OF MAN AND WOMAN.

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.528
&gt;&gt; Kamina: YEAH, WHATEVER.

00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:01.697
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:02.832
&gt;&gt; Ron: I’M LEERON,

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:04.034
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME RON.

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:05.504
OR YOU COULD CALL ME "BEAUTIFUL

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:06.072
QUEEN" IF YOU LIKE!

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:07.140
&gt;&gt; Kamina: I’D RATHER DIE!

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.176
&gt;&gt; Yoko: YOU’D NEVER GUESS, BUT

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:09.178
RON HERE KNOWS JUST ABOUT

00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:10.046
EVERYTHING.

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:11.583
AND HE’S ALSO THE GUY WHO TAKES

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:12.852
CARE OF OUR WEAPONS MAINTENANCE.

00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:13.687
&gt;&gt; Kamina: SERIOUSLY?

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:14.889
&gt;&gt; Ron: IS THAT SO STRANGE?

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:15.925
YOU WANNA GIVE THESE FINGERS

00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.027
A DEXTERITY TEST?

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:18.496
YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:21.803
YOU JUST MIGHT LIKE IT.

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:22.839
&gt;&gt; Kamina: DIE, YOU!

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.475
&gt;&gt; Yoko: NOW, NOW.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:25.778
ANYWAY, I’VE GOT THIS LITTLE

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:28.149

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:31.623
I WANT YOU TO CARRY THIS FOR ME.

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:34.696
&gt;&gt; Simon: BUT...

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.700
&gt;&gt; Yoko: WHAT’S THAT THING?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.773
OHH, IT’S KINDA PRETTY.

00:08:39.773 --> 00:08:45.785
[Ron and Kamina arguing]

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.855
[both gasp]

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:58.811
GUESS IT WORKS AFTER ALL,

00:08:58.811 --> 00:08:59.579
DOESN’T IT?

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:04.656
WELL, FOLLOW ME.

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:05.858

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:08.797
&gt;&gt; Ron: OH, SO FASCINATING.

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:09.833

ABOUT THIS.

00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:25.263

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:33.914
IF WE WEREN’T SO STRAPPED FOR

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:35.851

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.189
HUH?

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:42.899
&gt;&gt; Kamina: WHAT THE HELL’S THAT?

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.001
&gt;&gt; Yoko: SOMEONE WHO WAS KILLED

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:45.805
BY GUNMEN.

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:47.040

&gt;&gt; Kamina: HAH! PATHETIC.

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.229
YOU ASK ME, IT’S A WASTE OF TIME

00:09:58.229 --> 00:09:59.364
DIGGING GRAVES FOR PEOPLE

AND IT BECAME UNINHABITABLE.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:32.899
WE HAD TO COME TO THE SURFACE.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.869
AND WHEN WE DID, THOSE GUNMEN

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:36.940
WERE WAITING FOR US.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.342
WE CAN’T GO HOME, SO OUR

00:10:38.342 --> 00:10:39.879
