&gt;&gt; Dayakka: DON’T WORRY ABOUT

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:23.607
US, SIMON.

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:24.809
YOU GO TO LORDGENOME

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:26.112
AND DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:27.080
&gt;&gt; Simon: I WILL, BUT‐‐

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.686
&gt;&gt; Yoko: HURRY UP AND GET GOING!

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:30.888
&gt;&gt; Simon: YOKO.

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:31.957
&gt;&gt; Yoko: GO ON, SIMON.

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:32.892
THIS IS WHAT WE’VE ALL

00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:36.900
BEEN WORKING SO HARD FOR.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.212
&gt;&gt; Simon: YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:46.085
&gt;&gt; Ron: OKAY, DAI‐GURREN.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:48.590
IT’S TIME FOR YOUR LAST JOB.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.592
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: SET TIMERS ON

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:50.728
EXPLOSIVE MAGAZINES!

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:51.997
&gt;&gt; TIMER SET!

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:53.132
&gt;&gt; BLOW ’ER UP!

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.138
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: EMERGENCY...EJECT!

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:12.538
&gt;&gt; Yoko: IT’S ALL UP TO YOU

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:14.909
NOW, SIMON.

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:19.919
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: I SEE THAT

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.288
YOU’VE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO

00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:24.729
ARRIVE, MAN OF THE SPIRAL.

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:27.167
&gt;&gt; Simon: LORDGENOME!

00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:39.859
&gt;&gt; NICELY DODGED!

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.830
AS EXPECTED, SIMON!

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.168
&gt;&gt; Simon: VIRAL!

00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:59.899
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.703
AS YOU CAN SEE, I’M A WHOLE NEW

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:02.304
BEING TODAY.

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:03.039
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT’S THAT?

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:03.974
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A NEW BODY

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:05.811
THAT NEEDS NO REST AND CAN

00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.182
GO ON FIGHTING INDEFINITELY.

00:10:08.182 --> 00:10:09.719
I’VE BECOME MORE THAN

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:10.086
A BEASTMAN!

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:14.863
THIS PLACE WILL BE YOUR GRAVE!

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:18.035
WHAT?!

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.908
I‐IT’S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:25.083
HOW CAN THIS BE?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.152
DAMN IT!

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:28.122
WHY CAN’T I DEFEAT HIM?!

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:29.191
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: OH, VIRAL, YOU

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:31.262
POOR LITTLE CREATURE.

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:32.230
&gt;&gt; MAJESTY?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.266
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THE POWER I GAVE

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:35.103
YOU ISN’T MEANT TO BE USED TO

00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:37.274
OVERCOME THE HUMANS.

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:47.027
&gt;&gt; M‐MAJESTY...

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:48.764
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: TO BEGIN WITH, NO

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.935
BEASTMAN WILL EVER BE A MATCH

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:53.105
AGAINST A HUMAN WHO HAS ACQUIRED

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:54.909
THE POWER OF THE SPIRAL.

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:56.412
VIRAL...

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:57.915
IT’S TRUE I GAVE YOU A NEW

00:10:57.915 --> 00:10:59.351
BODY THAT FUNCTIONS WITHOUT

00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:01.823
NEEDING REST AND CAN NEVER DIE.

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:03.059
BUT IT WAS NOT SO YOU COULD

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:04.194
FIGHT HUMANS.

00:11:04.194 --> 00:11:05.664
IT WAS SO YOU COULD BE

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.267
A STORYTELLER WHO WILL RECOUNT

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:08.670
FOR ALL TIME...

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.077
THE VICTORY OF THE SPIRAL KING.

00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:13.714
&gt;&gt; STORYTELLER?

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:14.749
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: STAY WHERE YOU

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:16.285
ARE AND OBSERVE.

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:17.822
OBSERVE THE FATE OF

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:19.157
A FOOLISH HUMAN.

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:21.295
AND THEN, UNTIL THE VERY END

00:11:21.295 --> 00:11:22.698
OF TIME ITSELF, TELL OF THE

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.103
FUTILITY OF RAISING A REBELLION

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:32.284
AGAINST THE SPIRAL KING.

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:33.352
NIA.

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:35.023
&gt;&gt; Nia: IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME,

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.158
MY FATHER.

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:36.993
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: YOU’RE LOOKING

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:37.962
QUITE WELL.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.766
YOU DO KNOW I NEVER EXPECTED

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.101
TO EVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN.

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.772
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHY ARE YOU DOING ALL

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:43.239
THIS, FATHER?

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:45.176
YOU DRIVE HUMANS UNDERGROUND

00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:46.378
AND KILL THEM IF THEY COME TO

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:47.113
THE SURFACE.

00:11:47.113 --> 00:11:49.251
IT’S HORRIBLE!

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.019
HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:51.823
CRUEL AND TERRIBLE THING

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.159
LIKE THAT?

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:59.739
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: [laughing]

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:01.175
IGNORANCE IS SUCH

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:02.244
A FRIGHTENING THING.

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.081
YOU MIGHT BELIEVE YOURSELVES TO

00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:05.149
BE FIGHTING ON THE SIDE

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.252
OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

00:12:06.252 --> 00:12:07.855
BUT I AM THE ONE WHO IS

00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:09.358
TRULY PROTECTING THIS WORLD.

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:11.495
IT IS I, LORDGENOME,

00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:13.266
WHO IS THE ULTIMATE GUARDIAN

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.003
OF HUMANITY.

00:12:15.003 --> 00:12:16.305
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:17.307
&gt;&gt; Nia: THERE’S NO SUCH THING

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:19.011
AS A GUARDIAN WHO...

00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:20.380
KILLS HIS CHARGES.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.017
ARE YOU SO BLIND YOU

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:23.085
CAN’T SEE THERE’S SOMETHING

00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:24.288
WRONG WITH THIS WORLD?

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:26.025
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THIS WORLD THAT I

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:27.762
HAVE CREATED IS THE ONLY PATH TO

00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:30.133
ENSURE HUMANITY’S SURVIVAL.

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:32.137
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE

00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:33.874
STRAYED FROM THAT PATH, AND I

00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:36.245
CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:38.951
FOR HUMANITY’S SAKE,

00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:42.257
YOU MUST DIE.

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.864
&gt;&gt; Nia: AAH!

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:47.133
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THE SPIRAL POWER

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.404
IS STRONG WITHIN YOU.

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:51.308
YET YOU ARE UNAWARE THAT SUCH

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:54.047
POWER LEADS TO DESTRUCTION.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:56.018
ALLOW ME TO TEACH YOU...

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:58.991
[all gasping]

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:05.470
AND SHOW YOU ITS FUTILITY.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.840
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.409
TO POSSESS THE POWER

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:09.979
OF THE SPIRAL.

00:13:09.979 --> 00:13:11.348
I WILL SHOW YOU THE AWESOME AND

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:13.787
TERRIBLE TRUTH OF REAL

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:18.897
SPIRAL POWER.

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:21.468
BEHOLD MY LAZENGANN.

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:27.782
&gt;&gt; Nia: FATHER?

00:13:27.782 --> 00:13:30.253
&gt;&gt; Simon: WAIT. THAT’S A...

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.324
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: A GURREN‐LAGANN TYPE!

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:33.492
THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE REASON

00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:34.996
BEHIND THE IDENTICAL

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:41.175
GURREN LAGANN READINGS.

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.045
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA, YOU KNOW I HAVE

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.448
TO FIGHT HIM.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.920
&gt;&gt; Nia: RIGHT.

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:57.140
[both scream]

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:06.358
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THERE WAS ONCE A

00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:08.262
MAN WHO FOUGHT AS YOU DO.

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:10.233
ALSO UNAWARE HIS ACTIONS WOULD

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.270
ENSURE HUMANITY’S EXTINCTION.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.305
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT ARE YOU

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:13.840
TALKING ABOUT?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.876
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: NOTHING YOU NEED

00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:15.577
TO KNOW.

00:14:15.577 --> 00:14:18.583
YOU’LL BE DEAD SOON, AFTER ALL.

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:35.984
&gt;&gt; Simon: GIGA...

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.557
DRILL...

00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:42.297
BREAK!

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.044
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NO WAY!

00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:11.890
IT’S HOPELESS.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.225
WE CAN’T BEAT HIM.

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:14.394
&gt;&gt; Simon: DON’T GIVE UP!

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.998
KICKING LOGIC OUT AND DOING THE

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:17.467
IMPOSSIBLE IS THE WAY TEAM

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.104
GURREN ROLLS.

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.475
ROSSIU, HAVE FAITH IN ME.

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:23.012
BELIEVE IN THE SIMON WHO

00:15:23.012 --> 00:15:24.414
BELIEVES IN YOU.

00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:26.084
WE STILL HAVE SOME FIGHT LEFT

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:29.057
IN US!

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:29.926
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: YOU HAVE STRENGTH

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.529
ENOUGH TO GET BACK ON YOUR FEET,

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:32.497
I SEE.

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:35.369
WELL, IT WAS A WASTED EFFORT.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:38.209
&gt;&gt; Simon: WE’LL SEE!

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:44.555
ROSSIU!

00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:45.456
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I’M ALL RIGHT.

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:48.462
I’M NOT HELPLESS.

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:50.133
NOW’S YOUR CHANCE, SIMON!

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:51.235
USE LAGANN!

00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:54.374
&gt;&gt; Simon: RIGHT! GOT IT.

00:15:54.374 --> 00:16:00.419
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: GO AWAY.

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:06.699
&gt;&gt; Simon: LAGANN IMPACT!

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.135
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: SO YOU HOPE TO

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:11.308
ABSORB MY LAZENGANN, DO YOU?

00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:13.045
&gt;&gt; Simon: HE EXPLODED!

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:14.515
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: WELL, WELL.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.118
I SEE THAT IT WAS NOT A FLUKE

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:17.688
THAT YOU MADE IT THIS FAR.

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:19.457
HOWEVER, YOUR MISCHIEF

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:21.128
ENDS HERE.

00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:22.565
NOW THAT YOU HAVE LOST YOUR

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.167

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:25.571
SLIGHTEST HOPE OF WINNING.

00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:27.240
&gt;&gt; Simon: QUIT YOUR STUPID

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.741
YAMMERING!

00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:29.377
