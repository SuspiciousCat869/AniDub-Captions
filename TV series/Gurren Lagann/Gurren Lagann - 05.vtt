TOLD EVERYONE THE TRUTH.

00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:55.857
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS THIS TRUTH I

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.260
WOULD TELL?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.696
THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD ONLY SERVE

00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:00.499

THE FIRST THING I DID WHEN I

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.954
BECAME LEADER OF THE VILLAGE WAS

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:12.891

00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:16.465

IF WE SUCCUMB TO SENTIMENTALITY

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.680
WILL BE LOST.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.220

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.957
