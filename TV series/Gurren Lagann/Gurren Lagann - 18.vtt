00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:50.387
HURRY UP AND REALIZE THAT TIMES

00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:51.990
HAVE CHANGED.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.126
&gt;&gt; Darry: MAYBE HE DOESN’T WANT

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.729
THEM TO CHANGE.

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:55.831
&gt;&gt; Gimmy: THAT’S JUST HIM

00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:59.906
THINKING OF HIMSELF.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.838
&gt;&gt; Leyte: WELL...

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.142
&gt;&gt; Simon: HEY, LEYTE, MAKKEN.

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:19.646
&gt;&gt; Leyte: SIMON.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:22.117
[Boota burbles]

00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:23.152
&gt;&gt; Simon: SO I GUESS SHE DIDN’T

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.556
COME HERE, EITHER.

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:25.891
&gt;&gt; Leyte: I’M REALLY SORRY.

00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:27.427
WISH WE COULD’VE BEEN MORE HELP.

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.096
&gt;&gt; Simon: NAH, THAT’S OKAY.

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:30.200
I JUST CAME BY ON THE OFF CHANCE

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.168
THAT SHE MIGHT’VE COME HERE TO

00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:33.540
SEE YOU GUYS.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.976
&gt;&gt; Leyte: SIMON...

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:39.051
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:39.953
&gt;&gt; Simon: THEY SAW THE

00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:40.921
BROADCAST?

00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:41.790
&gt;&gt; Leyte: HUH?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.560
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA’S TRANSMISSION.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.869
&gt;&gt; Leyte: YEAH. THEY SAW IT.

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:49.806
&gt;&gt; Simon: DON’T YOU KIDS WORRY!

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:50.875
’CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.612
WE’LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:53.881
FOR SURE!

00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:54.883
I DON’T KNOW WHAT THIS HUMANITY

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:56.853
ANNIHILATION SYSTEM THING IS,

00:07:56.853 --> 00:07:57.989
BUT IT’S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:03.901
I PROMISE!

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:04.936
&gt;&gt; Leyte: YOU’RE THE ONE THAT

00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:07.809
WE’RE WORRIED ABOUT, SIMON.

00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:09.011
&gt;&gt; Makken: HE SEEMED PRETTY

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.480
DEPRESSED, DIDN’T HE?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.550
&gt;&gt; Leyte: SHAME HE’S NOT

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.552
A MECHA.

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:15.991
THAT, WE COULD FIX.

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.831
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA, WHERE ARE YOU

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:37.869
RIGHT NOW?

00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:38.937
WAS THAT REALLY YOU ON THAT

00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:41.743
BROADCAST, NIA?

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:58.944
NIA!

00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.699
♪ ROW, ROW, FIGHT THE POWER ♪ ♪

00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.780
♪ ROW, ROW, FIGHT THE POWER ♪ ♪

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:20.988
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: WHERE AM I?

00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:22.124
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: IT HAS BEEN SEVEN

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.827
YEARS SINCE YOUR DEATH.

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:25.731
WELL, NO, IT WASN’T YOU

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.833
THAT DIED, EXACTLY.

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:27.935
WE WERE ABLE TO PRESERVE ALL OF

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:29.806
LORDGENOME’S KNOWLEDGE AND

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.075
MEMORIES AS DATA.

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:32.077
ALTHOUGH WE DIDN’T GO AS FAR

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:33.747
AS REPRODUCING HIS PERSONALITY.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:34.849
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: SO YOU WOULD DIG

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:36.185
UP A COFFIN AND DRAG OUT

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.655
THE CORPSE INSIDE?

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:39.793
YOU’VE AN ODD NOTION OF FUN.

00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:40.995
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WE HAD NO CHOICE.

00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:42.097
YOU DIED WITHOUT TELLING US

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:43.099
ANYTHING.

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:44.001
BUT THIS TIME, YOU CAN’T

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:45.003
GET AWAY.

00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:46.138
NOW TELL ME.

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:47.073
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:49.211
WHAT IS SPIRAL POWER?

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:51.115
WHAT IS THE ANTI‐SPIRAL?

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:53.019
AND WHAT DO THESE TWO THINGS

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:54.087
HAVE TO DO WITH HUMANITY?!

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.023
&gt;&gt; Simon: I’VE BEEN LOOKING

00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:56.025
EVERYWHERE!

00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:57.762
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, NIA?

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:58.897
&gt;&gt; Nia: I HAVE BEEN IN A PLACE

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:01.068
UNKNOWN TO YOU.

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.805
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE LEARNED.

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.308
&gt;&gt; Simon: L‐LEARNED WHAT?

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:05.611
&gt;&gt; Nia: I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.613
AND I ARE COMPLETELY

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:09.051
INCOMPATIBLE.

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:10.988
THE SPIRAL NEMESIS WILL BRING

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:11.890
ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.192
OF THIS UNIVERSE.

00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:15.831
WE ANTI‐SPIRALS EXIST TO PREVENT

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.104
THAT FROM HAPPENING.

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:20.674
&gt;&gt; Simon: DO...DO YOU HAVE

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:21.743
A FEVER OR SOMETHING?

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:22.979
I UNDERSTAND YOU EVEN LESS THAN

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.081
I USUALLY DO.

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.985
&gt;&gt; Nia: SIMON, THE CORE DRILL

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:27.220
THAT YOU CARRY WITH YOU IS THE

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.724
VERY SYMBOL OF THE SPIRAL

00:10:28.724 --> 00:10:29.792
NEMESIS.

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.130
ITS POWER, THE SPIRAL POWER,

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.168
WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.905
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: SPIRAL POWER IS

00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:37.642
THE ENERGY OF EVOLUTION.

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:39.979
LIFE‐FORMS WITH HELICAL DNA...

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:42.819
GALAXIES IN SPIRAL SHAPES...

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:43.987
SPIRAL POWER AMPLIFIES THEM TO

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.626
INFINITE LEVELS AS IT DOES

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:47.060
ALL THINGS.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.097
THAT IS THE UNDERPINNING OF

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:50.066
THIS UNIVERSE.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.170
HOWEVER, A GROUP APPEARED WHO

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.272
FEARED THE EFFECTS

00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:54.341
OF SPIRAL POWER.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:55.410
THAT GROUP IS KNOWN TO US AS

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.884
THE ANTI‐SPIRALS.

00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:00.086
MY ORIGINAL BODY, LORDGENOME,

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:03.326
WAS ONCE A SPIRAL WARRIOR WHO

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:04.863
FOUGHT THE ANTI‐SPIRALS IN

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.434
ORDER TO PROTECT THE GALAXY.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.839
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: SPIRAL WARRIOR?

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.710
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: LAZENGANN, THE

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.747
TEPPELIN, EVEN THE GUNMEN, THEY

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:15.684
WERE ORIGINALLY WEAPONS USED TO

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:16.920
FIGHT THE ANTI‐SPIRALS.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.655
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WAIT!

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.291
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT LAGANN

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.126
WAS ALSO A‐‐

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:22.130
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: EXACTLY.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.867
IT WAS ONE OF OUR MOST POWERFUL

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:25.905
WEAPONS.

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:27.073
IT’S A CORE MACHINE, WHICH CAN

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:29.879
CONTROL ANY MECHA WITH WHICH

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.248
IT COMBINES.

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:32.284
THOUGH I SEALED IT UNDERGROUND,

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:35.256
IT WAS FOUND BY HUMANS,

00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:36.960
FATE’S HAND AT WORK AGAIN.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.362
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I DON’T UNDERSTAND.

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.933
IF YOU WERE ONCE A SPIRAL

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:41.135
WARRIOR, THEN WHY WOULD YOU

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.905
SUBJUGATE HUMANITY AND FORCE US

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:46.913
TO LIVE UNDERGROUND?

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.184
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: WE HAD LOST.

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:50.386
THE SPIRAL RACES WERE LEFT WITH

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.357
NO CHOICE BUT TO FLEE TO THEIR

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:53.827
VARIOUS HOME WORLDS.

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:56.900
EARTH IS ONE SUCH WORLD.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.902
AFTER THE ANTI‐SPIRALS

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.039
CONQUERED THE GALAXY,

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:02.143
THEY INSTALLED SPIRAL LIFE‐FORM

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:03.880
ANNIHILATION DEVICES ON ANY

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.049
WORLD WHERE THEY DETECTED

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:06.820
A SPIRAL LIFE‐FORM SIGNATURE.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.924
WHEN THE ABOVEGROUND LIFE‐FORM

00:12:08.924 --> 00:12:10.894
POPULATION EXCEEDS A SET LIMIT,

00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:12.898
THE DEVICE THEN ACTIVATES.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.034
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: AND SO THAT’S THE

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.036
REASON YOU DROVE ALL OF

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:16.472
HUMANITY UNDERGROUND?

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:17.808
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: THINK WHAT YOU

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:18.810
WILL OF ME, BUT I WAS TRYING TO

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.115
PRESERVE HUMANITY AS A SPECIES.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.119
I DID THIS BY MAINTAINING

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.756
A BARE MINIMUM POPULATION

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.091
UNDERGROUND.

00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:27.193
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WHY DIDN’T YOU JUST

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:28.329
COME OUT AND TELL US ALL THIS?!

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:29.866
WHY DID YOU USE FORCE

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:32.337
TO REPRESS US?!

00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:34.943
&gt;&gt; Lordgenome: I HAD TO.

00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:37.213
FOOLISH LIFE‐FORMS DRIVEN BY THE

00:12:37.213 --> 00:12:39.418
SPIRAL INSTINCT BLINDLY STRIVE

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:41.221
TO REACH THE HEAVENS.

00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:42.858
WORDS AND REASON AREN’T

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.529
SUFFICIENT TO CURB THAT DRIVE.

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.365
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.937
IS FEAR.

00:12:48.937 --> 00:12:50.908
EVEN SO, YOU REBELLED

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.045
AGAINST ME.

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.047
WITH A THOUSAND YEARS OF

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:56.251
IDLENESS AND BOREDOM BOTTLED UP

00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:58.022
INSIDE OF ME, MY WILL WAS

00:12:58.022 --> 00:12:59.424
WEAKENED AND NO LONGER STRONG

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:00.961
ENOUGH TO RESTRAIN THE RESTLESS

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:02.030
AMBITIONS DRIVING

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.067
SPIRAL INSTINCT.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:05.069
NO, PERHAPS YOUR LITTLE

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:07.875
INSURRECTION SIMPLY MADE

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.478
MY BLOOD BOIL.

00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:10.948
&gt;&gt; Nia: THAT IS THE TERROR

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:11.816
OF SPIRAL POWER.

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:12.885
NOT EVEN LORDGENOME COULD

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:14.956
RESIST ITS INFLUENCE AND CURB

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:16.325
HIS INSTINCT TO FIGHT.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:17.394
&gt;&gt; Simon: THAT’S CRAZY!

00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:18.997
I JUST WON’T ACCEPT THAT!

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:20.166
HOW COULD ME AND MY BRO’S FIGHT

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.370
BE THE RESULT OF ALL THAT?

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.472
&gt;&gt; Nia: IT’S NOW BEEN

00:13:23.472 --> 00:13:24.474
SEVEN YEARS.

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:26.946
HOW FAR HAS HUMAN CIVILIZATION

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:28.482
ADVANCED AND PROGRESSED IN SUCH

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:29.251
A SHORT TIME?

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:31.055
DO YOU NOT FIND THE SPEED

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:32.257
SOMEWHAT SUSPICIOUS?

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:34.428
THAT IS THE POTENTIAL OF SPIRAL

00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:35.430
LIFE‐FORMS.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.167
THE GROWING HUMAN POPULATION

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.505
AND CIVILIZATIONS WILL ADVANCE

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.941
EXPLOSIVELY.

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:42.477
YOUR POWER WILL THREATEN

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:43.379
OUR OWN.

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.350
AND SO, WE WILL DESTROY YOU

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.218
BEFORE THAT CAN HAPPEN.

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:47.253
&gt;&gt; Simon: THAT’S WHAT THE

00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:48.523
HUMANITY ANNIHILATION SYSTEM IS?

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:50.259
THAT MECHA EARLIER TODAY?

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:52.263
NO MATTER WHAT COMES, WE HAVE

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:53.299
GURREN LAGANN!

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.535
WE CAN DEFEAT THEM!

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:56.005
SO PLEASE, SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:59.344
NIA!

00:13:59.344 --> 00:14:01.315
&gt;&gt; Nia: THAT ISN’T POSSIBLE.

00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:03.185
I AM A MESSENGER SENT HERE

00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:04.287
BY THE ANTI‐SPIRALS,

00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:05.423
A VIRTUAL LIFE‐FORM THAT LAY

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:07.962
HIDDEN IN HELICAL GENETIC CODE,

00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:09.431
AWAKENED WHEN THE SPIRAL

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.135
LIFE‐FORM EXTERMINATION SYSTEM

00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:12.170
WAS ACTIVATED.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.205
&gt;&gt; Simon: COME ON, NIA!

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:15.109
TALK TO ME IN WORDS I CAN

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:16.913
UNDERSTAND, I’M BEGGING YOU!

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:18.416
YOU NEVER TALKED USING WORDS

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:19.519
LIKE THIS, REMEMBER?

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.221
WHEN YOU TALKED, YOU RAMBLED,

00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:21.556
SURE.

00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:22.992
YOU WERE INCOMPREHENSIBLE...

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:24.027
BUT YOU WERE WARM, AND YOU WERE

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:26.231
SWEET, AND YOU WERE SO...

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:28.169
AW! I CAN’T EXPLAIN IT, BUT YOU

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:29.271
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:30.406
YOU DIDN’T USED TO BE

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.310
LIKE THIS, NIA!

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.914
&gt;&gt; Nia: WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:34.381
THE REAL ME.

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:35.617
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: PLEASE, LORDGENOME,

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:36.519
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME!

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:37.454
WHAT IS THE HUMANITY

00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:39.057
ANNIHILATION SYSTEM?!

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:40.359
&gt;&gt; Simon: WHAT DOES THIS SYSTEM

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:42.497
DO TO ANNIHILATE HUMANITY?

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:43.432
&gt;&gt; Nia and Lordgenome: IN THREE

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:45.136
WEEKS, THE MOON WILL BREAK AWAY

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:46.371
FROM ITS ORBIT AND DIRECTLY

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:49.277
IMPACT THE EARTH.

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:51.448
AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT.

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:56.158
[explosion]

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:07.247
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: THE‐‐THE MOON?

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:08.416
WORD OF THIS MUST NEVER GET OUT

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.119
TO THE POPULACE!

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:11.556
THERE’D BE WIDESPREAD PANIC

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:13.058
IN SECONDS!

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:15.229
LORDGENOME, THIS INFORMATION

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:16.131
IS TOP SECRET.

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.601
YOU ARE TO DISCUSS IT WITH

00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:19.639
NO ONE BUT ME.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.442
&gt;&gt; Kittan: ROSSIU! SO THIS IS

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:22.511
WHERE YOU’VE BEEN HIDING?!

00:15:22.511 --> 00:15:23.580
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: DON’T ENTER

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.214
WITHOUT PERMISSION!

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:25.149
&gt;&gt; Kittan: DUMB‐ASS!

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:26.519
WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?!

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.688
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: THE MOON PROBE

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:28.957
GUNMEN HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:30.426
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WHAT?

00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:31.295
&gt;&gt; Kittan: THAT AIN’T

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.096
THE HALF OF IT!

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:35.571
CHECK OUT THE TV!

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:37.073
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: NIA?

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:38.175
&gt;&gt; Kittan: IT’S BEEN RUNNING

00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:39.444
LIVE FOR A FEW MINUTES NOW.

00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:40.581
SHE’S SAYING THAT THE MOON’S

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.651
GOING TO FALL.

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.054
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.156
&gt;&gt; Kittan: THE LITTLE PRINCESS

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:46.492
SAID IT PLAIN AS DAY!

00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:47.528
IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:48.930
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOON

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.166
PROBE, WHO KNOWS?

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.268
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: CAN IT REALLY BE

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:52.170
POSSIBLE?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.272
WE WERE DRIVEN UNDERGROUND

00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:55.343
BECAUSE OF SOME WAR BETWEEN THE

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:57.347
SPIRAL AND ANTI‐SPIRAL RACES.

00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.050
IT’S JUST LIKE LORDGENOME

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.552
PREDICTED.

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.121
THE MOON WILL BECOME

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:01.990
HELL’S MESSENGER.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.960
IT’S GONNA COME DOWN ON TOP

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.570

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.574
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I WAS TOO LATE.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:13.112
MY WORST FEARS ARE COMING TRUE.

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:14.114
&gt;&gt; Kittan: WHAT THE HELL?

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:15.483
&gt;&gt; Dayakka: HEY, I’VE SEEN

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:16.553
THIS GUY BEFORE SOMEWHERE.

00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:17.721
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: I WILL EXPLAIN LATER.

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:23.165
LET’S GO TO THE DEFENSE ROOM.

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:24.535
&gt;&gt; Nia: IT’S IRONIC THAT THE

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:25.971
HUMAN WHOSE GENES CONTAINED

00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.975
THE ANTI‐SPIRAL FACTOR WOULD BE

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:29.177
BORN INTO THIS WORLD AS

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:30.714
LORDGENOME’S DAUGHTER.

00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:33.385
HOWEVER, THE DEFENSE SYSTEM HAS

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:34.421
BEEN ACTIVATED.

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:36.058
I HAVE BECOME AN ANTI‐SPIRAL,

00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:37.327
AND I CAN NEVER AGAIN BE

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.697
MADE HUMAN.

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.447
&gt;&gt; Simon: NIA!

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:49.719
NIA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:54.762

&gt;&gt; Cybela: MUGANN HAVE

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:14.702
APPEARED AGAIN.

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:15.436
&gt;&gt; Gimmy: MUGANN?

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:16.506
&gt;&gt; Cybela: THAT MACHINE

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:17.240
FROM EARLIER.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.175
THAT TYPE HAS BEEN

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:18.677
CODE‐NAMED MUGANN.

00:17:18.677 --> 00:17:21.148

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:23.687

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:35.544
&gt;&gt; Darry: SIMON! IF YOU ATTACK

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:36.779
AND AREN’T CAREFUL, YOU MIGHT

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:38.082
CAUSE ANOTHER BIG EXPLOSION!

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:39.084
WE NEED A PLAN!

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:40.219

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:41.321
SOMETHING WHILE I’M FIGHTING!

00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:42.625

00:17:43.727 --> 00:17:44.595
BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY EFFECTIVE

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:46.131
MEANS OF ATTACKING

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:46.699
THIS THING YET?

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.335
&gt;&gt; Ron: THIS IS DATA WE GOT

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.437
FROM GIMMY AND DARRY.

00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:51.375
IT LOOKS LIKE A POWERFUL ENERGY

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:52.745
BARRIER OF SOME SORT IS

00:17:52.745 --> 00:17:54.147
ERECTED AROUND THE BODY.

00:17:54.147 --> 00:17:56.318
THAT ENERGY BARRIER NEUTRALIZES

00:17:56.318 --> 00:17:57.287
OUR ATTACKS.

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:58.322

00:17:58.322 --> 00:17:59.357

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:00.493
MORE POWER THAN IT CAN HANDLE!

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.499
YOU SAW THAT HUGE EXPLOSION

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:04.167
LAST TIME, RIGHT?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:05.704
A MUGANN IS ESSENTIALLY

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:07.808
COMPRISED OF EXPLOSIVE MATTER.

00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:09.210
WHEN THE ENERGY FIELD GOES DOWN

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.348
AND IT STOPS FUNCTIONING, THE

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:13.185

THAT UNSTABLE?
