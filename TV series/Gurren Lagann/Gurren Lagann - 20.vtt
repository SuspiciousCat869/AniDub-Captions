&gt;&gt; Ron: A SIMULATION OF WHAT’LL

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.705
HAPPEN WHEN THE MOON HITS

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:43.774
THE EARTH.

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:44.776
I’D NEVER CALCULATED ANYTHING

00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:46.011
LIKE THIS, SO IT TOOK A LONG

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.882
TIME TO GENERATE IT.

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:49.184
&gt;&gt; Kittan: BUT THIS MEANS THAT

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:50.220
THE ENTIRE SURFACE IS

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.825
GONNA BE WIPED OUT!

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:53.827
&gt;&gt; Ron: NOT JUST THE SURFACE.

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:55.965
UNDERGROUND TOO.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:56.833
THE ENTIRE SURFACE WILL BE

00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:58.436
STRIPPED OFF BY THE SHOCK OF THE

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:00.440
MOON’S IMPACT.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.210
AFTER THAT, THE WHOLE

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.981
WORLD WILL BE BLANKETED BY

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:04.983
WHITE‐HOT GASSES.

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:05.918
EVERYTHING ON LAND WILL BE

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:08.089
INCINERATED.

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.057
IT WON’T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:11.362
LIFE OF ANY KIND FOR A YEAR.

00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:12.297
&gt;&gt; Kittan: SO WHAT ARE

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:13.132
YOU SAYING?

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.067
ARE YOU JUST GONNA LET

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.771
THE PEOPLE UNDERGROUND DIE?!

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:16.338
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:17.374
OTHER IDEAS?

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:19.044
THE ARC‐GURREN CAN’T CARRY

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:20.179
A MILLION PEOPLE.

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.983
&gt;&gt; Kittan: THEN...

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:22.818
WHY DON’T WE USE THIS THING TO

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:23.887
DESTROY THE MOON?!

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:25.791
THIS DAI‐GUN WE GOT IS HUGE!

00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:26.860
I BET THERE’S NOTHING

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.895
THIS BABY CAN’T DO!

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:28.764
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WE’VE CONSIDERED

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:29.431
THAT, AS WELL.

00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:31.068
IT’S TOO RISKY, KITTAN.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:32.972
IF WE FAIL, HUMANITY TRULY WILL

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:34.308
GO EXTINCT.

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:36.445
TELL ME, ARE YOU ABLE TO BEAR

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:38.049
THAT RESPONSIBILITY?

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.786
&gt;&gt; Kittan: [grumbles]

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:40.888
&gt;&gt; Rossiu: WE WILL SAVE EVERY

LIFE WE CAN.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.992
AND NOT JUST HUMAN LIFE.

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:44.428
WHAT THE ARC‐GURREN CARRIES

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:45.798
WITHIN IT WILL BECOME

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.933
A SECOND EARTH.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.069
WE WILL TAKE ABOARD EVERY LIVING

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:49.204

00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:52.077
COOLS DOWN.

00:12:52.077 --> 00:12:55.149
THAT IS ONLY THING WE CAN DO.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.218
THE LEADER’S ROLE IS NOT TO

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:57.420
FIGHT.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.057
THE LEADER’S ROLE IS TO

00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:00.293
MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS.

DO YOU THINK I’M WRONG?

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:04.067
&gt;&gt; Kittan: NO.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:08.409
NO, YOU’RE NOT WRONG.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:11.181
BUT THAT DON’T MEAN I GOTTA

00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:13.520

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.197
SHE DRINKS WHEN SHE NURSES.
