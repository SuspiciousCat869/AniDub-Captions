1
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,333
We got two women
on RideBacks...!

2
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,041
One of 'em's fugitive,
Rin Ogata...!

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,541
Grimoires are in pursuit!

4
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,416
Damn it!

5
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,875
Tamayo!

6
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,625
Rin!

7
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,000
What the hell?!

8
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,583
Sorry, Tamayo.

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,125
I can't let you get hurt!

10
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
--bringing you
this live coverage...

11
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,875
As we move away from the
site of a recent skirmish,

12
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,791
and turn towards the direction
of GGP Headquarters,...

13
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,083
you can see massive
clouds of thick smoke from

14
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,500
numerous explosions blanketing
multiple districts...

15
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,000
All of Tokyo
seems to be in chaos!

16
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,833
Details are still coming in,
so this is unconfirmed...

17
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,250
But apparently,
the terrorist militia BMA

18
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,291
is claiming responsibility.

19
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,375
No one's riding
those things...!

20
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,416
I thought they
were RideBacks...

21
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,208
They look more like bugs!

22
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,375
Wow...

23
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,708
I had no idea Fuego
could feel so weightless...

24
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,833
Like she really
is a part of me.

25
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,250
Target is still on the move.

26
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,166
Current heading
is toward the city center.

27
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,333
Roger that...

28
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,125
Have the Grimoires
continue their pursuit.

29
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,708
All other units,
return to base!

30
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,250
Flank the terrorists
and block their escape!

31
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,583
Ten-four.

32
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,000
No way, the Anti-aircraft
missiles did nothing!

33
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,125
Keep at it, men...!

34
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,458
Get in close!

35
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,416
Aim for the joints and seams!

36
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,791
Ya make it sound so easy...!

37
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
We're way too
outnumbered here...!

38
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
We gotta stop 'em
at the source!

39
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,666
Units engaged at Gate Three!

40
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,666
Eight enemy
RideBacks eliminated...

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,541
Only two Grimoires lost.

42
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,875
Well within
acceptable loss margins.

43
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,875
I want those
bastards surrounded!

44
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,750
The moment Second
Battalion arrives,...

45
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,916
close those gates!

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,791
Yes, sir...!

47
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,166
Second Battalion is inbound...

48
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,708
ETA, five minutes!

49
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,708
Incoming!

50
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,250
They're blocking
us in from behind!

51
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,250
Get your people
out of here...!

52
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,750
Haven't enough men
died over this crap?

53
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,833
Not quite...

54
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,166
Full retreat!

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,916
Enemy units retreating!

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,541
Second Battalion is on-site!

57
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,166
Gates are being secured.

58
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,875
Now they'll finally
learn their lesson...

59
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,333
Let no one escape!

60
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,500
I show one enemy unit
still inbound...!

61
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,166
It's a black RideBack!

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,708
Give me a visual!

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,958
Saves me having
to hunt him down...

64
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,875
Gatobu!

65
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:38,958
He's your target!

66
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,916
Yes, sir!

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,166
'Old friend'...

68
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,666
You always wanted
to die in battle.

69
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,041
There it is again...

70
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,250
I'm not scared
even though I should be...

71
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,333
Just like before...

72
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,916
Back when I went
to rescue Shouko

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,708
and this whole mess started...

74
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,041
Surrounded by
bullets and smoke...

75
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,875
All I cared about was
the warmth in my heart...

76
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,583
and that beautiful light...

77
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,291
A light I've only seen
when I'm riding Fuego.

78
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,083
It is a moment of rare
and sublime beauty

79
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,291
when rider and machine
achieve perfect harmony.

80
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,375
Sitting atop Fuego,

81
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,833
your intentions
dissolve like smoke...

82
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,083
As you bask in
the light of the elect,

83
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,500
you shed the
obligations that bind you.

84
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,000
You're wrong...

85
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,750
I have an obligation to her!

86
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,083
She jumped!

87
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,041
Douta...!

88
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,458
Douta, wake up!

89
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,083
Rin's on TV,
she's in trouble!

90
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,083
--waiting for an official
GGP or Police statement,

91
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,833
this exclusive footage
appears to depict

92
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,833
the so-called 'RideBack
Girl' involved in the BMA's

93
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,750
violent attack
several months ago...

94
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,333
She has now been
identified as Rin Ogata...

95
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,958
This was taken as Miss Ogata
was being pursued...

96
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,500
Rin, no...

97
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
I thought you got away...

98
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,166
...more details shortly.

99
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,500
Stay with us as we continue
this special coverage...

100
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,500
Flames engulf
GGP Headquarters--

101
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,458
Front gate's
under heavy fire!

102
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,875
Reinforcements...!

103
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,500
The First Battalion is down...!

104
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,791
Please respond!

105
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Second Battalion's
been overrun...!

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,416
Gate has been breached...!

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,625
Explosion...

108
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,375
Numerous casualties...

109
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,083
He's a monster!

110
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,541
Grimoire Control reporting...

111
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,708
Still in pursuit
of suspect Ogata.

112
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,166
Target is in vicinity
of the TV Tower.

113
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,083
I've disabled
the Grimoires...

114
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,541
I want to enjoy
killing you myself.

115
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,125
Target has entered
an alleyway...

116
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,125
Sending in two drones
to surround her.

117
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,708
Hang on, Rin!

118
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,916
Me and Douta are
heading into the city...

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,416
Do you know
where Rin might be now?!

120
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,916
I think...

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,916
near the shopping center
where she saved me.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,833
She's still
within city limits...

123
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,208
Whether she's up to
something or is simply

124
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,625
trying to flee remains unclear.

125
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,791
Fuego can guess how I'll move
with little to no effort.

126
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,166
She's trying
to show me the light...

127
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,083
Because we can't
see it on our own.

128
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,291
But I don't need
to be shown anymore...

129
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,500
I know why I was
drawn to Fuego...

130
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,166
We bring out
each other's true beauty.

131
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,500
Fue-go...

132
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry...!

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,916
I tried, but I can't...!

134
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,375
I'm not like my mother...!

135
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,250
I can't shine like her!

136
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,916
"Life complete?"

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,166
Yes...

138
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,416
For a dancer, the stage
is all she ever needs...

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,250
It is where she lives,
and where she dies.

140
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,916
You won't die!

141
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,833
Don't you know, Rin...?

142
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,791
Our lives are defined
by light, transformed by it...

143
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:16,208
The glow of all we do in our
time shines down on everything.

144
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,416
I don't think
I get it, mommy.

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,791
Someday when
you're older, you will.

146
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,375
I see now...

147
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,583
The light is what
connects us all...

148
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,708
Shouko's light showed me a path
when I was lost in darkness...

149
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,250
My mother's lit up the stage,

150
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,666
dazzling all those who
saw her... The light...

151
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,291
It's the same...

152
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,916
It's in everyone.

153
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,125
Target apprehended...

154
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
Her vehicle was damaged...

155
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
We need hazmat
before this fuel goes up!

156
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,375
Okakura...!

157
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,916
Stay right there, Rin!

158
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,041
When I say, get to
Fuego and run for it.

159
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,083
Fine, but I can't just leave.

160
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,041
I have to finish something.

161
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,291
Finish what...?

162
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,166
You don't have
anything to prove...

163
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,583
None of this is your fault.

164
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,708
Go now!

165
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:19,958
Keep goin'!

166
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,583
'Kay, Fuego.

167
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,083
Time to move.

168
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,416
No more regrets...

169
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,791
It's time to live.

170
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,500
Grimoire Control reporting...

171
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,208
An unknown combatant interfered
in acquiring Target Ogata.

172
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,583
Hang on, where'd that guy go?

173
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,291
Don't move.

174
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,541
Hands up, and step out slowly.

175
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,708
Payback's a real bitch.

176
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,833
Isn't it?

177
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,125
We've remotely severed
the connection

178
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,000
in the stolen
Grimoire Control vehicle.

179
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,833
He was still able
to send shut-down commands

180
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,708
to several drone units.

181
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,375
I want those Grimoires
back online...!

182
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,625
Have the remaining
resume pursuit now!

183
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,416
Without a command vehicle, we're
likely to lose control of them!

184
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,583
I don't care, damnit!

185
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,416
I want this party
eliminated right now!

186
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,208
Message from HQ, sir!

187
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,833
What the hell do they want?!

188
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,416
I have this handled...

189
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,625
That's ridiculous...!

190
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,500
What, now?

191
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,916
In our moment of triumph...?!

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,666
Then what the hell
have I been doing here?

193
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,666
Call off the op.

194
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,750
Sir?

195
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,166
You heard me...!

196
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,208
I've received new orders...

197
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,083
Call for a cease-fire
within the base...

198
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
This fight is over...

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,958
Damn it...!

200
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
The Shortsighted fools!

201
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,083
Reports are flooding in...

202
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,208
We've learned that
four members of

203
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,083
the GGP's governing council...

204
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,916
have been dismissed.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,750
Yeah, it's all over
the news right now.

206
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,541
How's your end?

207
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,875
Total cluster...

208
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,708
I'm guessing the GGP and Hesner

209
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,833
weren't expecting
something like this...

210
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,208
Nice seeing Tokyo
at its Finest.

211
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,250
Over here, sir!

212
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,041
Hesner execs are
gettin' crucified by

213
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,000
the media right now...

214
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,208
Hope the new boss
is better than the old one.

215
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,666
So how's our girl doing?

216
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,666
On her own, still
trying make an escape.

217
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,833
Called off...?

218
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,333
What do you mean,
did something happen?

219
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
We've still got a bunch
of helicopters overhead, so--

220
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:08,708
You there!

221
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,958
Freeze!

222
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,250
Good god...!

223
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,291
I don't know if you're getting
this, but the GGP vehicles

224
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,500
have opened fire
on the police...!

225
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,166
Rin...

226
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,541
Where are you?

227
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,375
Suzuri...

228
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,875
She was murdered
in that park...

229
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,666
Rin...

230
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,041
What are you doing there?!

231
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,875
Please, Fuego...

232
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,333
I need you one last time...

233
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,083
I need to light
my own stage...

234
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,916
I need to let go of the past.

235
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,166
Suzuri...

236
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,625
This is for you.

237
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,208
This is my stage.

238
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,333
The RideBack Girl
is fighting back...!

239
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,083
She's systematically
taking down the GGP robots...

240
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,333
I see...

241
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,625
She's not fighting them...

242
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,166
She's dancing...

243
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,291
I've been waiting
for you, old friend...

244
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,250
Since you wouldn't stay
dead after the last time

245
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,583
I killed you, I get
to do it all over again...

246
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,083
I really am happy to see you.

247
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,541
Likewise...

248
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,333
Only you won't crawl out
of the grave I dig for you.

249
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,208
No.

250
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,458
Not now!

251
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,291
Go...!

252
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,750
Dammit, get outta there now!

253
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,333
Get up, Fuego, just
a little bit longer!

254
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,250
Come on, Fuego!

255
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
I still need you!

256
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,375
Please, we're not finished!

257
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,583
Up, dammit...!

258
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,083
Stand.

259
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,125
up...!

260
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,750
It can't end like--

261
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,666
The light...

262
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,666
It's not gone yet!

263
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,833
Rin, honey...

264
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,291
are you nervous?

265
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250
Let your heart guide you...

266
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,791
It knows the choreography.

267
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,208
And the stage
will welcome you.

268
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,541
Always try to remember, sweetie:
your heart is full of light...

269
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,416
As long as that
light keeps shining,

270
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
you can use it in your dance,
it will guide you...

271
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,000
And the stage will respond.

272
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,375
And then...

273
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,625
you can simply enjoy
the dance itself.

274
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,416
We wanted to
change the world...

275
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,958
But the GGP
changed on us...

276
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,833
We risked our lives
and when they were done,

277
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,833
they simply threw us away...

278
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,125
But that's all in the past.

279
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,583
You're all that matters now.

280
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,958
Time to finish this...

281
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,666
Any last words?

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500
Her leaps defy gravity...

283
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,416
Her grand jeté
makes time stand still...

284
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,000
Every beat of her heart
radiates life...

285
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,083
And then,...

286
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,125
her grand préparation...

287
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,666
Ending in an
impossible jeté entrelacé...

288
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,666
Captivating the audience!

289
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,833
Oh, Rin...

290
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,166
This is all for
Suzuri, isn't it?

291
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,416
Damn.

292
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,833
That took guts.

293
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,083
Rin!

294
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,500
Bravo.

295
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you, Fuego...

296
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,875
Thank you.

297
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,541
The GGP and the
Japanese Government made

298
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,083
a historic announcement today,
laying out their plans

299
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,875
for a new system of government,
to be headed by newly-

300
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,041
appointed Secretary
General, Nanpuu Kataoka...

301
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,416
Under the revised constitution,
the GGP will have no direct

302
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
involvement in government
decisions or policy-making,

303
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,916
and will now defer
to local authorities.

304
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,416
In a statement from
Secretary Kataoka, he called

305
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,125
the resolution, "a bold
step forward in righting

306
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,791
the wrongs of our past... "

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,333
I'm back.
