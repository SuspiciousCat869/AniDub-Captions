1
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,666
I know you...

2
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,083
So we meet again.

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,833
You might want to jump.

4
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,041
That's a Type-L Fuego...?

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,791
When were you chosen?

6
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,458
Good luck.

7
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,708
You don't look happy...

8
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,791
Do you prefer
the company of the GGP?

9
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:41,625
How should I look?

10
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,791
You're a stranger to me.

11
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,708
Sorry--my name is Kiefer...

12
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,250
I suppose I'm a terrorist.

13
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,750
And who is Rin Ogata?

14
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,833
You're the girl who
danced through the blockade...

15
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,541
The same girl who toppled
the fearsome White Riders

16
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,416
like so many dominos...

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,916
You make it sound so bad...

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,041
Both times I was just trying
to save someone close to me.

19
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,458
No, you weren't.

20
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,708
Sitting atop Fuego, your
intentions dissolve like smoke.

21
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,583
As you bask in
the light of the elect,

22
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,416
you shed the
obligations that bind you.

23
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,791
How would you know
what's going on in my head?

24
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,791
Because I, too, have known
the bliss of that light.

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,375
You're not a prisoner here.

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,541
He'll be coming
for you soon enough...

27
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,041
'Til then,
make yourself at home.

28
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,458
Huh...?

29
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,750
A trivial conflict
in one of those places

30
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,666
you can barely
find on the map...

31
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,416
That's all we thought it was.

32
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,958
Ten years later, we know
it was the end of one world

33
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,958
and the beginning of another.

34
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,666
The GGP started off
as a tiny band of rebels,

35
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
striking out at a common foe:
the world's policeman,

36
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,333
who wanted to trade
in its badge for a crown.

37
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,875
They had awakened a sleeping
giant--one that could

38
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,875
crush it with ease.

39
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,458
But if the Battle of
Arizona proved anything,

40
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:19,083
it's that
fortune favors the brave.

41
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,041
The ICBM base was the symbol

42
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,666
of the western empire's
global dominance.

43
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,916
It housed the most destructive
of their weaponry,.

44
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,333
so it was built
to be invincible.

45
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,791
But a squad of RideBacks,
designed by the brilliant

46
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,833
Killy McCannon,
threw themselves at it

47
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,041
in a daring surprise attack.

48
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,791
Romanov Kallenbach
led the assault.

49
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,583
The GGP left
the base in ruins...

50
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,541
and proceeded to fill the
very void in global politics

51
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,333
they themselves had created.

52
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,791
But victory came at a price...

53
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,291
Half of the GGP
were killed in action,

54
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,916
as was Professor McCannon--

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,416
who'd been imprisoned
within the base.

56
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,750
Later on, several GGP officers
were court-martialed

57
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,208
for human-rights violations
against prisoners of war.

58
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,916
The most important
battle of our time,

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,583
and nobody knows
quite what happened...

60
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,666
Victors write
the history books,.

61
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,875
or leave them blank.

62
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:39,708
Rin Ogata's Rideback Club was
started by Tenshirou Okakura...

63
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,125
And back in day he was
tight with Kallenbach,

64
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,916
our new supreme commander.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,166
RideBacks have helped
to shape each man's destiny...

66
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,500
And Hesner Incorporated
makes the RideBacks...

67
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,000
the White Rider models,
at least...

68
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,041
Dig my little party-favors?.

69
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,541
I think our guests
are gonna have a blast.

70
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,083
The GGP comes stormin' in
and you blow 'em up...?

71
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,541
And if they call in
an airstrike, what then?

72
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,875
They won't.

73
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,916
Kallenbach wants you
too much to let that happen.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,833
He wants is my dead body...

75
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,875
Kiefer's, too--never mind how.

76
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,041
Yeah, that's what
I keep hearing...

77
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,666
You can uncuff him.

78
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,750
The little lady's at a mansion
five kliks northwest of here...

79
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,250
I'd get up there
pretty quick if I were you.

80
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,125
We gotta make sure to give
the GGP a warm welcome.

81
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,500
It's like riding a bike.

82
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,208
You get rusty,
but ya don't forget how.

83
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,000
The target vehicle
remains stationary, sir.

84
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,375
What do you advise?

85
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,958
Establish a five-k perimeter.

86
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,125
No one gets in or out.

87
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,416
Bravo Team,
move to the target's six.

88
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,208
We're at an
abandoned weather station.

89
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,375
An airstrike'll flatten it
easily, Colonel.

90
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,750
Permission to fire?

91
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,291
I want them to feel the heat
before we snuff 'em out.

92
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,791
Permission denied.

93
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,250
Understood.

94
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,250
Sir, we lost the Strike team!

95
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,708
Incoming transmission, sir!

96
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,291
Bravo Team had a visual
on our suspected targets...

97
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,333
but they lost them.

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
Initiate a
door-to-door search--

99
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,250
they didn't
just vanish, dammit...!

100
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,250
All others, regroup
and prepare to mobilize!

101
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,500
Gatobu!

102
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,375
Your RideBack battalion
will lead the charge!

103
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,208
Yes sir!

104
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,208
We gotta stop
meeting like this.

105
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,041
Who'dve thought a war hero would
end up stuck in acadeemia,

106
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,416
poor Goblin...

107
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,833
I was hoping we could have
a nicer chat this time...

108
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,708
Perhaps about Rin Ogata
and Mr. Okakura.

109
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,291
She was just trying
to protect her brother,

110
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,958
but they got her
for assaulting an officer...

111
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,708
Man, if only I hadn't
given her a ride that night...

112
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,833
she wouldn't have gotten mixed
up in all this crazy crap...

113
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,666
I can't help, but feel
like it's all my fault.

114
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,083
'Kay, but...

115
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,458
you still haven't said how
this ties in with Okakura.

116
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,208
Well, it turns out your club
advisor fought alongside

117
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:55,416
the supreme commander
of the GGP during the war.

118
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,791
You kidding me?

119
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,083
I don't know what transpired
between the two of them,

120
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,500
but the honeymoon
is definitely over...

121
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,583
I think Okakura's in danger.

122
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,583
Why are you telling me this?

123
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,000
Because I think we can
clear your friend's name...

124
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,458
I dug up some juicy info, but
without proof it's worthless.

125
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,291
The kind of proof you
can never track down

126
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,208
unless you're really
well-connected...

127
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,041
Like you are.

128
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,208
All right.

129
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,208
But in exchange,
there's a little something

130
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,166
you're gonna do for me.

131
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,875
Behold the Black Knights.

132
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,208
They're standard issue
within the BMA...

133
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,958
Care to try one?

134
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,041
My interest is riding,
not preparing for war.

135
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,958
The day of the blockade,
you told me Fuego was special.

136
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,125
How is she special?!

137
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,166
I need to know
what you're talking about!

138
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,291
You know what I mean,
more than anybody else...

139
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,916
Enough of this charade.

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
"Charade?" No!

141
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,958
Look, I'm telling you the truth
when I say I don't understand-

142
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,625
It is a moment of rare
and sublime beauty

143
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,250
when rider and machine
achieve perfect harmony.

144
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,000
Your heart takes flight.

145
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,458
The chosen few can live and die
a life complete in that moment.

146
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,416
Rin...

147
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,916
There's something I want you
to remember, sweetie.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,125
For people like us, honey,
the stage is our one true home.

149
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,000
It's our entire world...

150
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,166
There we live
our life complete.

151
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
"Life complete?"

152
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,041
"Life... complete... "

153
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,708
You were chosen by Fuego...

154
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,125
Accepted, Rin...

155
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,083
Blessed.

156
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,000
Her creator
chose you, as well.

157
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,791
He chose the both of us...

158
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,958
The man you call Okakura,
I call Goblin.

159
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,833
He's on his way here as we
speak, but until his arrival...

160
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,208
I've many things to show you.

161
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,625
Why is the army mobilizing?!

162
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,875
Well, the GGP's
up to something--

163
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,291
that's for damn sure...!

164
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
We just received
word the highways

165
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,083
have been closed off...!

166
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,208
--What do I tell these guys?
--No! No comment, dammit!

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,625
Mr. Kataoka?

168
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,541
I think you have a visitor.

169
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,791
My sister told me you'd come.

170
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,000
Pardon me, but...

171
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,750
I should be getting
back out into the chaos.

172
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,500
This just in: The GGP
has ordered the closure

173
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,333
of National Highway 20.

174
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,750
Listen to what I've got to say,
I promise it'll be worth it.

175
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,125
"Dual Arrows?"

176
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,791
It's a special
RideBack operating system...

177
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
Once you execute
a particular move,

178
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,750
the machine learns
to anticipate it.

179
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,833
Goblin invented this
OS, and in doing so,

180
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,666
he breathed new life into
Fuego and the Black Knights.

181
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,625
Such a RideBack chooses its own
master, and with good reason.

182
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,458
Only a skilled rider will
possess instincts strong enough

183
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,750
for the machine to predict.

184
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,833
Those who lack faith in
themselves are not worthy.

185
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,458
Their chaos is
a danger to them both.

186
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,375
I guess that makes sense.

187
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,958
I've synced up your EW-Band
with this Black-Knight.

188
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,458
Breathe life and grace
into this cold metal...

189
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,625
Lend it your sublimity...

190
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,000
Experience perfection.

191
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,000
Take the reins,
Rin Ogata...!

192
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,333
All that strength
hidden within you...

193
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,875
Set it ablaze!

194
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,458
Ride with me!

195
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,666
Kiefer, we're mobilizing.

196
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,791
I understand...

197
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,166
On my way.

198
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,291
You stay here.

199
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,208
He'll be along
for you shortly.

200
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,750
This is all the ammo we've
got--shoot 'til you're empty!

201
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,166
There are 15--repeat,
one five--enemy RideBacks,

202
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,375
and those are just the ones
we've seen so far...!

203
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
No worse than what we expected.

204
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,750
You invite me over, then
take off before I get there?

205
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,083
Typical Kiefer.

206
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,916
You took your
sweet time, Goblin...

207
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,416
Your damsel in distress
is getting bored.

208
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,750
Where is she, dammit?

209
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,291
Care for a fight, Goblin?.

210
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,416
I can make the time.

211
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,041
Goblin is a dead man.

212
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:28,958
Quite right...

213
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,291
So am I.

214
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,041
Kallenbach would be, too,
if the world were fair.

215
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,541
She's waiting
in the rear courtyard.

216
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,708
You can take the RideBack.

217
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,583
See ya.

218
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,625
Get in there--let's
finish them off!

219
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,375
Booby-traps!

220
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,083
They've set
landmines everywhere!

221
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,708
A black RideBack
put down all of Unit Two!

222
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,875
Gatobu?

223
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,458
I'm on it!

224
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,250
You gonna fight me or what?

225
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,875
Rin...

226
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,958
No response, sir--the
signal's dead!

227
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,333
That's enough.

228
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,708
Send in the Apaches
and level the place.

229
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,208
Is that wise, Colonel?

230
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,166
Huh?

231
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,083
Beg pardon?

232
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,500
May I remind you,

233
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,916
we're cleaning up the
Intelligence Bureau's mess...

234
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,375
Now be a good girl
and shut your mouth.

235
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
Sir, it's Lieutenant Gatobu.

236
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,875
Patch him through.

237
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,375
What the...?

238
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,208
Romanov Kallenbach...

239
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,875
Kiefer...

240
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,333
Congratulations
on your promotion.

241
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,208
Oh, and thanks--tearing that
pathetic RideBack squad

242
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
of yours to shreds
was a pleasant diversion...

243
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,666
Though I imagine their
widows and children

244
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,875
might have a different opinion.

245
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,416
You want me dead, Romanov.

246
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,916
I can appreciate that.

247
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,125
For what it's worth,
the feeling is mutual.

248
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,833
Do you really think
you can best me...?

249
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,541
You cowering Kallenbach?

250
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
Just know that
I'm coming for you next.

251
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,000
The BMA's fierce--let's
call 'em "buma"!

252
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,250
Yeah...

253
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,833
I think the word
you're looking for is "puma"...

254
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,541
We'll "bear" with the GGP
while they "skunk" 'em out.

255
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,208
Who doesn't love a pun...?

256
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,250
Been lookin' for a chance
to use those haven'tcha?

257
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,416
Yeah.
