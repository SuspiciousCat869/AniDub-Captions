1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,500
Good morning,
thanks for watching TKN News.

2
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,666
Today marks the
sixth anniversary

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,166
of the Great Earthquake...

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,541
Aw... Stupid control rod's
got a crack in it...

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,125
Scrap pile!

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,250
Hey boss...!

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,500
Yeah, no, not yet...

8
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,083
The shop definitely has the
parts Balon needs and all...

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,291
I just...

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,666
I put her together,
so I wanted to at least

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,916
fix anything I could, you know?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,041
Turning now, to the
political front...

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,791
Colonel Romanov Kallenbach will
be sworn in today as the new

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,416
Commander in Chief of the
GGP's Peacekeeping Forces...

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Rin...?

16
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you grab that
off the table?

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:49,833
Oh, yeah...

18
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,375
Silly me...

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm going by the club later,
and I didn't wanna forget it.

20
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,875
Really, on Sunday?

21
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,916
After competing against other
racers, I feel like I'm finally

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,833
beginning to understand
some things...

23
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:05,291
Like handling and how to coax
out a RideBack's full power.

24
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,625
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess you forgot...

25
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,708
Huh?

26
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,875
You're unbelievable.

27
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,541
Can't believe you
forgot about the mall.

28
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,583
Sorry, Shouko!

29
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,708
I did forget!

30
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,708
I even promised that
I'd go with you!

31
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,458
So overdramatic...

32
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,166
I'll text you if I spot
anything you have to have.

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,083
I know the club's
important to you...

34
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,750
Its nice to see you
excited like this again.

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,000
This is great!

36
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,750
Aw, thank you.

37
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,375
Hey, look, RideBacks on TV!

38
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,166
Hesner Enterprises is
holding a conference today,

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,125
unveiling their
new police-issued

40
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,916
"White Rider" vehicles.

41
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,000
No, he didn't "do" anything...

42
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,041
It's just we've got this new
girl who's caught his eye...

43
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,875
But he's pretending like he
couldn't care less about her.

44
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,291
Has he told you about his past?

45
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,791
Not a word...

46
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,041
I've asked him flat out, and
all I get is a blank stare.

47
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,708
Go figure, huh?

48
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,916
Just as well...

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,791
I'll talk to you again soon.

50
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,291
We came all the way out here
on a Sunday for nothing?!

51
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,375
Thought you knew...

52
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,500
We didn't have
anything planned...

53
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,125
Wish you coulda told me
you were heading here.

54
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,250
Well, we're here!

55
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,375
You couldn't send
a text or an email?!

56
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,541
This was all
kinda last minute...

57
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,625
We're taking Balon
and Fuego to the shop.

58
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,583
Is there...

59
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,625
something wrong with Fuego?

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,791
No, figured since we're
bringing in Balon that Feugo

61
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,125
might as well get a tune up...

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,416
Unless you want
Fuego to stay behind?

63
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:02,958
No thanks...

64
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,333
That's okay...

65
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,458
But would you mind giving me
a lift into the city?

66
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,291
I guess I could.

67
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,708
What are you gonna do there?

68
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,083
Oh, Shouko's shopping,
I was gonna meet up with her.

69
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:11,791
Ooh...!

70
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,416
I wanna go shopping too!

71
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,416
What? You are coming?

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,833
You sure it's cool?

73
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,833
Ah...

74
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,041
I gotcha...

75
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,166
Call me when you guys
get close, okay...?

76
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,375
Great!

77
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,291
Seriously?

78
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,500
This is the new thing
in police enforcement...?

79
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,958
Talk about overkill?

80
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,416
Come on, keep it down!

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,125
You got a prototype or
somethin' to show us, right...?

82
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,291
'Cause the glossy press kits are
nice and all, but you know...

83
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,291
Yoda, I'm telling you.

84
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,541
Shut... Up!

85
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,500
I apologize for the delay...

86
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,083
To begin,...

87
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,666
There are a few opening comments
from our Vice President Goudou

88
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,375
of Hesner Enterprises.

89
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,916
Is there a checkpoint?

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,125
I guess so.

91
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
There's some kind of
inauguration ceremony

92
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,708
for some big cheese at the GGP.

93
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,166
reporting live from
GGP Headquarters...

94
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,666
We expect to see Colonel
Kallenbach making his way

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,000
to the ceremony
at any time now...

96
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,125
The route to the inauguration
site is under heavy security--

97
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,375
Aw, how long?

98
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,541
I'd guess at least
another half hour or so...

99
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,666
Sorry!

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,833
That's fine, I'm over
by the TV Tower.

101
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,583
I'll just wait for you in
the lobby café and who knows...

102
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,791
I might even have a donut!

103
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,333
Hey!

104
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,375
Wait for us...!

105
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,458
Suzuri's coming with me!

106
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,708
Alright...

107
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,708
Tea only until you get
your butts over here.

108
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,416
What the--?

109
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello...?

110
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,000
Shouko...?

111
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,333
What was that?

112
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,125
I can't see anything...!

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh, no...

114
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,750
What?

115
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,916
Shouko...!

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,958
Are you there?!

117
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:41,541
Whoa!

118
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,708
What's that?!

119
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,500
The city...

120
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,083
Isn't that where we're
supposed to meet Shouko?!

121
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:55,625
Please people!

122
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,041
Stay calm...!

123
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,291
Our security team will lead you
all outside to safety!

124
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,416
You get that?

125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,625
Hell yeah.

126
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,916
And This isn't...

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,750
part of the
presentation, is it?

128
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,250
Uh, yeah, no.

129
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,583
Go ahead.

130
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,583
We've set up a perimeter
and begun surveillance...

131
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,541
They've used several
smoke grenades inside...

132
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,291
So we still don't have
a clear picture of what's

133
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,708
going on in there...

134
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,416
But a group online has already
claimed responsibility.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,750
Understood...

136
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll try and calm our no-doubt
enraged commander.

137
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,708
Man, what should we do?

138
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,916
What are we supposed to do?

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,291
Traffic's gonna
make any plan impossible.

140
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,375
Shouko...

141
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,416
At two-oh-two this afternoon...

142
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,791
A blast on the Thirty-Seventh
Floor Observation Deck of--

143
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,041
We're still unclear on the
exact number of hostages

144
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,750
being held captive inside...

145
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,958
The armed gunmen...

146
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,708
here on the edge
of the cordoned-off area...

147
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,625
I'm told the yellowish
smoke we're seeing

148
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,250
is in fact from smoke
grenades, being used...

149
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,083
Now for this late
breaking development...

150
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,958
There is a group now claiming
responsibility for the attack...

151
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,250
The BMA have just posted
the following message

152
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,291
on their website...

153
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,500
Let's take a look...

154
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,583
The BMA will not abide
the appointment

155
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,250
of Romanov Kallenbach,
a corrupt, bloodthirsty

156
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,708
blight on our nation...

157
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,833
Exchange for the safe
release of our hostages,

158
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,750
we demand immediate negotiations
with the Colonel...

159
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,916
The BMA will not allow
a government of fools.

160
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,916
A cabinet representative has
made an official plea to the

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,291
Police Department and the
GGP Peacekeeping Forces

162
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,208
to engage in countermeasures
against the terrorists...

163
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,750
Access to the surrounding
area is currently limited

164
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,208
to emergency vehicles
at this time.

165
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,375
No use...

166
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,791
Can't connect...

167
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,666
Those being admitted currently
are the injured found

168
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,791
immediately outside
the blast area...

169
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,125
We're still waiting
for confirmation...

170
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,375
But there are reports
of injured trapped inside...

171
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,333
That does it...

172
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,833
Hey, Rin...

173
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,958
Rin, no!

174
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,541
I'm taking Fuego out!

175
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,666
Wait...!

176
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,208
I understand how you feel...

177
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,541
But hopping on
a Rideback isn't...

178
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,666
Don't go...!

179
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,875
They said there's
terrorists there...!

180
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,000
You're gonna wind up
killing yourself!

181
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,750
There's nothing you can do!

182
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,666
Would think about this...

183
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,000
Rin?

184
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,166
I'll be back when I get
Shouko out of that place!

185
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,041
Rin...!

186
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:26,833
Catch!

187
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,500
And she's gone.

188
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,583
Shouko...

189
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
Please be all right!

190
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,041
The BMA are not
the murderers...!

191
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,875
Do what we say quietly
and you won't be harmed!

192
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,458
The BMA are not
the murderers...!

193
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,666
Do what we say quietly
and you won't be harmed!

194
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,500
I have to call the police!

195
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,708
No...

196
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,958
As you can see behind me,
GGP forces are moving in

197
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,291
to begin their
counter-terrorist operation.

198
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,291
Their first order of business
will be to establish a blockade

199
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,625
in a two-kilometer radius
around the tower.

200
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,208
We are strongly advising
anyone within this area

201
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,041
to evacuate immediately...

202
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,458
Specifically,
we're talking about

203
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,041
the following Districts:...

204
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,041
West Twenty-Four,...

205
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,875
West Twenty-Five,...

206
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,416
West Thirty-Seven,...

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,208
and West Fifty-One.

208
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,125
Pesky little terrorists,
wouldn't you say?

209
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,333
I'm sorry we've had
to postpone your ceremony.

210
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,916
Why would I let a minor hostage
situation bother me...?

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,208
Let this BMA do their worst.

212
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,541
They'll prove my point and
my White Riders will be

213
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,958
on the ground all the sooner.

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
It's like a war zone
down there!

215
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,208
Yeah, great, you got
the shots, can we go now?

216
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,166
Where's your
journalistic integrity?

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,833
It's buried under
my desire to not die!

218
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,625
Oh, come on...

219
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,083
Please pick up!

220
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,833
Shouko...

221
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,166
Hello...?!

222
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,875
Shouko!

223
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,500
Hold on...

224
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,208
Rin...

225
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,833
Please, just hold on.

226
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:46,708
Rin...?

227
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,625
Are you there?

228
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,458
Shouko...!

229
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,666
You okay?!

230
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,750
Where are you...?

231
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,541
I just got to
the train station...

232
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,208
I'm gonna rescue you!

233
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,416
Second floor lobby...

234
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,750
in a corner.

235
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,500
But Rin, you have
to stay away!

236
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,000
There are men with guns here!.

237
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,333
I'm okay, but it's not safe--

238
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,083
Shouko...!

239
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,541
Can you hear me?!

240
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,416
Stop!

241
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,833
Where do you think
you're off to?

242
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,333
Nice RideBack...

243
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,625
This area's closed
to civilians...!

244
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,166
Turn around and leave now!

245
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,166
Please, my friend
is trapped in there...!

246
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,875
I just talked to her
on the pho--

247
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,958
Don't worry!

248
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,916
We'll get her
out of there, okay!

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,875
You just get
yourself to safety!

250
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,666
Shouko!

251
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,708
No!

252
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,375
Get back here!

253
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,458
Echo-One-Five to Base...

254
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,333
A civilian RideBack
has ignored our orders

255
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,041
and is riding into
the building!

256
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,708
Rin!

257
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,333
Shoukoooo!

258
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,416
Rin!

259
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,375
Shouko!

260
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,708
Rin!

261
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,166
Rin!

262
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:31,958
Hey...!

263
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,458
Are you all right?

264
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,416
I can't...

265
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,250
believe you came for me...!

266
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,666
I was so scared, Rin!

267
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,375
Sorry it took me so long...

268
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,750
Now let's get outta here.

269
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,916
Yeah.

270
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:47,750
Okay...

271
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,125
Climb up here.

272
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,500
Don't move!

273
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,458
A commercial RideBack?

274
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,125
Kill the engine and dismount.

275
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
Where you been
hidin' all this time?

276
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,791
Hang on tight, Shouko!

277
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,583
Get with it!

278
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,125
Open Fire!

279
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,708
Echo-Two-Four to Base...!

280
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,500
Possible terrorist vehicle
moving toward the bridge...!

281
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,291
It's a Red RideBack!

282
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,041
Aw, man!

283
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,458
We're missing all
the good stuff, C'mon!

284
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,625
Aren't we like, breaking the
law by not evacuating?

285
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,416
Think of it as
having an exclusive.

286
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,250
We're not goin' all the way
up to the roof, are we?!

287
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,416
Chop-chop!

288
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,958
Why me?

289
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,833
We're receiving word that
GGP Peacekeeping Forces

290
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,250
have entered the building...

291
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,083
Sasaki is live with more.

292
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,750
Good afternoon, I'm
standing here in front

293
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,250
of the southern Great Bridge,
a mere two kilometers

294
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,250
from the TV Tower situation...

295
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,333
All roads in the area have
been closed by GGP forces,

296
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,250
making this the closest we
can get to what's going on...

297
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,541
The city center is blanketed
in smoke...

298
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,708
Please, God...

299
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,958
Keep them safe!

300
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,041
What are we gonna do...?!

301
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,625
Everybody thinks
we're terrorists now!

302
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,583
It's weird...

303
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,708
I feel like I'm
connected to Fuego...

304
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,541
Just like the
first time I rode her...

305
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,458
As if she's an extension
of my own limbs...

306
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:29,750
Yoda...!

307
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,958
Look over there!

308
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,166
Rin...

309
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,500
Behind us!

310
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,541
As the situation continues
to unfold, a helicopter is

311
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,500
in pursuit of what appears to
be a Rideback which emerged

312
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,083
from the barricaded area.

313
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,041
We believe this may be
one of the terrorists

314
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
attempting to flee, but
we're unable to confirm

315
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,708
that at this time.

316
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,625
Rin...

317
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,208
Let's just stop...

318
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,375
I'm sure they'll
understand if we explain...!

319
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,958
Okay, Rin?

320
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,625
You might want to jump.

321
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,208
Shouko, hold on
and do not let go!

322
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,125
There it is again...

323
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,750
That light...

324
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,791
The chopper has
been destroyed...!

325
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,666
Ladies and gentlemen, there's
been some kind of explosion...!

326
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,166
The Rideback barely
escaped the blast...

327
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,958
Holy--...

328
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,125
Rin, no...

329
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,625
What the heck is she doing?

330
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,958
All right...

331
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,291
I think we're safe now...

332
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,083
Shouko?

333
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,083
That's a Type-L Fuego...?

334
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,958
When were you chosen?

335
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,916
Your machine
has unique tuning...

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,083
Their programming allows a
Rideback to choose its rider.

337
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,333
Say what?

338
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,791
Good luck.

339
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,041
Today's terrorist attack on
the TV Tower, which began

340
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,875
just past two this afternoon,

341
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:58,750
was resolved by GGP Peacekeeping
Forces by four-thirty...

342
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,166
All five of the political
radicals were killed

343
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,916
in the ensuing conflict.

344
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,625
The Japanese government has
issued a formal thanks to

345
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,583
the GGP for their swift
response with minimal

346
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,208
loss of civilian life.

347
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,666
Sworn in soon after,
Commander Kallenbach

348
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,208
expressed his condolences to all
victims of terrorist violence,

349
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,541
including those in
Sasebo and Kokura,...

350
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
and renewed his vow
to wipe out terrorism.

351
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,875
Rin...

352
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,750
Please don't go...

353
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,333
Rin...

354
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,625
That light...

355
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,583
We're too young to go to jail!

356
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,791
Hey, relax, dude.

357
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,833
I got an idea,
why don't you relax, dude?!

358
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,541
The GGP think we're terrorists!

359
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,750
Nah, we're fine...

360
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,916
We're minor supporting
characters at best.

361
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,291
Whaaaaat?!
