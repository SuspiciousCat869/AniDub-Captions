1
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,875
It's really tall...!

2
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:18,375
I thought it'd be scarier!

3
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:21,416
Took me all night to put
her back together, so try...

4
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,958
--This is so cool!
--Stop being a spaz up there...!

5
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:26,875
Kay?

6
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,041
Hey, Haruki.

7
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,291
What does it mean
to be "in regulation?"

8
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,416
Oh!

9
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,166
It means a ride's
been cleared for use

10
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,416
in a sanctioned race
or tournament.

11
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,791
Keeps it about skill,

12
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:38,333
instead of who's got the
money for the sickest mods.

13
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,125
That's why I can't use Fuego.

14
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,541
Right...

15
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,666
Fuego may look like your
typical off-the-lot RideBack,

16
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,291
but Okakura tricked the hell out
of its insides, top to bottom.

17
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,833
The frame's legit,
but the guts are way too leet.

18
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,208
Sorry.

19
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,541
What a shame...

20
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,083
Don't sweat it...

21
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,958
Balon's a new model from the
same design team responsible

22
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,875
for Fuego and all the
controls are the same,

23
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,375
so you shouldn't
run into any problems.

24
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,916
Help!

25
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,458
I'm still getting
the hang of it.

26
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,666
Geez, Suzuri!

27
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,666
Don't treat it like
a mechanical bull...!

28
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,416
I'm sorry!

29
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,833
Whenever you two
are done flirting,

30
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,916
maybe somebody
could give me a hand?!

31
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,750
--Okay...
--Okay...

32
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:26,000
Wishing it were race-legal?

33
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,916
What's in here?

34
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,125
Think of it as
a little graduation present.

35
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,458
I pushed you pretty hard
these last two weeks,

36
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,375
but you made it
through boot camp...

37
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,958
I think you're gonna
hold your own out there.

38
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,708
Thanks a lot for training me.

39
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,458
Don't get all mushy on me...

40
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,041
I've a score
to settle with you.

41
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,250
Our top story:...

42
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,625
Colonel Romanov Kallenbach,

43
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,916
the soon to be
commander of the GGP,...

44
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,458
has arrived at the
Yokota Military Base.

45
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,375
Following his inauguration next
week, he will assume the title

46
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,958
of Supreme Commander,
in keeping with the...

47
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:40,916
Look...!

48
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it's the RB-Z!

49
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,458
Dude, no wonder it's Junkoku's
flagship model--that's

50
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,208
a sweet-ass ride...!

51
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,916
How'd she get
her hands on one?

52
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,791
Kataoka's the one to beat,
just like last year...

53
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,708
Move it!

54
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:58,958
Dumbass!

55
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,500
Try accelerating, ya amateur!

56
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,750
The pre-race briefing
is about to start, sir.

57
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,416
Fine.

58
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,083
This is All-Out Hurricane,
the special FM broadcast

59
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:22,083
coming at ya from the big
RideBack tournament in Kanto!

60
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,375
Greetings to all
you riders out there!

61
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,541
Now, before we get into
the afternoon's events,

62
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,958
I just wanna
put out a disclaimer.

63
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:29,791
A disclaimer?

64
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:30,833
Hey, Shouko...!

65
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,833
We're over here!

66
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:33,541
Hey...

67
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:34,833
I hope you're hungry!

68
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,625
Heavenly!

69
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,500
Thanks for hooking us
up like this.

70
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,708
No biggie, it was nothing.

71
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,333
This is like some kind
of festival or something.

72
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:46,041
Everybody's pretty
stoked about it...

73
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:48,250
This kind of thing
only happens once a year...

74
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,166
Most of the teams out here
are just looking to have

75
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,375
a good time, but as
the defending champs,

76
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,083
we gotta make sure
our rep stays in tact.

77
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,250
Where's Rin?

78
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,083
Tamayo and her
are doing a practice run.

79
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:00,208
Hey, speak of the devil.

80
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:08,291
...And we're excited as all hell
to be here with you today!

81
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,583
This might come as actual news
to those of you listening in

82
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:13,291
at home, but let me state the
obvious to anybody who's...

83
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,500
What was all that about...?

84
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:16,375
You weren't even
trying out there.

85
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,708
I couldn't get it to
turn like I wanted...

86
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,250
Its weird, but it kinda
felt like I was being

87
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,333
pulled by the handlebars.

88
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:25,083
I don't know how
to explain it...

89
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,291
Haruki...

90
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:29,083
Balon's LSD settings
need a boost about now.

91
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,541
While you're at it...

92
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,916
Check her absorbers, see if
you can do her any favors

93
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,375
on those sharp left turns.

94
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,416
Wait a sec...!

95
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,291
Prelims are two hours
from now...!

96
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,458
How am I gonna finish that?!

97
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,666
She might as well
go home if you don't.

98
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,041
She felt like the
handlebars pulled her.

99
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,041
Whaddya think...?

100
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,166
Will you win
two years in a row?

101
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,250
I came here to win
this thing, end of story.

102
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,125
What's Dad say?

103
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,916
This is about me, not him.

104
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,875
Hey, you guys, is Tamayo's dad,
like, famous or something?

105
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,625
Come on, he's only
the Minister of Finance

106
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,916
and of Foreign Affairs...

107
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Nanpuu Kataoka's
a real big shot...

108
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,958
He's like an uber-politician.

109
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,500
You never saw him on TV?

110
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:10,541
Oh!

111
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:11,791
You mean the guy
who's all corrupted!

112
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,375
 Quiet!

113
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,916
That's not all--her brother is
some hot-shot with the police.

114
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,958
Kataoka, I assume you
met the new commander

115
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:22,500
at the GGP training summit?

116
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:25,041
The job has its perks,
I suppose.

117
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,958
Rumor has it he led
the RideBack battalion

118
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,583
during the war.

119
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,000
From what I've heard,
he took part in

120
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,166
the Battle of
Arizona--after that fight,

121
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,166
the GGP were unstoppable.

122
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,666
No records to
substantiate it, though...

123
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,291
The Colonel's a mysterious one.

124
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:46,416
"Suspicious" is more like it.

125
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,250
Gentlemen...

126
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,458
If you'll follow me...

127
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:52,166
Shall we pay our respects
to the new Commander?

128
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:54,583
All right!

129
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:55,833
The preliminary race to
determine the starting grid

130
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,208
is underway!

131
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,583
The most difficult leg will
be the stretch through

132
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,916
the mountains.

133
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,958
If you look at the roster...

134
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,791
Nothing's wrong
with its settings...

135
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,250
Is Fuego the only
reason she's good?

136
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,541
There she is!

137
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:09,541
Knock 'em dead, girl!

138
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,666
Go Rin!

139
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,458
Why's she still
going so slow?

140
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:15,125
Maybe she's, you know,
saving it for later on.

141
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,708
Oh, you're the expert?

142
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,333
This is only
her first race ever.

143
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,500
Just her being out there
is pretty amazing.

144
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:24,750
I mean, no disrespect,

145
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,375
but this isn't exactly
an event for noobs.

146
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:30,458
I figured Rin would be fast no
matter what model she was on,

147
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,583
but I guess RideBacks are more
different than I thought...

148
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,125
Nope!

149
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,916
If the settings match up, might
as well be the same machine.

150
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,291
Yeah, but...

151
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,291
If I'm not mistaken,
Fuego does have a few quirks...

152
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,291
Maybe Rin's just having trouble
adjusting to Balon's settings.

153
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:47,041
I doubt it, she's just
a noob--end of story.

154
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:49,208
Nah, I think I might
be onto something here...

155
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,416
Tamayo's never been a
big fan of Fuego--says

156
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,166
the handling is crappy...

157
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,166
But somehow,
Rin doesn't have a problem...

158
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,416
Don't you think that's odd?

159
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,541
Yeah, I guess so.

160
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm doing horribly.

161
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:01,750
What's holding me back...?

162
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,083
I don't get it...

163
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,833
I wish I had Fuego...

164
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:13,041
Damn, Bro--these amateurs
need to quit screwing around!

165
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,000
Hey bitch!

166
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:22,625
You're gonna pay for that!

167
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,250
You mess with my protégé,
you mess with me.

168
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,333
Winner of the prelims, the
RideBack Princess herself,

169
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,208
Tamayo Kataoka!

170
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,250
No surprise...

171
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,750
First in the
prelims--pretty good!

172
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:40,416
That's awesome!

173
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,208
Yay us!

174
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:46,625
What the heck's going on
with Fuego's ACS settings?

175
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,000
This is one funky matrix...

176
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,375
Looks like it's been disabled.

177
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:54,250
Why would Okakura jury-rig
it all weird like that?

178
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,833
Haruki, whatever you're messing
around with, it can wait...

179
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:02,625
Listen up, I need you to set
the fork back the way it was...

180
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:04,708
And I'm losing speed
when I shift into third,

181
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:06,375
so fix that crap, pronto!

182
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,708
You just took first in the
prelims--what exactly

183
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,000
are you worried about?

184
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,125
Earn those pastries, gearhead.

185
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,791
Oh, and Rin's issues
with Balon...

186
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:15,833
I have an idea...

187
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:17,375
it's kinda risky...

188
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:22,041
All or nothing, huh?

189
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,833
Well then,
what are you waiting for?

190
01:09:23,916 --> 01:09:25,000
Gotcha!

191
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,875
Good job, you.

192
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,541
Only 16 people beat you.

193
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,166
Thanks, you guys.

194
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:41,625
Ten minutes 'til
showtime, Haruki...!

195
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,625
Just one more
change I gotta make...

196
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,333
Is Rin gonna be okay...?

197
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:51,541
She's been sitting over
there, all by herself...

198
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:54,750
She's just getting herself
into the zone is all.

199
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,375
That's her focused face...

200
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,750
I know Rin Ogata better than
anyone and she's no quitter...

201
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:02,291
Trust me, she's fine.

202
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,666
Well, it's almost time for

203
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,708
the All-Japan RideBack
Championship Race to begin!

204
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,916
CS Motor Channel will provide
coverage of the event,

205
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,375
with editor-in-chief
of RideBack Magazine,

206
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,750
Mr. Suzuki, as commentator.

207
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,041
Good afternoon!

208
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,875
Thanks for having me
up in the booth with you.

209
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,958
Hey, it's our pleasure...

210
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,791
To make a long story, less...

211
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:21,958
long...

212
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,916
I pulled out Balon's
ride-assist module,

213
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,500
better known by gearheads
as an ACS System.

214
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,083
"Ride-assist?"

215
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,166
Fuego's got one, too.

216
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,666
They're pretty standard.

217
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,250
Ready for the crazy part...?

218
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,916
Fuego's never
actually kicked in...

219
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,708
You should get a smoother ride
without Balon's ride-assist...

220
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:39,833
Sounds simply enough...

221
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:41,250
Don't you think?

222
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,166
Take it easy those
first couple minutes, okay?

223
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,416
Good luck out there!

224
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,458
Thanks.

225
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,625
We're getting closer
to the start of

226
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,458
the All-Japan RideBack
Championship Race.

227
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:54,791
It's anybody's game,
but still you gotta wonder:

228
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,458
Will Kataoka take home the
trophy like she did last year,

229
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:01,416
or will her bitter rivals,
Team Cobra, stand in her way?

230
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,666
Catch me if I faint...!

231
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,208
Rin!

232
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:04,666
Kick some tail!

233
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,708
Seriously...

234
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:08,041
tweaking her
RideBack is dangerous.

235
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,000
I know, man...

236
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,458
This is pretty risky.

237
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:11,583
But, hey...

238
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:12,958
Rin's got the goods
to pull this off.

239
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,916
If anyone can do it,
my money's on her.

240
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,500
We're all just moment away from
the All-Japan Championship Race!

241
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,916
Damn, that chick
was on to us, Bro!

242
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,583
That chick is
smarter than you!

243
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:52,208
Nice, Tamayo's
past curve number one.

244
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,291
Where's Rin?

245
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:55,750
Oh no...

246
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,458
she's way back.

247
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,916
Benjamin Franklin...

248
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,416
Inventor and Founding Father...

249
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,583
And, first US ambassador...

250
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:06,000
He went to France to try
and drum up support

251
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,625
for the American Revolution.

252
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,291
That's a nice start...!

253
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,666
Care to continue, Mr. Ogata?

254
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,833
Huh?! Sure thing!

255
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,000
Ohh...

256
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,666
What page are we on, again?

257
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,416
It's been a long time...

258
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,333
Welcome to Japan, sir.

259
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:32,250
The tournament's defending champ
Kataoka is taking the lead,

260
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,666
followed by Team Cobra--Takeshi
and his younger brother

261
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,708
Hiroshi, who had to settle for
second and third last year.

262
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:39,583
We're looking at
a field of 22 riders.

263
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:41,833
Nobody DQed in the
prelims, so the battle

264
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:44,875
for first place will
undoubtedly be a tough one.

265
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,458
Sweet, the RB-Z
is still in first place.

266
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:48,625
How 'bout Balon?

267
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:49,583
Back in...

268
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,250
second-to-last place.

269
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,083
You think she's
going to be all right?

270
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,000
Show 'em whatcha got--c'mon!

271
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,750
Wait! She moved up!

272
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,416
The mountain trail and field
tracks are clear and ready...

273
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,083
Number 710 is leading
the pack onto the mountain.

274
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,291
Rin just moved up
another spot!

275
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:08,583
She's looking good
out there...!

276
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:10,875
Real good!

277
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,708
It's still messy
on the curves...

278
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:15,333
But at least I'm
calling the shots now...

279
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,541
The white RideBacks are just
beyond the horizon--does

280
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:20,916
that worry you?

281
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,583
My own opinion is irrelevant.

282
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:24,583
All I want...

283
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,333
is enough information...

284
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:29,291
to make a decision
regarding their practicality.

285
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,875
You're very circumspect.

286
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:34,000
My predecessor made the
mistake of letting you

287
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:37,333
run him around in
polite little circles.

288
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,458
So here I am.

289
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,333
My country has accepted
this new world of ours.

290
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:45,041
We don't need
enforcement RideBacks.

291
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:47,416
But that isn't the
situation here--here,

292
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,375
terrorists use RideBacks and
attack their targets unopposed.

293
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,458
Seems they're very effective
weapons in little,

294
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,541
crowded nations.

295
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,708
We have very effective weaponry
at our disposal, too, sir.

296
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:00,333
You prefer a tank
on every corner,

297
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,000
right next to the police box?

298
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,625
How picturesque.

299
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,250
No, that's not what I meant...

300
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:08,125
I just simply don't see how some
glorified motorcycle with arms

301
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,125
is going to single-handedly
bring terrorism

302
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,750
to a grinding halt.

303
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,916
I'm starting to see why the
Japanese are thought of

304
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,916
as a stubborn people...

305
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,625
I had a Japanese guy
in my old unit.

306
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:22,333
He was nothing on two legs.

307
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,958
But on a RideBack,
he was a hero...

308
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:27,416
Tamayo Kataoka is speeding onto
the field track just ahead

309
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,375
of the Cobra Brothers--they're
hissing at her heels!

310
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,833
Say your prayers, Kataoka...!

311
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,458
I'm gonna beat you
no matter what!

312
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:35,041
Persistent, aren't we?

313
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:38,250
It looks like one of the
riders is working their way

314
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:42,125
through the pack, from last
place--it's Number 711,

315
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:44,166
a newcomer to the
All-Japan tournament!

316
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,500
Why are they
driving so reckless?!

317
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,958
Not cool!

318
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:56,875
Wait, something
isn't right here.

319
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:57,833
Awesome!

320
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,291
She's almost
into the top ten!

321
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,000
Attagirl!

322
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,791
That's weird, he should
be officiating the race...

323
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:04,833
Hey, boss man...

324
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:08,333
You removed Balon's ACS system.

325
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,166
So you noticed that,
did ya...?

326
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,500
It's not against the rule
or anything, what's the harm?

327
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,625
Her driving is spooking
the other riders...

328
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,666
Pull her out
of the race right now.

329
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,041
Say what?

330
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,750
Come on, she's up to
eleventh place--I can't just--!

331
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:20,916
Are you trying
to fight me on this?

332
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,250
Uh, no sir!

333
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,541
I'll get the ball rolling
soon as we hang up--...

334
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,125
Oh, crap!

335
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,666
What happened?

336
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:31,500
I may have forgotten to tell her
how to read the sign boards.

337
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,375
Bring her in, you idiot!

338
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:35,333
Hey, is something wrong?

339
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:36,833
Straight from Okakura...

340
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:39,250
He thinks Balon might be
too much of a liability.

341
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,708
What do you mean?

342
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:44,000
He figured out that
I disabled the ACS system.

343
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:44,916
ACS system?

344
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,166
What's that do?

345
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,000
Basically, it keeps the
rider from falling over

346
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,125
when they make a mistake.

347
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,458
A foolproof of sorts
if you will.

348
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,208
Deactivating the ACS
is bit of gamble...

349
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:57,250
One wrong move,
and down ya go.

350
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:00,416
"Down ya go?!" She's gonna
hurt herself out there!

351
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,583
A week ago,
you'd probably be right.

352
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,833
But she's gotten
pretty good on a Rideback...

353
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:07,208
This could just be me,
but I think Rin's reflexes

354
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:10,000
are actually better
than the ACS system's...

355
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:13,000
To put it simply,
she's like a human upgrade.

356
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,125
I know all this sounds crazy,

357
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,916
but look at what
she's doing out there.

358
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,416
The real action seems
to be further back a ways...

359
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,833
It's that rookie
you were mentioning earlier...!

360
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,375
I'm in control...!

361
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,333
She's catching up at speeds
that're out of this world...!

362
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:27,583
Her speed is picking up
with each lap...

363
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,208
About time she made it back
into the competition.

364
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,791
Number 711 is back
from the dead,

365
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:35,541
zipping past
everybody in one shot!

366
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,291
Go, girl!

367
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,875
Be careful...!

368
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,166
"The breaking into this money
of Vernon's was one of

369
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,625
the first great
errata of my life..."

370
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:43,208
Wow!
My jaw's on the floor, here!

371
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:46,625
This rookie is flying past the
opposition at breakneck speeds!

372
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:49,750
The announcer's going
crazy about something...

373
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:52,541
Wish I could watch...!

374
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,875
Finally got your
engine revved, Rin?

375
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:58,791
I'm out, Bro!

376
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,625
It's all you, nooow!

377
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:03,541
Peace out.

378
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,250
I'll win this for both of--

379
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:06,083
That's it!

380
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:08,250
Your ass is mine!

381
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:12,666
Those snake brothers
are a buncha meanies!

382
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,291
I say let's
push for a red-card.

383
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,708
Naaah,...

384
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,291
I'll bet the marshals
were watching as it went down.

385
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,041
We just gotta make sure
Tamayo doesn't murder

386
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,833
those fools after
the race, y'know?

387
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,666
One of the Cobra Brothers
takes the lead here

388
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,291
in the home stretch, but
Kataoka's in hot pursuit!

389
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,041
I caught you.

390
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,833
Waiting for an
invitation, ballerina?

391
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:42,291
Hey, um...

392
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,333
I know you told me
what to read...

393
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,708
Long as I got a sec...

394
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,666
...is not Kataoka,
but some rookie!

395
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:51,125
Meet Number 711,
a new darling for a new day!

396
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,375
The RideBack Princess
is dead--long live

397
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:54,875
the RideBack Princess!

398
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:58,541
Consider yourself doomed,...

399
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,666
Mr. Ogata.

400
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,500
Oh... I do, sir...!

401
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,541
Rin's all the way up to fourth!

402
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,166
The suspense is killing me!

403
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:10,750
Almost there...

404
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,333
Balon's good enough...

405
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:16,208
but she's still no Fuego.

406
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,958
Sooo, are we gonna
show her this sign or what?

407
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,625
Oh, come on,
it's the final lap.

408
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:25,416
Huh?

409
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,083
Wonder who that could be.

410
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,666
She seems to be
running fine, so I--

411
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,875
You hear that sound
Balon's exhaust is making?

412
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:32,666
Huh?

413
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,875
She burned out the engine.

414
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,791
You're paying for the new one.

415
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,666
No!

416
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,666
After Ogata comes from behind
to practically win it all,

417
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,625
--Fortune steps out on her!
--Adios, engine.

418
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,208
Always a damn shame to see
a good engine give out.

419
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,916
She was mounting a comeback
for the record books,

420
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,291
but Ogata won't be seeing
the checkered flag today!

421
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,958
Better luck next time!

422
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:56,583
Looks like Rin demands more

423
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,875
out of a Rideback
than Balon can provide.

424
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,708
This race is gonna come down
to its final turn, people!

425
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:03,958
Sorry, Rin...

426
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,125
Guess we'll have
to settle this next year.

427
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,416
I'm sorry...

428
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:35,458
According to our records,

429
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,750
no Japanese citizen
ever enlisted in

430
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:41,333
the GGP's RideBack
force... Not a one.

431
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:42,208
Right...

432
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,791
Not even a rumor.

433
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,625
But, there's a man
who fits the bill.

434
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,375
The Public Safety Force
has been keeping an eye

435
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,083
on him at the GGP's request.

436
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,125
He was gone during the war.

437
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:58,083
And wouldn't you know it,
he's a RideBack enthusiast.

438
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,375
Cheers!

439
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:09,333
Tamayo, it was soooooo
cool the way you spanked

440
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:10,875
those Cobra Brothers...!

441
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,416
It's like you were
a big ol' mongoose!

442
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,250
When I grow up,
I wanna be like you!

443
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,083
All right...

444
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,250
which of you got her drunk?

445
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:18,958
Nobody did.

446
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:20,375
She isn't old enough.

447
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:22,791
All we gave her was a
little bit of orange juice.

448
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:23,958
Oh man!

449
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,833
How come Balon had to
go an' break down

450
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:29,041
like that right
at the end, huh?!

451
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:31,833
What'd she do get
plastered off the smell...?

452
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:32,541
Hold on,...

453
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:33,875
Where did Rin go?

454
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,416
She's out with Fuego.

455
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,166
Wanted to take her for a ride.

456
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:01,291
So, what's up?

457
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,875
Sorry...

458
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,833
About breaking Balon.

459
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,541
That was the
engineer's fault...

460
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:11,291
not yours.

461
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:13,375
Can I ask you something?

462
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,000
When Fuego malfunctioned
that day,...

463
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,958
Why did you go for the jump
when you could have just

464
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:20,125
slammed on the brakes?

465
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,875
I got scared when I saw
the edge coming up...

466
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,208
But still...

467
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:28,500
Somehow I knew I could
trust Fuego with my life.

468
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:31,083
I'll come back after
I've ridden a little more.

469
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:40,541
Hey Okakura, I just got the
repair bill for Balon.

470
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:43,208
The new engine's gonna be
really little pricey.

471
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:45,833
And I don't I have the cash.

472
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,083
Huh?

473
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,541
Wait, you were asleep? Your face
never changes!
