1
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,000
Do we need to take you
to the hospital?

2
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,500
Why did you risk
your life to save me?

3
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,250
It's my fault
you're involved...

4
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,500
Just be quiet and rest.

5
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,666
You made Fuego.

6
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,208
What about the rest
of the Ridebacks...?

7
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,833
Did you make the BMA's too?

8
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,250
Not them!

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,250
I dunno what kinda crap he's
been filling your head with...

10
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,208
Kiefer uses any excuse
to justify killing.

11
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,916
I'm starting to think
that some of the things

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,333
he's told me might be true.

13
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,375
Rin, listen...

14
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,833
Fuego's one of
my biggest regrets...

15
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,500
The fact I dragged you
into all of this...

16
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,208
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,208
Romanov Kallenbach...

18
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,958
Just know that
I'm coming for you next.

19
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,500
Call a senior staff meeting!

20
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,500
Shouldn't we worry
about retaliation, Colonel?

21
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,708
Looting or even worse, riots?

22
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,583
Are you criticizing
my decision...?

23
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,666
I'm too busy protecting
them from terrorists

24
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,000
to give a damn what they think.

25
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,500
I want checkpoints on all
main roads before morning...

26
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,666
Counter-Terrorism Squad:
go to Alert Level-Four.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,333
Detain everyone
who resists...!

28
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,583
This terrorist threat
will be wiped out...

29
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,333
Within the month!

30
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,958
We interrupt this program
for a special news report...

31
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,583
The GGP has declared
a State of Emergency,

32
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,833
to be effective immediately...

33
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,791
In addition to a curfew
for all civilians, RideBacks

34
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,208
and other unauthorized
vehicles are to be seized

35
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,416
by local and military police...

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,250
Those strongly affected
include RideBack retailers,

37
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,916
who have been
shut down indefinitely,

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and ordered to disclose
their clients to the GGP.

39
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,000
SNN's cameras are just now
making it onto the scene,...

40
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,541
but already we're seeing
increased military presence,

41
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,958
with checkpoints bringing
traffic to a halt...

42
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,666
Also... the Japanese Government
was quick to respond,

43
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,666
claiming they received
no advance warning

44
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,125
of the GGP's actions,
which is in violation

45
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,541
of established protocols...

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,875
Foreign Affairs Minister
Ogino had this to say...

47
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,041
Emergency...

48
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,875
Tensions continue
to rise as public outcry

49
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,666
spills onto city streets,...

50
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,666
Local police are at their
limits trying to keep

51
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,833
the protests contained...

52
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,708
Several arrests
have already been made,

53
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,458
but the situation is
quickly deteriorating...

54
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
Numerous officials are
challenging the legality

55
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,083
of the GGP's
de facto martial law,...

56
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,958
and some fear
it may be the first step

57
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,375
in an outright coup attempt.

58
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,833
The city's going nuts over
this GGP martial law crap...

59
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,250
Where is she?

60
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,625
Upstairs resting.

61
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,250
Now lemme see your arm.

62
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,666
Forget it, I'm fine.

63
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,083
I'm just gonna have to clean
your blood off the floor --

64
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,875
This is bad...

65
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,125
I'm in a forest
engulfed in flames...

66
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,208
The image is so surreal,...

67
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,833
it's like a painted
backdrop on a stage...

68
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,041
Though I feel
the heat on my face...

69
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,750
there's also something
deeper--a spark of life.

70
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,166
And I can't look away
from the flames...

71
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,625
They're so beautiful
to behold...

72
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,666
The light pulsating,
flickering...

73
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
dancing.

74
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,625
Fuego...

75
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,916
My deepest regret.

76
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,500
What are you doing?!

77
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
Can't stay
in one place too long.

78
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,583
You can stay here...

79
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,166
This is a safe-house
used by politicians...

80
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,791
Even the Chief of Police
doesn't know about it...

81
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,250
No one would
ever look for you--

82
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,416
Make sure the two of you

83
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,375
are ready to bail
at a moment's notice.

84
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,750
You asked for my help...

85
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,041
Where do you think you can go?!

86
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,916
Just keep Rin safe, okay?

87
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,541
I'm gonna make sure
she can get out of here.

88
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,958
You can't...

89
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,166
They've got all those damn
checkpoints everywhere...

90
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,833
You'll be lucky if you
make it to the next district.

91
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,833
Tamayo...

92
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,916
Forgive me.

93
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,958
Don't do anything stupid...

94
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,791
Enough, I refuse to just
sit here and do nothing!

95
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,750
Why's Tamayo calling?

96
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,250
Text from Haruki...

97
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,208
"Rin is somewhere
safe for now"...?

98
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,125
"Her and Tamayo
are trying to lay low"...

99
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,250
That makes me feel
so much better...

100
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,041
"I'll text you again if
I find out anything else."

101
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:01,708
Rin,...

102
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,666
you're safe...

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh, thank god!

104
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,833
Got one!

105
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,458
Is this okay...?

106
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,333
Being out in public?

107
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,416
Just securing rations,
then we'll head out.

108
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Took the liberty of contacting
our family attorney.

109
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,291
He's looking into
your brother's case.

110
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,083
Oh wow, thank you...

111
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,958
For everything, really,
you didn't have to do that...

112
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,666
Enough with the sad face.

113
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,125
So last year a bunch of us came
out here on a camping trip...

114
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,500
Everyone was fishin'
n' havin' a blast...!

115
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,500
Douta showed up with hip-waders
and full-on angler gear,

116
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,875
but he never caught a bite!

117
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,583
Hey, look!

118
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,166
Dinner!

119
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,958
I've been
wondering something...

120
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,750
I'm pretty sure you've
never mentioned it to me,

121
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,166
but how did you pickup riding?

122
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,916
Wanted to piss off
my bastard of a father...

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,708
Since he was always out with one
of his "lovely lady friends"

124
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,583
I hardly ever saw him...

125
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,333
Needless to say,
growing up I had some

126
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,458
anger management issues...

127
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,625
Birthdays of course,
he was extra generous;

128
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,958
so one year I asked
for an RB-Z, just 'cause

129
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,208
they were impossible to find...

130
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,125
But he did anyway...

131
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
Isn't that obnoxious?

132
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,833
Not even a little...

133
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,375
Your father must
have a kind heart.

134
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:26,916
Yeah!

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,458
If he had one.

136
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,875
I didn't even want the damn
thing, but he called my bluff,

137
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,500
so I was stuck with it...

138
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,750
Now I can't imagine
ever living without it...

139
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,083
It's like it's
become a part of me.

140
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,583
When you put it that way,
I can totally understand...

141
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,291
But I've had it all wrong.

142
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,750
In the beginning,

143
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,208
I felt like Fuego was
an extension of myself...

144
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,750
It set me free...

145
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,625
The more I rode it,
the more attached I became...

146
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,916
I practically considered
it a friend...

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But then I realized
something...

148
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,625
Fuego was a replacement
for what I'd lost...

149
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,000
A high-tech crutch
for my injured leg...

150
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,625
The feelings I had for
this machine weren't real...

151
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,458
They were part of the fantasy
I created to try and cope.

152
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,625
I can't do this anymore.

153
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,666
I'm through with
Rideback from here on out.

154
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,916
So what are you gonna do...?

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,958
Will you try
going back to the ballet?

156
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,750
Not sure yet.

157
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,916
You don't wanna ride
anymore, fine I get it.

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,875
But don't think you're getting
out of our arrangement.

159
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,791
You still owe me
a race, Ballerina.

160
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,208
If you can beat me,
I'll allow you to quit...

161
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,083
But... since
that'll never happen,

162
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,500
you'll have to stay
and be our slave!

163
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,375
Guess we'll see.

164
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,041
Please keep Kenji safe.

165
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,333
Guess I can't
give her this now.

166
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,083
Yeah, I owe you big time...

167
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,666
Nah, getting over here
was easy...

168
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,208
Smooth sailing so far...

169
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,625
Hope my luck holds up,

170
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,291
and the GGP don't start
to question these credentials.

171
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,208
Just be careful out there.

172
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,166
The situation could change
at the drop of a hat...

173
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,666
And there's only so much
I can do from over here.

174
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,791
Yeah, yeah...

175
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,500
I know what I'm doin' here.

176
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,583
Where are you...?

177
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,333
You know it's a delicate
time for Dad right now,

178
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,333
and your disappearing act
doesn't help matters!

179
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
Sorry, usually when I call you
it's 'cause I need something,

180
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,208
and I didn't want
to stress you out.

181
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,125
So what do you need?

182
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,541
Not a thing, actually...

183
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,750
But Okakura's doing exactly
what you said he would...

184
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,375
Trying to save the day.

185
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,125
He doesn't have much time...

186
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,416
The GGP are going
full-scale tomorrow...

187
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,666
None of you will
be safe anywhere.

188
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,333
I know.

189
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,375
Do one more thing for me...

190
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,875
Give Dad a call...

191
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,625
He's worried about you.

192
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,416
I will, thanks.

193
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,625
You must be Tamayo.

194
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,625
The GGP has finally
crossed a line...!

195
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,916
You're just making things
worse, so go home!

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
As protests escalate...

197
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,166
The GGP has ordered the
temporary seizure of

198
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,208
all RideBack vehicles, in order
to prevent terrorist use...

199
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,583
Owners of--

200
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,000
This sucks...!

201
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,250
Way things are goin',...

202
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
They could bust down
the door any second.

203
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,333
They can't just come
and take them, right?

204
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,833
I wouldn't be surprised
if they locked us out...

205
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,416
They can't...!

206
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,916
It would break Rin's
heart if she sees that

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,416
when she comes back!

208
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,875
They're a corrupt
military dictatorship...

209
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,791
I hear ya,...

210
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,750
but what are we
supposed to do?

211
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,375
I don't know, but there
has to be something!

212
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,291
Shouko, you with me?!

213
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,041
Well, to be honest...

214
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,791
I don't think it would be such
a bad idea if we quit now...

215
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,000
Things keep getting worse,

216
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,208
at this rate
someone could get hurt.

217
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,375
If Rin was here...

218
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,583
I know she would
agree with me.

219
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,375
Well, I'll fight back!

220
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,166
I dunno about
the rest of you,...

221
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,708
but these babies
mean the world to me...

222
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,333
None of us
would've ever met...

223
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,625
If it wasn't for Ridebacks.

224
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,833
The GGP can spout off
on how they're being used

225
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,208
by terrorists and
all that mumbo jumbo...

226
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,375
But I can't sit back and
let them take away my ride.

227
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,750
Glad you're optimistic...

228
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,041
That makes one of us.

229
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,250
I didn't expect
to see you again so soon...

230
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,916
Well, "dead man?"...

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,625
To what do I owe the
pleasure of your company?

232
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,916
I'm here
to make you an offer.

233
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,000
Who is this?

234
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,166
It's me.

235
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,041
Well if it isn't my horrible
ingrate of a daughter...

236
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,666
I'm assuming your brother
put you up to this.

237
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,916
Tamayo...?

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,708
Tamayo, Are you here?!

239
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,125
Tamayo?

240
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,541
Why don't you tell me what
this is really about, sweetie?

241
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,458
I can't...

242
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,250
It'll just make
trouble for you.

243
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:33,791
Um...

244
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,916
So, yeah.

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,666
Is that what
you're worried about...?

246
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,083
If there's one thing I've
learned, it's that children

247
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,875
are supposed to cause trouble
for their parents...

248
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,166
Tell me what you need.

249
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,750
I'll move the Earth
to do what I can for you.

250
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:48,958
Thanks, Dad...

251
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,416
Love you.

252
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,583
What's the RB-Z doing here?

253
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,416
Fuego?

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,166
Why is it here?

255
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,541
Is...

256
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,541
she gone...?

257
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,125
Took her apart,
and threw her away.

258
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,125
So you weren't
disassembled after all...

259
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,875
I'm so glad.

260
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,375
Goodbye, Fuego...

261
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,958
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,625
Okay, open 'er up!

263
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,750
Look at that...

264
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,375
Instant army.

265
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,833
In other news...

266
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,250
Mounting tension,...

267
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,750
a series of nationwide protests
are set to take place,

268
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,000
opposing the GGP's
counter-terrorism methods.

269
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,916
Thousands of local
police officers will be...

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,916
This is just what Kallenbach
needs, more fuel for the fire.

271
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,500
Previous rallies have
remained non-violent,

272
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,750
but the sheer number --

273
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,333
Looks like the demonstration
starts with a march...

274
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,041
from Hiigata all the way down
to the Earthquake Memorial.

275
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,208
As of right now,
there are gonna be

276
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,500
at least ten Ridebackers
participating.

277
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,666
Whoa!

278
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,625
That's a lot more
people than I thought!

279
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,958
Haruki!

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,791
We got company.

281
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,875
Uh, your friend Tamayo
asked me to swing by...

282
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,625
Special delivery for ya.

283
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,625
Oil?

284
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,833
Suh-weet...

285
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,791
This stuff's not easy
to find these days.

286
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,500
Hang on--there's a letter...

287
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,833
Let's see...

288
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,791
"Hey guys, last time I
checked, the club's stock

289
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,708
of mixed-base
was running low...

290
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,208
So here's a small present...

291
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,333
to show you all I miss you.

292
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,583
"But I'm not the only one.

293
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,333
There's also a little
something to show you

294
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,416
our other AWOL member is okay.

295
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, 'bout that part...

296
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,000
She also sent this for ya.

297
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,291
C'mon, hurry,
load it already!

298
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,250
Rin!

299
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,666
Thank god, it looks
like she's okay!

300
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,583
Yeah...

301
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,458
Shouko, don't...

302
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,708
Cryyyy!

303
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,375
Yo, long time no see...!

304
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,333
I guess I never did explain
the whole machine gun thing

305
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,083
from before...

306
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:43,958
Old news.

307
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,458
Well, it's still relevant...!

308
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,791
It was a metaphor about
our upside-down world...

309
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,333
And how we, as a club, survive.

310
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,583
Got another metaphor explaining
hybrids and full electrics.
