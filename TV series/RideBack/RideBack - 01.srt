1
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,208
Next movement.

2
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,166
That girl...

3
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,250
She's Yuki Ogata's daughter.

4
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,416
Ah, that's her.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,791
She's going to win awards.

6
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,458
And this is her first lead?

7
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,791
Rin!

8
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,541
The world changes...

9
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,875
just like scenes on a stage.

10
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,750
In the year 2025, the entire
world came under the rule

11
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,000
of a resistance group
called the GGP or,

12
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,166
the Global Government Plan.

13
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,625
They opposed the
existing superstate,

14
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,625
an ant fighting an elephant...

15
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,875
The GGP deployed fantastic
new weaponry,

16
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,916
and defying all odds, claimed
a truly historic victory.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,625
But these soldiers,
the heroes of this war,

18
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,458
were never seen by the public...

19
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,291
The value of their deeds
was downplayed in the media...

20
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,375
And before long,...

21
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,375
it was as if
they never existed.

22
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,166
In those first days,...

23
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,625
the air of change
was palpable...

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,208
The increasing
military presence,...

25
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,458
The public retaliations...

26
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,750
and their escalation...

27
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,791
When the gray sky
was the only constant.

28
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,291
Revolution...

29
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,833
A new world order...

30
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,625
But through all of it,...

31
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,125
for all of these changes...

32
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,375
It wasn't my world.

33
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,708
I was simply living the way
my mother taught me...

34
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:36,291
Doing my best to enjoy the life
of peace granted by ballet.

35
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,958
This is my world...

36
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,208
This light,...

37
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,875
this feeling...

38
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,666
The only time I'm even aware
of my own existence...

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
is when I'm up on this stage.

40
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,458
Then the curtain
suddenly fell...

41
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,375
And the world...

42
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
changed.

43
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,000
One, two,...

44
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,791
three!

45
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,833
Check it out...!

46
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,250
It's like a
cherry blossom blizzard!

47
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,958
Wow, aren't you excited?

48
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,666
Well, why shouldn't I be?!

49
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,666
It's the first day
of our brand new life!

50
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,041
And we're roommates,
it's like a dream!

51
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,416
You can't tell me you're
not a little excited.

52
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,791
I guess I am...

53
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,583
Eight-minute walk
to the train...

54
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,375
Convenience store
down the street...

55
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,000
Our own bathroom...!

56
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,958
And the room is like,
sixteen square meters!

57
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,458
That might sound big,

58
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,916
but there's gonna be two beds
and two desks in there...

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,166
Oh, yeah...

60
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,708
that's kinda small then...

61
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
And we don't have AC!

62
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,500
The summer's gonna suck!

63
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,666
It's all good.

64
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,666
Plenty of people have
done it before us.

65
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,333
We're gonna be okay here.

66
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,541
But hot.

67
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,291
Beautiful!

68
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,250
Order has been restored
to this great nation

69
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,541
due to the efforts
of your parents...

70
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,166
And as well by the aid in
reconstruction provided

71
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,250
by the GGP.

72
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,583
When you young men and women
complete your studies here...

73
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
And take your first
real steps into the world...

74
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,458
I hope you will
continue the example set

75
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,125
by those who came before you...

76
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,083
Uh-huh...

77
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,583
Yeah, the cherry blossoms
are in full bloom here.

78
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,250
Ah, around here,
they've mostly fallen.

79
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,625
So, how's everything else
going with you...?

80
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,375
How's Kenji?

81
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,208
Oh, I think you saw him
the last time I did...

82
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,125
He still hasn't come home yet?

83
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,916
Well, he is a teenager...

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,166
I suppose it's not terribly
"cool" to hang around

85
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,958
with an old lady and her dog...

86
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,666
This house...

87
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,166
it's just too big
for only two people...

88
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,958
I'm out and about
during the day,...

89
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,791
But come dinnertime
it's just Peron and me...

90
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,458
It gets lonely...

91
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,333
With Kenji about to graduate
from high school...

92
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll have to start considering
what to do next...

93
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,791
But Enough about me...

94
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,500
How are you doing?

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,541
Do you have any regrets...?

96
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,791
It would be all right
if you did.

97
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,041
No...

98
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,625
What's done is done.

99
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,500
Grandma...?

100
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,833
I'm sorry, dear...

101
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,041
I shouldn't've even
brought it up.

102
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,166
It's good to
hear your voice, though.

103
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,625
I imagine you'll be quite busy,

104
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,750
but don't forget to call home
every now and then.

105
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,000
I won't...!

106
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,083
Well, I better go.

107
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,833
Love you!

108
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,666
And I you.

109
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,958
Rin...!

110
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,458
Shower's all yours now!

111
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,041
Oh...!

112
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,750
Thanks...

113
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,333
Are you alright?

114
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,666
Yeah, I'm fine...

115
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,625
Kinda beat from all the
first day chaos, you know?

116
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,375
Well, go ahead and
hop in the shower.

117
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,916
That oughtta help a bit.

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,208
'Kay...

119
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,666
By the way, Shouko...

120
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,166
Since the two of us
are roommates now,

121
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,375
you have to promise
to look after me.

122
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,750
Fine, I promise, but of course,

123
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,041
that means you're gonna
hafta take care of me, too.

124
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,083
Why are you
so serious today, you goof?

125
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,500
The carrier is here to take
part in an event celebrating

126
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,750
the anniversary of
the UN ratification

127
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,125
of GGP's worldwide
sovereignty...

128
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,125
Protesters...

129
00:08:59,208 --> 00:08:59,916
You're...

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,583
Rin Ogata, aren't you?

131
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,625
Oh, my god!

132
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,250
You are her...!

133
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,833
Freshman, in the Fine Arts
Department, I'm Suzuri Uchida!

134
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,583
I um,...

135
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,416
I was sure it was you!

136
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,791
The fact that I'm
talking to you in person,

137
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,708
it's like I'm dreaming!

138
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,583
My mom is such a big fan...!

139
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,041
I've been to every one of
your performances with her!

140
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,583
She is gonna totally freak!

141
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,916
D'you remember...?

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,916
Two years ago?

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,666
At the Third
National Theatre...?

144
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,500
My heart was pounding...

145
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,958
Your grand jeté is still
burned into the backs

146
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,416
of my eye-lids...!

147
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,958
What powerful leaps!

148
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,583
I get chills just
thinking about it!

149
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,208
And now, seeing you up close,

150
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,208
you really look
just like your mother...!

151
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,958
Prima ballerina,
Yuki Ogata's spitting image!

152
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,625
Talent like hers...

153
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,833
only comes around every hundred
yea-- no, hundred millennia!

154
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,166
But then...

155
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,333
the earthquake six years ago...

156
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,708
When I saw the news...

157
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,291
I couldn't stop
crying for days!

158
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,208
For crying out loud,
would you shut your mouth...

159
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,208
Hey, Shouko!

160
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,000
What's up...?

161
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,791
You on lunch...?

162
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,500
How are things?

163
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,625
Are you taking French for your
foreign language credit...?

164
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,791
I don't know...

165
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,000
Rin! Hey!

166
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,333
I'm Kamiyama...?

167
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,583
We met last year,

168
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,041
but I only made it
to the second audition...

169
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,791
I totally had a feeling
you might end up

170
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,666
in the Drama Department here...

171
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,416
Is it true you quit ballet?

172
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,250
I, um...

173
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,916
Rin...

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,875
Are you through?

175
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:33,583
You should...

176
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,000
Probably get going...

177
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,041
You still have all those
forms from orientation...

178
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,083
Right?

179
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:39,500
 Uh...

180
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,166
Sorry...

181
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:40,833
I have to...

182
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,333
Um...

183
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,125
Go now!

184
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,875
Call ya in a bit!

185
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,500
Hey...! Megumi...

186
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,291
Get over here!

187
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,458
Be right there...!

188
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
Cool, see you later, then.

189
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,000
Uh, yeah, cool...!

190
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,041
Sorry to pry...

191
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,458
But what you guys
were just saying...?

192
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,041
Rin didn't really...

193
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,000
quit ballet, right?!

194
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:04,958
Because...

195
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:05,916
that would...

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,375
just be...!

197
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,291
She tore a ligament?

198
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,916
Had to give up the role
of Regina after the premiere...

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,375
She hasn't announced
it publicly,...

200
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,416
but yeah, she's moving on.

201
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,625
She can't do that!

202
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,125
Lots of people
come back after injuries...

203
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,500
I know that...

204
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,041
And Rin does too.

205
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,583
She just isn't confident in
the way she dances anymore...

206
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,333
Continuing isn't
an option for her.

207
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,875
All she ever
wanted was to follow

208
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,166
in her mother's footsteps...

209
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,000
So what's the point?

210
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,458
I'm with you though...

211
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,166
Believe me, no one was
a bigger fan of Rin than I was.

212
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,916
Hello?

213
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,291
Where is...

214
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,458
Some storm, huh?

215
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,083
That last one hit pretty close!

216
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,250
Sorry, the door open
and the rain had...

217
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,250
Oh, wait.

218
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,333
Are you here
to join up with us?

219
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,625
Awesome...!

220
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,166
Let me welcome you
to the RideBack Club!

221
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,750
I suppose it was only a matter
of time before this happened...

222
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,625
Still, it's kinda hard
to believe a stylish girl

223
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,250
like yourself wants to join.

224
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,125
Uh...

225
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,000
You've got the wrong--

226
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, then!

227
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,208
Would you like
to give it a try?

228
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:11,958
Huh?

229
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,208
Just got this one back.

230
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,416
It was out for a few mods
I can't do myself.

231
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,958
I think there's been
some kind of mistake,

232
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,708
I was just escaping the rain...

233
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,083
And besides, I don't
even have a license yet.

234
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,375
Well, if that's all you're
worried about, you're in luck.

235
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,083
You don't need
a license to ride one...

236
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,583
Nobody does.

237
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,791
And besides, all the really
super complicated junk

238
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,125
is handled by the
onboard computer.

239
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,208
Its easy enough that pretty much
anybody with a brain can do it.

240
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,583
Only thing is, it's not approved
for use on the highway yet.

241
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,083
Interesting...

242
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,041
So?

243
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,625
It's called a RideBack...

244
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,500
You haven't seen 'em on TV?

245
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,541
No...

246
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,958
Wow...

247
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,750
Guess we're still kinda
"underground" in some ways...

248
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,875
Well, it's a
two-legged two-wheeled

249
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,208
recreational vehicle...

250
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,625
Unlike traditional
two-wheelers,

251
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,833
it can maneuver in
all three dimensions...

252
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,208
Basically a
humanoid motorcycle.

253
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,000
They're finally getting
a bit of attention

254
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,250
with the general public, since
they started holding events

255
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,625
like the national
racing competition.

256
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,000
I see...

257
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,166
This model comes from
the Tersian Kaduro Company,

258
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,500
its off their
Mountain Trail line.

259
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,583
Please meet the Fuego Type-L...

260
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,916
Its fire.

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,416
That's what "Fuego" means
in the Spanish language.

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,625
Fuego...

263
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,708
Like the name implies,
she's got some kick.

264
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,500
But driving her's
a piece of cake.

265
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,625
I dunno...

266
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,833
Give it a try.

267
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,916
I'll give you a crash
course on the basics

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,041
while you wait
on the storm to pass.

269
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,041
Okay...

270
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,416
Since I'm stuck.

271
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,916
Yeah, that's the spirit...

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,250
Now in order to get
on this thing,

273
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,083
you'll want to
climb up from behind.

274
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,041
Am I positioned okay?

275
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:51,958
Heh...

276
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
Plus one, agility...

277
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,541
You can scoot
forward just a bit.

278
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,458
Now grab the handlebars...

279
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,375
Gently tap the touchscreen
display right there

280
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,708
in the middle.

281
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,333
Oh... um,...

282
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,583
you mean...

283
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,750
this?

284
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,291
'Kay, don't let go.

285
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,958
How's it feelin'?

286
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,083
It's kinda tall, isn't it?

287
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,666
It feels like riding
on someone's back

288
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,833
when you drive it.

289
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,541
Where do you think
the names comes from?

290
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,625
Pretty cool, isn't it?

291
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,875
C'mere, Fuego.

292
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:33,916
It can talk...?

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,458
this...

294
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,458
BackRide?

295
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,708
RideBack...

296
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,208
And no, it doesn't talk,
but it does recognize

297
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,541
a handful of simple
verbal commands.

298
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,333
Hey, it finally let up.

299
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
Well, I guess I should
get out of your hair...

300
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,750
Why don't we
take it outside...?

301
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,500
You won't be able to get
the full experience

302
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,416
trapped in there.

303
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,291
Go ahead and switch it to
battery mode to engine mode.

304
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,541
Hello...?

305
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,291
You still awake up there?

306
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
Uh-huh...

307
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,833
Okay, with your right hand,
turn the key clockwise...

308
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,625
Then press the "Start"
button under the red switch.

309
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,666
Twist the right-hand
grip toward you...

310
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,208
Now push lightly
on the right pedal.

311
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,458
Eyes forward...

312
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,708
Okay...

313
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,208
I'm gonna release the lock.

314
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,333
Slowly start to ease
your grip on the left lever...

315
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,750
While you also let up
with the right foot...

316
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,083
Then gently twist
the right grip...

317
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,500
Yeah, that's it!

318
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,041
Nice view, isn't it...?

319
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,083
Alright...

320
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,083
Go ahead and squeeze
that left lever.

321
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,166
Um...

322
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,833
It doesn't seem
to be doing anything!

323
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:52,875
What...?

324
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,791
Try squeezing
the right one, then!

325
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,875
It's stuck...!

326
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,208
I can't make it stop!

327
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,666
In front of you!

328
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,958
Quick! Lean right...!

329
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,416
Left!

330
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,708
Whoa, what a power slide...!

331
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,291
Uh... wait a sec...

332
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,625
Wh- whoa...!

333
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,083
Come on, ease up girl!

334
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,208
She listened...

335
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,583
Whoa, dude, what is that?

336
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,041
A girl with guts...

337
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:20,791
Hey, cutie!

338
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,375
Nice panties!

339
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,250
This is crazy, its like
its responding to how

340
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,708
I shift my weight
around or something...

341
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,875
Huh?

342
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,000
So weird...

343
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,458
I'm not scared!

344
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,791
 This is easy...

345
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,208
Why is that?

346
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,375
Wow, she can...

347
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,833
dance!

348
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,791
Look how close
the blossoms are!

349
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,750
Okay, I think we might be
ready for a pirouette.

350
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:23,958
What...

351
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,333
what just happened?!

352
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,958
He's still tinkering
with his precious ride...

353
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,458
If he breaks someth--

354
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,708
Look ouuut!

355
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,500
I'll call you back.

356
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,000
Tamayo, I'm freakin'!

357
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,291
Fuego's gone berserk
and I don't !

358
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:46,833
Ya think?!

359
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,000
It just went by.

360
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,333
Can't be software,

361
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,250
gotta be the circuit board
or it could be the...

362
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,041
Shut up and move over...

363
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,666
Hold on.

364
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,833
Aren't you revvin'
that a little hard?!

365
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,208
You're insa-a-ane!

366
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,833
But it's not so much
aerodynamics as--

367
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,458
What now...?

368
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,708
What d'you think you're doing?

369
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,208
Stop the engine and get off!

370
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,000
I would if I could!

371
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,125
Is there some kind of
emergency button or brake...?

372
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,666
I don't know what to do,
she quit listening.

373
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,666
Heads up!

374
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,083
Sorry!

375
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,166
Wait, that road--!

376
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,333
Face front and just hang on!

377
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,833
One more!

378
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
The road's out!

379
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,833
Did it work?

380
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,375
The brakes!

381
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,000
Which one is the--

382
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:35,708
Oh, wow...

383
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,375
Insane!

384
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,708
She's crazy.

385
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,875
That's so awesome...

386
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,250
And the world...

387
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,750
changed.

388
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,791
That crazy girl...!

389
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,833
She'll definitely liven
things up around the garage!

390
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,458
Because clearly I'm nothing but
a rough and rusted old woman

391
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,666
of steel, so you just trade me
in for the shiny new model.

392
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,375
Um,...

393
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,208
hey, what'cha got there?

394
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,708
Come out back, I'll show ya.

395
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,791
Oh no!
