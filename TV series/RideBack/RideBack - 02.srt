1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,791
The rush of excitement...

2
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,958
The view as I soared above...

3
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,500
I felt the faint flame
smoldering in my heart

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:24,000
dance to life with
this crimson machine.

5
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,750
Authorities are set to
pursue the militant group BMA...

6
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,916
After another
bombing on the GGP...

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,416
Officials will employ
the Damage Prevention Act...

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,708
What these terrorists
don't realize is that they're

9
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,583
playing right into
the hands of the GGP.

10
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,791
But the group
is wanted nationwide...

11
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,750
Any act of vandalism
will be considered-

12
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,791
It's only a matter
of time before they have

13
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,791
full government support.

14
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:18,916
Yeah...

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,708
they've got the
cabinet's ear...

16
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,958
With all these attacks...

17
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,666
legislature will give them
the green light...

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,958
and then they'll roll out
the White RideBacks.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,875
You don't sound
too thrilled about it...

20
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,416
Your sister on the other
hand is practically glued

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
to the seat of that RideBack,
regardless how much

22
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,333
we may disapprove...
To call that girl stubborn...

23
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,416
would be an understatement.

24
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,250
Excuse me, gentlemen.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,250
Son...

26
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,208
Know that I'm counting on you
to look after your sister.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,708
My heart just about
leapt out of my mouth!

28
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,541
You've gotta be
some kind of prodigy...

29
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,208
You're instantly amazing
at anything you try.

30
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,666
And it's like your sense
of balance isn't even affected

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,583
by the laws of gravity.

32
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,750
Your body's gotta operate
on its own molecular level.

33
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,791
I mean you...

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,208
wow...

35
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,833
You soared through the heavens
like you were riding on

36
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,000
the back of Pegasus!

37
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,166
It made my heart flutter
like a butterfly.

38
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,000
Did she really jump that high?

39
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,291
You betcha!

40
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,166
She jumped so high
I felt like I was witnessing

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,333
some kind of miracle.

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,750
It wasn't that high...

43
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,083
And it was mostly luck because
I had no idea what to do

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,166
on that thing.

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
Oh, would you
stop being modest...

46
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,750
I bet you're the only
person who's ever made

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,208
a jump like that before.

48
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,666
It makes me want to try it!

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,833
Hey, go easy on the mayo!

50
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,958
So...

51
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,875
What's the story on the white
knight who came to your rescue?

52
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,875
Well, it turns out
he's the club's advisor.

53
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,708
You know there's
something about that guy,

54
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,166
he seems like he's
from a different planet...

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,000
He looks like he could strangle
a grizzly bear with his hands.

56
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,041
So he's the manly type then.

57
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:50,750
Rin...?

58
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,958
Why are you doing that?

59
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,916
You were great yesterday.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,583
Yeah...

61
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,208
She's pretty cute...

62
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,875
This is the girl that everyone
on campus has been raving about.

63
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,416
Are you talking to me?

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,333
No, it's the girl next to her.

65
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,166
Your name is Rin,
if I'm not mistaken?

66
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,541
Sorry things got
so intense yesterday.

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,875
My name's Haruki,
I'm an engineering sophomore.

68
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,125
Pleased to meet you...

69
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,333
And this is Douta,
he's a junior.

70
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,291
Hello there...

71
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,791
Not to be too presumptuous...

72
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,125
But I wanted to give you
our club's application form.

73
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,500
You should come by
the shop again,

74
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,500
even if it's just to
hang out or something.

75
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,750
Anytime you want is cool.

76
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,708
There's always someone there.

77
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,083
How about you stop trying

78
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,458
to gloss over the real
issue at hand here?

79
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,083
Uh, what issue?

80
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,958
You endangered my friend's
life by putting her

81
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,583
on that thing and you want
her to sign up for your club?!

82
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,375
I uh...

83
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,541
I didn't think about it...

84
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,875
It's a good thing
Rin is so talented.

85
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,958
Anyone else could've died.

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
I'm really sorry, okay?

87
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,041
See ya...

88
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,583
Bye!

89
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,166
Buh-bye...

90
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
Later...

91
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,750
She seems kind of
infatuated with you.

92
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,333
What?

93
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,083
In other news...

94
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
The GGP has been attacked...

95
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
The terrorist group known
as the BMA is responsible...

96
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,083
As evidenced by
the on-site footage,

97
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,375
the terrorists were using
weapons known as RideBacks.

98
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,583
What is it?

99
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,666
You thinking about her?

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,875
The rookie daredevil
from yesterday?

101
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,583
Why would I be?

102
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,375
A normal beginner could
never make a jump like that...

103
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,458
Especially on Fuego...

104
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,000
There's no way you're not
the least bit curious.

105
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,000
That's everything
I could find...

106
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,791
Rin Ogata...

107
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,083
She's the daughter
of the late Yuki Ogata,

108
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
a world-famous dancer...

109
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,000
Rin started training as
a dancer at the age of three

110
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,666
and she's regarded as a natural
prodigy in the ballet world.

111
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,416
But I doubt you'd have
any interest in Yuki Ogata...

112
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,083
There's no reason she
should mean anything to you.

113
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,166
Where's the other one...?

114
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,916
The Fuego?

115
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,333
R, B, dash Z.

116
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,250
She's a beauty, isn't she...?

117
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,500
Fuego's being repaired.

118
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,500
I had a feeling you'd be back.

119
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,833
Excuse me?

120
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,708
You've got the craving
to ride again, don't you?

121
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,291
No, no, I was just walking by.

122
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,541
You a coward?

123
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,666
A coward?

124
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,375
You can ride again
if you really want to.

125
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,375
But if that is what you want,

126
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,916
then you're gonna
have to race me to do it.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,666
I'll even give you a handicap.

128
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,125
On the off chance that you
win, you'll be able to use

129
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,375
the Rideback whenever
and however you see fit.

130
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,250
But if you lose, well then...

131
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,958
you'll have to
act as my servant.

132
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,375
R B Z...

133
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,000
Lower.

134
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,291
So whadda ya say...?

135
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,458
Do we have a deal,
Miss Ballerina?

136
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,625
I'll do what I can to get
Fuego up and running.

137
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,625
Let's set the place
and time for right here,

138
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,791
next Saturday at
10 in the morning.

139
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,083
And I'll count it as a loss
if you don't show up.

140
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,458
Wait a sec, I didn't
even agree to this.

141
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,208
Her...

142
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,416
Her servant?

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,416
What does she think she is?

144
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,708
A British noble?

145
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
She said she would
give me a handicap.

146
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,541
I'd be a little concerned...

147
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,958
You are aware that she's the
captain of the RideBack Club,

148
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,416
right...?

149
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,833
Tamayo Kataoka,
junior year French major

150
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,125
with a minor in lit,
currently single.

151
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,458
It's a little odd
that you collect

152
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,291
all this random information...

153
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,875
So...

154
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,625
I wonder why this club leader
chick is challenging a beginner

155
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,875
like you to a race.

156
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,416
Me too.

157
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,708
She must've seen that
amazing jump you made!

158
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,500
If anyone could make her
jealous, it's you...!

159
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,875
I'll show up to cheer you
on but I know for a fact

160
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,166
you're gonna beat her!

161
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,291
Well...

162
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,458
I'm not even sure
I'm gonna do it yet.

163
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,041
Ohhh, is that so?

164
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,458
Uh, yeah.

165
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,583
Sure.

166
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,083
Don't doubt yourself, Rin...!

167
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,791
There's no way
you could possibly lose!

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,000
I...

169
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,208
know...

170
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,833
How many times have I
gotta tell you that?

171
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,541
I'll believe that
when you stop skipping class.

172
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,583
I'm in tutoring right now.

173
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,625
Sure you are.

174
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,916
Sounds like tutoring.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
Really not the
time for a lecture.

176
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,750
Wait, hold on, Kenji...

177
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,791
You know a lot about
RideBacks, don't you?

178
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,500
About RideBacks, hell yeah!

179
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,750
I practically know
everything there is to know...

180
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
Why the sudden interest?

181
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,083
Don't tell me you're thinking
about picking up riding?

182
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,458
What, no.

183
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,666
Actually, one of my friends
was wondering about it,

184
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,625
so I thought I'd ask.

185
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,416
Uh huh...

186
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,833
Wait a minute...

187
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,000
I think you go to the
same school as Tamayo Kataoka.

188
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,250
She was last year's
RideBack champion.

189
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey, do me a favor...

190
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,833
Can you try to get her
autograph for me...?

191
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,291
I'll tell you anything
you want if you do.

192
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,458
Okay...

193
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,625
let's see...

194
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,333
Spread Legs Form...

195
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,083
To shift into the high speed
form from the default mode,

196
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,166
apply light pressure
to the left hand lever...

197
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,458
while stepping down
on the right pedal.

198
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,750
Release pressure in order
to lock the form in place.

199
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,458
Hey, girly.

200
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,000
Were you able to get
to the Laundromat in time?

201
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,125
What are you up to?

202
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,541
I'm not up to anything.

203
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,041
About Saturday-

204
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,291
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna
do that silly little race...

205
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,166
My focus should be on organizing
my schedule and studying,

206
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,625
you know what I mean...?

207
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,208
And we've got better stuff
to do on the weekend anyway.

208
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,083
Nice try, but you can't
hide how fired up you are.

209
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,541
My heart...

210
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,666
never felt like that.

211
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,375
I wonder if she's
actually gonna show up.

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,916
Of course she will...!

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,666
She'll be here any minute!

214
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
Hey, you're Suzuri
if I'm not mistaken...

215
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,291
It looks like you've
come prepared today.

216
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm pumped for Rin to win.

217
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,333
I'm cheerleading for her!

218
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,625
Well it's fun
to actually ride them too...

219
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,333
You should try it.

220
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,916
You can ride one
after the race if you want.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,625
Haruki...

222
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,250
What's the status?

223
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,041
We're still waiting on Rin.

224
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,666
She's probably not gonna show.

225
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,541
Analyze.

226
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,666
And, checkpoint number five
is reading clearly.

227
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,625
I'm heading over to set up six
and seven right now, 'kay?

228
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,083
Roger that.

229
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,750
Hey, Rin...!

230
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,500
There you are...!

231
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,750
We've been waiting!

232
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,291
Haruki...

233
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,333
Give her one of
my extra riding suits.

234
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,833
Sure thing, captain.

235
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,666
We ran a thorough diagnostic...

236
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,833
But just in case something
goes wrong on you...

237
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,125
All you've gotta do is press the
stop button on your wristband.

238
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,250
All right.

239
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,125
The rules are simple enough.

240
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,875
Just stick to the main
thoroughfare running

241
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
through the university...

242
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,916
Circle the water tower on the
third block and then head back.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,958
You've got a one-lap handicap...

244
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,875
If you finish three laps
before I can complete four,

245
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
then I officially lose.

246
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,625
We'll run two preliminary
laps so you're familiar

247
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,750
with the course.

248
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,583
And that's it...

249
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,791
Any objections?

250
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,166
No.

251
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,750
Show me watch you got.

252
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,333
Get to know the track for now.

253
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,166
Remember, you've
got two free laps.

254
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,166
I'm rooting for you, Rin!

255
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,750
You can do it!

256
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,000
Thanks.

257
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,416
Go, Rin, for the win!

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,666
It's kind of reckless for
Tamayo to challenge a beginner

259
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,208
like Rin to a race...

260
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,750
But for Rin to
actually accept it...?

261
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,125
Well it's gutsy
to say to the least.

262
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,083
They're really burning rubber.

263
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,375
What's the deal, Captain?

264
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,375
I thought you said
you were gonna take it slow.

265
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,541
That was the plan...

266
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,583
But I'm adjusting
my pace to hers.

267
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,500
Whoa, I can't believe
they're already here.

268
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,125
Am I seeing this?

269
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,375
She's actually keeping
pace with Tamayo!

270
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,000
--Girl's got some crazy skills!
--Go...! Go...! Go, Rin, go...!

271
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,666
Are you sure this is only
her second time riding?

272
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,208
Don't let the pressure
of defeat get you down...

273
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,458
The outcome for this
is already decided...

274
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,666
But you still showed up.

275
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,416
There are some people
in this world...

276
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,333
They simply can't say no
to challenge no matter

277
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,625
how obvious it is
they're gonna lose.

278
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,875
I'm one of them...

279
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,333
You are too.

280
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,458
Wouldn't have shown up
if you weren't,...

281
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,666
I could see it in your eyes
the second you arrived...

282
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,375
The two of us are cut
from the same cloth, Rin.

283
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,250
Wrong...

284
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,041
That's not why I showed up...

285
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,083
I uh...

286
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,375
Honestly, I was curious...

287
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,041
I don't mean for this to sound
rude, but I needed to see

288
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,625
if the national
champion is everything

289
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,166
she's cracked up to be...

290
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,416
And of course...

291
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,291
I need to experience
that feeling.

292
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Is that so...?

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,458
It kind of sounds like you
think you're better than me...

294
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,500
Alright then...

295
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,333
I'll give you
a two-lap handicap.

296
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,208
But if I give you
that much leeway...

297
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,958
You and I are gonna
get this race going...

298
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:24,916
You got it?

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,833
Okay!

300
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,250
Captain, hold on a second...

301
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,416
Rin isn't familiar
with the track just yet...

302
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, and I forgot
to mention something...

303
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,208
What's going on here...?

304
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,291
Explain.

305
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,708
That's what I was
about to tell you.

306
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,958
They're transporting stuff
for a construction site...

307
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,416
Looks like its gonna be
another five minutes

308
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,416
or so before
everything's ready.

309
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,125
Maybe you could take
a detour around building eight?

310
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,458
Of course...

311
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,458
Hey, Haruki...

312
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
Stop the timer...

313
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,375
We'll restart from the
beginning of the track.

314
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,166
Roger.

315
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,000
So, if I did want to try,

316
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,666
how difficult is it
to pilot a RideBack?

317
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,041
That all depends...

318
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,666
First mode is automatic...

319
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,416
Its easy...

320
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,625
Balancing is a breeze...

321
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,375
In that mode anyway.

322
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,708
But our Rideback ladies
are in manual mode...

323
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,666
Pretty tough for
a beginner to simply stand,

324
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,916
even if they've
got good reflexes.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,291
Wow...

326
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,625
That makes Rin's grand jeté
even more impressive.

327
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,000
What's a grand jeté?

328
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,166
It's a ballet term...

329
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,500
It's a type of
long horizontal jump.

330
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,041
Are you sure this is okay...?

331
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,458
Us riding through here?

332
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,083
That depends on who you ask...

333
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,500
But I say it's fine...

334
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,708
Improvising your own path

335
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,208
is part of the fun
of riding a RideBack.

336
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,166
Hey, Captain!

337
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,625
What are you guys doing...?!

338
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,541
We're gonna get a complaint
from the student council.

339
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,208
Who cares?

340
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,416
Add it to the pile.

341
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,958
Oh, man.

342
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
How's it look?

343
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,291
Still no sign of them.

344
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,041
Keep looking...

345
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,750
It should be any second.

346
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,458
They're here!

347
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,958
Here they come!

348
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,583
Annnnnnd...

349
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,041
Begin!

350
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,166
Alright, Rin...!

351
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,375
Go get her...!

352
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,375
Okay, I admit it.

353
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,375
RideBacks are totally cool!

354
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,583
Yeah...

355
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,791
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

356
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,708
I know, I'm agreeing with you.

357
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,416
Was that Rin who passed by?

358
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,208
Shouko!

359
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,041
So...?

360
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,958
How are things going so far?

361
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,083
Time to get serious about this.

362
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,125
Oh, wow...

363
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,000
She really picked up speed.

364
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,208
That form...

365
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,875
the one on the internet.

366
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,083
Okay.

367
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,458
The speed is amazing.

368
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,791
What...?

369
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,416
How the heck does she know
the Spread Legs Form?

370
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,833
What is that?

371
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,333
The wheels reposition themselves
to the front and back...

372
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,416
The legs spread, which in turn,
lowers the center of gravity.

373
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,750
Higher speeds can be reached,
due to less air resistance,

374
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,291
but controlling turns
becomes a bit of an obstacle.

375
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,000
Haruki...!

376
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:07,875
Check out their stats!

377
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,958
Uh, why?

378
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,125
I can't believe it...

379
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,875
The newbie's closing in!

380
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,708
Are you intentionally
letting her catch up, Tamayo?

381
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,875
Will you shut up...?

382
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,458
I'm trying to focus.

383
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,375
How is she catching up with me?

384
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,000
Its her second time riding...

385
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,458
Is this talent...?

386
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,250
Alright...

387
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,958
Let's see her handle this!

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,875
Why am I not surprised?

389
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,666
That timed out perfectly...

390
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,083
It was bound to
plunge into the lake

391
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,083
while accelerating
on that curve.

392
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,750
She may come off as all
kinds of cute and polite

393
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,958
but that girl's got a
powerful set of fangs on her.

394
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,916
Haruki...

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,583
Fuego fell into the lake.

396
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,791
Come and help dredge her out.

397
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,666
You ready for this, Fuego?

398
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,583
Tamayo just passed
the water tower!

399
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,166
Is that all you're
worried about...?

400
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,500
Where's Rin?

401
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,666
Try to keep an eye on the
monitor while I'm gone, okay?

402
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,458
Wait, hold on...

403
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm gonna go with you.

404
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,291
Hey...!

405
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,500
She's up and moving!

406
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,500
Oh, wait.

407
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,250
It looks like
she stopped again.

408
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,916
That's right where Tamayo is...

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
Hey Captain, listen up.

410
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,875
Rin should be
somewhere ahead of you...

411
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,333
Got a visual on her?

412
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,833
Not too shabby, ballerina.

413
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,958
You're a little impressive.

414
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,583
We're resuming the race!

415
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't believe it!

416
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:24,833
So she's okay?

417
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,208
Go, Rin!

418
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,375
She's closing
the gap between them.

419
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,083
I had no idea Fuego
could move that fast!

420
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:43,958
C'mon...

421
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,541
Just try to pass me.

422
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,916
Neck and neck!

423
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,083
She passed her!

424
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,833
Way to go, Rin!

425
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,083
Idiot...!

426
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,916
You're gonna wipe out
again going that fast!

427
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,458
She's incredible.

428
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,375
Doctor said it's
nothing too major...

429
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,625
She got off with only
a mild concussion.

430
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,583
Well, I guess all we should be
worried about is how she reacts.

431
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,375
Gotta feeling it
isn't gonna be pretty.

432
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,416
Haruki...

433
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,208
Entries are still open, right?

434
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,041
Hey.

435
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,375
How long've you been awake?

436
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,208
Rest easy, I've already
sent in your registration

437
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,333
for the nationals.

438
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,333
We're all set.

439
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,125
Not for me, for her.

440
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,291
You'll need to work on your
skills before we race again...

441
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,958
We're gonna start
the training tomorrow,

442
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,125
so make sure you're prepared.

443
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,666
Okay.

444
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,208
So listen to this...

445
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,666
Suzuri's joining
the club as well.

446
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,041
Apparently she can't stop
thinking about trying it.

447
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,125
You might have something
to do with that.

448
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,875
I wonder...

449
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,583
Do you think
I've made a mistake?

450
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,333
What, of course not.

451
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,166
I gotta admit you looked
pretty cool out there.

452
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,291
They're letting a beginner
like Rin into the Nationals?

453
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,500
What, seriously, for real?!

454
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,416
For really real
they're going to?!

455
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,791
Well, it's not that hard...

456
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,791
You just have to register
on time to get in.

457
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,583
Well that's the
minor sports for you...!

458
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,375
How awesome!

459
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,625
Don't call it minor!
