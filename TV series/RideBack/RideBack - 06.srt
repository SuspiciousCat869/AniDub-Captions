1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,375
...are endorsing ratification
of a new domestic

2
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,041
counter-terrorism unit...

3
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,500
The so-called "White Riders" are
to be operated by local police,

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,333
but under strict
guidance from the GGP...

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,125
When this might go into effect
is still under some debate...

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,791
Your thoughts, Mr. Suzuki?

7
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,083
Terrorists have an incredible
advantage because of

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,791
their work with Ridebacks...

9
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,083
Some say this move is not only
logical, but overdue...

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,000
The question I'm
forced to ask, however,

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,500
is how much of a deterrent
will this really be?

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,791
You're crazy to be working
in this kind of heat.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,625
I told you, club's
suspended indefinitely.

14
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,625
Yeah, well, I guess I just
don't listen too good...

15
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,416
But of course,
you already knew that.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,000
Can you expand on that a bit?

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,500
Unlike typical police
vehicles, the White Riders

18
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,416
are armored and equipped
with high-caliber firearms...

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
My concern...

20
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,041
is that police forces are slowly
becoming small military units.

21
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,625
Interesting.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,041
When I rode that thing
I had no control over it...

23
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,708
But the "Swan Princess" did...

24
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,333
How is it I can't drive it
but a newbie like Rin can...?

25
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,833
What is Fuego--really?

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,958
You don't need to know
the answer to that question...

27
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,333
It doesn't concern you.

28
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,875
The hell it doesn't...!

29
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,916
By bringing it here, you made
it the whole club's concern!

30
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,708
At this point,
I have a right to know.

31
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,500
What...?

32
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,125
Whaddaya mean you're
"not coming in"?!

33
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,916
Did you forget
our deadline today?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,041
The Yakuza piece?

35
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,125
Sorry...

36
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,208
I gotta check somethin'
in Toranomon...

37
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,500
Close up the office;

38
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,708
the editor can bitch
to the answering service.

39
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,916
Your funeral...

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh!

41
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,375
I found some info
you're gonna love!

42
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,333
On what?

43
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,875
Our mystery
"RideBack Girl"...

44
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,333
Goes to the same school
as Tamayo Kataoka.

45
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,750
And she's got a name...

46
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,958
Rin Ogata.

47
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,750
Long, straight dark hair...

48
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,375
Oh yeah, it's her...

49
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,500
Dark hair...?

50
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,416
I mean, I been staring at that
footage of her for days ...

51
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,833
So now what...?

52
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,791
Maybe you're when done there,
we should try callin'

53
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,125
the university and
see if-- Uh- hello?

54
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Guess I better pay
the young lady a visit.

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,458
Looks like Kenji
won't be joining us.

56
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:44,708
Hey, Kenji...!

57
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,125
You here?

58
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,041
Oh, man...

59
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,750
What is all of this?

60
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,541
Hey, RideBack...

61
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,291
When did Kenji get all these?

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,333
That jerk.

63
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,291
What could he possibly be
doing that's so important?

64
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,500
Well, he was only ten years old
when your mother passed away...

65
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,583
To lose her
at such a young age-

66
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,541
I suppose it affected
him differently.

67
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,625
Even so...

68
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,958
He should come
visit her grave with us.

69
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,416
He's going to do
what he's going to do...

70
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,125
Hard to believe it's been
six whole years, isn't it?

71
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,708
So...

72
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,166
Are you getting involved
with any campus activities?

73
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,291
I guess I've found
a couple of things I like...

74
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,000
Nothing too serious...

75
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,250
I even found this one club
that I'm really enjoying.

76
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,625
I'm so glad...

77
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,333
It's good that you're
finding new things

78
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,458
to focus your talents on.

79
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,291
It's wonderful, actually.

80
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,208
So, Rin...

81
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,708
how's dorm life treating you?

82
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,083
Are you and Shouko still
getting along all right?

83
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,250
Yeah, we are...

84
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,416
In fact, we're supposed
to meet up later.

85
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,625
Whoa!

86
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,958
Badass!

87
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,541
Hell yeah!

88
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,375
Hey, where did you get 'em?

89
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,166
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

90
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,583
Let's just say
they fell off...

91
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,583
a boat somewhere.

92
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,500
Best you don't know more.

93
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,000
We can take all of them?

94
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,583
I tell you what...

95
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,333
Make a nice big mess tonight.

96
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,625
Tell me something champ...

97
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,541
You ain't afraid
of the police, are ya?

98
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,708
Good, 'cause here's
a little bonus...

99
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,125
What are they?

100
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,000
Military-grade smoke flares.

101
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,833
BMA use 'em, too...

102
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,458
You can figure out
how they work.

103
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,166
Now go an' raise some hell.

104
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,166
Wh--...

105
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,833
Whoa!

106
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,291
Holy crap, this is Gremlin's
like, brand-newest model...

107
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,833
Not bad for a Luxury--

108
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,250
There's no manufacturer badge...

109
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,166
Was this thing smuggled out of
the freakin' factory?

110
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,458
I don't wanna sound
like a lamoid,

111
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,708
but doesn't this seem
kinda dangerous to you?

112
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,083
You trust me, don't you?

113
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,250
Yeah, but...

114
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,291
Shut up 'n show me
how to ride this thing.

115
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,666
That's a Dumont
Co E-W Band!

116
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,250
Suh-weet!

117
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,041
Hey...

118
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,458
Yeah, four of 'em,
just like ya wanted...

119
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,250
We'll set 'em loose
later tonight.

120
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
Of the three
escaped RideBackers,...

121
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,166
we've identified two...

122
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,583
First is Abraham Ronstadt...

123
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,125
Former Special Ops
with the U.S. Army...

124
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,750
No name yet on the second...

125
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
But he is South African

126
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,500
and served in the
French Foreign Legion.

127
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,541
Unfortunately, the third was not
found in any of our databases,

128
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
so we don't have much...

129
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,583
We have obtained
footage of him,

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,125
taken just after
he launched the rocket...

131
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,083
And a closer look...

132
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,208
Facial analysis tells us he's
Caucasian of European descent...

133
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,541
Due to his ability to fire
a shoulder-mounted rocket

134
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,666
from such an
unstable vehicle,...

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,250
we believe him to be a highly
trained soldier or mercenary.

136
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,333
Given the large number
of combat professionals

137
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,208
we've identified
within their ranks...

138
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,750
Gentlemen, I strongly
believe at this point...

139
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,875
It's safe to say the BMA
radicals have evolved...

140
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,000
From a terrorist cell...

141
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
To a full-fledged militia.

142
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
We should not be surprised
to see them attempt

143
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,208
more and more
larger-scale attacks.

144
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,708
Therefore, my intelligence
staff hereby recommends

145
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,833
the immediate implementation
of the White Rider program

146
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,875
in police departments
nationwide,.

147
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,583
For the protection
of our cities,

148
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,375
and the preservation
of public safety.

149
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,875
Hey, sorry I'm late...!

150
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,458
I missed the bus,
can you believe it?

151
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,625
Sorry I made you come
all the way out here...

152
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,458
Every so often, I just have the
urge to get away from it all.

153
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,500
Yeah...

154
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,625
I get those feelings
too sometimes.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,041
Hey, Shouko...

156
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
Do you remember...?

157
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,583
Last year after
the school festival,...

158
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,750
the fireworks?

159
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,000
Mm hm...

160
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,541
We were making
so much noise,...

161
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,083
the police came out...

162
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,666
Gave us all warnings...

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,000
Then we all ran--just
scattered!

164
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,791
In all the craziness,
you and I got separated...

165
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,125
I was so scared!

166
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,000
I walked up and down
that pitch black beach

167
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,250
calling out for you, "Shouko!

168
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,791
Shouko!"...

169
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,083
But all I heard back
was the waves...

170
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,250
God, I was so relieved
when I finally found you...

171
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,541
I'm glad you looked for me too,
instead of running home!

172
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,958
I hugged you so tight and
we couldn't stop crying...

173
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,083
Even with all
the chaos and tears...

174
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,291
It's still worth
remembering, isn't it?

175
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,041
Rin...

176
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,625
You're the most talented
dancer I've ever seen,

177
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,458
but when it comes to
acting you really suck.

178
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,708
I know what you're doing...

179
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,875
Okay, I was pretty freaked
out for while there,

180
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,125
who wouldn't be...?

181
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,541
But I'm fine now...

182
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,250
Really.

183
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,291
Its just...

184
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,458
I know how you feel
about big crowds

185
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,458
and everything right now...

186
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,333
Honestly,I can't say I blame you
after all that's happened...

187
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,166
Maybe if I had taken
the time to think it over,

188
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,708
you might not have
gotten so traumatized.

189
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,708
You rescued me...

190
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,958
'Kay?

191
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,708
Shouko...

192
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,875
Aw, man...

193
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,666
The bus is gonna
be here any second now...

194
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,041
You comin'?

195
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,166
Yeah, no...

196
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,916
I think I'll
catch the next one.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,208
Alright then, girlie...

198
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,125
Guess I'll catch up
with ya later.

199
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,291
Gimme a call
or something tomorrow!

200
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,708
There you are...

201
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,166
Dude!

202
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,625
I am freakin' lovin' this!

203
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,625
Listen to that baby purr!

204
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,125
All right...!

205
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,041
Rev 'em up, boys!

206
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,041
Let's roll!

207
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,625
Yeah!

208
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,291
You're Rin Ogata, right?

209
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,625
I dropped by your club the
other day, you remember me?

210
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,666
I don't suppose I could
trouble you for a moment

211
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,166
of your time...?

212
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,250
Not right now.

213
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,166
Sorry, I have
somewhere I need to be.

214
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
Please don't go...

215
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,750
Is that a motorcycle gang...?

216
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,500
On Ridebacks?

217
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,416
Kenji?!

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,375
Need a lift?

219
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,791
Damn kids,
someone could get hurt!

220
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,125
You stupid punk!

221
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,416
Yeah, tear it up!

222
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,666
Take this!

223
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,541
Kizaki...

224
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,500
Aren't we taking it
a bit far?

225
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,750
Relax, kid!

226
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,375
This is what we're here for,
try not to be a little pansy!

227
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,875
Attention RideBacker!

228
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,541
Pull the vehicle over and stop
the engine, immediately!

229
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Yeah...

230
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,250
That'll happen.

231
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,791
Whoopsie.

232
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,875
That was a cop car!

233
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,583
We're sorry, the number
you are trying to reach--

234
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,875
Kenji...

235
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,541
What have you
gotten yourself into?

236
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,333
I guess delinquency
is an Ogata family trait.

237
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,791
Just kidding.

238
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,875
Seriously?

239
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,958
They're messing
with the police?

240
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,500
Well, Good Evening,
Officers...!

241
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,208
Is there something
going on up ahead?

242
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,125
Sorry, ma'am.

243
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,041
Road's closed
from this point.

244
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,666
You'll have to go around.

245
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,291
Interesting, I'm a journalist
and I just happened to notice

246
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,333
the smoke as I drove by...

247
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,125
I'll need to see your driver's
license please, ma'am.

248
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,750
I'm sorry, your
passenger can't be here

249
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,250
without the proper
press credentials.

250
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,791
GGP?

251
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,791
You hear me?

252
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,458
Yes, that's fine...

253
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,250
Thank you, gentlemen!

254
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,166
I think I've stumbled
onto a big scoop...

255
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,000
Hang on...

256
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,541
This might get rough.

257
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,041
They're currently
on Forty-Seventh Street...

258
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,333
Moving from the Inamura District
to the reclaimed land area.

259
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,541
You both know that vandalism
and traffic violations

260
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,625
aren't justification
for deadly force.

261
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,125
Ah, come on...

262
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,500
They'll trump up
some worse charges later,...

263
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,291
right?

264
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,125
Uh, something like that...

265
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,208
Damn...

266
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,916
These GGP bastards, thinkin'
they own anything and everyone!

267
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,000
They've been diverted
to the closed-off area.

268
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,625
Two units standing by.

269
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,083
Colonel...

270
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,000
The combat operations test
will be starting shortly...

271
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,458
Would you like to join us
in the briefing room?

272
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,000
Thank you, no...

273
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,791
You seem to have a handle on it;
I'll watch the feed in here.

274
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,708
Shall I report in
to the home office?

275
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,083
That won't be necessary...

276
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,583
He's a "terrorist" now...

277
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,791
When we find him, we just
get to kill him again.

278
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,875
Man, those cops were nothin'!

279
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,791
What the holy hell
is happening?!

280
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,750
No way...

281
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,250
Those are White Riders!

282
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,166
No...!

283
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,541
Suck on this!

284
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,375
Damn...!

285
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,500
It was all a set up!

286
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,375
This is bad!

287
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,208
Yeah, ya think?!

288
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,333
Gun it!

289
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,875
Kizaki!

290
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,250
Kenji!

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,625
White Riders...?

292
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,958
But they're not supposed
to be on the streets yet...!

293
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,041
What the--?

294
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,208
Damn it!

295
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,458
uh...

296
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,583
I give up!

297
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,666
What the hell did a
biker gang ever do

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,791
to deserve this brutality?!

299
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,000
Damn iiit!

300
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,458
Why is this happening?!

301
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,000
Gimme a break!

302
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,791
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, Crap!

303
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,291
Hey wait!

304
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,833
Kenji!

305
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,083
Oh, god...

306
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,583
What're you, nuts...?!

307
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,000
Get back here!

308
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,916
Come on...!

309
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,708
It started!

310
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,250
Rin Ogata...?

311
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,958
What is she doing there?

312
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,125
This female rider...

313
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,750
She's the terrorist
from the BMA incident...

314
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,416
Do not hold back.

315
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,000
This is turning into
quite the field test.

316
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,500
Run, Rin.

317
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,416
Kenji!

318
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,000
She dodged them again!

319
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:50,750
That's insane...!

320
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,333
No one can do that!

321
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:55,916
Go...

322
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,958
Leave me...

323
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,166
Kenji...

324
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,041
She's the RideBack Girl...

325
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,500
I knew it.

326
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,958
Stay where you are...!

327
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,333
Turn off the engine,...

328
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,666
then put your hands
where we can see 'em,

329
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,958
and slowly
dismount the RideBack!

330
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,833
Now...!

331
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,708
I repeat:...

332
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,208
Disengage the engine...

333
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,500
and step away from
the vehicle at once!

334
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:33,750
She's busted!

335
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,458
Nabbed!

336
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,458
Sent Up the river...!

337
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,708
What do we do now?!

338
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,041
Haruki!

339
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,541
Have you ever wondered
if its truly possible...?

340
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,250
Will the meek inherit
the planet they inhabit...?

341
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,166
Can we fight those
who govern us?

342
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,666
We broke Haruki...!

343
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,833
And, scene!
