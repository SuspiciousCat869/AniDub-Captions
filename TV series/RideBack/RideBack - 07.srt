1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,916
Kenji!

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,833
Please, stop hurting him!

3
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,083
I'm begging you...

4
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,041
don't hurt him any more!

5
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,291
Guy had a pretty sweet
RideBack, didn't he?

6
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,375
And you not having one,
of course you'd be envious,

7
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,041
after all you're only human...

8
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,375
Hell, I'd have been...

9
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,416
back in the day anyway...

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,458
But pushing him to his death
'cause you're jealous

11
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,833
of his ride?

12
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,041
You took it to a whole
'nother level, kid.

13
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,916
What were you thinking?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I didn't kill him,
I swear it!

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,458
Come on!

16
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,416
Listen to me--I
didn't kill anybody!

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
You sure about that?

18
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,875
I can do this all night...

19
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,500
You're the murderers
here, not me.

20
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,750
You keep getting 'em wrong...

21
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,291
Maybe you wanna rethink your
answers before Sis has to

22
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,708
take a shot at the
lightning round...

23
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,875
You know you're guilty...

24
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,750
Sign the confession.

25
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,500
Fine, I'll do it.

26
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,458
Kenji!

27
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,916
Kenji?

28
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,583
I'm okay.

29
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,208
That little brother of yours
spared you a world of pain.

30
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,833
The streets of Kasahara
are that much safer today

31
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,791
after nearly a dozen vandals
on RideBacks were arrested in

32
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,166
the prefecture yesterday evening
and charged with assault.

33
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,791
Many of those arrested
are minors, we've been told,

34
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,125
and as such their names
will not be released.

35
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,375
We're sorry.

36
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,875
The phone you're trying
to reach is turned off

37
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,750
or outside of the service area.

38
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,666
Please try
your call again later.

39
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,041
No luck?

40
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,750
Every time I call...

41
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,541
nothing...

42
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,833
Don't get too worried...

43
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,333
I mean, we don't even
know if she was there.

44
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,666
Maaaan!

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,458
I so knew something totally
messed up was gonna go down...!

46
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,166
Why would you say that?!

47
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,250
This sucks!

48
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,250
Haruki...!

49
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,500
Can I take Balon out?

50
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,125
Uh...

51
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,708
take it out?

52
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,666
Whad'ya want Balon for?

53
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,083
I gotta distract
myself, or else...

54
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,583
I'll just keep worrying.

55
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,125
You know I think
it might help.

56
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,791
Dude, how's it gonna help?!

57
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,166
Y'know Douta,

58
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,791
us stressing isn't gonna
make Rin magically appear...

59
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,458
I mean it's not like she
would have broken the law...

60
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,750
Even if she had gotten
herself arrested...

61
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,958
it's just...

62
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,833
a mix-up and they'll
figure it out soon...

63
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,625
She's a good egg.

64
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,416
Suzuri's right...

65
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,916
Hey, why not let her hop onto
Balon and putter around a bit.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,750
We're the RideBack Club,
for crying out loud?!

67
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,291
And besides...

68
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,541
We can't let people go thinking
only terrorists ride 'em.

69
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,875
C'mon, it's the
least we can do.

70
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,375
RideBack Cluuuub...!

71
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,625
Go!

72
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,583
Okay, have it your way.

73
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,791
Keep it nice
and slow, yeah...?

74
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,583
We're down to
our last RideBack...

75
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,791
you smash up Balon
and we're sunk!

76
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,000
"Nice an' slow"
is my middle name!

77
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,833
Welp, time for liftoff!

78
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,083
Whoa...

79
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:34,625
whoa...

80
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,750
I... I got it...

81
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,375
I got it!

82
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,208
On three, Balon!

83
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,500
--whoa!

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,083
 What the hell was that?

85
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,791
Ah, mission accomplished.

86
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,166
You're way cuter when
you smile, y'know.

87
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,666
Do I look bad-ass or what!

88
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,833
Hands on the handles--this
ain't a parade!

89
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,708
Huh...?!

90
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,958
Whoa!

91
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,916
Again...

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
the streets of Kasahara
are that much safer today...

93
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,125
I asked my brother
to look into it.

94
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,333
Rin's been arrested.

95
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,958
But, at least
we know she's okay.

96
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,083
They're trying to pin
some random guy's murder

97
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,875
on her little brother.

98
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,458
If the GGP is half as mixed
up in this as my brother

99
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,166
seems to think, they might
not be getting out.

100
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,375
Okakura...

101
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,208
Enough with the secrecy, I need
you to be straight up with me.

102
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,166
Who the hell are you?

103
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,500
Officers in Sendai have already
arrested several elusive

104
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,958
criminals with the help
of their new RideBacks,

105
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,458
the White Riders.

106
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,333
These are specialized machines,
bearing little resemblance

107
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,666
to those sold to civilians...

108
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,750
White Rider patrols
in Chiba have arrested

109
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,666
a terror suspect
atop a RideBack.

110
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,000
One officer was injured
during the pursuit.

111
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,666
Our viewers have been calling
in from all over Japan,

112
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,750
and they are not happy
about these White Riders

113
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,250
being forced upon them.

114
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,416
Well who would be...?

115
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,458
That said, what can
we do from here...?

116
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,416
I'd be hard pressed to think of
a more effective alternative

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,916
in eradicating terrorism.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,708
Local governments,
on the other hand, are going

119
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
out of their way to request
White Rider squads,

120
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,583
isn't that so?

121
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,250
That's true--especially
in areas considered --

122
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,875
Teams are slated for deployment
in Yokohama, Sendai, Kobe,

123
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,500
and Miyazaki...

124
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,625
Adding thirteen more squads will
get us to our goal of thirty.

125
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,625
You can't just barge in!

126
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,750
Sorry, but it couldn't wait.

127
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,375
At ease...

128
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,791
For now.

129
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,041
Quite a theatrical entrance...

130
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,750
Superintendent.

131
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,791
What's the meaning of this?

132
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,875
I think it speaks for itself.

133
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,583
"Rin Ogata will be transferred

134
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,083
to a GGP facility and
detained indefinitely"?

135
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,208
You're acting like
we don't exist...!

136
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,916
How dare you
disrespect my department?!

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,791
I call the shots here, sir...

138
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,041
If I were you,
I'd get accustomed to it.

139
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,750
Police searched the house,

140
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,125
I suppose they were
looking for evidence...

141
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,375
They inadvertently
straightened up Kenji's room,

142
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,916
it's so tidy now...

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,583
But you know...

144
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,250
Messy was better.

145
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,375
Yeah...

146
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,958
I guess...

147
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,208
Honey...

148
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,416
You're strong...

149
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,833
Far stronger than you know.

150
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,125
So don't you
give up, all right?

151
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,833
Time's up, lady.

152
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,875
And Kenji's a good boy,
say what they will.

153
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,791
You have to leave--now.

154
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,125
Don't lose hope, dear.

155
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,250
Save Shouko...

156
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,250
Protect Kenji...

157
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,625
That's all I wanted to do...

158
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,125
But helping them
came at a price.

159
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,458
Would you have done
the same thing, Mom?

160
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,291
Stop dancing
and just answer me.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,916
You have been chosen.

162
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,708
"Chosen?"...

163
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,708
By who?

164
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,000
You've been chosen
for your strength.

165
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,583
Who...?

166
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,208
And what for...?

167
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,375
How am I strong?

168
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,791
You've the
strength to fight...

169
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,541
To emerge victorious...

170
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,083
To rip your enemies
to shreds...!

171
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,583
The GGP's ruling
philosophy seems to be

172
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,083
"might makes right."...

173
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,416
And people are finding this
an increasingly bitter pill

174
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,250
to swallow.

175
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,833
Easy to see why.

176
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,208
People are starting to wonder if
this whole Rideback Girl story

177
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,041
was simply some kind
of publicity stunt...

178
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,041
Rin...

179
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
I wonder...

180
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,541
Why haven't
they named Rin yet...?

181
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,000
The GGP is up to something.

182
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,208
I know you're back there.

183
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,375
Wasn't I quiet enough?

184
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,083
Fuego...?

185
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,625
Do what you have to.

186
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,250
And what about you?

187
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,333
I have a date
with a dead man...

188
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,958
What a dump, am I right?

189
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,250
Don't you worry, sweetie.

190
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,458
A little paperwork
and we'll have you

191
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,250
transferred out of here...

192
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
Give it a week or so...

193
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,500
You'll be in GGP custody
where it's much comfier.

194
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,250
Until then, is there anything
else we can do for you?

195
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,083
Don't transfer me.

196
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,583
I'm sorry?

197
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,416
Don't transfer me.

198
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,250
You're in lockdown,
babydoll--get a clue...

199
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,166
We're gonna take you
where we damn well please.

200
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,416
Huh?

201
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,875
What's wrong?

202
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,625
He disappeared.

203
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,333
Hand out of the coat.

204
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,791
Nice and slow.

205
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,458
Far enough.

206
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,750
You tell Colonel Romanov...

207
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,625
Goblin is gonna
pay him a visit soon.

208
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,583
You're telling me
he just walked away?

209
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,708
Shall I put out an all-points
bulletin for Okakura?

210
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,416
What, to catch
a washed-up veteran...?

211
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,333
That's overkill.

212
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,875
Goblin would've been
better off staying dead.

213
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,166
Account for your things
and sign out for them.

214
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,125
Outta the way!

215
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,208
No, wait--!

216
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,291
I don't care anymore...

217
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,250
Just leave me in the truck...

218
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,458
The video on your screen
was submitted to us

219
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
by an anonymous source.

220
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,833
Though the resolution is
grainy in comparison

221
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,125
to the official footage,
this sheds new light

222
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,125
on the incident.

223
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,583
The presence of the armored
GGP vehicle in the shot

224
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,041
is significant.

225
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,416
Clearly, the GGP's
involvement in this situation...

226
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,125
Sato, tell me you're watching
The WideShow right now...!

227
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,625
This just in: One of
the young suspects

228
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,000
apprehended in the
Kasahara incident...

229
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,000
was taken by BMA agents...

230
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,666
as she was making her way
to GGP headquarters...

231
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,166
just moments ago.

232
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,791
According to a statement
issued by the police,.

233
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,041
all five of the officers on the
scene were wounded or killed.

234
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,166
The prisoner at large is
suspected to have played

235
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,041
a significant role in the
TV tower bombing as well.

236
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,291
Since she is a minor, however,
her name cannot be disclosed.

237
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,583
The BMA have
released the following.

238
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,750
Good afternoon, Japan.

239
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,416
The RideBack Girl was imprisoned
on false terrorism charges

240
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,625
at the GGP's behest.

241
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,791
We of the BMA have taken
the righteous path

242
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,875
and liberated her
from their tyranny.

243
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,666
In the twenty minutes since the
attack occurred, we've come

244
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,375
no closer to discovering the
fate of the kidnapped prisoner.

245
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,333
Again, the BMA claims
to have abducted the youth

246
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,000
known as the RideBack Girl
while she was being moved

247
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,708
to GGP custody.

248
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,083
The GGP have neither
confirmed nor denied this.

249
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,208
They can't move
a single co-ed from A to B?

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,750
Some Intelligence Bureau!

251
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,125
Go ahead.

252
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,833
We found Okakura, but BMA
agents are shadowing him.

253
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,416
Please advise, Colonel.

254
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,083
He'll lead you to them...

255
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,958
If you play your cards right.

256
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,125
Hey, you're Goblin, ain'tcha?

257
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,750
Why'd you free the girl...?

258
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,041
We both know she has
nothing to do with this.

259
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,250
Ask 1st Lieutenant Kiefer...

260
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,166
We'll even give ya a ride.

261
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,708
I see...

262
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,958
Rin was just the bait
to draw me out into the open.

263
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,291
Target is moving southwest
at 80 kilometers per hour...

264
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,583
Unit Eight will give pursuit
on the ground via the overpass.

265
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,916
Recon out.

266
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,958
I know you...

267
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,250
So we meet again.

268
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,208
So this is the preview?

269
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:39,916
Pretty cool!

270
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,875
Super cool!

271
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,208
But Haruki's such a slacker,

272
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,833
he never helps me
like he's supposed to!

273
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,416
Hey, now--don't look at me.

274
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,791
Oh, I see how it is!

275
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,375
You're probably jealous
'cause you've never been

276
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,333
--on a RideBack, huh!
--Yeah, that'll be the day! No.
