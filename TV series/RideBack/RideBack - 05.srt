1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,708
What the hell were
you people thinking...?!

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,750
Answer me!

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,333
We told her to stay
in the truck...!

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,791
Help me out here...!

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,375
Rin and Shouko are fine,
what's the big deal?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,000
The GGP didn't do squat
for those hostages!

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,166
Why don't you
yell at them instead?

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,833
You know nothing
about the GGP!

9
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:30,875
One...

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,458
All club activities
are cancelled...

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,541
Two, today didn't happen,
understood...?

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,083
You can't tell anybody.

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,041
Three...

14
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm scrapping Fuego.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,166
Why is Okakura freaking out?

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,291
He's afraid of the GGP.

17
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,166
But why...?

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,666
Is it 'cause
Fuego's so rare...?

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,708
Or something else...

20
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,916
Back at ya...

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,208
So what all'd
the cops have to say?

22
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,458
"We've no comment
at this time."...

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,041
I just wanted to punch him...

24
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,041
Well, they've kept
a lid on it so far.

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,125
Oh, and our new
counter-terrorism squad'll

26
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,875
catch 'em, so rest easy.

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,375
Who the hell calls
a press conference

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,958
in the middle of the night?

29
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,666
Aintcha gonna ask
if I found anything?

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,625
Wait, a girl...?

31
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
Girls ride these things, too?

32
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,041
Meet Tamayo
Kataoka--college hottie,

33
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,458
and winner of the All-Japan
RideBack tournament, a.k.a.

34
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,291
the RideBack Princess...

35
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,291
Her dad, Nanpuu, is a
powerful member of Parliament,

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,833
and her brother's
a high-up with the police.

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,000
That explains
the media blackout...

38
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,583
Nepotism...

39
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,625
Yesterday's RideBack was a Fuego
Type-L made by Tersian Kaduro...

40
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,833
And according to the
dealerships I called,

41
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,583
there's only twenty of these
Fuego Type-Ls in all of Japan.

42
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,875
Sweet...

43
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,375
Pop all that into
an e-mail for me, would ya?

44
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,041
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

45
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,541
Sato, ya done good!

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,333
I'd say its about nap time.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,083
A girl was on the
Rideback that broke through

48
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,000
the GGP blockade...

49
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:01,000
she could have ties to the
government and the police?

50
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,958
It's payday, baby.

51
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
And now, the news at six.

52
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,125
Our top story remains the
hijacking of the TV tower

53
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,458
yesterday by the BMA...

54
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,791
The explosion with which
they began their attack

55
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,041
ripped through the
area, killing seven

56
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,875
and injuring 167--the highest
number of casualties

57
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:42,250
in an anti-GGP attack thus
far this calendar year.

58
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,166
The Cabinet gathered
for an emergency meeting

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,458
last night in
response to this.

60
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,541
Earlier today they
announced plans to create

61
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,916
a new anti-terrorism bureau,
combining resources

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,708
and personnel from the Ministry
of Internal Affairs...

63
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,958
Along with the GGP itself.

64
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,291
This new bureau is sure
to be under discussion...

65
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,875
There hasn't been
one mention of us.

66
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,750
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

67
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,791
Hello to you, too.

68
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,125
Hi, whatever you're
calling about,

69
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,708
better be pretty freakin'
important at this hour.

70
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,041
Did something out
of the ordinary happen?

71
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,166
I told you I'd call
if anything came up...

72
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,041
Its late.

73
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,666
Sorry about that...

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,458
By the way,
have you seen the news?

75
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,125
You mean about
the terrorist attacks?

76
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,041
Word has it some random civilian
woman was on that RideBack

77
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,916
that broke
through the blockade.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,750
Yeah, so...?

79
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,333
A woman on a RideBack's
not that unusual.

80
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,666
That woman...

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
wouldn't be you,
would it...?

82
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,000
Accusing your own sister?!

83
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,500
You douche!

84
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,083
Wait, I--!

85
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,458
He was a civilian who
ended up falling in

86
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,083
with the GGP during the war.

87
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,125
He helped in the creation
of the RideBack battalion...

88
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
Turns out he's especially
proficient at various forms

89
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
of guerilla warfare...

90
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,750
Returned to Japan in 2026 after
being honorably discharged.

91
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,500
Romanov spoke of a hero...

92
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,416
Is this the guy?

93
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,541
The RideBack Club, huh?

94
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,541
Such a drag...

95
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,000
What's his deal?

96
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,916
Okakura is blowing this whole
thing out of proportion.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,708
Yeah, 'cause we all
know he's usually so chill.

98
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,958
Why's he being all jerky?

99
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,791
We didn't even do anything!

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,958
Speaking of Okakura,
he's the one who

101
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,416
started the RideBack
Club... Isn't he?

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,291
Yeah...

103
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,500
It was about three years ago,

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,083
right as Tamayo and
I were starting college.

105
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,500
Come to think of it,

106
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,750
I doubt Okakura's actually
competed in a race before.

107
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,875
Nah, he's more of
the mechanic type.

108
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,333
Maybe Mr. Scaryface is
too much of a chicken to try!

109
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,416
Guess again...

110
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,708
He doesn't like to show people,

111
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,916
but his technique
is a thing of beauty.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,708
Not to mention, he knows
more about Ridebacks than

113
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,250
anyone else in all Japan...

114
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,166
Seriously, that guy gets
mad respect from the riders.

115
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, Rin...!

116
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,875
How are you doing?!

117
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,083
Good morning.

118
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,333
How you holding up?

119
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,125
I'm okay.

120
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,875
Getting some sleep helped.

121
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,333
Fuego...

122
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,208
Yeah, guessing he
moved it last night.

123
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,041
Don't know where to, but
it was gone by the time

124
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,041
we got here this morning.

125
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,333
He's taken her apart?!

126
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,541
Probably hasn't...

127
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm sure he'll
do it soon enough.

128
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,333
Uh...

129
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,750
how's Shouko doing?

130
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,291
She's pretty shaken up
about it, but she'll be okay.

131
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,708
Who wouldn't be after going
through something like that?

132
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,125
I know I'd be all kinds
of messed up.

133
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,416
I'm worried about her,
you guys.

134
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,791
I know...

135
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,791
How about all of us go over
there and cheer her up?!

136
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,166
That's nice...

137
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,916
but maybe we shouldn't
make a big deal about it...

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,416
You're such a boy...!

139
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,916
You don't barge in and say,
"You almost died yesterday,

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,458
but it's all good."

141
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,791
Well,...

142
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,541
since the club activities
all got cancelled,...

143
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,958
how 'bout we go out tonight
and grab some food together?

144
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,958
Oh, man--that's
an awesome idea...!

145
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,541
And you know we'll be starved by
the time we're done cleaning up!

146
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,500
All right!

147
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,583
We totally sound like a posse!

148
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,458
A posse?

149
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,625
Seriously?

150
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,416
Where do you think we are,
the Wild West?

151
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,375
'Scuse me, guys.

152
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,291
Sorry 'bout
barging in on your fire,

153
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,208
but is Tamayo Kataoka around?

154
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,000
Uh...

155
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
who wants to know?

156
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,791
Well, if you wanna go formal...

157
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,458
You're a freelance
journalist...?

158
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,416
Thanks a lot, you guys!

159
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,291
Heeey...!

160
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,750
Wait a sec...

161
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,375
What if she's investigating
the thing from yesterday?!

162
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,791
Dude, don't be dense--of
course she is.

163
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,833
But Tamayo wasn't there,
remember...?

164
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,083
So...

165
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
all she's doing
is barking up the wrong tree.

166
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,291
Makes a lot
of sense, good job.

167
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,250
Just gave her a heads up
about this lady journalist

168
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,166
and made sure to
tell her about dinner.

169
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,083
Huh, I wonder where Okakura
would be about now...

170
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,916
Uh...

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,083
I could go tell him
we're going out to eat.

172
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,458
Please leave
a message after the beep.

173
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,541
Hey, Shouko...

174
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,125
it's me...

175
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
How are you feeling...?

176
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,083
We're all going out
to dinner tonight...

177
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,458
like a posse Suzuri said.

178
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,583
If you want to come,
we'd love to have you.

179
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,083
I'll try again later.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,708
Why're you here?

181
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,541
Well, um...

182
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,875
we're having dinner tonight...

183
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,625
I told you to lie low
for a while, so do it!

184
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,125
Well?

185
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,458
Is...

186
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,583
she gone...?

187
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,375
I took her apart,
and threw her away.

188
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,875
Go on and close
the door behind you.

189
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,500
Fuego...

190
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,958
She was a special kind
of Rideback, right?

191
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,375
Who gave you that idea?.

192
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,125
Was it a mechanic?

193
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,625
And... found you.

194
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,916
Tamayo Kataoka, I presume?

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm a freelance journalist
please, call me Kei...

196
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,791
Um...

197
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,583
I've got a few questions,
if that's all right.

198
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,208
How about that RideBack
that broke through

199
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,541
the blockade yesterday?

200
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,291
Crazy stuff, huh?

201
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,083
No...?

202
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,250
Okay...

203
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,250
Then, what do you
think about the rumor

204
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,625
that our mystery
rider was a woman?

205
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,500
That so?

206
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,458
Yeah!

207
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,333
Who cares?

208
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,875
A lot of riders
are women these days.

209
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,666
I wonder if your brother the
cop feels the same way you do?

210
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,333
You trying to piss me off?

211
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,875
Oh no, not at all...!

212
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,708
Why would I fight the child
of a politician so wel-?

213
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,333
Wouldn't have pegged her
for a reader...

214
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,541
The GGP had us trapped, but...

215
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,583
there was this man...

216
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,125
He helped us get away.

217
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,833
And he told me...

218
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,208
He said...

219
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,375
It didn't make any
sense, what he said.

220
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,125
Look, Rin...

221
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,791
Although the GGP hasn't made
public knowledge of it yet...

222
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,750
They can track you down by
simply looking at the footage.

223
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,208
You're scared, and you
should be, but the ball

224
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,458
is in their court.

225
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,625
But, Shouko and I didn't
even do anything--

226
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,625
I know, dammit!

227
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,708
Never should have let you
get mixed up in this...

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,666
I promise I'll protect you.

229
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,416
You can go now.

230
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,041
Aw, that was sick!

231
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
Dude, Kenji...

232
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,916
tell me you caught it on TV!

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,541
That Tersian Kaduro
off-roader chumping the GGP?

234
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,791
Hell yeah I did!

235
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,541
Of course you know
the model...!

236
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,333
Lamoid!

237
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,583
Smart, not lame!

238
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,166
The GGP was all, like,...

239
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,416
"Wait, where did it go?!"

240
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,041
Betcha I coulda pulled off
a jump like that!

241
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,250
Keep dreamin'...!

242
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,500
You'd've eaten it so
hard, there'd've been

243
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
nothing left to arrest!

244
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,916
'Sup, guys...

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,291
Long time, no see.

246
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,833
Kizaki, hey...

247
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,333
How you been, man?

248
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,375
Looking good...

249
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,958
Little Kenji's all grown up.

250
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:42,708
Yeah...

251
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,708
I guess.

252
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,583
"I guess?"...

253
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,083
That's the best you got?

254
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,500
It's a good thing
I ran into you,

255
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,750
been trying to dig up your
number and give ya a call.

256
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,375
Why?

257
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,416
Something up?

258
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,625
Check it out...

259
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,541
We got a little
street-race in the works...

260
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,958
but we're a couple
riders short, man.

261
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,583
Dude, serious?!

262
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,750
Hey, why not?

263
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,166
You'd be doing us
a huge favor if you did.

264
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,333
I so owe you one, Kizaki!

265
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,833
No, of course...

266
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,625
Yeah.

267
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,916
I understand.

268
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,958
Okakura and Tamayo will not
be joining us tonight.

269
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,791
Could you cancel
two of our appetizers?

270
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,250
Thank you!

271
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,416
Posse's full of no-shows.

272
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,083
Yeah...

273
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,125
Even Douta's M.I.A.

274
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,000
and he planned it.

275
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,708
Well, no point waiting around.

276
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,125
Now you're talking!

277
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,750
All right!

278
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,208
Cheers!

279
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,083
Uh...

280
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,333
Terrorists attack
on Inauguration Day...

281
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,125
And a gun for hire
RideBack wiz...

282
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,666
Already under
surveillance by the GGP.

283
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,791
A mere coincidence...?

284
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,041
Or is all of this...

285
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
a set-up?

286
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,875
Sorry for
inconveniencing you.

287
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,375
Not at all, Colonel.

288
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,708
This is rather embarrassing...

289
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,083
Video of GGP security being
trumped by a sole Rideback

290
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,291
has made it all over Japan...

291
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,458
The White Riders couldn't
have a better pretext.

292
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,833
That's assuming
one's in favor of them.

293
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,666
The initial wave should
hit the streets next month.

294
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,375
Is the GGP attempting to trick
the public into thinking

295
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,833
it was a terrorist, and not a
civilian, who broke through

296
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,416
the blockade by suppressing
the rider's true identity?

297
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,625
We'll hand them
over eventually...

298
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,458
but...

299
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,583
I do admit I'm curious.

300
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,666
I have to wonder what sort
of civilian is capable

301
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
of such a maneuver...

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,416
Screencaps from the
APC's onboard camera.

303
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,791
I got the wiggle
that'll make you giggle!

304
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,875
Huh...?

305
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,291
You're saying Rin
bailed out on us?

306
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,083
She's really
worried about Shouko.

307
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,333
That's so thoughtful...

308
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,916
Rin's so great.

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,750
Kind of a buzz-kill that it's
only the three of us you know...

310
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,583
Whatevs, more food for Douta!

311
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,625
I'm starving!

312
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,541
Oh man, these ham
cutlets are the bomb!

313
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,708
You come here much?

314
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,166
Well...

315
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,333
We're always at the garage
pretty late the night before

316
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,250
a race, so we eat here
when we're done...

317
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,625
Yeah.

318
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,708
Yup yup...

319
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,208
it's all part of
the college experience.

320
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,375
Heeeey!

321
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,625
You stole my cutlets!

322
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,250
...special
episode of The WideShow.

323
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,666
We come to you tonight with news
on yesterday's terror attack...

324
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,458
You angry about
the cutlets too...?!

325
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,416
I'll buy us some more, okay!

326
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
A person on a RideBack thought
to be a terrorist outfoxed

327
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,875
GGP forces at the south end
of the Great Bridge...

328
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,250
Neither the GGP nor the
police have made any

329
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,583
official statement regarding
the individual's motives

330
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,083
or identity.

331
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,166
During the conflict...

332
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,708
we caught
the person on tape...

333
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,500
However, government
officials demanded

334
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,625
that we censor our broadcast...

335
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,500
lest we grant airtime
to a possible terrorist.

336
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,625
We at The WideShow were
more than happy to comply

337
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,208
in the name of
responsible journalism.

338
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,458
That's when we took our inquiry
to the next level--thanks

339
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,000
to detailed image-analysis,
we can report with confidence

340
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,333
that the rider
is not a terrorist...

341
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,750
It appears to be
your average citizen.

342
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,291
An innocent bystander,
if you will.

343
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,416
Rin Ogata.

344
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,000
Her identity was confirmed
less than 18 hours ago.

345
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,291
A GGP surveillance team
has been keeping a close watch.

346
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,083
Again, for those of you just
tuning in, the rider of

347
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,125
the robotic motorcycle that
broke yesterday's blockade

348
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,250
was not a participant
in the conflict.

349
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,791
In fact, it appears
to be a young girl.

350
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,916
This clip from yesterday's
conflict leaves little room

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,208
for doubt.

352
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,333
You're the expert,
Mr. Suzuki...

353
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,750
Explain to our views...

354
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,000
What are we looking at here...?

355
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,916
The Internet's been
abuzz with rumors from

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,916
supposed eyewitnesses since
yesterday, but this video

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,458
puts the debate pretty neatly
to rest in my opinion.

358
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,375
I'm sure you noticed the
presence of a second rider...

359
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,208
If I had to guess,
I'd wager these two

360
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,083
were merely trying
to make an escape.

361
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,416
Regardless of that speculation,
do you really think

362
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,041
it's possible for a Rideback
to evade capture like this?

363
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:16,833
Well...

364
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,041
Before yesterday's events,

365
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,083
the answer would have
definitely been no.

366
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,583
The video, however,
debates that it is possible.

367
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,416
I'm more than a little concerned
about this rider's abilities.

368
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,458
Speaking as the resident
expert on Ridebacks,

369
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,791
do you truly believe this to
be the talent of the rider

370
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,375
or is it the performance
of the machine?

371
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,625
The police are said to be
finalizing plans to put

372
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,500
their own counter-terrorist
models into the field.

373
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,958
So, how does yesterday
factor into that?

374
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,458
Ah...

375
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,208
The White Riders, which is
what the police RideBacks are

376
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,916
being called--bear no
comparison to the vehicles

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,750
the terrorists have used
in their recent attacks.

378
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,666
Theirs are just standard,
off-the-lot RideBacks...

379
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,500
I don't think yesterday
changes anything.

380
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,666
Maybe you could explain
what a RideBack is

381
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,750
for folks at home
who don't know.

382
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,250
Gladly, a Rideback...

383
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,625
To put it in lamens terms,
is a type of hybrid,

384
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,125
a cross between a robot
and a motorcycle.

385
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,625
You're sure she's the one?

386
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,375
Somebody else fired the missile
at my forces, obviously,...

387
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,666
but that little girl did most of
the escaping all by herself...

388
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,791
Hate them though you may,

389
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,000
Ridebacks are something
to be admired.

390
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,458
Colonel...

391
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,791
we should go.

392
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,875
Ah, yes...

393
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,458
There was a big tournament...

394
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,291
I understand your sister won,
for the second year in a row.

395
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,166
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

396
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,458
I didn't want to waste
your time with family trivia.

397
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,208
She's no amateur,
that's for sure.

398
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,500
Perhaps your sister

399
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,250
taught that girl all those
impressive moves...

400
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
I hope that's all it is.

401
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,208
You keep secrets from me
at your own peril.

402
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,625
Sorry--it's still classified.

403
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,875
Rest assured, your people will
get a copy of this later on.

404
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,750
Once again, here's
our exclusive video

405
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,916
of the mysterious
RideBack girl.

406
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,750
"The mysterious
RideBack girl"...

407
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,291
Hmm...

408
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,583
I must be crazy.

409
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,125
Why did I just
charge in like that?

410
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,208
Did I need to save
Shouko that badly...?

411
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,000
No...

412
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,583
I did it to feel the adrenaline
buzzing through me...

413
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
What happened to
the person I was?

414
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,291
It looks heavy as hell
on these schematics.

415
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,833
It doesn't make any sense.

416
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,875
No, the body's titanium, and
the stems are high-tensile...

417
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,000
These babies are gonna be fast.

418
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,208
What about weaponry?

419
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't see any room
for any kind of heat.

420
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,916
Oh, they're
packing all right...

421
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,708
Think we can beat these things?

422
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,291
They can improve their
machines in every

423
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,666
possible way it
doesn't matter...

424
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,625
Until they ride
with souls unfettered,

425
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,666
victory will ever
elude their grasp.

426
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,375
I shall educate them...

427
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,958
In the way RideBacks
are meant to fight.

428
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:36,166
Don't you sweat it, Rin--nobody
knows it was you in that video!

429
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,666
They should just let it
go--you're the victim here!

430
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,500
The club...

431
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,541
No...

432
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,166
I alone will
protect you--I swear!

433
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,875
Haruki...

434
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,250
Rin went home already!

435
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,041
Of coooourse...!
