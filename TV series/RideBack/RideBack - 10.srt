1
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,833
This is Private
First Class Robert.

2
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:30,250
He served under Kallenbach
during the Battle of Arizona.

3
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,458
He's been unresponsive
to my questions.

4
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,000
Catatonic,
or something like that.

5
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,958
He would have been
a perfect witness.

6
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,708
Don't fall back, we
have to hold the line...

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,333
I wondered why they let me
in here with so little fuss...

8
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,166
Shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up...

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,458
I'll try again tomorrow,
see if he remembers working

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,500
at Hesner Incorporated...

11
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,750
Don't hold your breath.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,041
So much for our witness...

13
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,125
Basically...

14
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,291
But the fact they
let her try at all

15
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,166
betrays something significant...

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,333
 She got in without a fight...

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,791
If any evidence still exists,

18
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,291
they're sure we're not
going to find it...

19
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,583
You know...

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,583
Colonel Kallenbach may
have won this battle

21
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,375
before we even knew
to take the field.

22
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Hey, new guy--we're
off at the next stop.

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,708
Thanks.

24
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,083
Using a proprietary OS,
are we?

25
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,916
There's no place left
to hide, is there?

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,208
Okakura's gonna
figure something out.

27
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,041
White Riders could
roll up here any minute.

28
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,125
Maybe...

29
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,833
I should turn myself in.

30
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,708
No, Rin...

31
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,125
Hell no...

32
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,250
Have you forgotten that they're
bloodthirsty murderers?

33
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,750
'Cause I sure haven't...

34
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,750
My father and brother hate
the GGP, and with good reason.

35
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,416
They're not getting
you--not on my watch.

36
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,333
Listen up, guys--from
here, we're gonna march

37
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,166
to Peace Memorial Park.

38
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,791
If you're taking
your RideBack over,

39
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,750
make sure you sign
the list first, okay?

40
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, hang a right--you
can park over there.

41
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,958
Man, why're these guys
jumping the gun so bad?

42
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,375
What did you expect, dude?

43
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,541
Why wait until the cops've
jacked all our RideBacks

44
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,375
to protest the fact they've
started impounding 'em...?

45
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,166
Folks need to see RideBacks
are nothing to be afraid of.

46
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,666
Just leave it to me!

47
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,208
I'm gonna prove Rin
is innocent and show

48
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,291
how awesome RideBacks are!

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,083
Fair enough, but if
they take Balon away,

50
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,083
you're gonna owe us
a boat load of cash!

51
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:41,708
Huh?

52
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,500
That's not fair!

53
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,916
Don't go bonkers out there and
you won't have to--just keep it

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,708
nice and chill like
we talked about, yeah?

55
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,250
Got it!

56
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,375
Whatcha holding?

57
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,625
Don't laugh...!

58
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,208
It's my new good-luck
charm!--it's a picture

59
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,333
of Rin dancing
that Shouko gave me.

60
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,666
We've got a really good
turnout today, you guys...!

61
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,416
We're going to keep this
nice and organized!

62
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,541
What's in the back?

63
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,833
Just some artwork, sir.

64
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,166
A permit, huh?

65
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,541
I'll be back.

66
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:23,916
That...

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,291
permit's gonna
do the trick...

68
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,208
isn't it?

69
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,458
Hope so.

70
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,166
Hey you...!

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,166
Open it up!

72
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,250
Damn.

73
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,208
What're you waiting for?

74
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,291
Get back here!

75
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,750
And we're screwed.

76
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,208
Guys, the permit's good...

77
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,875
They're clear to go through.

78
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,458
Sorry for the delay!

79
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,500
Man...

80
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,083
Your dad is
a political pimp...

81
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,041
He's got some bomb-ass clout.

82
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,416
All clear.

83
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,708
This seems awfully risky...

84
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,333
Are you sure this
is going to work?

85
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,875
What, hiding you
in the city...?

86
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,833
It's like hiding a tree in
the woods--who's gonna notice?

87
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,916
Anyway,.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,458
You wanna see
the others, don't ya?

89
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
The others?

90
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,916
The RideBack crowd is holding an
anti-GGP rally in town today.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,125
We're gonna meet up with 'em
after the shouting's done.

92
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,333
Is Shouko there?

93
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,291
She's isn't marching
in the protest,.

94
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,666
but she's gonna
swing by later.

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
They left ya a message.

96
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,125
Cool, go for it!

97
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,666
Glad you're okay, Rin...!

98
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,708
'Cause if anything happened
to you, I'd totally fall apart!

99
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,083
--Squeeze in, Shouko!

100
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:29,750
Hey...!

101
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,625
What's up...?!

102
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,208
I'm doing pretty good...!

103
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,833
Since we got your message,
I've been way less worried...!

104
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,166
When are you coming home?

105
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,375
We're gonna e-mail this,

106
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,791
so we gotta keep it
kinda short, ladies...

107
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,000
Sup!

108
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,791
I've been practicing
on Balon all the time!

109
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,208
Maybe when you get back,
we could, like, ride together?!

110
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,291
There--I said it!

111
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,541
What is this, 
a video slumber-party--?

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,416
Oh.

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,375
You, guys...

114
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,791
you're the best.

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,458
Our intel suggests the
BMA's next target will be

116
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,166
a government office or major
public transportation hub...

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,000
Surveillance teams have been
dispatched to those areas...

118
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,000
We need as many eyes
on the ground as possible,

119
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,500
so we've notified
the police, as well...

120
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,625
And White Riders
are canvassing the city.

121
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,791
On a related note,
it's come to our attention

122
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,000
that Parliament member Nanpuu
Katowka has lent his support

123
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,666
to anti-GGP activities.

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,208
Under the Anti-Terrorism Act,
we can arrest him, but...

125
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,583
well...

126
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,458
You see...

127
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,875
Colonel Kallenbach...

128
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,166
You do know the traitor's son
is Ryuunosuke Katowka.

129
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,625
All the more reason to act.

130
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,166
So what are we up against?

131
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,291
The military designed
their information network

132
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,500
to be a totally
cloistered system...

133
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,708
No way of taking it down
from the outside.

134
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,916
Talk about suicide.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,625
We might as well pack up
if we can't disable

136
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,208
their security systems.

137
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,833
I don't think Goblin
was done speaking yet.

138
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,083
Their network design is
unique, but it's based on

139
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,416
the Harvard configuration,
or at least some of it is...

140
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,625
We can't just
kick down the firewall.

141
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,500
What we can do is confuse
the hell out of the system.

142
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,333
We route connection requests
through third-party

143
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,583
zombie terminals,
then we flood their system

144
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,291
with teardrop packets--a classic
denial-of-service attack.

145
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,000
It's going to
take some time, though.

146
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,041
Level with me...

147
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,875
What do you really plan to
accomplish with this attack?

148
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,208
Conscience, Goblin...?

149
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,041
It's a little late for that.

150
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,708
Fine, on account
of our history.

151
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,500
Yes, I have other motives.

152
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,750
Winning isn't
enough for you, Kiefer?

153
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,666
I fully intend to win...

154
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,125
But I'm not simple minded.

155
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,875
All who join the
BMA do so because

156
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,375
it furthers their own agenda.

157
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,125
Doesn't take a psychic
to know your agenda...

158
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,500
I hate him, too...

159
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,208
His actions are unforgivable.

160
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,333
My vendetta was forged in the
flames of that missile site

161
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,541
as he abandoned
us to our fate...

162
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,041
I swore his betrayal
would not be the end of me.

163
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,750
Once I've destroyed
everything he holds dear,

164
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,708
Kallenbach shall die.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,666
Speaking of agendas...

166
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,750
Why did you create Fuego?

167
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,083
It...

168
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,958
reminds me of every life
I took on the battlefield.

169
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
I wasn't looking for a Rin.

170
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,416
Yes, but you found one.

171
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
And...

172
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,166
thanks to you, that girl's been
made privy to her true nature...

173
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,375
She's happiest twirling
among bullets and flame.

174
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,166
She's a 19 year old girl,
Kiefer...

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,166
What've we condemned her to?

176
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,625
You know...

177
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,625
I wonder how it got
to this point.

178
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,291
What if I hadn't broken through
the blockade that day...

179
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,583
Had enough of RideBacks, eh?

180
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,958
No, it's nothing like that...

181
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,333
I just wish I could go riding
around on one without making

182
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,583
the six o'clock news
or getting arrested.

183
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,083
You ever dance over there,
at the Third National Theater?

184
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,583
Personally, I think that
place is way more your style.

185
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,500
I did, but those days
are behind me now.

186
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,416
Suck it up...!

187
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,125
You hurt yourself, big deal...

188
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,750
Maybe you won't
be the best ballerina

189
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,791
in the history of
the universe anymore...

190
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,166
but that doesn't mean
you just throw in the towel.

191
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,458
Gonna give up on Fuego?

192
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,625
There's no way I can
force you to ride her...

193
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,041
But like it or not, this
is your EW Band and you're

194
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,583
part of our club, dammit...

195
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,791
Learn to deal and move on
because quitting the club

196
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,375
just isn't an option, Rin.

197
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,458
I guess it isn't.

198
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,000
We want the GGP out of Japan!

199
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,416
When do we want it, guys?!

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,041
Right now!

201
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,458
That's right!

202
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,500
This crowd is freakin'
huge, man--Hopefully,

203
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,166
it'll make the cops
think twice about trying

204
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,708
to bust any heads, you know?

205
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,958
Hey, yo, Suzuri...

206
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,250
You cool up there?

207
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,500
I chilled out--cantcha tell?

208
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,708
I can tell you're not
flopping around...

209
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,250
Uh, what's the matter?

210
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,125
Whoa...

211
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,958
The Third National Theater...

212
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,416
Rin used to dance there,
back in the day.

213
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,333
Dang...

214
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,583
Look at the size
of that place...

215
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,208
Just between us, I'd rather
see Rin doing her thing

216
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,583
on stage than zipping
around on a RideBack...

217
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,166
But!

218
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,041
I couldn't tell her that--oh,
she would hate my guts for sure!

219
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:25,541
Huh...

220
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,583
Really?

221
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,916
I can't just be, like,

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,750
"Hey, that thing you used
to do was way awesomer!"

223
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,208
Maybe...

224
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,458
I didn't know Rin back
when she was a dancer,

225
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,333
but I betcha it's her
ballet skills that make her

226
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
so awesome with Fuego.

227
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,833
If ballet helped with riding,

228
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,083
maybe Ridebacks could
help her with dancing.

229
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,666
Makes sense,
when you think about it.

230
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,083
She just needs to get back
in the saddle, right?

231
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,500
Uh-huh...

232
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,958
Seems like she'd rock at
whatever she puts her mind to.

233
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,083
After Rin hurt herself,
she probably didn't think

234
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,083
too much before up
and quitting ballet...

235
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,208
In my experience, when
stuff like that goes down,

236
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,666
it's friend's job to
get them out of their head.

237
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,541
You and Shouko
are her best friends...

238
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,791
Give it a try!

239
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,333
Dude's got a point...

240
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,875
Sometimes ya gotta bust out
the tough love to be a pal...

241
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,291
Like Haruki--I'm older, but
he's always bossing me around.

242
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,708
Its too soon for friendship!

243
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,041
I'm just her biggest fan,
nothing else!

244
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,666
Whad'ya mean, "too soon?" It's
not like there's a rulebook!

245
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,666
Exactly...

246
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,458
Go for it...

247
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,750
From where we're standing,

248
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,666
this looks like the
perfect time to speak up!

249
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,625
Hey, you up there--you're
the RideBack girl, aren'tcha?

250
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,458
Huh?

251
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,125
Yeah--that's her, isn't it?

252
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,458
Calm down, you guys...!

253
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,875
I am so not her!

254
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,708
I'm a big fan!

255
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,958
Are you really her?

256
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,416
I'd love to tell you I am--

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,875
See?!

258
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:35,500
I knew it!

259
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,000
Hey...!

260
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,208
The RideBack girl came to
the demonstration, everybody!

261
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,000
For real?!

262
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:41,875
Awesome...!

263
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,250
Where is she?!

264
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,666
No, wait!

265
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,333
C'mon!

266
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,625
I...!

267
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,250
Thanks for taking us
as far as you did.

268
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,416
Come on, Rin.

269
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,125
Parliament member Nanpuu
Kataoka has been taken

270
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,333
into custody just moments ago.

271
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,791
The GGP allege that
Kataoka has lent support

272
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,250
to a terrorist organization,
and are detaining him

273
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,833
in his hospital room in lieu
of jail, citing his condition.

274
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,500
Simply put, Colonel,
any combat vet who tries

275
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,125
to go head-to-head with the
Grimoire isn't going to live

276
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
long enough to rue his mistake.

277
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,958
We'll have a chance
to test your confidence

278
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,083
in the Grimoire soon enough.

279
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,458
A white RideBack...?!

280
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,916
The protest is still going...?

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,625
Let's make some noise, people!

282
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,875
We gotta show
the GGP we mean business!

283
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,375
I can't believe the RideBack
girl is out in public...!

284
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,875
That's the BMA chick
from the blockade?

285
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,291
Wow, she's taking a risk...!

286
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,083
She looks like she's
cutting class to be here...

287
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh, crap...

288
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,916
It's Suzuri-mania.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,958
Let's head out soon.

290
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,750
Still gotta meet up
with everybody.

291
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,083
Attention passengers.

292
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,041
This train will stop
for five additional minutes

293
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,291
to allow for a mandatory GGP
counter-terrorism inspection.

294
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,083
Your safety and comfort
are our top priorities.

295
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,291
Sweating yet?

296
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,916
We apologize for the delay.

297
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,291
We're gonna be safe
with the others, aren't we?

298
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,708
Hey...

299
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,375
You should check on
the old man...

300
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,750
I can hold down the fort.

301
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,041
No, we need
to observe the protest.

302
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,875
Mr. Kataoka, the boss
is asking for you.

303
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,458
RideBack girl's here--what
do you pigs think of that?!

304
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,333
We're not afraid
of you damn fascists!

305
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,375
You tell 'em, man!

306
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,125
YEAH!

307
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,500
Suzuri...!

308
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,333
It's time to go now...!

309
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,250
Oh, dangit...

310
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,416
She can't hear me at all!

311
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,291
Haruki... look.

312
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,208
White Riders?!

313
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,208
The GGP's here, too.

314
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,708
That's bad, right?

315
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,541
Headquarters is saying we've
got a fugitive in the crowd

316
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,916
on a RideBack, one Rin Ogata.

317
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,625
Is that her?

318
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,708
Attention all units: there's
a wanted criminal in there,

319
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,083
thumbing her nose at us.

320
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,500
She's on RideBack.

321
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,125
Beat the hell out of a cop
with one a few nights ago.

322
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,083
Look sharp.

323
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,416
Roger.

324
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
Did you see that?

325
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,500
Those bastards
better not roll in here!

326
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,875
Get the hell out
of our country, you thugs!

327
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,625
You're not the boss
of us, dammit!

328
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,875
Should we run or what?!

329
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,333
They're coming!

330
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,458
That concludes the
anti-terror inspection.

331
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,291
Thank you for your patience.

332
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,333
First your sister, now your
father--it must be tough.

333
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,583
Why'd you come here?

334
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,833
Have you looked
into Kallenbach's past?

335
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,541
The GGP is evolving...

336
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,041
Warmongers like the Colonel
are fast becoming a liability.

337
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,750
And your point is?

338
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,458
We can get your father
out of this little fix...

339
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,625
Which is why...

340
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,500
you're going to do
something nice for me.

341
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,833
Hesner Incorporated...

342
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,041
You're going to expose them.

343
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,875
Who do you think you are?.

344
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,500
You presume to threaten me?

345
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,083
Not at all...

346
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,958
Keeping the audience interested
requires a change in regime...

347
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,041
All I ask is that
you simply hit your marks

348
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,250
and recite your lines.

349
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,083
I'd love to have you on board.

350
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,250
Wait--they can't do that?!

351
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,458
Oh my God!

352
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,750
We gotta get outta here!

353
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,791
Yeah, no kidding.

354
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,333
Just run!

355
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,708
Suzuri...!

356
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,916
Get outta there!

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,541
What, Haruki?

358
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,583
Why's she leaving the park?!

359
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,166
Rin Ogata is fleeing the scene.

360
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,791
Vehicle One, get out there
and bring her in.

361
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,083
Ten-four.

362
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,250
Awesome...!

363
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,083
Rin and Tamayo are here!

364
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,666
Suzuri...?!

365
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Hey, Rin!

366
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,708
I'm on her six--Rider Two,
cut around and box her in!

367
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,041
Roger!

368
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,583
Idiot!

369
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,250
They're after you...! Suzuri!

370
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,375
Balon?

371
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,958
Wait--Suzuri?

372
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,833
Oh my God!

373
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,958
Crap, they're trying
to cut her off!

374
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,666
Suzuri!

375
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,041
Just stop!

376
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:16,833
Hey, Rin...!

377
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,916
Listen...!

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,791
You need to start
dancing again...!

379
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,500
I wanna see you happy...!

380
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,125
you're my bestfriend!

381
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:23,916
Tamayo...!

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
What is she saying?!

383
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,166
I've got a surprise
for you, Rin!

384
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,583
While you were gone, I've been
practicing like crazy...!

385
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,625
And I can jump now, too!

386
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,791
No way...

387
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,875
Oh my God...!

388
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,166
Please, No...!

389
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,416
No...

390
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,791
This...

391
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,708
isn't real...

392
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,416
None of this...

393
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,333
is happening...

394
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,208
It's a dream...

395
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,208
a bad dream...

396
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,583
I, I'm gonna wake up...

397
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,083
and Suzuri's,
gonna be fine, she's...!

398
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,958
She's not gonna be...

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,791
Nooooooooo!

400
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah...

401
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,083
Understood...

402
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,833
Thanks for everything...

403
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,708
I'll call you later on, kay?

404
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,791
They...

405
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,750
murdered her...

406
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,541
--I know.
--That's... all you can say?!

407
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,208
I wish you never would have
made this horrible thing...!

408
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,541
Then Suzuri would...

409
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,750
Suzuri'd be fine...!

410
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,750
She wouldn't be dead!

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
Leave him.

412
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,000
We killed her...

413
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,958
With a RideBack...

414
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,291
With our mistakes...

415
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,625
She died...

416
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,875
because of
the things we've done!
