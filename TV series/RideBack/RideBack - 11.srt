1
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,666
My mother danced with a radiance
that captivated audiences...

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,000
Their attention granted
her form and focus,.

3
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,083
In return, she let them
bathe in her luminescence.

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,750
She was the stuff of legend,
a treasure of the stage...

5
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,375
Watching, not daring to blink,
I followed her path--

6
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,583
chasing that sacred
fire I was lacking...

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,291
I wanted so badly
to be like her.

8
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,333
It seemed easier
than being me.

9
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,958
But then, when the curtain
came crashing down...

10
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,166
When I awoke from the dream,
and life forced me

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,875
to live as Rin Ogata...

12
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,375
Shouko was there for me...

13
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,458
Never without
that smile of hers...

14
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,833
She shared her spark,
and I cherished it.

15
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,375
It was all I had,
until Fuego.

16
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,125
I danced through the sky,
my heart fit to burst.

17
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,375
My legs had failed me,
but with her wheels,

18
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,958
I could take flight again.

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,333
That freedom...

20
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,458
came at a heavy price.

21
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,333
My greed has hurt people
I've never even met...

22
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,833
all but destroyed my family...

23
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,000
and led to a dear friend
dying in my place.

24
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,541
We attack the tyrant
in his lair tomorrow...

25
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,541
Take the field with me.

26
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,500
Their pawns are
no match for my knights,

27
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,375
but having a strong queen
on the board never hurt.

28
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,375
The game doesn't
appeal to you...?

29
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,458
Will you flee...

30
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,458
as Goblin did long ago...?

31
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,083
Always running, waiting for
that night when they finally

32
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,500
kick your door in, and secretly
relieved when they do?

33
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Have you any idea
what you want to do, Rin...?

34
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,375
Run for it?

35
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,958
Mourn your dead?

36
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,250
Make your enemy bleed?

37
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,458
You love RideBacks so much,
but you don't give a damn

38
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,041
about anybody,
you make me sick!

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,666
Letting emotions
enslave you is not a virtue.

40
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,291
Suzuri was killed because
they thought she was me...!

41
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,083
Her blood is on my hands!

42
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,375
Fine--do as you will.

43
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,291
Without a rider
to lend it strength,

44
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,041
a RideBack is mere scrap metal.

45
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,291
If you would let your
talent wither on the vine,

46
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,041
then you're unworthy
of the freedom

47
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,541
these machines can grant...

48
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,208
Get out.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We...

50
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,416
can't even get
flowers for her?

51
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,958
I think...

52
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,291
Suzuri would understand.

53
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,666
They're gone...

54
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,458
We're all that's left.

55
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,541
Come on...

56
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,583
Let's get you
out of this rain.

57
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,458
You sure the
phone's not tapped?

58
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,083
I'm taking a big risk here.

59
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,416
Yes, it's clean...

60
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,666
I checked it myself.

61
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,625
Have you looked
through that paperwork?

62
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,791
Oh yeah...

63
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,291
I confirmed Hesner
landed a juicy contract

64
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,333
for a new military vehicle,
but the plug got pulled on it

65
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,000
at the last second.

66
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,416
GGP and Hesner
pulled a fast one...

67
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Somebody used
connections to force

68
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,708
the order of White Riders...

69
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,500
Looks like the big
whigs wanted insure

70
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,708
they didn't leave empty handed.

71
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,125
All well and good...

72
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,291
but a whole lot of money
changed hands in the process.

73
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,708
And...

74
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,666
without proof, we're up
a creek without a paddle...

75
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,791
I'm leaving that to you guys.

76
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,083
We already have
all the proof we'll need.

77
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,250
All that's left for us
to figure out...

78
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,875
is how they're going
to react when everything

79
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,750
is out in the open.

80
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,041
Hey...

81
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,875
Are you positive
we can trust these guys?

82
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,750
They should do
as they're told...

83
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,916
Just trust me on this, okay?

84
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,500
How's she doing?

85
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,458
Hanging in there...

86
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,458
Acts like she is, at least...

87
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,541
Inside, who knows?

88
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,458
"Anything you need, just name
it," I told her, and she said...

89
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,916
"Flowers...

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,083
for Suzuri."

91
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,125
Hey, why won't you
come with us?

92
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,166
Once we're outta here,
we'll be set.

93
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,416
I got a few contacts that
could help us out, you know?

94
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,250
I promised that I'd protect her,
but you have to now.

95
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,291
Yeah, I know.

96
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,791
Idiot.

97
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,291
Geez, Rin--you're
soaking wet...!

98
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,875
It's not safe out
there--you can't just--

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,541
I see...

100
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,208
Come on in.

101
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,333
It's quiet out there...

102
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,708
I don't like it.

103
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,875
They've closed off all
access points into the city.

104
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,041
But, with roads being so empty,
we'll have our run of the place.

105
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,416
What'll we do if
they attack us first...?

106
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,291
We don't have a Plan B.

107
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,625
Not likely.

108
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,708
Kallenbach would never
kill me in my bed, as it were.

109
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,375
He needs to feel like
he's finally bested me...

110
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,625
He'll cut me down from
a RideBack, or not at all.

111
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,916
The two of us have unfinished
business from Arizona.

112
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,833
He won't fire until he sees
the whites of my eyes...

113
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,666
A fatal mistake...

114
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,625
Romanov's time is at an end.

115
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,458
Be careful out there, man.

116
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,333
Thanks--Gonna need it.

117
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,916
Never really was any good
at big, teary goodbyes.

118
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,791
Good thing I'm heading out on
that chopper with you tomorrow.

119
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,833
I'm sorry for...

120
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,750
Getting you
mixed up in all this.

121
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,041
Hey, don't beat
yourself up about it...

122
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,250
The choice was mine
to make after all.

123
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,083
So...

124
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,750
your mom...

125
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,166
She was a famous dancer, right?

126
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,250
The one and only Yuki Ogata.

127
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,416
I tried so hard to be her.

128
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,833
Performing at her level
was all I ever wanted to do...

129
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,500
Any chance of that disappeared
the second I got hurt...

130
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,583
I simply sat back and watched as
my one goal in life faded away.

131
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,333
It was like,.

132
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,333
a giant weight had been
lifted from my shoulders.

133
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,666
I didn't have to live in
the shadow of my mother anymore.

134
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,666
Being one of her fans
would have been enough for me...

135
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,958
I'd given up.

136
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,041
But then Fuego showed up...

137
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,083
and I was so sure
I could dance again...

138
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,666
God, what was I thinking...?

139
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,416
Stop, Rin.

140
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,291
I joined your club...

141
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,083
and made such
wonderful friends...

142
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,666
Now look at us...

143
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,041
This is all my fault.

144
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,333
Why do all of my dreams
come crashing to the ground

145
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,500
just when I start
believing in them...?

146
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,208
Whenever I find
something precious,

147
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,250
life snatches it away from me.

148
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,041
I don't care if
I have to shuffle through

149
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,833
the rest of
my life in a fog...!

150
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,583
But I can't
lose anything else!

151
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,083
You be careful out there...

152
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,583
And remember to
take care of each other.

153
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,666
We'll do our best.

154
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,958
Rin...

155
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,583
I'm so sorry.

156
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,583
Be safe, dummy.

157
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,000
What was she
saying that day...

158
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,041
Before...

159
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,708
Right before she...

160
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,500
The monorail was so loud
I couldn't hear her...

161
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,000
but she definitely
said something.

162
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,791
 What was she trying to say?

163
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,041
Suzuri really wanted to
see you dance again, you know.

164
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,041
Haruki felt
compelled to tell me...

165
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,333
Wasn't gonna say anything...

166
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,833
But she let it slip to
the boys during the protest.

167
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,166
I guess she thought
it would hurt you

168
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,416
or piss you off
or something...

169
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
so she never brought it up.

170
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,916
Oh, Suzuri...

171
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,208
Unit H-5 reporting in!

172
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
We've got a visual on
an armed band of RideBacks

173
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,041
coming up northwest
of the base!

174
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,833
We've IDed the leader near the
head of the pack--they're BMA!

175
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,666
Orders, sir?

176
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,208
Leave 'em be, soldier...

177
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,708
I'll go lay out
the welcome mat.

178
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,666
Huh?

179
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,833
What the hell...?!

180
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,416
I'm gonna be good and pissed if
that chopper is running late.

181
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,250
Calm down, Princess--it's
already on the roof.

182
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,083
--It's called a RideBack.
--Why the sudden interest,

183
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,375
Don't tell me, you're thinking
about picking up riding?

184
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
Girl's got some crazy skills!

185
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,791
You can ride again
if you really want to.

186
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,125
Its fire.

187
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,625
That's what "Fuego" means
in the Spanish language.

188
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,000
I promise I'll protect you.

189
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,125
Do you have any regrets?

190
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,750
I know the club's
important to you...

191
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
Its nice to see you
excited like this again.

192
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,958
Listen...!

193
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,750
You need to start
dancing again...!

194
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,000
I wanna see you happy!

195
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,083
Rin, honey...

196
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,125
are you nervous?

197
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,166
Yeah.

198
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,625
Let your heart guide you.

199
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,333
Trust me, it knows
the choreography.

200
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,666
Take the stage
and make it welcome you.

201
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,708
C'mon.

202
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,625
 What are you doing?

203
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm sorry, Tamayo--
I have to stay here.

204
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,916
Don't even think of
leaving without us!

205
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,250
What are you doing...?!

206
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,458
We gotta go!

207
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,000
What the..?!

208
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,125
This is Vehicle Two.

209
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,125
We've neutralized
a helicopter on a rooftop

210
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,291
in the west district...

211
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,416
Commencing
forward assault, over.

212
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,791
What was that sound?!

213
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
What's going on in here...?

214
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,666
Rin--come on!

215
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,416
We gotta go!

216
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,791
You okay, Tamayo?!

217
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,708
Never better...!

218
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,708
The RideBacks are two klicks
from our front gate and closing.

219
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,208
Status report!

220
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,666
Computer anomaly, Colonel!

221
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,000
Someone's wreaking havoc
on our network!

222
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,333
System live in three, two...

223
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,958
Blips on the NRS radar...!

224
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,208
They're missiles...!

225
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,375
They're too close, sir--
The AA guns are useless!

226
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,750
Hacking our system
is impossible!

227
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,791
It's Goblin...!

228
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,291
What the hell is going on?!

229
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,125
How long I've waited for this.

230
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:20,833
Gatobu!

231
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,125
Send them to hell!

232
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,625
Yessir!

233
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,958
The Grimoires have secured
the first floor, sir...

234
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,083
Remaining enemy forces
are dug in.

235
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,708
Entering now to take 'em out.

236
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,166
Two female terrorists
are fleeing the building

237
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,458
on RideBack!

238
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,833
No...

239
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,791
Tearing through wind
and flame alike...

240
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,291
the crimson metal
steed pauses...

241
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,458
to bathe its hero
in the righteous light.

242
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,916
Next time,
the final episode:...

243
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,750
"To the Lighted Stage."
