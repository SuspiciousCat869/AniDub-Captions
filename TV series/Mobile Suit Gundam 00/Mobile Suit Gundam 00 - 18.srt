(Blast)

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,057
(Weapons blasting)

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,730
(Boom)

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,358
(Rapid blasting)

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,202
(Boom)

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,293
(Slash)

8
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,044
(Boom)

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,509
(Fire raging)

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,094
(Gasping for air)

11
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,561
THAT THING'S A...
THAT THING'S A DEMON!

12
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,438
(Boom)

13
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,483
(Nena laughing)

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,151
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,990
(Laughing)

16
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,704
Lockon:
THIS MAKES IT THEIR SEVENTH
ARMED INTERVENTION.

17
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,832
THEY KEEP ATTACKING MILITARY
BASES FOR NO GOOD REASON.

18
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,875
AND THEY'RE
ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATING THEM.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,919
NOT TO SOUND LIKE
ALLELUJAH,

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,005
BUT IT'S AS IF I CAN HEAR
ALL THE EVILS OF THE WORLD.

21
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,506
HEARD ANYTHING
FROM PTOLEMY?

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,133
REMAIN ON STANDBY.

23
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,884
THANKS TO THOSE GUYS
OUR OPERATION PLAN

24
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,636
HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY RUINED.

25
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,555
I ASSUME MISS SUMERAGI

26
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,349
IS FURIOUSLY ALTERING
ALL HER MISSION PLANS.

27
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,727
IS THIS THE KIND OF THING
GUNDAMS SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,104

President Stegmeyer:
SO, IT WAS ITALY
THIS TIME.

35
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
AND AGAIN, IT WAS
THE THREE NEW GUNDAMS

36
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,409
THAT PERFORMED
THE ATTACK.

37
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,370
MR. PRESIDENT...THE
INTERVENTIONS OF THE NEW MODELS

38
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,415
ARE CLEARLY DIFFERENT IN NATURE
FROM THE PREVIOUS ONES.

39
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,668
DARING TO COME TOGETHER IN A
LARGE JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE

40
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,129
MUST HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE
WRATH OF THE GUNDAMS.

41
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,715
Official #2C:
THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH
CELESTIAL BEING ON OUR OWN.

42
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,468
OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN
OUR TIES WITH THE OTHER BLOCS.

43
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,512
AND YOU THINK THAT WILL
HELP US DEFEAT THE GUNDAMS?

44
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,556
Official #2A:
WELL THEN WHAT DO
YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

45
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,436
IS THERE NOTHING WE
CAN DO TO STOP THEM?

46
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,770
Peries:
COLONEL...

47
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,522
DO YOU THINK THE GUNDAMS
WILL LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON US

48
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,898
UP HERE AS WELL?

49
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,650
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY.

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,069
I'D EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE
SUCH ACTIONS

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,779
IF THEIR GOAL
IS TO DESTROY THE WORLD.

52
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,410
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NEW GUNDAMS?

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,370
EVEN YOU, AN OBSERVER?

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,789
MY INFORMATION IS LIMITED

55
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,500
ACCORDING TO MY ACCESS
LEVEL AS SET BY VEDA.

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,003
THEIR TEAM NAME IS
TRINITY.

57
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,589
THEIR MACHINES ARE
CALLED GUNDAM THRONES.

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,300
AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS
I KNOW ABOUT THEM.

59
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,760
THIS IS JUST MY
PERSONAL OPINION...

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,388
BUT I THINK THEIR
ACTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT EXTREME.

61
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,681
SO TELL ME THEN,

62
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,475
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT THE EXISTENCE

63
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,602
OF THE TRINITYS IS ALSO
PART OF OUR ORIGINAL PLAN?

64
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,730
THAT'S A REASONABLE CONCLUSION
GIVEN THE FACTS.

65
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,274
AFTER ALL, THEY ARE IN
POSSESSION

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,318
OF MOBILE
WEAPONS CALLED GUNDAMS.

67
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,154
Ian:
ABOUT THOSE THRONES...

68
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,072
THEIR SYSTEMS
AND ARMOR

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,158
USE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY
THAT OURS DO.

70
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,910
SO THEY'RE
OF THE SAME TYPE.

71
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,162
BUT THEIR GN DRIVES
ARE DIFFERENT.

72
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,873
THEIR SOLAR REACTORS
ARE DIFFERENT?

73
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,833
WELL, THEY'RE
FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL...

74
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,628
BUT THE REACTOR CORE
DOESN'T USE A TD BLANKET.

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,631
THUS THE OPERATING TIME OF
THE DRIVE ITSELF IS LIMITED.

76
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,342
Ian:
IN OTHER WORDS, THESE ARE
PSEUDO SOLAR REACTORS.

77
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,762
SO, THIS IS A CASE WHERE
SOMEONE STOLE CELESTIAL BEING'S

78
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,680
TECHNOLOGY AND THEN BUILT
THEIR OWN GUNDAMS?

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,015
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

80
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,184
THE BLUEPRINTS FOR THE
SOLAR REACTORS

81
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,353
CAN ONLY BE FOUND
IN VEDA'S DATABANKS.

82
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,479
WHICH MEANS...

83
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,814
ARE YOU SAYING
SOMEONE

84
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,232
ACTUALLY HACKED
THEIR WAY INTO VEDA?

85
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,441
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

86
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,567
CHRIS...

87
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,861
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN ABSOLUTE.

88
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,030
EVEN IF IT WAS TRUE...

89
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,991
IT TAKES QUITE A LOT OF TIME TO
BUILD A SOLAR REACTOR.

90
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,702
WELL, AT THE VERY LEAST, IT
MEANS WE HAVE A TRAITOR

91
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,204
SOMEWHERE IN THE
ORGANIZATION.

92
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,540
SO IT WOULD SEEM.

93
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,132
(Thinking):
LEVEL THREE CLEAR.
LEVEL FOUR. LEVEL FIVE.

94
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,133
(Gasps)

95
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,639
SOME OF THE DATA FROM LEVEL
SEVEN HAS BEEN ALTERED.

96
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,516
I WONDER WHAT
THIS DATA COVERS...

97
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,060
(Alarm sounds)

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,436
I'VE BEEN REJECTED?

99
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,690
BUT IT'S ME! HOW COULD
I BE DENIED ACCESS?

100
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,901
(Tieria thinking):
VEDA... WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

101
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,407
SO... WHAT DO WE
DO NOW?

102
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,284
LOOK, IF THE WORLD
ACTUALLY THINKS

103
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,703
THAT WE'RE BROTHERS IN
ARMS WITH TEAM TRINITY,

104
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,289
THEN IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO
GO ON ANY MISSIONS RIGHT NOW.

105
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,416
WE HAVE TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THEM WHILE WE LEARN

106
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,875
AS MUCH AS WE CAN
ABOUT THEM...

107
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,502
THEN WE CAN
DEVISE A RESPONSE.

108
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,504
SOUNDS LIKE A JOB
FOR WANG LIU MEI.

109
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,510
MISTRESS, THE PTOLEMAOIS
SENT US THE BIOMETRIC DATA

110
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,596
THEY GATHERED
ON THE TRINITY PILOTS...

111
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,889
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY
MATCHING INDIVIDUALS.

112
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,725
REDOUBLE YOUR EFFORTS,
PLEASE.

113
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,727
AS YOU WISH, MISTRESS.

114
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,232
THE TRINITYS' METHODS ARE
CERTAINLY RECKLESS...

115
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,235
BUT IF THE WORLD
CHANGES AS A RESULT...

116
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,112
(Whoosh)

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,952
(Birds chirping)

118
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,664
Graham:
HOWARD MASON...

119
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,166
HOWARD HAD
NOTHING BUT

120
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,043
THE GREATEST RESPECT
FOR YOU, CAPTAIN.

121
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,587
HE BELIEVED THAT
THE FLAG WAS CHOSEN

122
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,422
TO BE OUR NEXT‐GENERATION
MOBILE SUIT...

123
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,050
BECAUSE OF YOUR
EFFORTS AS A TEST PILOT, SIR.

124
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,219
THE ONLY REASON I ACCEPTED
THE ASSIGNMENT

125
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,929
TO BE THE FLAG'S
TEST PILOT WAS BECAUSE

126
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,848
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST.

127
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,893
AND THEN...IN THAT MOCK
BATTLE DURING TESTING...

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,021
THAT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
ACCIDENT, SIR!

129
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,485
CAPTAIN...HOWARD SAID
SOMETHING TO ME ONCE:

130
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,153
"IT'S THANKS
TO THE CAPTAIN

131
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,781
"THAT I WAS ABLE TO
BECOME A FLAG FIGHTER!

132
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,493
"AND NOW I GET THE CHANCE TO
FLY THE SKIES WITH HIM..."

133
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,827
I SEE.

134
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,954
SOUNDS LIKE HE LOVED
THE FLAG...

135
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,289
EVEN MORE THAN I DID.

136
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
(Sighs)

137
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,088
REST EASY, HOWARD MASON,
FOR I SWEAR THIS:

138
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,590
I, GRAHAM AKER,
WILL USE A FLAG

139
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,509
WHEN I FINALLY
DEFEAT THE GUNDAMS!

140
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,679
(Grunts)

141
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,977
(People talking)

142
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,896
SORRY FOR MAKING YOU COME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

143
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,065
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN MEETING NEAR THE BASE.

144
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,109
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHERE'S MY CASH?

145
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,654
SHOOT.

146
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,532
I HEARD YOU WERE IN THAT BIG
MILITARY EXERCISE...

147
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,534
AND THAT YOU
SAW THOSE NEW GUNDAMS

148
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,785
IN THE TAKLAMAKAN DESERT.

149
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,537
YEAH.
I SAW THEM ALRIGHT.

150
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,414
YOU ONLY SAW THEM?

151
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,749
AND I HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR
ONE OF THE PILOTS TALKING.

152
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,750
YOU HEARD THEM?

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,210
YEAH.

154
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,129
I WAS FLYING MY
REALDO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

155
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,672
ONE OF THOSE GUNDAMS
SHOT ME DOWN.

156
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,881
THEN I STUMBLED
ACROSS IT WHILE

157
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,299
I WAS WAITING TO BE
RESCUED.

158
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,342
(Gasps)

159
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,845
(Determined grunt)

160

THE PILOT HAD A HELMET ON
SO I COULDN'T SEE HER FACE...

BUT I COULD TELL IT WAS
A YOUNG GIRL

00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,988
FROM HER VOICE
AND THE SHAPE OF HER FIGURE.

00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,197
AND YOU'RE CERTAIN YOU
HEARD HER SAY

THOSE EXACT WORDS,
"NOTIFY LAGUNA"?

MIGHT HAVE MISHEARD HER...

HAVE YOU TOLD THE
MILITARY ABOUT THIS?

A REPORT ON IT.

PRICE FOR THIS INFO.

YOU TO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF

322
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,202
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

323
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,454
THE PROFESSOR WAS ON THE VERGE
OF FIGURING OUT

324
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,706
THE TRUE NATURE
OF THE GUNDAMS' ENERGY SYSTEMS

325
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,458
AND THEIR SPECIAL
PARTICLES.

326
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,878
SOMEHOW CELESTIAL BEING MUST
HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS.

327
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,296
SO THEY KILLED HIM

328
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,965
WHILE MAKING IT
LOOK LIKE AN ARMED INTERVENTION.

329
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,216
HMM.

330
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,385
YOU THINK THERE'S A
SPY IN OUR MILITARY?

331
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,303
IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO
THINK THAT THERE WASN'T ONE.

332
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,389
HMM.

333
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,852
(Alarm Sounding):
DETECTING A POSSIBLE GUNDAM AT
POINT F‐ 3988 OVER IOWA!

334
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,186
THEY'VE SPOTTED A GUNDAM!

335
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,438
THERE'S ONLY ONE POSSIBLE
TARGET AT THAT POINT...

336
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,481
(Gasps)

337
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,150
IRIS CORPORATION'S
MUNITIONS PLANT!

338
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,153
IT CAN'T BE! IT MAY BE A
WEAPONS FACTORY

339
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,155
BUT THE WORKERS
THERE ARE ALL CIVILIANS!

340
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,199
IS MY FLAG
READY FOR LAUNCH?

341
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,536
(Over radio):
THIS IS GRAHAM!
I'M TAKING THE LEAD!

342
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,329
Katagiri:
HEADING OUT ALONE
IS JUST RECKLESS!

343
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,168
SOUNDS REASONABLE, TOO BAD
I'M AN UNREASONABLE MAN!

344
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,171
(Screaming)

345
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,338
(Siren wailing)

346
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,548
(Boom)

347
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,390
HUH?

348
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,100
AN INCOMING MACHINE.

349
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,768
AND IT'S A FAST ONE...

350
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,606
SO IT IS ONE OF THE
NEW ONES!

351
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,858
(Rapid blasting)

352
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,697
HE'S GOOD!

353
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,657
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
BETTER YOUR MACHINE IS!

354
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,328
TODAY I AM BEYOND THAT!

355
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,831
I STRIKE LIKE AN
AVENGING ANGEL!

356
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,292
WHAT THE...

357
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,138
THAT'S...IMPOSSIBLE!

358
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,269
(Gasping)

359
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,481
THAT WAS FOR YOU, HOWARD.
SOME PAY BACK.

360
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,024
(Vomiting)

361
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,068
(Gasping)

362
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,696
MY BODY CAN'T TAKE
THIS MANY G'S!

363
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,951
(Waves washing on shore)

364
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,160
Lockon:
SETSUNA!

365
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,413
IT'S TEAM TRINITY.
THEY WENT AND DID IT AGAIN.

366
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,498
DID WHAT?

367
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,459
THEY HIT AN
IRIS CORPORATION FACTORY.

368
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,919
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE
DIED IN THE ATTACK.

369
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,170
(Gasps)

370
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,214
ALL THE WORKERS IN THAT
FACTORY WERE CIVILIANS.

371
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,633
IT'S NO BETTER THAN
INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM!

372
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,634
(Setsuna running)

373
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,635
HUH?

374
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,178
SETSUNA!

375
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,430
(Sumeragi thinking):
VEDA...

376
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,224
THE QUANTUM COMPUTER
PROCESSING SYSTEM

377
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,518
THAT'S THE BACKBONE
OF OUR OPERATION PLAN.

378
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,479
IN THE OFF‐CHANCE THAT
SOMEONE...

379
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,899
HAS ACTUALLY HACKED VEDA,

380
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,567
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY

381
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,486
TO CONTINUE OUR MISSIONS
WITHOUT IT.

382
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,031
THERE IS
NO WAY WE CAN DO IT.

383
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,616
(Beeping)

384
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,617
HUH?

385
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,288
IT'S FROM BILLY...

386
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,289
(Gasps)

387
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,873
NO, PROFESSOR EIFMAN
WAS KILLED!

388
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,459
AND IT WAS IN AN
ATTACK BY GUNDAMS.

389
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,211
THERE'S A PROBLEM,
MISS SUMERAGI!

390
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,879
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

391
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,465
LOUISE WAS HURT?

392
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,051
AND HE'S GOING TO
SPAIN TO BE WITH HER?

393
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,056

HEY, YOU!

399
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,450
NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAY!

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,368
(Saji panting)

00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,626
LOUISE?

403
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,754

00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,007
(Sighs)

405
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,092
I HEARD YOU
WERE IN AN ACCIDENT.

406
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,470
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO
LONG TO GET HERE.

407
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,013
BUT YOU'RE
SKIPPING SCHOOL.

408
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,306
AW, DON'T WORRY.

409
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,892
BUT WHAT A RELIEF...
YOU SEEM WELL.

410
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,353
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

411
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,898
OH, THAT'S RIGHT! I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU, LOUISE...

412
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,649
IT'S RIGHT HERE...

413
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,859
WHAT'S THAT?

(Gasps)

415
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,572
FOR ME?

(Chuckling)

417
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,451
IT'S THAT SET OF RINGS YOU
WANTED A WHILE BACK!

418
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,037
I WORKED LIKE CRAZY DURING
THE WHOLE EXAM BREAK...

419
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,747
AND I MADE
ENOUGH TO BUY THEM!

420
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,999
THEY'RE FOR YOU...
LOUISE!

421

IT'S BEAUTIFUL...

(Nervous chuckle)

423
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,766
UH LOUISE...I HAVE SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU...

424
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,809
SEE, THE MORE I
THINK OF YOU‐‐

425
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,852
I'M SO... SORRY.

HUH?

427
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,481
YOU WENT TO THE TROUBLE
OF BUYING THESE...

428
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,274
AND THEY'RE SO
BEAUTIFUL...

429
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,075
BUT I CAN'T
WEAR THIS RING.

430

I CAN'T WEAR THIS RING.

00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,325
DON'T UPSET HER.

441

I KNOW THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE
WAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

442
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,418
BUT WHEN THEY
FIGHT PEOPLE GET HURT.

443
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,044
WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO
HEAL THEIR INJURIES...

444
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,589
BUT WE CAN'T
HEAL THEIR HEARTS.

MAYBE THE FAMILY WAS
PROMOTING WAR...

Nurse #18F:
BUT THEY WERE CIVILIANS!

451
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,395
Nurse #18E:
IN THE END, IT JUST
MEANS MORE WORK FOR US.

GIVE YOU TROUBLE.

CARELESSNESS
IS THE REAL ENEMY.

I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE THAT TO HEART.

460
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,261
HUH?

461
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,472
