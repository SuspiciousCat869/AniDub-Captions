00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,547
Al‐Saachez:
IN ORDER TO
GIVE YOUR BODY TO GOD,

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,549
AND JOIN THIS HOLY WAR

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,718
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU MUST DO.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,431
AND THAT IS...

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,433
(Gunshots)

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:26,526
(Distant gunshots)

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,362
CONGRATULATIONS!

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,739
YOU HAVE NOW BEEN
ACCEPTED BY GOD

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,741
AND YOU CAN BECOME WARRIORS

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,702
PARTICIPATING
IN THIS HOLY WAR.

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,746
(Gasps)

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,248
Al‐Saachez:
(chuckles)

13
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,960
NICE MACHINE.
SHAME ABOUT THE PILOT, THOUGH!

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,711
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MR. GUNDAM?

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,546
I KNOW THAT VOICE...

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,799
YOU'RE INTERFERING
WITH MY BUSINESS!

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,176
NO...IT CAN'T BE!

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,431
Al‐Saachez:
I'VE GOT
A BONUS RIDING ON THIS!

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,808
IT IS HIM...

20
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,147
WELL, GUNDAM...YOU'RE MINE.

Narrator:
2307 AD.

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,373
THREE GROUPS OF NATIONS
HAVE CREATED

28
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,125
ORBITAL ELEVATORS AND
A SOLAR POWER GENERATION SYSTEM

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,127
GIVING HUMANITY ACCESS

30
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,464
TO A NEARLY INFINITE
SOURCE OF ENERGY.

31
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,549
HOWEVER,
THIS HAS NOT STOPPED

32
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,760
THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD
FROM FIGHTING.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,388
FOR THEIR OWN PRESTIGE
AND PROSPERITY,

34
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,348
EACH GROUP OF NATIONS
INSISTS ON PLAYING

35
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,351
A GRAND ZERO‐SUM GAME.

36
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,979
A PRIVATE ARMED ORGANIZATION,
CELESTIAL BEING,

37
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,731
TAKES ACTION
AGAINST THIS WORLD,

38
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,525
WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL

39
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,403
BEING THE ELIMINATION OF
WAR ITSELF.

40
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,947
THE FOUR GUNDAMS HAVE BEGUN
AN ARMED INTERVENTION

41
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,534
AGAINST THE
REPUBLIC OF MORALIA.

42
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,953
ON THAT BATTLEFIELD,
SETSUNA F. SEIEI

43
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,163
CONFRONTS THE AUTHOR OF
HIS DESTINY.

44
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,917
THE MAN'S NAME IS AL‐SAACHEZ.
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

45
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,630
Al‐Saachez:
(chuckles)

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,132
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D CAPTURE YOU

47
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,551
WITHOUT A LITTLE BIT
OF DAMAGE.

48
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,553
SINCE THE RIFLE DIDN'T WORK

49
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,139
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
CUT YOU UP!

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,642
HOW'S THIS?!

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,062
(Thinking):
I KNOW THAT MOVE!

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
(Grunts)

53
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,986
(Gasps)

54
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,535
HOW MANY BLADES
DO YOU HAVE?

55
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,120
YOU KNOW WHAT?!

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,122
Al‐Saachez:
(Aggressive yell)

57
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,709
I CAN SEE YOUR MOVES...
BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM!

58
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,544
(Grunts)

59
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,547
Setsuna's mother:
DON'T DO IT! SORAN!

60
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,134
WHY? WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, SORAN?

61
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:24,473
(Sobbing)

62
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,141
(Gasps)

63
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,645
(Yells angrily)

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,396
WHAT?

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,319
INCREDIBLY SHARP.

66
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,071
SO THAT'S WHAT
THE GUNDAM IS CAPABLE OF.

67
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,659
(Exia beeps)

68
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,703
Al‐Saachez:
HE'S SIGNALING ME...

69
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,122
HE'S TELLING ME TO COME
OUT OF MY COCKPIT?!

70
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,291
HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?!

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,292
HUH?

72
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,337
THE EXIA!
IT'S...!

73
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,213
WHAT?!

74
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,173
SETSUNA, WAIT!

75
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,968
Al‐Saachez:
HE'S SERIOUS!
HE'S REALLY COMING OUT.

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,470
AND LOOK AT
THE SIZE OF HIM!

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,139
THAT PILOT'S JUST A KID!

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,891
(Chuckles)

79
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,560
INTERESTING!
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING,

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,312
CELESTIAL WHATEVER!

81
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,822
Al‐Saachez:
SO, YOU WANT A FIST FIGHT?

82
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,534
WELL? MR. SILENT
GUNDAM PILOT?

83
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,535
(Gasps)

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,122
WELL DONE.

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,043
(Grunts)

86
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,211
WHAT THE HELL?

87
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,338
THIS IS WHAT YOU
CALLED ME OUT HERE FOR?

88
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,131
AT LEAST SHOW ME
YOUR FACE!

89
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,717
WELL, HOW ABOUT IT?!

90
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,718
(Terrified sobbing)

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,637
(Guns clicking)

92
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,768
DYNAMES...

93
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,144
Haro:
YOU MISSED! YOU MISSED!

94
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,771
Lockon:
ON PURPOSE!

95
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,274
I COULD HAVE EASILY HIT
SETSUNA AS WELL...BIG MOUTH!

96
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,279
(Beeps)

97
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,698
Lockon:
HE'S MOVING.
I'M TAKING HIM OUT!

98
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,494
HE DODGED MY SHOTS!

99
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,582
Lockon:
SETSUNA!
ARE YOU...

100
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,125
Sumeragi:
GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION
ANOTHER TIME.

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,876
CAN YOU RESUME
YOUR MISSION?

102
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,253
ROGER.

103
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,964
SKIP PAST PHASE FIVE
AND GO STRAIGHT TO PHASE SIX.

104
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,174
DYNAMES WILL PROVIDE
SUPPORT FOR EXIA.

105
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,343
GIVE THE SAME ORDER TO
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE.

106
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,137
ROGER THAT,
MA'AM!

107
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,642
THE MISSION PLAN'S A MESS
THANKS TO THAT CHILD.

108
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,227
HE ACTUALLY OPENED
THE COCKPIT HATCH

109
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,146
WHILE IN
THE MIDDLE OF COMBAT...

110
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,148
WHY WOULD HE DO
SUCH A THING?

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,075
DEPLOYING PARTICLES
DIRECTLY AHEAD.

112
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,708
Pilot:
OUR... OUR SHOTS!

113
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,064
HEY, TIERIA.

114
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,690
SETSUNA'S GONE
AND DONE IT AGAIN.

115
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,150
Tieria:
BE QUIET.

116
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,527
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR CHIT CHAT.

117
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,656
Operator #1:
WE'VE LOST CONTACT WITH
THE THIRD AIR CORPS!

118
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,491
Operator #2:
NO RESPONSE FROM THE ENRIO BASE!

119
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,202
Operator #3:
NO RESPONSE FROM THE PMC'S
THIRTY‐SECOND TRANSPORT CORPS!

120
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,536
Operator #4:
OUR COMMUNICATION LINES
ARE BEING DISRUPTED!

121
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,121
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON!

122
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,873
AND WHAT ARE OUR
MOBILE SUIT LOSSES?

123
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,957
ENORMOUS.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,542
JUST FROM WHAT'S BEEN
REPORTED SO FAR,

125
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,962
WE HAVE 32 MACHINES DESTROYED,
26 BADLY DAMAGED

126
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,507
AND THE AEU HAS LOST
15 MACHINES AS WELL.

127
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,966
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WE'VE LOST MORE THAN

128
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,344
HALF OF OUR FORCES
IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS?!

129
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,762
COMMANDER!

130
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,682
THE PMC TRUST HAS SENT WORD
SUGGESTING WE FALL BACK!

131
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,808
THOSE FOOLS!

132
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,476
JUST WHERE DO THEY THINK
WE CAN RUN TO?!

133
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,022
Katagiri:
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE THIS BAD.

134
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,191
THOSE GUNDAMS ARE...
TOO MUCH.

135
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,112
(Thinking):
STOP SACRIFICING
YOUR SOLDIERS.

136
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,488
SURRENDER.

137
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,409
OUT OF ALL THE PLANS
WE CONSIDERED

138
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,578
THIS IS THE
WORST CASE SCENARIO.

139
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,955
IS EVERYTHING READY?

140
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,540
AS WE PREVIOUSLY
DISCUSSED,

141
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,000
WE HAVE FORMED A RECONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE TEAM.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,170
WE'RE GOING TO BE AMONG
THE FIRST ON THE GROUND.

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,797
I'VE LINED UP
SOME NATIONS

144
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
THAT ARE PROMISING
ECONOMIC AID,

145
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,386
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE IN MORALIA NOW.

146
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,763
LET US OFFER UP A
SILENT PRAYER

147
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,808
TO HONOR THE EFFORTS
OF OUR VALIANT SOLDIERS.

148
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,645
Member #1:
YOU'VE LOST TRACK
OF ALL THE GUNDAMS?!

149
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,063
WHAT, DID THEY FALL BACK?!

150
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,773
NO, WE SHOULD ASSUME

151
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,984
THEY'VE JUST MOVED ON TO
THEIR NEXT MISSION.

152
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,236
ANYTHING FROM THE
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ TEAM?

153
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,113
OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE
CURRENTLY DOWN

154
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,990
BECAUSE OF THOSE PARTICLES
FROM THE GUNDAMS

155
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,283
SO NOTHING'S
GETTING THROUGH.

156
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,702
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
FOUR MACHINES!

157
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,328
YOU CAN'T CALL
THIS MESS A WAR,

158
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,123
THIS IS A ONE‐SIDED
BUTT‐KICKING FIASCO!

159
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,460
ALL GUNDAMS
HAVE ARRIVED

160
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,336
AT THE SCHEDULED
RENDEZVOUS POINT.

161
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,213
NOW COMMENCING
PHASE SIX.

162
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,591
RIGHT...THEN
LET'S WRAP THIS UP.

163
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,263
WHY ARE WE
FLYING DOWN HERE ANYWAY?

164
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,098
Lockon:
STOP YOUR GRUMBLING.

165
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,349
THE ENEMY'S ATTENTION
IS ON THE AREAS

166
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,935
WHERE THERE'S
RADIO INTERFERENCE.

167
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,061
WE'LL SNEAK IN AND

168
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,980
QUICKLY CRUSH
THE ENEMY'S HEAD.

169
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,524
WE'RE COUNTING ON
YOUR STEADY HAND HERE.

170
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,610
(Crash)

171
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,986
HEY, BE CAREFUL
WILL YOU?

172
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,529
YOU SUCK!
YOU SUCK!

173
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,198
NEVER MIND.

174
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,325
Lockon:
THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD BE SAYING!

175
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,122
(Thinking):
WHY WAS HE HERE?

176
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,749
DID HE JOIN THE PMC

177
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,709
BECAUSE HE HAD
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO?

178
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,127
IF HE DID...

179
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,129
THEN WHERE IS HIS GOD NOW?

180
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
(Beep)

181
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,009
Tieria:
SETSUNA F. SEIEI...

182
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,594
TIERIA ERDE.

183
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,764
MAKE ANOTHER SILLY
SELF‐ABSORBED MOVE LIKE THAT

184
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,766
AND I'LL SHOOT YOU
IN THE BACK.

185
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,518
YOU'D TRASH
A SOLAR REACTOR?

186
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,145
TO PROTECT THE SECRETS
OF THE GUNDAMS, YES.

187
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,237
Mercenary #1:
BOSS!
YOU MADE IT!

188
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:17,742
Al‐Saachez:
YEAH. SOMEHOW.

189
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,246
BUT I LET MY BONUS
GET AWAY.

190
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,414
Mercenary #2:
STILL, THAT WAS
WELL DONE, BOSS.

191
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,333
YOU WENT TOE TO TOE
WITH THAT MONSTER

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,585
AND YOU CAME OUT EVEN!

193
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,839
Mercenary #3:
YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU
ORDERED US TO HIDE, SIR!

194
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,551
THE DEAD DON'T CARE
ABOUT MONEY.

195
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:39,305
(Thinking):
BUT WHO WAS THAT KID?
DOES HE KNOW ME?

196
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,143
AND THE WAY
HE USED THAT SWORD...

197
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,646
COULD HE BE FROM...KRUGIS?

198
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,399
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

199
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,986
MISS SUMERAGI,
WE'RE COMING UP

200
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,779
ON THEIR
ARRIVAL TIME NOW.

201
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,739
Feldt:
PHASE SIX...
COMPLETE.

202
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,116
HERE WE GO...

203
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,492
LAST PHASE!

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,037
(Radar beeping rapidly)

205
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,080
WE'VE GOT
GUNDAMS!

206
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,416
POINT 326! IN FRONT OF
HEADQUARTERS!

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,167
THEY MUST'VE COME
THROUGH THE GORGE!

208
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
ALL MOBILE SUITS ARE
TO ENGAGE!

209
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,804
VIRTUE, READY
TO DESTROY TARGETS.

210
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,023
DYNAMES, TARGETED AND
READY TO FIRE.

211
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,154
(Boom)

212
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,116
KYRIOS, NOW COMMENCING
INTERVENTION!

213
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,125
(Boom)

214
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,130
EXIA...ELIMINATING TARGETS.

215
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,566
(Metal clanging)

216
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,125
Operator:
ALL MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
HAVE BEEN SILENCED.

217
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,170
ANNIHILATED IN LESS
THAN FIVE MINUTES?

218
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,339
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

219
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,382
COMMANDER,

220
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,133
THE PRIME MINISTER
IS CALLING, SIR.

221
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,638
THE ENEMY'S
NOT RESPONDING.

222
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,181
WILL THEY KEEP ON...

223
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,101
OR QUIT?

224
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,519
QUIT.

225
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,151
Lockon:
HARO, SEND WORD TO
MISS SUMERAGI!

226
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,153
WE'VE CONFIRMED
THE ENEMY'S WHITE FLAG!

227
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,363
MISSION COMPLETE!

228
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,115
Haro:
ROGER! ROGER!

229
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,541
Feldt:
THEY'VE SIGNALED
UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.

230
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,709
MISSION COMPLETE.

231
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,919
ALL MACHINES WITHDRAW.

232
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,254
WHEW!

233
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,548
WELL,
MISS SUMERAGI,

234
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,383
THAT WAS WELL DONE.

235
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,635
WE DID HAVE ONE OUTRAGEOUS
INCIDENT, HOWEVER.

236
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,887
I KNOW,
BUT DESPITE THAT,

237
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,182
THE PLAN UNFOLDED ALMOST
EXACTLY AS VEDA HAD PREDICTED.

238
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,976
Sumeragi:
PERSONALLY,
SOMETIMES I WISH

239
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,644
THINGS DIDN'T GO
AS PREDICTED.

240
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,771
UH, WHY IS THAT?

241
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,189
WE'RE HEADING OUT.

242
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,941
TAKE CARE OF THE EQUIPMENT
FOR ME, PLEASE.

243
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,943
RIGHT, I'LL GET ON THAT.

244
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,572
WANG LIU‐MEI...

245
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,740
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LIVES

246
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,116
WERE SACRIFICED IN
THIS MISSION?

247
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,325
NO.

248
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,952
ACCORDING TO
MY FORECAST

249
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,079
THERE WERE AT LEAST
FIVE HUNDRED LOST.

250
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,123
BUT SURELY, WHEN YOU
JOINED CELESTIAL BEING

251
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,292
YOU KNEW THINGS LIKE
THIS WOULD HAPPEN?

252
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,046
I KNEW ALRIGHT.
YES...ALL TOO WELL.

253
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,971
IT APPEARS
TO BE OVER.

254
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,349
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE AEU LOST ITS BIG GAMBLE.

255
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,185
I'M NOT TOO SURE...

256
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,145
OBVIOUSLY LOSING OVER TWENTY
MOBILE SUITS LIKE THAT

257
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,147
HAS GOT TO BE
PRETTY PAINFUL.

258
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,983
BUT I THINK THE AEU WILL SEE
A SURGE IN SUPPORT

259
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,568
FROM ITS CITIZENS
WHICH MEANS

260
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,154
THEY'LL HAVE A FREE HAND
TO EXPAND THEIR MILITARY.

261
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,364
AND BY HAVING MORALIA
IN THEIR DEBT,

262
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,577
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PMCS
WILL BECOME EVEN STRONGER.

263
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,120
HOW SAD...

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,123
NO MATTER HOW BRILLIANT
ITS VICTORIES ARE,

265
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,333
CELESTIAL BEING IS

266
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,336
ONLY ALIENATING ITSELF
FROM THE WORLD.

267
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,921
SO, TELL ME PROFESSOR...

268
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,339
DO YOU FEEL
THEY'RE WALKING DOWN

269
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,966
THE PATH OF THEIR OWN
DESTRUCTION?

270
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,968
YOU KNOW,
THEIR ACTIONS INDICATE

271
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,553
THAT IS WHAT
THEY'RE SEEKING.

272
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,931
ANYWAY THAT'S THE WAY
IT LOOKS TO ME.

273
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,351
Man:
MORALIA'S JUST SURRENDERED!

274
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,727
THAT'S TOO FAST!

275
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,396
THEY ONLY DECLARED THEIR
EMERGENCY FIVE HOURS AGO!

276
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,065
CHANGE THE BROADCAST!
I'LL REWRITE THE SCRIPT!

277
00:14:59,065 --> 00:14:59,941
DO WE HAVE ANY VIDEO
FROM THE SCENE?!

278
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,150
WE'RE GETTING
IT NOW!

279
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,069
IS THE WAR... OVER?

280
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,612
Reporter:
KINUE! DON'T
JUST SIT THERE!

281
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,155
UH, YES SIR!

282
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,953
Newscaster:
IN OUR LEAD STORY,
NEWS ON CELESTIAL BEING'S

283
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,871
ARMED INTERVENTION
YESTERDAY INTO

284
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,166
THE JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE
HELD
BY THE MORALIAN MILITARY

285
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,961
AND THE AEU IN
THE REPUBLIC OF MORALIA.

286
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,754
ONLY FIVE HOURS HAD PASSED

287
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,965
BETWEEN THE STATE
OF EMERGENCY DECLARATION

288
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,216
AND THE UNCONDITIONAL
SURRENDER.

289
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,968
WOW, IT'S ALREADY OVER!

290
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,302
AN INSTANT KILL!

291
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,555
THOSE GUNDAMS ROCK!

292
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,473
SAJI, WHEN WE WERE
IN DANGER,

293
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,560
CELESTIAL BEING WAS THE GROUP
THAT SAVED US, RIGHT?

294
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,145
YEAH...THAT'S RIGHT.

295
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,563
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT...

296
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,148
...CASUALTIES STAND AT 527

297
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,191
BUT WITH PEOPLE
STILL MISSING IN ACTION

298
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,570
THE CASUALTY FIGURES ARE
EXPECTED TO RISE.

299
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,196
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING
LIVE WITH

300
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,740
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
IKEDA ON THE SCENE.

301
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,118
HE WILL NOW UPDATE US
ON THE CURRENT SITUATION.

302
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,246
PLEASE GO AHEAD, MR. IKEDA.

303
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,541
YES, IKEDA HERE!
I AM REPORTING FROM RIVIERE,

304
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,751
THE CAPITAL OF MORALIA.

305
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,545
CAN YOU SEE THAT?
THIS IS THE SPOT

306
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,173
WHERE A MORALIAN MOBILE SUIT
WAS SHOT DOWN.

307
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,092
IT CRASHED INTO THIS BUILDING
CAUSING IT TO COLLAPSE.

308
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,969
ON OUR WAY HERE
WE SAW SEVERAL HOMES

309
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,555
THAT HAD BEEN DESTROYED
BY STRAY GUNFIRE.

310
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,931
WE UNDERSTAND THERE WERE

311
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,767
QUITE A NUMBER OF
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

312
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,644
Newscaster:
HAS THE PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION

313
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,023
CELESTIAL BEING RELEASED A
STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY?

314
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,567
Ikeda:
AH, I HAVE RECEIVED NO
INFORMATION ABOUT A STATEMENT.

315
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,830
Ribbons:
CONGRATULATIONS...

316
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,166
MASTER ALEJANDRO CORNER.

317
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,376
THANK YOU, BUT IT'S THE
GUNDAM MEISTERS

318
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,546
WHO SHOULD BE
RECEIVING ALL SUCH ACCOLADES.

319
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,299
HOW WILL THE WORLD
RESPOND NOW?

320
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,553
PMC Member:
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?!

321
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,971
WHERE WAS I?

322
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,973
I WAS FIGHTING THE GUNDAMS,
OF COURSE.

323
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,893
THEN WHY IS YOUR TEAM THE
ONLY ONE WITHOUT CASUALTIES?!

324
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,145
THEIR COMMANDER KNOWS
HIS STUFF.

325
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,480
OH, BY THE WAY,

326
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,149
I GOT SOME GOOD INFORMATION
A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

327
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,151
WHAT? WHAT KIND OF
INFORMATION?

328
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,154
JUST WATCH THE NEWS
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT.

329
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,290
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I HIT YOU, RIGHT?

330
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,709
OUR IDENTITIES FALL UNDER
THE SAME S‐LEVEL

331
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,088
SECRECY RESTRICTIONS
AS THE SOLAR REACTORS.

332
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,925
WHY DID YOU SHOW
YOURSELF LIKE THAT?

333
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,135
GO AHEAD,
GIVE ME A REASON!

334
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,763
(Grunts)

335
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,139
YOU'RE SO STUBBORN.

336
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,724
YOU ARE REALLY ASKING
FOR IT!

337
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,851
(Gun cocks)

338
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,521
FINE THEN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL US.

339
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,731
BUT YOU'RE NOW A DANGER
TO THE REST OF US.

340
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,191
KNOCK IT OFF,
TIERIA!

341
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,568
IF WE LET HIM GET AWAY WITH
THIS KIND OF FOOLISHNESS,

342
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,988
HE'LL BE PUTTING OUR LIVES
AT RISK AS WELL.

343
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,990
THE PLAN IS STILL
IN ITS INFANCY.

344
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,825
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO SLIP UP...

345
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,160
Setsuna:
I'M NOT LEAVING.

346
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,288
I'M NOT
LEAVING EXIA.

347
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,748
AND I AM A
GUNDAM MEISTER.

348
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,584
Lockon:
PUT IT DOWN,
SETSUNA!

349
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,546
LOOK, I KNOW I'M GUILTY OF
DISOBEYING ORDERS TOO.

350
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,382
BUT ALL OF US HERE
WERE CHOSEN BY VEDA.

351
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,593
THERE'S A REASON WHY SETSUNA
WAS MADE A GUNDAM MEISTER.

352
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,975
THEN ANSWER ME
ONE QUESTION, SETSUNA...

353
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,561
WHY DO YOU DESERVE
TO BE A GUNDAM MEISTER?

354
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,693
MY EXISTENCE IS THE REASON.

355
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,736
WHAT?

356
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,696
BECAUSE I'M ALIVE.

357
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,699
I'M STILL ALIVE.

358
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,700
Haro:
EVERYONE!

359
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,869
GET ALONG! GET ALONG!

360
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,953
(Splash)

361
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,121
(Lockon gasps)

362
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,711
(PDA beeps)

363
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,841
(Gasps)

364
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,970
WELL, IT WAS
INEVITABLE REALLY.

365
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,140
WE LIVE IN A WORLD
THAT IS FILLED WITH EVILS.

366
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,024
Saji:
LOUISE, WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON

367
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,859
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
GONE OUT.

368
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,195
Louise:
ARE YOU STILL WORRIED
ABOUT MORALIA?

369
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,572
BUT LOUISE,
YOU'RE FROM THE AEU.

370
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,157
AREN'T YOU WORRIED AT ALL?

371
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,742
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
BEEN TO MORALIA

372
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,952
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

373
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,954
SO, WHERE ARE WE
GOING NOW?

374
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,206
(Giggles)

375
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,540
FIRST, I WANT TO LOOK AT
SOME CLOTHES...

376
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,833
THEN SOME MORE CLOTHES...

377
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,086
THEN SOME MORE CLOTHES...
AND THEN MORE CLOTHES!

378
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,754
ALL FOR YOURSELF,
RIGHT?

379
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,005
(Laughs)

380
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,006
(Louise screams)

381
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,973
Saji:
WHAT HAPPENED?

382
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,142
THE...THE BUS!

383
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,311
(People moaning)

384
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,521
(Gasps)

385
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,981
Man:
THE BUS
JUST EXPLODED!

386
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,401
TERRORISTS!
A TERRORIST ATTACK!

387
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,860
TERRORISTS...

388
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,320
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
LOUISE!

389
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,321
HURRY!

390
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,909
HEY! LISTEN UP,
YOU GUYS!

391
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,619
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
JUST HAPPENED!

392
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,413
WHAT'S GOING ON,
OLD MAN?

393
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,706
SEVEN MAJOR CITIES WERE
ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS...

394
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,333
SIMULTANEOUSLY!

395
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,376
HOW MANY?!

396
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,586
TERRORISTS!

397
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,796
WERE THERE
ANY CASUALTIES?

398
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,464
WELL, THEY USED
TIME BOMBS

399
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,259
AT TRAIN STATIONS
AND BUSINESS DISTRICTS.

400
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,386
THEY WEREN'T LARGE EXPLOSIONS

401
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,721
BUT THEY TARGETED PLACES
WHERE PEOPLE WERE GATHERED.

402
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,056
I HEARD AT LEAST

403
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,809
A HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST
THEIR LIVES IN THE BLASTS.

404
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,519
THAT'S JUST
TERRIBLE.

405
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,522
(PDA beeps)

406
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,440
IT'S ME.

407
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,608
ATTENTION GUNDAM MEISTERS.

408
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,195
MOMENTS AGO, THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS

409
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,157
RELEASED A STATEMENT OF
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE NETWORKS.

410
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,200
UNLESS
CELESTIAL BEING CEASES

411
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,119
ITS ARMED INTERVENTIONS
AND DISARMS,

412
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,163
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO
ENGAGE IN

413
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,916
INDISCRIMINATE RETALIATORY
ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD.

414
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,210
SO IN FACT, THIS WAS
REALLY AIMED AT US.

415
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,254
WHICH ORGANIZATION
MADE THE STATEMENT?

416
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,173
THAT'S UNKNOWN.

417
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,300
MEISTERS, PLEASE REMAIN THERE
ON
STANDBY UNTIL WE RECEIVE

418
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,719
AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
FROM OUR AGENTS.

419
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,556
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE
OR WHERE THEY'RE FROM...

420
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,183
BUT THEY'VE
STIRRED THINGS UP.

421
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,603
BLACKMAILING US BY
MASS MURDER...

422
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,188
WHAT DID THEY THINK?

423
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,899
THAT THIS WOULD STOP US FROM
CARRYING OUT OUR INTERVENTIONS?

424
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,358
ARE YOU SERIOUS,
TIERIA?!

425
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,069
INNOCENT CIVILIANS
WERE VICTIMS HERE!

426
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,571
AND YOU DON'T FEEL
ANYTHING?!

427
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,739
NO, I DON'T.

428
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,574
ALL OF OUR PLANS DID
FORECAST THAT

429
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,410
THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING.

430
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,995
CALLOUS BASTARD!

431
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,164
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
USUALLY YOU'RE THE ONE

432
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,791
WHO ACTS LIKE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD.

433
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,002
SHUT UP,
YOU BASTARD!

434
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,338
DO YOU DESPISE
TERRORISM THAT MUCH?

435
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,380
AND YOU DON'T?!

436
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,257
TO THE WORLD
AT LARGE...

437
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,218
WE'RE NOTHING BUT
A BUNCH OF TERRORISTS TOO.

438
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,970
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME HATING THEM?!

441
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,102
KNOWN AS TERRORISM.

442
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,606
YEAH, SO?

443
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,857

SO...

444
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,652

WHAT IT DOES BEST...

445
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,320
ARMED INTERVENTION.

446
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,409
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

447
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,704
WE GUNDAM MEISTERS WILL
BE THE ONES TO DO IT.
