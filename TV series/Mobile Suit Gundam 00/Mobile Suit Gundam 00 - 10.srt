1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,506
Waitress:
EXCUSE ME.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,175
COME IN!

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,969
YOUR COMPANION
HAS ARRIVED, MA'AM.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,014
TA‐DAH!

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,267
OH MY, LOUISE!
THAT LOOKS LOVELY ON YOU!

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,644
(Giggles)

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,397
I KNEW MY SELECTION WOULD BE
JUST PERFECT FOR YOU.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,191
UH, HEH HEH...

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,525
HELLO.

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,320
YOUNG MAN, I DON'T REMEMBER
INVITING YOU FOR DINNER.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,031
I INVITED HIM!
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SAJI?

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,492
I REFUSED
BUT SHE INSISTED.

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,952
YOU'RE RATHER
WEAK‐WILLED.

14
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,620
I GET TOLD THAT
A LOT.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,996
INDEED.

16
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,624
LET ME MAKE THINGS
VERY CLEAR FOR YOU.

17
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,959
GO HOME NOW.

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,751
OH, RIGHT!

19
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,127
NO, MOM!

20
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,379
IT'S OKAY!

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,505
GO HOME, YOUNG MAN!

22
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,257
I SAID NO, MOTHER!

23
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,428
(Metal clanging)

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,890
(Grunts)

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,976
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT...

26
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,353
THE ENEMY IS TRYING
TO BUY TIME.

27
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,860
THEY KEEP MOVING!

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,823
THEY'RE TRYING TO WEAR US OUT!

29
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,241
NO.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,411
IT'S CLEAR THE ENEMY IS NOT
AFTER THIS SHIP.

31
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,163
THEY'RE TRYING
TO CAPTURE A GUNDAM!

32
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,210
(Struggling gasps)

33
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,587
I KNOW YOU...

34
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,048
I'M CERTAIN I DO!

35
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,883
I KNOW THAT...

00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,885

EVEN NOW,
DESPITE GAINING ACCESS

44
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,740
TO A NEVER ENDING SUPPLY
OF ENERGY,

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,327
HUMANITY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO
PUT AN END TO CONFLICT.

TO RECTIFY
THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS,

47
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,956
THE PRIVATE ARMED ORGANIZATION

48
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,959
CELESTIAL BEING TAKES ACTION
AGAINST THIS WORLD,

49

WITH ITS GOAL BEING
THE ELIMINATION OF WAR ITSELF.

50
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,340
HOWEVER, THE WORLD RESISTS
ITS INTERFERENCE,

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,718
AND THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S
CHOBU SPECIAL FORCES TEAM

52
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,972
PROCEEDS WITH A SECRET PLAN.

53
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,306
THROWN OFF BALANCE
BY THE TACTICS

54
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,684
OF THE TEAM'S COMMANDER,
SERGEI SMIRNOV,

55
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,060
THE FOUR GUNDAMS FIND IT

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,563
DIFICULT TO COUNTERATTACK
EFFECTIVELY.

57
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,939
AS THE BATTLE RAGES,

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,151
SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE
SOMA PERIES,

59
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,861
PILOTING HER TIEREN TAOZI,

60
00:03:55,861 --> 00:04:00,031
APPEARS BEFORE
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM.

61
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,576
WHAT WILL
SPACE BEAR WITNESS TO...

62
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,704
WHEN THESE TWO FINALLY MEET?

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,211
Ming: COLONEL, THE WINGED ONE'S
MOVEMENTS ARE A BIT ODD.

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,880
AND IT'S STOPPED
EMITTING THOSE PARTICLES.

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,383
IS IT MALFUNCTIONING...
OR IS THIS A TRAP?

66
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,969
Peries:
COLONEL, I VOLUNTEER
TO GO AHEAD.

67
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,139
WE'LL USE THE CARBON NETS FIRST.
LIEUTENANT MING!

68
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,891
Ming:
ROGER!

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,898
(Nervous gasp)

70
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,819
(Shocked gasp)

71
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,702
GO AWAY.

72
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,915
(Nervously):
GO AWAY!

73
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,252
(Whimpering)

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,923
Allelujah:
I'M BEGGING YOU... GO AWAY!

75
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,966
Peries:
MATCHING
RELATIVE VELOCITY.

76
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,845
CONTACT INITIATED.

77
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,347
(Screams in pain)

78
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,431
(Allelujah screaming)

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,682
WHAT?

80
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,768
Sergei:
HEY, THAT VOICE...

81
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,102
Allelujah:
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

82
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,688
EVERYONE, MOVE
TO THE CENTRAL BLOCK!

83
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,691
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE,
MOVE TO THE CENTER!

84
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,651
(Allelujah screaming)

85
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,611
IT'S THE SAME AS BEFORE.

86
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,363
IT'S THE VOICE OF THAT
SAME YOUNG PILOT.

87
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,365
BUT WHY IS HE IN PAIN?

88
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,201
(Screaming continues)

89
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,204
Sergei:
IS HE REACTING
TO LIEUTENANT PERIES?

90
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,205
(Gasps)

91
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,873
COULD IT BE?!

92
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,417
Technician:
WE ANALYZED HER TAOZI'S
MISSION RECORDER

93
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,213
AND DETECTED ABNORMALITIES IN
HER QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

94
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,049
ORDINARILY,
THIS SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

95
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,343
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT
AN EXTERNAL INFLUENCE.

96
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,136
EXTERNAL INFLUENCE?

97
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,014
IF THAT'S SO, THEN THE
ONLY KIND OF INDIVIDUAL

98
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,432
WHO COULD CAUSE THIS REACTION

99
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,560
WOULD BE SOMEONE
LIKE THE LIEUTENANT,

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,480
WITH ENHANCED GLIAL CELLS AND
USING QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,066
THE SAME AS LIEUTENANT PERIES...

102
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,318
Peries:
COLONEL, THE PILOT HAS
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.

103
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,070
ROGER THAT.

104
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,781
Sergei:
ALL UNITS, TAKE THE WINGED ONE
INTO SHIP FOUR,

105
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,866
AND THEN FALL BACK TO
A SAFE DISTANCE!

106
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,578
SERGEANT IVAN, RENDEZVOUS
WITH THE MAIN FORCE

107
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,329
AND SIGNAL THEM TO FALL BACK!

108
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,130
(Frustrated grunt)

109
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,177
Lockon:
THEY'RE IN
MY BLIND SPOT AGAIN!

110
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,387
DAMN!

111
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,347
I HOPE ALLELUJAH'S
SAFE OUT THERE!

112
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,349
AND TIERIA!

113
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,772
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I COULD BE SO...CARELESS.

114
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,865
Pilot:
THE WINGED ONE IS
STORED AND SECURED.

115
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,908
Sergei:
HAVE THE CREW REMOVE
THE PILOT FROM THE MACHINE

116
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,535
AND RESTRAIN HIM.

117
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,287
Soldier:
MAINTENANCE TEAM, ROGER THAT.

118
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,883
HEY CHIEF, I'M GETTING
AN ERROR MESSAGE

119
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,801
NO MATTER WHICH
SCANNING METHOD I USE.

120
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,303
YOU SURE?

121
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,139
I WONDER IF IT'S BECAUSE OF
THOSE PARTICLES...

122
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,142
Pilot:
SHIP FOUR IS
PREPARING TO HEAD OUT.

123
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,353
Sergei:
THAT WASN'T VERY EXCITING
FOR A FIRST BATTLE

124
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,355
NOW WAS IT LIEUTENANT PERIES.

125
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,565
SUCH FEELINGS
DO NOT CONCERN ME, SIR.

126
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,734
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS THE MISSION...

127
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,152
AND ITS COMPLETION.

128
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,612
(Beeps)

129
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,238
COLONEL, A HEAT SOURCE!

130
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,658
IT'S HERE!

131
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,117
WHAT THE...?!

132
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,498
Sergei:
ALL MACHINES, SPREAD OUT!

133
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,292
SHIP FOUR, GET OUT
OF THIS ZONE, RIGHT NOW!

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,670
THAT ATTACK...
WAS IT THE BIG ONE?

135
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,672
IT'S A GUNDAM!

136
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,054
SO THERE WAS ANOTHER TEAM.

137
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,056
(Beeps)

138
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,474
WHAT?

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,060
KYRIOS' SIGNAL IS COMING FROM
INSIDE THAT TRANSPORT.

140
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,104
THE ENEMY'S ACTUALLY
CAPTURED HIM!

141
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,439
THIS IS A MAJOR SCREWUP!

142
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,775
YOU DESERVE TEN THOUSAND
DEATHS, ALLELUJAH!

143
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,246
Peries:
COLONEL! THE ENEMY HAS
ASSUMED A FIRING POSITION!

144
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,790
IT'S TARGETING SHIP FOUR!

145
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
Sergei:
IT MUST KNOW ITS COMRADE
IS IN THERE!

146
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,046
AND YET, IT'S STILL
GOING TO FIRE?!

147
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,965
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM,

148
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,675
THIS JUST PROVES MY BELIEF

149
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,219
THAT YOU WERE NEVER WORTHY OF
BEING A GUNDAM MEISTER.

150
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,221
(Beeps)

151
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,097
HUH?

152
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,099
IT'S FAST!

153
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,061
IT'S MORE THAN A TIEREN...

154
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
A NEW MODEL?

155
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,070
IT DODGED ME TWICE!

156
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,363
COLONEL SMIRNOV!

157
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,365
LEAVE THIS TO ME AND
YOU GO AFTER THE WINGED ONE!

158
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,368
Sergei:
VERY WELL, LIEUTENANT!

159
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,829
WAIT FOR US AT THE
RENDEZVOUS POINT, SHIP FOUR!

160
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,415
MAKE SURE YOU DRAG THE PILOT
OUT OF THE WINGED ONE.

161
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,293
IF NEED BE, YOU HAVE
MY PERMISSION TO USE CUTTERS!

162
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,252
Pilot:
ROGER THAT!

163
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,670
IT'S MOVING AWAY!

164
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,047
(Beeps)

165
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,925
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DEAL WITH
VIRTUE BY YOURSELF?!

166
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:15,597
Peries:
YOU WILL NOT STOP US!

167
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,514
WHAT THE...?!

168
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,766
EVEN WITH YOUR SHIELD...

169
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,601
YOU'LL STILL FEEL
THESE SHELLS!

170
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,025
(Grunts)

171
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,777
IT'S NOT THAT EASY IS IT?!

172
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,116
(Gasps)

173
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,409
YOU DARE...

174
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,536
TO DAMAGE MY TAOZI?!

175
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,913
DAMN YOU!

176
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,706
Ming: COLONEL, THE LIEUTENANT'S
MACHINE!

177
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,792
Sergei:
I KNOW.
ALL MOBILE SUIT TEAMS,

178
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,544
SUPPORT THE LIEUTENANT AND
MOVE IN TO CAPTURE THE BIG ONE!

179
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,803
Soldier:
BRIDGE, THERE'S NO SWITCH ON
THE OUTSIDE OF THIS THING.

180
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,346
WE'RE USING THE CUTTER!

181
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:02,769
(Whirring)

182
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,232
(Thinking):
I CAN HEAR... A VOICE.

183
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,317
YOU WILL NOT STOP US!

184
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,944
THAT'S RIGHT.

185
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,987
IT'S HER VOICE.

186
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,823
(Gasping in pain)

187
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,659
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

188
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,536
IT'S THAT GIRL.

189
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,287
THE ONE FROM BEFORE!

190
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,083
(Metal grinding)

191
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,085
HUH?

192
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,505
(Confused gasps)

193
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,840
(Yells)

194
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,510
(Men shouting)

195
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:47,360
(Siren in background)

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,986
Pilot #1:
EMERGENCY IN THE CONTAINER!

197
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,696
Pilot #2:
CONTACT THE COLONEL!

198
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:54,325
Pilot #1:
(Shouts in panic)

199
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,993
COLONEL!

200
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:58,079
THE SHIP IS BEING DESTROYED
FROM
THE INSIDE!

201
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,831
Sergei:
SHIP FOUR, WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
SITUATION REPORT!

202
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,209
(Men yelling)

203
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,421
(Beeps)

204
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:10,591
Sergei:
SHIP FOUR'S
SIGNAL HAS BEEN LOST.

205
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,760
WHAT A TERRIBLE TURN OF EVENTS.

206
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,556
THIS IS MY FAULT AND
MINE ALONE.

207
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:19,308
HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT RETURN
EMPTY‐HANDED!

208
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,687
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES,

209
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,438
WE'RE GOING TO CAPTURE
THE BIG ONE!

210
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:31,279
I'M SENSING SOMETHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THAT MACHINE.

211
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,864
VEDA, WHAT COULD IT BE?

212
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,700
(Beeps)

213
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,243
NEW ENEMIES!

214
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,619
THE COLONEL!

215
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:41,205
WE'LL PUT OUR PLAN INTO ACTION
AFTER THE ENEMY FIRES!

216
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:42,415
DON'T DIE!

217
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,166
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHO THEY'RE MESSING WITH!

218
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:48,546
WHAT?!

219
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,382
WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN YOUR SHOTS
THERE'S A TIME LAG!

220
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,149
(Metal creaking)

221
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:09,900
Sergei:
FIRE THE GEL!

222
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:23,914
(Metal creaking)

223
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,083
THIS ISN'T GOING TO STOP ME!

224
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,176
YOU WILL NOT FIRE THAT!

225
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,637
(Metal clanging)

226
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:39,638
(Grunts)

227
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,182
I DON'T NEED IT!

228
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:45,353
(Metal clanging)

229
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:47,772
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK!

230
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:59,617
Ming:
COLONEL!
WE CAN'T HOLD IT!

231
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:03,162
THE BIG ONE HAS MORE THRUST THAN
SIX TIERENS COMBINED?!

232
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,706
LIEUTENANT! I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S A HEAD OR AN ARM!

233
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,500
TAKE SOMETHING!

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,919
Peries:
ROGER!

235
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,921
ACTIVATE GN FIELD!

236
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,714
(Metal creaking)

237
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:14,715
Tieria:
(Gasps)

238
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:17,968
IT'S NOT FORMING!

239
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,470
IT'S HERE!

240
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,306
(Determined cry)

241
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,185
THEY'RE GOING TO GET ME!

242
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,686
(Beeping and whirring)

243
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,817
(Metal creaking)

244
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,235
(Peries yells in pain)

245
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:39,156
(Metal creaking)

246
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,324
IT'S CHANGED.

247
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,326
(Metal creaking)

248
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,254
Ming:
WHAT NOW?!

249
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,005
Sergei:
IT SHED ITS ARMOR?!

250
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,637
GUNDAM NADLEEH...

251
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,390
PREPARE TO ERADICATE
ALL TARGETS!

252
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,102
(Pilots screaming)

253
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:09,103
Pilot:
COLONEL!

254
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,272
(Pilots screaming)

255
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:12,356
(Gasps)

256
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:13,899
Sergei:
CANCEL OPERATION!

257
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,693
LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY!

258
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:16,485
Ming:
ROGER!

259
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:17,319
Peries:
COLONEL!

260
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,321
WE'RE FALLING BACK!

261
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:29,915
(Furious cry)

262
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,625
ANOTHER FOUL‐UP!

263
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:37,006
REVEALING NADLEEH
AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE!

264
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:40,009
HOW COULD I HAVE JEOPARDIZED
THE PLAN LIKE THAT!

265
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,218
(Shuddering)

266
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,636
VEDA...

267
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:45,139
(Sobbing)

268
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:47,224
I JUST...

269
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:49,643
I DIDN'T...

270
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:56,066
(Weeping)

271
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,819
I COULDN'T HELP IT...

272
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,669
AND THAT WAS ONLY
NUMBER SEVEN.

273
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:18,464
(Metal clanging)

274
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,894
THAT WAS MACHINE NUMBER NINE.

275
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:35,439
(High‐pitched whining)

276
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,233
IT'S THE WITHDRAWAL SIGNAL.

277
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,488
THEY RAN!
THEY RAN!

278
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,323
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

279
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:47,117
Feldt:
THE ENEMY MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
HAVE BEGUN TO WITHDRAW.

280
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:48,661
SO DOES THAT MEAN...

281
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,037
WE ALL SURVIVED?

282
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,705
APPARENTLY SO.

283
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,457
NOW THAT WAS TOUGH.

284
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,625
STAY ALERT THERE!

285
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,877
THIS ISN'T
OVER YET!

286
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:59,380
WE STILL HAVE TO RECOVER
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE!

287
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,756
ROGER THAT!

288
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,676
ALLELUJAH...

289
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:06,470
TIERIA...

290
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,306
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT.
HOW'S YOUR MACHINE HOLDING UP?

291
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,058
Peries:
LONG DISTANCE
ACCELERATION IS OUT.

292
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:12,643
BUT CRUISING IS NO PROBLEM.

293
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,562
I SEE.

294
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:17,106
ALL THOSE RESOURCES
AND MANPOWER...

295
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,900
AND WE COULDN'T
EVEN CAPTURE A SINGLE ONE.

296
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,485
Ming: COLONEL, SOMETHING IS
APPROACHING

297
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:22,570
FROM DIRECTLY
AHEAD OF US!

298
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,445
WHAT?

299
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:25,364
(Gasps)

300
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,408
Sergei:
IT'S THE WINGED ONE!

301
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:28,742
I'VE TRACKED YOU DOWN.

302
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:31,579
A SUPER‐SOLDIER
VERSION OF THE TIEREN!

303
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,038
YES, YOU'RE THE ONE.

304
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,415
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I'D LET YOU

305
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:37,251
MESS AROUND WITH
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES?

306
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,878
YOU'RE THE SAME AS ME,
AREN'T YOU?

307
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:42,423
THAT'S RIGHT,
TWO PEAS IN A POD!

308
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,258
FIRST THEY ENHANCED YOUR BODY...

309
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:46,010
THEN THEY MESSED WITH
YOUR BRAIN,

310
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,803
AND TURNED YOU INTO A MONSTER!

311
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:49,388
I'M ENGAGING!

312
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,515
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT! NOT WITH
YOUR MACHINE LIKE THAT!

313
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,225
YOU'RE A BRAVE ONE...

314
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,602
WOMAN!

315
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,026
(Grunts)

316
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,531
IS HE...

317
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:08,949
TOYING WITH ME?

318
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:11,160
I TOLD YOU!
WE'RE EXACTLY ALIKE.

319
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,911
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO DO!

320
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,416
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT!

321
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,793
Ming:
COLONEL! TAKE THE
LIEUTENANT AND GET AWAY!

322
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,253
WHAT?

323
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,379
Ming: YOUR ABILITIES AND THE
LIEUTENANT'S ARE CRUCIAL

324
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,590
TO THE CHOBU TEAM!

325
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,259
PLEASE, SIR.
AVENGE MY DEATH!

326
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:30,721
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT MING!

327
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,514
LEAVE HER ALONE!

328
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,516
STAY BACK, LITTLE TIN SOLDIER!

329
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,436
YOU SHOULD VALUE
YOUR LIFE A LOT MORE!

330
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,980
(Metal crashing)

331
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,361
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT MING!

332
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:46,820
(Peries gasps)

333
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,988
Ming:
COLONEL!

334
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,865
PLEASE! GET AWAY!

335
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,659
Peries:
LIEUTENANT MING!

336
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,202
Sergei:
WE'RE WITHDRAWING,
LIEUTENANT!

337
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,620
BUT, SIR!

338
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,915
DO NOT WASTE THE
SACRIFICE OF A BRAVE MAN.

339
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:02,586
(Electrical static)

340
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,171
WHAT'S THIS?

341
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:06,590
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE AND
ABANDON ONE OF YOUR OWN?

342
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,550
SO MUCH FOR
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE...

343
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,636
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

344
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,763
Ming:
SOMEDAY...

345
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:16,767
SOMEDAY THE TIME WILL COME WHEN
YOU ALL GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!

346
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,394
AND YOU WILL BE PUNISHED FOR

347
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,938
DISRUPTING THE ORDER OF THE
SOCIETY WE HAVE BUILT!

348
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,857
STOP BRAGGING ABOUT
YOUR DAMN COUNTRY.

349
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:27,361
A SOCIETY THAT REBUILDS ITS
PEOPLE INTO INHUMAN SOLDIERS,

350
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,405
WHAT KIND OF ORDER IS THAT?

351
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:31,031
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

352
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:34,410
I'M STILL PRETTY PISSED OFF
ABOUT THE GIRL THAT RAN AWAY.

353
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,245
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

354
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,872
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU SLOWLY!

355
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:41,750
(Electrical static intensifies)

356
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,086
WHAT THE...?

357
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:45,671
(Ming screaming in pain)

358
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,005
Hallelujah:
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE
YOUR LIFE

359
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,091
SLOWLY CRUSHED
BY OVERWHELMING FORCE,

360
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,301
WITH NO HOPE OF FIGHTING BACK?

361
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,720
(Screaming in pain)

362
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,723
NO, STOP!
STOP IT, PLEASE!

363
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,975
Hallelujah:
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I CALL BEGGING FOR YOUR LIFE!

364
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,435
WHO WILL YOU THINK OF?

365
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:01,729
YOUR MOTHER?
OR YOUR LOVER?

366
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,481
YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING MEMORIES
OF YOUR CHILDHOOD NOW

367
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:06,442
AS THEY FLASH BEFORE YOUR EYES!

368
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:09,278
Allelujah:
STOP IT, HALLELUJAH!

369
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,904
HOLD ON, ALLELUJAH.

370
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:13,449
I'M JUST GETTING TO
THE BEST PART.

371
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,034
Allelujah:
PLEASE, STOP!

372
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,660
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

373
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,497
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, BECAUSE
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU COULDN'T.

374
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:21,373
Allelujah:
I SAID STOP!

375
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,542
OH, OKAY.

376
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,003
SURE THING, ALLELUJAH.

377
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:27,629
I GOT IT.

378
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,424
I JUST CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU.

379
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,801
JUST KIDDING!

380
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,844
(Hallelujah cackling)

381
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,638
THIS IS FUN ISN'T IT,
ALLELUJAH?!

382
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:40,851
ALLELUJAH!

383
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:42,728
(Electrical static)

384
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:46,190
(Beeps)

385
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,734
COLONEL,
LIEUTENANT MING JUST...

386
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,277
DON'T SAY IT,
LIEUTENANT.

387
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,028
BUT, SIR!

388
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,447
DON'T!

389
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,450
GUNDAM...

390
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:10,130
Allelujah:
(Heavy breathing)

391
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,507
HOW COME?

392
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:14,227
WHY IS IT HALLELUJAH?

393
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:17,355
WHY DO YOU WANT TO
KILL PEOPLE SO MUCH?

394
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,107
IS THAT ME?

395
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:22,360
IS THAT MY TRUE NATURE?

396
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,488
AND IF IT IS...

397
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,948
THAT MEANS I'M...

398
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:28,950
A MONSTER!

399
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:39,127
Christina:
I'VE LOCATED VIRTUE.
IT'S ON THE MONITOR.

400
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:41,296
THAT LOOKS LIKE...

401
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:44,216
NADLEEH.

402
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,425
I SEE...

403
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:49,304
YOU HAD TO USE NADLEEH
TO ESCAPE.

404
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,056
TIERIA...

405
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:02,943
SO THAT'S...

406
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,945
NADLEEH.

407
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,446
(Sighs)

408
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,448
Christina:
I'VE LOCATED KYRIOS!

409
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:10,033
ALLELUJAH, DO YOU COPY?

410
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,326
ALLELUJAH!

411
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:12,327
(Gasps)

412
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:13,411
WHAT'S WRONG?

413
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:17,207
UH...NOTHING.

414
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,252
HE'S CRYING.

415
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,378
NOT AGAIN!

416
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:23,463
I CAN'T STAND IT!

417
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:24,965
I MADE...

418
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,550
ANOTHER STUPID MISTAKE!

419
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,093
IT'S TRUE.

420
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:29,469
I JUST WISH I WASN'T SO...

421
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:31,096
PATHETIC!

422
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:32,472
(Sobbing)

423
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:36,977
Liu‐Mei:
WHAT A BLUNDER.

424
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:39,729
THE GUNDAMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE EMBODIMENT OF

425
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:42,399
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S
EXALTED IDEALS.

426
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,858
SO THEN...

427
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:46,027
WHY ARE
THE CHOSEN MEISTERS

428
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,780
SO VERY IMPERFECT?

429
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:56,204
ARE YOU CERTAIN...

430
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:58,164
YOU DON'T WANT TO
ACT NOW?

431
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:02,210
I AM MERELY AN OBSERVER IN
THESE MATTERS, NOT A COMBATANT.

432
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,549
ALL I CAN DO IS KEEP MY DISTANCE
AND CONTINUE WATCHING THEM.

433
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:10,927
EVEN IF...THEY ARE ON THE PATH
TO DESTRUCTION.

440
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,982
MAKES UP ALLELUJAH'S MIND
TO CARRY OUT A CERTAIN MISSION.

441

IS IT ATONEMENT FOR HIS PAST?
