00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,588
(Machine gun firing)

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:09,551
Al‐Saachez:
THIS BATTLE...IS A HOLY WAR
IN THE NAME OF GOD.

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,844
(Grunts)

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,388
WE SHALL STRIKE DOWN
THE INFIDELS

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,724
WHO DISRESPECT OUR TRADITIONS

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,727
AND LAY WASTE
TO THE LAND OF GOD.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,145
(Tank running)

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,190
(Panting)

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,860
WE MUST NOT SUBMIT
TO THE INFIDELS.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,529
(Gun shots firing)

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,657

(Screams)

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,373
BY DYING IN BATTLE...

16
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,043
WE SHALL BE LED
INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
(Breathing heavily)

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,215
(Setsuna thinking)
IN THIS WORLD...

19
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,883
THERE IS NO GOD.

20
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553
(Gun shots blast)

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,894
(Gasps)

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,649
Al‐Saachez:
THIS BATTLE IS A HOLY WAR...

23
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,860
(Thinking)
IN THIS WORLD
THERE IS NO GOD.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,529
Al‐Saachez:
WE SHALL STRIKE DOWN
THE INFIDELS

25
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,197
WHO DISRESPECT OUR TRADITIONS

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,534

HUH?

SO THIS IS THE ENACT.

46
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,879
THE FIRST A. E. U. MOBILE SUIT
THAT RUNS ON SOLAR ENERGY.

47
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,213
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE A. E. U.'S

48
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,632
ORBITAL ELEVATOR
IS DEFINITELY LAGGING.

49
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,384
THEY PROBABLY WANT TO
MAKE UP FOR THAT

50
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,553
BY MAKING THEIR
MOBILE SUITS STATE OF THE ART.

51
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,888
WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

52
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,307
SHOULD THE ACE OF MSWAD BE
SHOWING HIS FACE HERE?

53
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,893
OF COURSE
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

54
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,025
YOU KNOW, THE A. E. U.'S
GOT SOME NERVE, ALRIGHT.

55
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,027
ANNOUNCING THEIR NEW MODEL
AT THE SAME TIME

56
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,239
AS THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S
TENTH ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY.

57
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,492
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS MACHINE ANYWAY?

58
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,368
TO BE PERFECTLY
HONEST,

59
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,329
IT'S JUST A KNOCKOFF
OF OUR FLAG MODEL.

60
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,165
ONLY THE EXTERIOR DESIGN
IS ORIGINAL.

61
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,876
Patrick:
YOU THERE!
I CAN HEAR YOU!

62
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,170
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
WELL? COME ON!!

63
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,923
WELL, AT LEAST IT HAS
GOOD SOUND PICKUP.

64
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,549
I GUESS SO!

65
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,897
2‐4‐0‐0‐8‐2 EXIA HAS
TARGET LOCATION IN SIGHT.

66
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:18,068
CEASE G. N. PARTICLE DISPERSAL
UPON ARRIVAL AT TARGET.

67
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,528
TARGET CONFIRMED.

68
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,531
COMMENCING
FIRST PHASE ON SCHEDULE.

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,995
CAPTAIN! I'VE SPOTTED
AN INCOMING SILHOUETTE!

70
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,996
WHAT?

71
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,499
IT'S AT
THREE O'CLOCK, SIR!

72
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,708
WHICH SQUADRON?

73
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,377
THIS IS AN EXERCISE
DAMNIT.

74
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,878
WARN THEM OFF!

75
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,338
IT'S NOT SHOWING UP
ON OUR RADAR!

76
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,506
NOTHING HERE, SIR!

77
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,676
GET A VISUAL ON IT!

78
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,843
(Gasps)

79
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,096
JUST WHAT KIND OF
UNIT IS THAT?

80
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,686
IT'S BEGUN.

81
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,896
WHAT?
AN UNKNOWN?

82
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,398
WHY NOW OF ALL TIMES?!

83
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,524
(Groans)

84
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,652
HUH?

85
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,862
A MOBILE SUIT.
INCREDIBLE.

86
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,156
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY HAD ANOTHER NEW MODEL.

87
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,450
THEN IT'S NOT THEIRS.

88
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,703
WHAT IS WITH THAT LIGHT?

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,166
(Crowd gasps)

90
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,422
ENACT!
CAN YOU HEAR ME, ENACT?!

91
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,881
PATRICK! DAMN!

92
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,759
I CAN'T GET THROUGH.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

93
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,344
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE OUT?

94
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,139
Security Officer:
EVERYONE, WE'VE
BEEN ADVISED TO EVACUATE!

95
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,890
IT'S NOT
AN A. E. U. MACHINE?

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,935
WELL, WHOSE IS IT?

97
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,187
ALRIGHT,
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

98
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,690
FROM THE UNION?
HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE?

99
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,525
WELL, EITHER WAY,

100
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,069
YOU'RE A PARTY‐CRASHER
AND YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

101
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,572
AND NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO PAY THE PRICE!

102
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,866
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT IDIOT
DOING OUT THERE?

103
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,826
DOESN'T HE KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY IT COST

104
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,869
TO DEVELOP THAT THING?

105
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,203
IT'S A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY.

106
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,206
IT'LL JUST RAISE
THE VALUE OF THE ENACT.

107
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,125
AFTER ALL,
PATRICK COLASOUR

108
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,628
IS OUR MILITARY'S
TOP ACE, RIGHT?

109
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,465
HIS PERSONALITY COULD USE
A LITTLE WORK, THOUGH.

110
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,841
HEY, YOU!

111
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,385
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO YOU'RE MESSING WITH HERE?

112
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,221
I'M PATRICK COLASOUR
OF THE A. E. U.!

113
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,057
I'VE NEVER LOST A MOCK BATTLE

114
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,268
BECAUSE I'M
JUST THAT SPECIAL!

115
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,937
SO DON'T SAY I DIDN'T
WARN YOU!

116
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
(Crowd groans)

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,107
THAT IDIOT!

118
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,817
Patrick:
WELL, COME ON!

119
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,320
EXIA, READY FOR
TARGET ELIMINATION.

120
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,950
(Slash)

121
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,202
WHAT THE HELL?!

122
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,997
(Crash)

123
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,208
AH! YOU BASTARD!

124
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,502
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?!

125
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,548
Patrick:
I'M... SPECIAL!

126
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,552
I'VE DONE
TWO THOUSAND...

127
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,888
OF THESE MOCK BATTLES!

128
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,557
HMM?

129
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,272
EXCUSE ME!
HEY, WHAT THE...?

130
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,233
I SAID, "EXCUSE ME."

131
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,948
Graham:
GUN... DAM...

132
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,951
IS THAT THE NAME OF THE MOBILE
SUIT OR SOMETHING ELSE?

133
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,536
A GUNDAM?

134
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,667
EXIA, FIRST PHASE COMPLETE.

135
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,711
NOW PROCEEDING TO
SECOND PHASE.

136
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,677
AGAIN WITH THAT
LIGHT.

137
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,181
HOW CAN IT FLY WITHOUT
A PROPULSION SYSTEM?

138
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,350
WHERE IS HE?!
WHERE'D HE GO?!

139
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,560
MY NAME IS
PATRICK COLASOUR AND...

140
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,562
HUH, THAT'S
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

141
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,230
I GUESS
THE BRAND NEW ENACT

142
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,024
DESERVES HIGH MARKS
FOR PILOT SAFETY.

143
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,069
BUT THAT MOBILE SUIT IS
A WHOLE OTHER THING.

144
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,489
WAS THIS MEANT TO HAMPER
THE A. E. U.'S MILITARY BUILDUP?

145
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,701
OR MAYBE, IT'S JUST
MEANT TO BE A WARNING.

146
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,286
WHATEVER THE CASE,
THERE'S NO WAY

147
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,039
THE A. E. U. IS GOING TO TAKE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS LYING DOWN.

148
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,875
(Plane engine running)

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,344
Christina:
PTOLEMY PERIMETER DENSITY,
MAINTAINING MISSION MODE.

150
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,723
EXIA HAS PASSED THE SCHEDULED
OPERATION TIME

151
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,391
FOR FIRST PHASE.

152
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,852
IT IS MOST LIKELY
IN THE SECOND PHASE NOW.

153
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,354
I WONDER IF SETSUNA'S
DOING ALL RIGHT OUT THERE?

154
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,398
WELL, IF HE ISN'T,
THEN THAT SPELLS

155
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,900
THE END OF CELESTIAL BEING,
DOESN'T IT?

156
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,693
THAT'S ENOUGH
IDLE CHATTER YOU TWO.

157
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,571
IT'S ALMOST TIME TO
COMMENCE THE THIRD PHASE.

158
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,324
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE TO BE SO UPTIGHT.

159
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,368
AFTER ALL THIS IS
CELESTIAL BEING'S BIG DEBUT!

160
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,703
LET'S DO IT WITH FLAIR!

161
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,288
HEY!
ARE YOU DRINKING?!

162
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,664
DID I HEAR THAT
RIGHT?

163
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,874
WELL, WHY NOT?

164
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,168
I'M JUST IN CHARGE
OF PLANNING THE MISSIONS.

165
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,587
THE REST IS UP TO YOU GUYS.

166
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,255
(Gulping)

167
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,971
Feldt:
CONTAINER LOADING COMPLETED.

168
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,307
MOVING KYRIOS TO
CATAPULT DECK.

169
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,149
A REAL BATTLE, HALLELUJAH.
JUST WHAT YOU WANTED.

170
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,192
(Sighs)

171
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,653
BUT THIS IS DEPRESSING TO ME.

172
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,863
Feldt:
KYRIOS ON CATAPULT DECK.

173
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,201
INCREASING LINEAR CATAPULT
VOLTAGE FROM 230 TO 520.

174
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,870
KYRIOS STABILIZED WITH
LINEAR FIELD.

175
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,665
LAUNCH PREPARATIONS COMPLETE.

176
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,292
TRANSFERRING TIMING CONTROL
TO KYRIOS.

177
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,086
ROGER,
I HAVE CONTROL.

178
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,880
KYRIOS, NOW COMMENCING
OPERATION.

179
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,384

182
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,398
HERE ON THE GEOSTATIONARY
ORBITAL STATION,

183
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,024
A FESTIVE
PARTY IS UNDERWAY

184
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,901
CELEBRATING THE TENTH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATION'S

CORPORATE EXECUTIVES,

189
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,369
ALL OF WHOM CONTRIBUTED

190
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,038
TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR ITSELF.

191
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,917
MAY I OFFER YOU
A BEVERAGE?

192
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,294
OH!

193
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,754
YES, I'LL TAKE ONE.

194
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
(Giggles)

195
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,384
YOU KNOW,

196
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,886
SOME PEOPLE THINK
REAL MEN DON'T BLUSH.

197
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,554
(Giggles)

198
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,352
IT HAS BEGUN,
MY MISTRESS.

199
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,481
FINALLY...
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR MOVE.

200
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,568
HERE COME THE GUNDAM MEISTERS
OF CELESTIAL BEING.

201
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
(Gun shots firing)

202
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,665
(Sighs)

203
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,888
Pilot #1:
GOTCHA!

204
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,265
(Firing continues)

205
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
Pilot #2:
WHAT MOBILITY!

206
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,769
I NEVER KNEW
A MACHINE COULD DO THAT!

207
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,562
Commander #1:
DON'T BREAK FORMATION!

208
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,230
REINFORCEMENTS ARE
ON THEIR WAY!

209
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,446
AS WE THOUGHT,

210
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,240
THE A. E. U. HAS STATIONED
MILITARY FORCES IN THE PILLAR.

211
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,203
LOCKON.
REINFORCEMENTS APPROACHING.

212
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,038
REINFORCEMENTS APPROACHING.

213
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,124
EVEN SETSUNA WOULD HAVE
TROUBLE IN THIS SITUATION.

214
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,919
WELL, LET'S TAKE AIM
SHALL WE?

215
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,045
LET'S GO!

216
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,714
THE GUNDAM DYNAMES AND
LOCKON STRATOS,

217
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,216
IN OUR MAIDEN BATTLE!

218
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,389
Commander #1:
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!

219
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,057
IT MAY BE NEW,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE!

220
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,352
SURROUND IT!

221
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,728
Pilot #1:
E‐ENEMY ATTACK!

222
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,064
Commander #2
FROM WHERE?!

223
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,399
IT'S FROM BELOW!

224
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,900
IT'S LOCKON.

225
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,201
DYNAMES IS TARGETED
AND READY TO FIRE.

226
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,792
Commander #2:
IT'S FIRING FROM THE GROUND!

227
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,127
(Commander #2 gasps)

228
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,929
AND SO THE SECOND PHASE...

229
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,889
IS NOW COMPLETE.

230
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,561
SO, THAT MOBILE SUIT
IS EXPOSING

231
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,397
THE A. E. U.'S UNDECLARED
FIGHTING STRENGTH?

232
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,982
YEAH!
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE

233
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,442
IT'S TRYING
TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT

234
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,110
THE A. E. U. HAS MORE
MILITARY POWER

235
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,653
THAN IS ACTUALLY ALLOWED

236
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,405
BY THE TREATY
LIMITATIONS.

237
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,657
THIS IS A CHECK AND
A WARNING.

238
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,952
AND WHY WOULD IT WANT
TO DO THAT?

239
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,038
THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK

240
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,415
THE PILOT OF
THAT GUNDAM THING.

241
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,833
BUT YOU KNOW

242
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,835
I REALLY CAN'T SEE
THE A. E. U.

243
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
KEEPING
QUIET AFTER THIS.

244
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,889
(Blast)

245
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,897
ANOTHER READING ON
THE E‐SENSOR.

246
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,398
THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF DEBRIS

247
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,733
FLOATING OUT THERE
TODAY.

248
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,902
IT SURE SEEMS LIKE
AN AWFUL LOT OF MASS.

249
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,403
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
THE REMAINS

250
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,238
OF AN OLD
GENERATION SATELLITE.

251
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,949
Captain:
GET A VISUAL AT
MAXIMUM MAGNIFICATION.

252
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,202
DON'T FORGET THERE'S
A CEREMONY STILL GOING ON.

253
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,746
ROGER THAT, CAPTAIN.

254
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,914
WHAT THE...?

255
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,000
I'M GOING TO TRY TO
ENLARGE THE IMAGE, SIR!

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,628
Captain:
THOSE LOOK LIKE MOBILE SUITS!

257
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,629
INCREDIBLE!

258
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,963
THEY SNUCK
IN WITH THE DEBRIS!

259
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,548
IF THEY GET INTERFERENCE
FROM THE SHIELD,

260
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,549
THE MOBILE SUIT,

261
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,051
ALONG WITH THE PILOT,
WILL BE...!

262
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,219
(All gasp)

263
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,553
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?!

264
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,847
IT LOOKS LIKE THESE GUYS
ARE PRETTY DETERMINED.

265
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,390
ARE THEY TERRORISTS?

266
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,852
GIVE THE ORDER FOR THE THIRD
DEFENSE FORCE TO SCRAMBLE!

267
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,854
(Alarm wails)

268
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,233
Pilot #3:
DAMN IT!

269
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,318
ONLY COWARDS
ATTACK DURING A CEREMONY!

270
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,155
Pilot #4:
BUT SIR, I ONLY HAVE
120 HOURS OF SPACE TRAINING!

271
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,782
Commander #3:
WELL THEN JUST CRASH INTO THEM!

272
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,534
YOU'LL GET
A TWO RANK PROMOTION!

273
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,452
Engineer:
THERE WASN'T TIME
TO CHANGE YOUR EQUIPMENT!

274
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,454
YEAH, I KNOW.

275
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,583
THEY'RE USING HELLIONS?

276
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,876
DAMN A. E. U.

277
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,045
THIS IS HAPPENING
BECAUSE THEY'LL SELL WEAPONS

278
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,214
TO ANY LITTLE TIN‐POT NATION.

279
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,218
(People chatter)

280
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,394
OH MY,
EVERYONE WITH A RANK

281
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,895
SEEMS TO ONLY BE
INTERESTED

282
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,356
IN SAVING
THEIR OWN LIVES.

283
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,732
SHALL WE EVACUATE?

284
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,733
OF COURSE NOT.

285
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,735
BUT KUDOS
TO MISS SUMERAGI.

286
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,572
HER FORECAST
WAS REMARKABLY ACCURATE.

287
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,365
Operator #1:
B3 AREA, MAXIMUM PRIORITY.

288
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,701
300 SECONDS UNTIL BACKUP TEAM
SCRAMBLES.

289
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,370
PREVENT UNKNOWNS
FROM ENTERING NON‐COMBAT AREA.

290
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,872
Operator #2:
CONTROL TO ALL UNITS,

291
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:00,001
UNKNOWNS WILL REACH PILLAR
IN 0‐2‐8‐7.

292
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,295
Commander #3:
ALL UNITS, CONTROL ATTITUDE.

293
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,839
BLOCK THE ENEMY
EN ROUTE!

294
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,216
Pilot #4:
THE ENEMY HAS CHANGED COURSE!

295
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
Pilot #3:
DAMN IT!

296
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,345
THEY'RE HIDING BEHIND
THE RING!

297
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,346
Commander #3:
AFTER THEM!

298
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,307
BUT COMMANDER,
WE'RE ON OUR OWN!

299
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,892
STAY FOCUSED, MEN!

300
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,686
(Gun shots firing)

301
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,021
DAMN IT!

302
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,611
THE ENEMY IS GETTING
READY TO OPEN FIRE!

303
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,200
ON COURSE
FOR A DIRECT HIT!

304
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,868
THERE'S NO TIME
TO INTERCEPT THEM!

305
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,665
(Shots firing)

306
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,751
(Rumble)

307
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,211
HUH?

308
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,463
AH! WHAT WAS THAT?!

309
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,382
IT'S A GUNDAM.

310
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,302
GUNDAM KYRIOS.

311
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,595
Commander #3:
WHO THE HELL WAS THAT?!

312
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,765
MISS SUMERAGI'S FORECASTING
REALLY IS AMAZING.

313
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,896
(Firing continues)

314
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,900
Allelujah:
A SUICIDE ATTACK?

315
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,818
THESE TERRORISTS ARE
ALL THE SAME.

316
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,404
TIERIA, COME IN!

317
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,365
THE UNKNOWN IS HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR US!

318
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,536
WHAT?!

319
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
(Concerned crowd)

320
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,875
THE VIRTUE.

321
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,091
VIRTUE, PREPARING TO
DESTROY TARGET.

322
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,683
(Boom)

323
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,364
CONFIRMING THIRD PHASE
NOW COMPLETE.

324
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,742
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS
JUST A LITTLE BIT EXCESSIVE?

325
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,372
THOSE WERE...
WHAT WERE THEY?

326
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,883
Announcer:
GOOD MORNING.
THIS IS J. N. N. NEWS.

327
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,886
IN OUR LEAD STORY, WE CONTINUE
OUR COVERAGE OF THE ATTACK

328
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,889
ON THE HIGH ORBITAL STATION OF
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S

329
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,309
ORBITAL ELEVATOR,
"HEAVEN'S PILLAR".

330
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,644
EARLY THIS MORNING AROUND
DAYBREAK, JAPAN TIME,

331
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,229
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S

332
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,897
HIGH ORBITAL STATION
WAS ATTACKED

333
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,401
BY WHAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
TERRORIST MOBILE SUITS.

334
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,195
AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 P. M.
GREENWICH MEAN TIME,

335
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,655
MOBILE SUITS LAUNCHED
MISSILES

336
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,198
AT THE HIGH ORBITAL STATION,

337
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,909
IN WHAT IS NOW THOUGHT TO BE
A TERRORIST ATTACK.

338
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,871
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MISSILES
WERE THEN INTERCEPTED

339
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,540
BY AN AS YET
UNIDENTIFIED MOBILE SUIT.

340
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,542
THESE IMAGES WERE TAKEN
BY THE J. N. N. CREW

341
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,003
THAT HAPPENED TO BE
ON LOCATION AT THE TIME.

342
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,215
WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

343
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,550
THEY SAY THIS GUY

344
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,093
TOOK OUT ALL
THE TERRORISTS.

345
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,345
IN A MOBILE SUIT?

346
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,138
WHICH MILITARY
IS HE WITH?

347
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,056
APPARENTLY,

348
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,390
THAT'S WHAT THEY
DON'T KNOW.

349
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,559
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?

350
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,186
(Beeping alert)

351
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,438
WE HAVE AN UPDATE
ON THE INCIDENT.

352
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,732
J. N. N. HAS JUST RECEIVED
A VIDEO MESSAGE

353
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,318
FROM AN ORGANIZATION
THAT CLAIMS IT IS RESPONSIBLE

354
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,029
FOR PREVENTING THE ATTACK AND
SAVING THE STATION.

355
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,073
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO THEY ARE

356
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,076
OR IF THE CLAIMS THEY'RE MAKING
IN THE VIDEO ARE GENUINE.

357
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,702
BUT WHAT IS CLEAR

358
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,871
IS THAT SOMEHOW THEY
ARE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT.

359
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,375
NOW, FOR OUR VIEWERS,
WE WILL BROADCAST IT UNEDITED.

360
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,878
I WOULD LIKE
TO ADDRESS THIS STATEMENT

361
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:35,383
TO EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING
BORN AND RAISED ON EARTH.

362
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,053
WE CALL OURSELVES
SIMPLY CELESTIAL BEING.

363
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,055
WE ARE A PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION

364
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,974
IN POSSESSION
OF THE MOBILE WEAPON GUNDAM.

365
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,601
AN ARMED FORCE?

366
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,354
AND WHAT IS
CELESTIAL BEING?

367
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,899
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF
CELESTIAL BEING'S ACTIVITIES

368
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,567
IS TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE

369
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,530
ACTS OF WAR AND CONFLICT
FROM THIS WORLD.

370
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,741
WE DO NOT ACT FOR
OUR OWN BENEFIT

371
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,369
OR FOR PERSONAL GAIN.

372
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,540
WE HAVE CHOSEN TO INTERVENE FOR
THE GREATEST GOAL OF ALL.

373
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,876
TO RID OURSELVES
OF THE SCOURGE OF WAR.

374
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,294
AS OF THIS MOMENT,

375
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,673
I MAKE THIS DECLARATION
TO ALL HUMANITY...

376
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,552
TERRITORY, RELIGION,
ENERGY,

377
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,555
NO MATTER WHAT
THE REASON OR EXCUSE...

378
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,557
IF THERE IS AN EVIDENT
ACT OF WAR

379
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,058
BEING CARRIED OUT...

380
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,979
WE WILL COMMENCE
INTERVENTION WITH ARMED FORCE.

381
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,441
ANY COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION
OR CORPORATION

382
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,900
THAT PROMOTES WAR

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,069
WILL ALSO BE
A LEGITIMATE TARGET

384
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,155
FOR OUR INTERVENTION.

385
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,908
WE SIMPLY CALL OURSELVES
CELESTIAL BEING.

386
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,202
WE ARE AN ARMED ORGANIZATION

387
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,037
THAT WAS
ESTABLISHED TO ELIMINATE

388
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,207
ALL ACTS OF WAR FROM
THIS WORLD.

389
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,959
I REPEAT...

390
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,670
HE'S CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY?

391
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,088
Patrick:
THOSE ARE THE GUYS?!

392
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,884
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO PUT ME
THROUGH ALL THIS?!

393
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,011
THAT...THAT MAN...

394
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,931
THE WORLD IS
BEGINNING TO CHANGE.

395
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,101
THEY WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF WAR WITH MORE WAR.

396
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,436
(Graham laughing)

397
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,812
NOW THAT'S RICH!

398
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,399
THEY SERIOUSLY WANT TO USE
FORCE TO ELIMINATE WAR?

399
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,359
CELESTIAL BEING...

400
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,363
YOUR WHOLE EXISTENCE
IS A CONTRADICTION!

401
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,241
RIBBONS.
IT HAS BEGUN.

402
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,410
HUMANITY'S REFORMATION.

403
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,372
HALLELUJAH.

404
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,626
IT'S AS IF ALL THE WORLD'S
EVILS ARE EXPOSED.

405
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,378
HUMANITY IS BEING TESTED.

406
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,381
BY THE POWER
OF CELESTIAL BEING.

407
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,552
THAT IS A TERRIBLE MISDEED.

408
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,098
WELL, THIS IS IT.
WE'VE STARTED IT.

409
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,309
AND IT CAN'T BE STOPPED.

410
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,603
IT WON'T STOP!
IT WON'T STOP! IT WON'T STOP!

411
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,355
HEY, WE JUST PICKED
A FIGHT

412
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,357
WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD.

413
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,943
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, SETSUNA?

414
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,237
YEAH. I KNOW.

415
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,077
I KNOW BECAUSE
WE'RE THE GUNDAM MEISTERS

416
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,995
OF CELESTIAL BEING.

Narrator:
THE GUNDAMS ARE TO BE
THE MEANS BY WHICH

427
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,383
ALL ACTS OF WAR ARE
REMOVED FROM THE WORLD.

428
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,218
THAT IS WHY THE PILOTS
THEMSELVES

429
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,387
MUST BE DETACHED
FROM THEIR EMOTIONS.

430
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,890
NEXT EPISODE,
"GUNDAM MEISTERS".

431
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,434
IS THIS REALLY
WHAT THE RIGHTEOUS WOULD DO?
