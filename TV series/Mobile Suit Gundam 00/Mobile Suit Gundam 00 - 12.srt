1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,215
Tribal Chieftain #12A:
RASA! THE ASSEMBLY'S ACTIONS
DEFY THE TEACHINGS OF GOD!

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,302
THE LAND OF THIS NATION
WAS GIVEN TO US BY GOD!

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,138
HOW DARE THEY BRING INFIDELS
TO THE PROMISED LAND!

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,808
THE REFORMISTS WILL STEAL THE
VERY GROUND OUT FROM UNDER US!

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,562
RASA...GIVE THE WORD AND LEGIONS
WILL RISE UP AT YOUR CALL!

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,022
THE TIME IS NOW!

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,067
CALM YOURSELVES. THE PRINCESS
AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,194
WILL FACE THE JUDGMENT OF
GOD FOR TURNING

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,404
THEIR BACK ON HIS TEACHINGS.

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,951
AND SO, WE SHALL WAIT
FOR GOD'S RETRIBUTION.

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,120
Tribal Chieftain #12C:
RASA... HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU
GOING TO KEEP SAYING THAT?

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,457
Tribal Chieftain #12B:
AT THIS RATE, WE'LL END UP
LIKE THE PEOPLE OF KRUGIS!

13
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,709
WE MUST BECOME THE
SWORD OF GOD

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,544
AND STRIKE
DOWN THE REFORMISTS!

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,130
WE MUST DRIVE THE INFIDELS
OFF OUR LAND!

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,883
Tribal Chieftain #12C:
BRING GOD'S LIGHTNING DOWN
UPON THESE CORRUPT REFORMISTS!

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,219
Tribal Chieftain #12B:
LET US BE BLESSED!

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,888
GOD SHALL SMITE THOSE
WHO FORGET HIS TEACHINGS!

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,391
RASA!
RASA!
RASA! RASA!

20
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,850
(Sighs)

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,018
(Gunfire)

22
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:01,979
WHAT'S THAT?

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:02,980
GUNFIRE!

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,898
COULD IT BE
THE REFORMISTS?

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,191
RASA!
BANDITS ARE‐‐

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU ARE?

Narrator:
THE MIDDLE EAST. MANY OF THE
COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,763
HAD BASED
THEIR ENTIRE ECONOMIES

39
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,182
UPON THE EXPORTING OF OIL.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,351
BUT AS A RESULT OF THE SOLAR
POWER GENERATION SYSTEM

41
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,772
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, THIS
OIL LOST MUCH OF ITS VALUE.

42
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,191
THE UNITED NATIONS RESOLVED

43
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,070
TO PLACE STRICT CONTROLS ON OIL
EXPORTS, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS.

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,531
IN RESPONSE, A NUMBER OF
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES

45
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,700
TOOK MILITARY ACTION.
THE CONFLICTS MULTIPLIED,

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,953
BECOMING THE SOLAR
POWER WARS

47
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,706
THAT WERE WAGED
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS.

48
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,917
IMPOVERISHED BY THE CONFLICTS
AND ABANDONED

49
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,044
BY THE REST
OF THE WORLD,

50
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,505
MANY COUNTRIES OF THE REGION
HAVE REPEATEDLY DISSOLVED

51
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,801
AND RE‐UNITED IN RESPONSE
TO THEIR ECONOMIC DESTITUTION.

52
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,887
THIS IS THE CURRENT STATE OF
AFFAIRS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,266
THE KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN,
LOCATED BETWEEN THE CASPIAN SEA

54
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,810
AND THE PERSIAN GULF,
IS ONE SUCH NATION

55
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,438
THAT IS ATTEMPTING
TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION.

56
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,274
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CIVIL
UNREST WITHIN ITS NEIGHBOR,

57
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:56,027
SIX YEARS AGO IT ABSORBED
THE REPUBLIC OF KRUGIS.

58
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,113
THE MONARCHY WAS RESTORED
IN THE RESULTING NEW COUNTRY.

59
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,199
DUE TO DIFFERENT
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,410
STATE RELIGION, THE POPULATION
HAS SPLIT INTO

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,328
TWO RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS.

62
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,497
AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT
POLITICAL CLIMATE

63
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,832
REMAINS UNSTABLE.

64
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,003
MASSOUD RACHMADI
HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED

65
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,838
BY AN UNIDENTIFIED
GROUP?

66
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,924
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

67
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,010
THE CONSERVATIVES WILL
LIKELY BELIEVE

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,304
THAT WE REFORMISTS
ARE BEHIND ALL THIS.

69
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,099
IN FACT, WE CAN'T RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT IT'S TRUE.

70
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,934
IT SEEMS THE UN'S
ASSISTANCE HAS

71
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,769
DONE NOTHING BUT
BRING US MISFORTUNE.

72
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,898
BUT THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED
THE SOLAR POWER GENERATION!

73
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,941
THAT IS TRUE, BUT IT
DOESN'T MEAN

74
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,736
THAT ALL OF OUR
PEOPLE ACCEPT IT.

75
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,446
THE ASSEMBLY HAS
ALREADY DECIDED

76
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,574
TO DEPLOY A
PEACE‐KEEPING FORCE.

77
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,576
IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME

78
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,745
BEFORE RADICAL
CONSERVATIVES TAKE ACTION.

79
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,539
AND GOD FORBID, BUT
IF BY SOME CHANCE

80
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,500
MASSOUD RACHMADI
SHOULD TURN UP DEAD‐‐

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,835
STOP IT!
IT'S JUST TOO AWFUL!

82
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,421
YOU MUST THINK OF
THESE THINGS...

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,590
IN ORDER TO
AVOID THE WORST POSSIBILITY.

84
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,758
(Gasps)

85
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,720
THE WORST... POSSIBILITY.

86
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,975
CIVIL WAR.

87
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,897
(Crowd yelling angrily)

88
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,150
LET GOD'S WRATH STRIKE THOSE
WHO'VE FORGOTTEN HIS TEACHINGS!

89
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,075
Hong‐Long:
I CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO PTOLEMAOIS YET.

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,910
I EXPECT IT'LL STILL
BE SOME TIME

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,120
BEFORE IT'S
BACK FROM LAGRANGE FOUR.

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,082
SHOULD CIVIL WAR BREAK
OUT IN AZADISTAN...

93
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,501
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO USE
WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE NOW.

94
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,922
(Beeping)

95
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,883
Liu‐Mei:
IT'S ME.
WHAT'S THE SITUATION LIKE?

96
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,885
Alejandro:
THERE SEEM TO BE
SMALL FIGHTS BREAKING OUT

97
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,679
HERE AND THERE,
BUT NOTHING SERIOUS...

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,806
YOU SHOULD GET OUT
OF THE COUNTRY.

99
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,266
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE.

100
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,685
STAY THERE? BUT WHY?

101
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,687
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS
COUNTRY DOES

102
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,939
AND WHERE
IT GOES NEXT, AND...

103
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,066
I WANT TO SEE FOR MYSELF WHAT
KIND OF ACTION

104
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,694
YOU GUYS WILL
EVENTUALLY DECIDE TO TAKE.

105
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,701
Intern #2A:
I WENT BACK THROUGH THE RECORDS
AND RESEARCHED

106
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,536
THE LAST TWO
HUNDRED YEARS...

107
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,830
THERE ARE AROUND
138 PEOPLE WITH DOCTORATES

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,166
WHO'VE EITHER RUN AWAY
OR... GONE MISSING.

109
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,460
CAN YOU RUN A CHECK ON THE
MOST RECENT DISAPPEARANCES?

110
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,670
YEAH, SURE THING.

111
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,463
NEWS FLASH!

112
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,674
MASSOUD RACHMADI, AZADISTAN'S
RELIGIOUS LEADER,

113
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,759
HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED
BY SOME KIND OF ARMED GROUP!

114
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,553
DID HE SAY AZADISTAN?

115
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,721
WE SENT A
REPORTER THERE

116
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,764
TO COVER THE UN'S
TECHNOLOGY AID PACKAGE!

117
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,474
CONTACT HIM
AND GET HIM ON THIS!

118
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,892
RIGHT, BOSS!

119
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,103
SO, DO YOU THINK CELESTIAL BEING
WILL MAKE AN APPEARANCE?

120
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,313
PROBABLY.

121
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,486
OH... MY, THAT LOOKS GOOD!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO

122
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,614
GO TO ALL THIS
TROUBLE FOR LITTLE OLD ME!

123
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,199
(Laughs nervously)

124
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,410
I TOLD YOU, MY MOM
LIKES TO GET THINGS!

125
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,037
BUT IT'S ONLY ONE PIZZA.

126
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:52,871
YOUNG MAN...

127
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,705
YES?

128
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,998
YOUR CLOTHING?

129
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,335
OH...IT'S MY JOB, I WORK
AT THIS PLACE PART‐TIME.

130
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,836
IT'S SO SAD, MOM...

131
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,047
SAJI'S PARENTS PASSED AWAY
WHEN HE WAS LITTLE...

132
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,466
AND NOW HE LIVES ALL
ALONE WITH HIS BIG SISTER.

133
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,508
(Whimpers)

134
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,136
GOODNESS, BOTH PARENTS...

135
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,723
AND NOW YOU'RE FORCED
TO WORK PART‐TIME...

136
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,141
YOU'RE SO BRAVE!

137
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,559
AH...I'M NOT.

138
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,186
MOM CRIES
KIND OF EASILY.

139
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,355
TOO EASILY.

140
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,023
YOU SAID YOUR
NAME'S SAJI, RIGHT?

141
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,941
UH... YEAH.

142
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,694
I CAN SEE NOW THAT YOU
DO HAVE MANLY FEATURES.

143
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,946
D...DO YOU THINK SO?

144
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,657
YOU LOOK LIKE...

145
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,742
LOOK LIKE WHO, MA'AM?

146
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,744
MY DEAR HUSBAND REBORN.

147
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,163
HE DOES NOT AND
DAD IS STILL ALIVE!

148
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,254
RASA...

149
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,382
MASSOUD RACHMADI.

150
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,261
I SEE. SO, YOU'VE MADE
YOUR DECISION THEN.

151
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,847
YES. I'VE DECIDED
TO ACCEPT

152
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,600
AND BECOME THIS
COUNTRY'S PRINCESS ROYAL.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,436
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
I'M MERELY A FIGUREHEAD,

154
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,147
A SYMBOL OF THE NEW
AZADISTAN,

155
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,942
I FEEL THAT IF THERE'S
SOMETHING I CAN DO TO HELP,

156
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,110
THEN I HAVE TO DO IT.

157
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,903
SO, PLEASE, RASA...

158
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,947
IF YOU DO THEN I SHALL
HAVE NO CHOICE

159
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,907
BUT TO TAKE
THE OPPOSING POSITION.

160
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,702
BUT... WHY WOULD YOU?

161
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,038
PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY
PRINCESS MARINA.

162
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,958
THOUGH THIS NATION
OF OURS MAY BE REBORN,

163
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,503
THE PEOPLE LIVING ON ITS LAND
STILL HAVE HISTORY,

164
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,548
THEIR FAMILIES AND
THE HOLY TEACHINGS OF GOD.

165
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:32,178
MANY OF THEM DISLIKE CHANGE.
AND I DISLIKE IT AS WELL.

166
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,097
IN ORDER TO KEEP
THOSE WHO OPPOSE YOU

167
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,976
FROM RESPONDING WITH VIOLENCE,
THERE MUST BE A FIGURE

168
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,603
WHO CAN TAKE IN THEIR
FEELINGS AND CALM THEIR FEARS.

169
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,693
RASA... HAS EVERYTHING I'VE
DONE UNTIL NOW

170
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,570
JUST BEEN A TERRIBLE MISTAKE?

171
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,572
(Knocking)

172
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,284
SHIRIN. IS THE ASSEMBLY LIKELY
TO LISTEN TO MY OPINIONS?

173
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,369
WILL THE TWO SIDES
AGREE TO COMPROMISE?

174
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,455
THAT IS NOT AN OPTION NOW.

175
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,623
THE CONSERVATIVES ARE
BOYCOTTING THE ASSEMBLY.

176
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,126
AFTER BEING SECRETLY
APPROACHED BY THE UNION,

177
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,211
THE REFORMISTS ARE NOW
DISCUSSING THE IDEA

178
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,046
OF ACCEPTING
MILITARY AID FROM THEM.

179
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,174
BUT DOING THAT WOULD
PROVOKE THE EXTREMISTS

180
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,800
AMONG THE CONSERVATIVES!

181
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,428
AND WHY WOULD THE
UNION GET INVOLVED?

182
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,097
THEY HAVE NO REASON TO
PROTECT THIS COUNTRY.

183
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,391
I'M SURE THEY
HAVE THEIR MOTIVES.

184
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,269
IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT

185
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,979
WE'LL FINALLY BE FACING
GUNDAMS, LIEUTENANT!

186
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,814
I'D BE DISAPPOINTED
IF WE DIDN'T.

187
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,734
BUT HOW DID WE EVER
END UP IN AZADISTAN?

188
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,694
THE MILITARY BRASS HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON CONGRESS

189
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,446
BEHIND THE SCENES.

190
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,075
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FALL
BEHIND THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE.

191
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,580
PLEASE STAY OUT OF SIGHT

192
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
UNTIL THE CIVIL WAR
ACTUALLY ERUPTS.

193
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,086
THEY'RE A LITTLE SMALL
BUT WE DO HAVE ROOMS FOR YOU.

194
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,963
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

195

HOTEL! HOTEL!

196
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

197
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,969
IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE
IMPENDING CIVIL WAR

198
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,931
WE HAVE TO RESCUE MASSOUD
RACHMADI FROM HIS KIDNAPPERS.

199
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,809
IT'S IMPORTANT WE SHOW HIS
COUNTRYMEN THAT HE'S UNHARMED.

200
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,521
THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE OF
THIS COUNTRY DESPISE OUTSIDERS.

201
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,523
I DON'T KNOW IF WE
CAN PULL THIS ONE OFF.

202
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,941
I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

203
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,108
YOU'RE GOING?

204
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,236
WELL, I ORIGINALLY
CAME FROM AZADISTAN.

206
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,488

HOMELAND THAT'S IN DANGER.

IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

211

PROBABILITY THAT THE GROUP

YOU DON'T...
DO THAT TO MY FLAG!

318
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:46,291
THIS GUY JUST KEEPS
ON COMING!

319
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,627
HARO, CEASE
GN PARTICLE DISPERSAL!

320
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,337
TRANSFER ALL THE
POWER TO THE WEAPONS!

321
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,630
ROGER! ROGER!

322
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,383
Lockon:
ALL THIS
AGAINST A MERE FLAG?

323
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:55,342
GUNDAM...

324
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,345
(Voice on radio):
MOBILE SUITS HAVE BEEN
SPOTTED LEAVING

325
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,596
THE AZADISTAN
ARMY'S ZAYER BASE.

326
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:00,889
THEY'RE HEADING FOR
THE PALACE.

327
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,474
AN EMERGENCY CALL...

328
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,059
ALL UNITS ARE TO HEAD
THERE AND INTERCEPT THEM.

329

Liu‐Mei:
I EXPECT WE'LL BE
SEEING SOME MOVEMENT

00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:07,062

332
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:13,652
MOBILE SUITS LEFT THE ZAYER
BASE WITHOUT ANY ORDERS?

333
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:16,030
THIS MEANS... A COUP D'ETAT!

334
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,198
THERE ARE FIVE
MOBILE SUITS IN TOTAL

335
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:20,242
AND ALL OF THEM ARE HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR US.

336
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:21,869
Attendant:
PRINCESS!
EVACUATE TO THE SHELTER!

337
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:22,661

PLEASE, HURRY!

339
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:29,043
(Voice on PA):
WE ARE THE SWORD OF GOD!
WE WILL RISE UP AGAINST THEM!

340
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,045
BRING THE WRATH
OF GOD DOWN UPON THOSE

341
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,796
WHO HAVE FORGOTTEN
HIS TEACHINGS!

342
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:35,215
CHASE OUT THE
INFIDELS WHO HAVE TRESPASSED

343
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:36,884
UPON OUR PROMISED LAND!

345

SHOULDN'T WE BE
EVACUATING?

346
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:47,019
AH, RIBBONS...YOU SHOULD
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AS WELL.

347
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,229
A GUNDAM WILL BE
COMING VERY SOON.

351
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,078
SOUNDS LIKE A COUP D'ETAT.

352
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,580
SO WHAT'LL YOU DO...
MR. FLAG PILOT?

353
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:10,959
AFTER FINALLY
MEETING A GUNDAM!

354
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,128
DISAPPOINTING TO
SAY THE LEAST...

355
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:15,089
BUT A MAN
HAS HIS OBLIGATIONS!

356

HEAD FOR THE CAPITAL!

ANYTHING ON WHO
FIRED THE MISSILES?

359
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:24,848
Daryl:
WE SAW THE SILHOUETTE OF A
MOBILE SUIT

360
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,809
BUT BECAUSE OF
THOSE SPECIAL PARTICLES...

361
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,311
SOMETIMES GUNDAM ABILITIES
HAVE DRAWBACKS.

(Slashing)

363
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,751
Ribbons:
SO THAT IS A GUNDAM.

364
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,128
THAT WAS JUST
BRUTE FORCE.

365
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:57,881
HE'S RELYING TOO MUCH ON
THE GUNDAM'S ABILITIES.

366

00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,100
THE KAZUNA BASE HAS
DEPLOYED A MOBILE SUIT TEAM.

370
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,144
THEY'RE PASSING THROUGH
