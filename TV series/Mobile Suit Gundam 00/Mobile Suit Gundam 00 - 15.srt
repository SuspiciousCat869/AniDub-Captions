IT'S HARD TO
BELIEVE...

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,545
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D

IT'S DOING JUST FINE,

WATCH ME GO TO WORK!

20

BE A SNAP WITH THIS!

00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,186
SO INNOCENT
AND PEACEFUL,

A THOUSAND MOBILE SUITS

51
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,482
GETTING READY TO TAKE PART

AEOLIA SCHENBERG?

HOW IS EVERYTHING
PROGRESSING?

57
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,631
WE'VE JUST RECEIVED A
REPORT FROM INTELLIGENCE.

THE LATEST UPDATE HAS THREE

00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,927
AND THREE PERSONNEL
TRANSPORTS HEADING FOR

60
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,096
THE URANIUM STORAGE
FACILITY.

61
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,558
NOW IF ONLY OUR TRUE QUARRY
WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE NET.

62
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,188
VERY WELL THEN.

63
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,191
IT SEEMS THE TWO WAY
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM HAS

64
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,611
DETECTED SOME "INTERFERENCE"
AT THE EXERCISE GROUND.

65
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,490
AS WE EXPECTED. ADVISE THE
COMMANDER TO CHANGE

66
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,450
THE OPERATION ACCORDINGLY.

67
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,453

PROVIDED THIS SITE,

68
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,206
IN THE FACE OF
STRONG PUBLIC CRITICISM.

69

OBSERVATION TEAMS,
WHAT IS THE GUNDAMS' TARGET?

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,566
SIR, WE HAVE NO UNITS
ALONG THE ROUTE

77
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,318
WHERE WE HAVE
COMM INTERFERENCE.

78

Kati:
WHAT?

79
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,615
THE GUNDAMS ARE HEADING

80
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,158
STRAIGHT FOR THE
SITE WHERE

81
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,035
THE ENRICHED
URANIUM IS BURIED.

82

WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

83
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,121
HOW COULD WE MISS A
GROUP OF TERRORISTS

84
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,457
HEADED STRAIGHT FOR
THE FACILITY?

85
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,459
COLONEL, WE JUST RECEIVED
ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS

86
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,794
TO CAPTURE THE GUNDAMS.

THE GOVERNMENT KNEW WHAT
THE TERRORISTS WERE UP TO...

92
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,110
AND PURPOSELY LEFT THEM ALONE
TO LURE THE GUNDAMS OUT.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,035
DYNAMES HERE.
TARGETED AND READY TO FIRE!

94
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,454

I'M OKAY.
WE'VE GOT INCOMING!

118
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,964
Soldier #15A:
MAINTAIN THE BARRAGE.

119

122
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957

00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,501
COMPLETION TIME
FOR THE FIRST PHASE.

124
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,170
I JUST HOPE EVERYBODY MADE IT
OUT OF THERE IN ONE PIECE.

125
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,133
WHAT'S YOUR FORECAST,
MISS SUMERAGI?

126
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,886
I THINK THEY'VE PROBABLY
SWITCHED TO PLAN B2 BY NOW.

127
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,225
IT'S TIME
FOR EXIA AND VIRTUE.

128
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,478
SUCCESSFUL FIRST ATTACK
FOR UNION THREE.

129
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,189
WE HAVE TWO

130
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,191
CONTINUE LONG‐RANGE
BOMBARDMENT!

131
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,819
ROGER! CONTINUING
LONG‐RANGE BOMBARDMENT!

132
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,904
GETTING A VISUAL SIGNAL
FROM HUMAN‐ONE!

133
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,323
THEY REQUEST A TEAM BE
DISPATCHED TO POINT TF‐2123!

134
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,869
SO, THEY'RE CHOOSING THE
WEAKEST AREAS TO ATTACK.

135
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,164

00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,187
FIRST SHOT COMPLETE.

163
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,815
NOW COMMENCING GN
PARTICLE RECHARGE.

164
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,489
THERE'RE SO MANY OF THEM!

165
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,074
A RESPONSE ALREADY?

166
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,920
Lichtendahl:
TWO HOURS SINCE
IT ALL BEGAN.

167
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,465
Christina:
IF THEY'RE ON PLAN B2...
DYNAMES AND KYRIOS SHOULD REACH

168
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,967
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT
PRETTY SOON.

169
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,805
IF WE COULD AT LEAST USE
THE GN ARMS, THEN MAYBE...

170
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,892
BY THIS TIME THEY
SHOULD HAVE SWITCHED OVER

171
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,144
FROM PLAN B2 TO E5.

172
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,355
WHICH MEANS THAT MACHINE
IS GOING TO BE SHOWING UP.

173
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,481
ALLELUJAH...

174
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,486

(Screaming)

176
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,741
ALLELUJAH, WHAT'S WRONG?

177
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,493
MY HEAD IS KILLING ME...

178
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,494
(Screams)

179
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,955
SHE'S COMING...
THE SUPER‐SOLDIER.

180
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,415
(Moaning)
THE SUPER‐SOLDIER?

00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,541
(Moaning)

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,335
YOU MEAN THE HRL MACHINE
FROM YOUR REPORT?

183
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,170
ENEMIES APPROACHING!
ENEMIES APPROACHING!

184
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,677
(Engines roaring)

185
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:17,724
IT'S HER!

186
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:24,188
(Gasps)

187
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:30,987
ALLELUJAH!

188
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,033
WE FELL INTO THEIR TRAP!

189
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,205
(Screaming)

190
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:48,046
(Missiles ricocheting)

191
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,926
TIERIA! HOW LONG TILL
YOU'RE RECHARGED?

192
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:54,677
ANOTHER 170.

193
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,554
THAT'S TOO LONG.

194
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:57,764
(Slam)

195
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:58,806
(Boom)

196
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,143
(Allelujah screaming)

197
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,395
(Screaming)

198
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,022
I SWEAR THIS...

199
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,942
I WILL COMPLETE THE
MISSION THIS TIME

200
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:10,401
AS A SUPER SOLDIER!

201
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,945
Hallelujah:
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

202
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,321
A TRANSMISSION?

203
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,864
COME ON, TELL ME.

204
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:18,618
SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE,
LIEUTENANT SOMA PERIES!

205
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:21,162
SOMA PERIES, HEY?

206
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,164
I LIKE THAT.

207
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,958
BUT I'LL LIKE KILLING YOU MORE!

208
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,002
(Gasps)

209
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,633
PULL BACK FOR NOW,
LIEUTENANT!

210
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,550
YES, COLONEL!

211
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:40,890
(Shots firing rapidly)

212
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:42,850
NAH...

213
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,311
THIS IS NO FUN.

214
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,563
I'LL LET YOU DEAL WITH
THE REST, ALLELUJAH.

215

Alejandro:
FIVE HOURS HAVE PASSED
SINCE THE FIGHTING BEGAN.

218
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,749
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

219
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:10,628
I'M GOING TO HEAR THE OPINIONS
OF THE OTHER OBSERVERS.

220
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:14,173
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE MY
JOB COULD BE OVER HERE.

221
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,222
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

222
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,102
I HATE ADULTS.

223
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:29,063
(Shots swarming)

224
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,483

Kati:
HAVE THE SIXTEENTH MOBILE
SUIT TEAM TAKE OVER.

227
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,824
YOUR TURN'S COMING UP,
LIEUTENANT.

228
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:42,035
HURRY UP AND GET
READY TO LAUNCH.

229
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,161
MA'AM!

230

00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:54,422
(Explosions)

232
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,927
HOW MUCH LONGER
CAN THIS LAST?

233
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,679
THIS ATTACK
IS MURDER!

234
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,474
(Guns firing rapidly)

235
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,023
AT LEAST GIVE US
A BREAK TO EAT!

00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,232
(Gasping)

237
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:20,406
(Growls)

238
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,742
THEY WILL NEVER
GET THESE GUNDAMS!

239
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:27,371
(Panting hard)

240
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,586

Patrick:
ATTENTION ALL UNITS!

245
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:51,437
OUR SQUADRON'S TARGET
IS THE GIANT GUNDAM.

246
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,564
WHEN THE BARRAGE STOPS,
THAT'S WHEN WE INITIATE

247
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,274
OUR CAPTURE PLAN!

248
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:57,193
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GET HIT BY ITS BEAMS.

249
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:03,866
(Boom)

(Sighs)

251
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,370
FIFTEEN HOURS SINCE

253

(Force field humming)

255
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,553
WHAT THE...

256
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,097
IS THE ATTACK OVER?

257
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,348
WE'RE LEAVING!

258
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:28,516
ROGER THAT!

259
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,944
I'VE GOT YOU NOW GUNDAM!

260
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,617
(Growls)

261
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,619
(Blast)

262
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:49,787
Patrick:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

263
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,498
YOU'RE A LITTLE
SLOW TODAY, GUNDAM!

264
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:53,457
Patrick:
DO IT!

265
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,718

Peries:
COLONEL, MOVING IN TO
CAPTURE THE WINGED ONE.

271
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,025
Sergei:
BE CAREFUL, LIEUTENANT.

272
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,735
IT COULD SUDDENLY
START MOVING AGAIN

273
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,195
LIKE IT DID LAST TIME.

274
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,487
ROGER, COLONEL.

275
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,667
COMMANDER. HAVE VISUAL OF
TARGET, COMMENCING OPERATION.

276
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:40,588
OVER FLAGS, WE'RE GOING TO START
THIS MISSION USING FORMATION E!

277
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:41,797
Daryl:
CAPTAIN!
IT'S JOSHUA!

278
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,049
(Growls)

279
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,469
JOSHUA!
DON'T BREAK FORMATION!

280
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:47,428
(Scoffs)

281
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,388
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
A LEADER ACTS!

282
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,602
MID‐AIR TRANSFORMATION?

283
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,062
Joshua:
YOU LIKE THAT?

284
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,231
I BET YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR OWN PERSONAL TRICK!

285
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:58,981
(Gasps)

286
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,359
(Gasps)

287
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,360
NO!

288
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,737
(Boom)

289
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:06,447
Daryl:
JOSHUA'S GONE!

290
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,573
(Groans)

291
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,575
ALL RIGHT MEN, SWITCH
TO FORMATION C!

292
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,498
(Rapid blasting)

293
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,500
I'M STARTING TO LOSE
FEELING IN MY FINGERS.

294
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,255
TIME FOR A LOVER'S
EMBRACE, GUNDAM!

295

(Screaming)

296
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,182
Graham:
AND YOU ARE MY
SLEEPING BEAUTY!

297
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:37,812
Christina:
FELDT, HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING FROM THE MEISTERS?

298
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,021
NOTHING YET.

299
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,899
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

300
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,115
THE LIVES OF THE
GUNDAM MEISTERS

301
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,783
MIGHT BE
COMING TO AN END.

302
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,456
HOW ARE THE OTHER
MEISTERS DOING?

303
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:04,213
(Beeping)

304
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:05,131
(Gasps)

305
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,924
ENEMY MACHINE AT
THREE O'CLOCK!

306
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,263
Setsuna:
A MOBILE ARMOR.

307
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:14,515
(Gasping)

308
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,100
IT'S THAT ENACT!

309
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,477
I'M GOING TO PAY YOU BACK
FOR THE LAST TIME!

310
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:21,856
READY, MISTER GUNDAM?

311
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,232
(Gasps)

312
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,984
(Rapid blasts)

313
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:34,118
(Crash)

314
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:45,087
YOU CAN DIE NOW.

315
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:50,426
(Electric buzzing)

316
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:54,055
(Screaming)

317
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:58,059
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF
THE AGRISSA'S PLASMA FIELD?

318
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,853
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND
LEAVE YOUR MACHINE BEHIND

319
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:02,855
YOU LITTLE KRUGIS PUNK!

320
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:03,981
(Screaming)

321
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,526
(Door opens)

322
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:13,157
THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICE JUST
RECEIVED AN UNOFFICIAL REPORT.

323
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,117
IT SEEMS THE GUNDAMS OF
CELESTIAL BEING

324
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,912
MADE AN APPEARANCE
AT THE JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE

325
