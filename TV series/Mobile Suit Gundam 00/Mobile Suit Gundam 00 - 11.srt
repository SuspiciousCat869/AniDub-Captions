1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,215
Howard:
LIEUTENANT... IS IT TRUE
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,425
FOUGHT A BATTLE WITH THE
GUNDAMS IN SPACE?

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,760
YEAH.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,095
AND I HEARD THAT, JUDGING FROM
THE DEBRIS ALONE,

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,264
OVER TWENTY TIERENS
WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,766
(Whistles)

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,768
NO WAY. KIND
OF SCARY JUST THINKING ABOUT

8
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,145
GOING UP
AGAINST THOSE THINGS.

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,231
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,816
YEAH, WELL MOBILE SUIT
PERFORMANCE ISN'T THE ONLY THING

11
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,527
THAT DETERMINES WHO'S GOING
TO WIN A FIGHT.

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,112
I KNOW YOU'LL
DO ME PROUD...

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,239
FLAG FIGHTERS.

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,576
SO, THOSE SPECIAL
PARTICLES

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,537
ARE ACTUALLY
DIVERSELY MUTABLE PHOTONS.

16
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,247
YES, BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

17
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,249
THE GUNDAMS SEEM
TO BE PRODUCING THESE

18
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,876
UNIQUE PARTICLES WITHIN
THEIR ENGINES.

19
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,670
I DON'T KNOW HOW
ELSE TO EXPLAIN

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,755
THEIR SEEMINGLY
LIMITLESS FLIGHT RANGE

21
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,257
AND EXTENDED
OPERATION TIME.

22
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,259
THAT MUST HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT

23
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,178
ONLY FOUR GUNDAMS HAVE
MADE AN APPEARANCE SO FAR.

24
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,474
AEOLIA SCHENBERG WAS A
MAN OF SUPERHUMAN GENIUS.

25
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,060
TO THINK HE DISCOVERED THIS
PARTICLE AND ESTABLISHED

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,396
ITS BASIC THEORY
OVER TWO CENTURIES AGO.

27
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,274
HMM...

28
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,193
WHY WOULD A MAN LIKE THAT
INITIATE SUCH AN UNREALISTIC

29
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,946
PROJECT AS THE ELIMINATION
OF WAR FROM THE WORLD?

30
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,949
TO WARN HUMANITY WHO
SEEM ON THE VERGE

31
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,451
OF BRINGING THE SEEDS
OF WAR UP INTO SPACE.

32
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,122
AT LEAST, THAT'S
HOW I SEE IT.

IN THE MILITARY OPERATION

39
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,435
THAT WAS CARRIED OUT
BY THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE,

40
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,646
KYRIOS WAS NEARLY CAPTURED
AND NADLEEH WAS

41
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,231
REVEALED TO THE ENEMY.

42
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,483
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA,
AS COMMANDER

43
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,319
OF THE OPERATION,
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,654
IS YOUR FAULT.

45
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,740
I AM SORRY. BUT AS YOU KNOW,
I'M ONLY HUMAN,

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,410
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I DO MAKE MISTAKES.

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,412
THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT
OCCURRED HERE.

48
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,831
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THIS
WILL SET THE PLAN BACK?

49
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,998
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PANICKED

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,084
AND SHOWED
NADLEEH TO THE ENEMY.

51
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,961
IF I HADN'T, THEY'D
HAVE CAPTURED ME.

52
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,046
THAT MAY BE SO,
BUT YOU'RE STILL

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,297
PARTIALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

54
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,925
YOU CAN'T BLAME ALL OF THIS
ON MISS SUMERAGI.

55
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,886
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS
THAT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

56
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,473
I'LL BE GIVING VEDA'S COMMANDS
TOP PRIORITY FROM NOW ON.

57
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,850
EXCUSE ME.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,813
(Sighs)

59
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,022
WELL, THAT WAS
SURE TENSE.

60
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,816
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
IN HERE WITH

61
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,277
AN ATTITUDE AND SAY IT IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE LIKE THAT.

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,363
I THINK IT'S CUTE HOW UPTIGHT
THE GUY IS...

63
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,116
HE'S ANGRY WITH HIMSELF
SO HE TAKES IT OUT ON OTHERS.

64
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,413
(Thinking):
THAT MACHINE...
A HIGH‐MOBILITY

65
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,249
SUPER‐SOLDIER
VERSION OF THE TIEREN.

66
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,710
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

67
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,546
THAT PILOT IS JUST LIKE ME.

68
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,298
THEY'RE NOT STILL WORKING ON
THAT PROJECT...ARE THEY?

69
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,219
THAT ACCURSED PROJECT.

70
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,396
Commander #4A:
THE DATA COLLECTED ON THE
WINGED GUNDAM

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,356
DURING ITS CAPTURE,

72
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,901
IMAGES FROM THE
TIERENS' MISSION RECORDERS

73
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,487
OF THE CELESTIAL BEING'S
MOTHER SHIP

74
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,531
AND THE BIG
ONE SHEDDING ITS ARMOR.

75
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,118
IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE
COST OF SEVERAL HUNDRED

76
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,704
THOUSAND PROBES AND
MORE THAN TWENTY TIERENS.

77
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,623
I HAVE NO EXCUSE, SIR.

78
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,375
I AM PREPARED TO FACE
DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

79
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,338
I HAVE NO PLANS TO RELIEVE YOU.
AND YOU CAN NOT RESIGN.

80
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,756
HMM?

81
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,175
IT'S TRUE THE OPERATION
WAS A FAILURE...

82
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,887
BUT THAT HASN'T CHANGED MY
EVALUATION OF YOU ONE BIT.

83
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,972
THE GUNDAMS' ABILITIES
SIMPLY SURPASSED

84
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,974
ALL OF OUR
EXPECTATIONS.

85
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,976
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW

86
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,770
WHAT THEIR TRUE LIMITS ARE.

87
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,731
CONTINUING THIS CAPTURE
OPERATION COULD BE VERY COSTLY‐‐

88
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,109
I'M AWARE OF THAT AS WELL.
THE CHAIRMAN IS

89
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,862
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING SECRET
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNION.

90
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,364
TALKS WITH THE UNION?

91
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,283
THIS MEANS THAT THE
CELESTIAL BEING SITUATION

92
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,119
IS MOVING TO THE NEXT
PHASE OF ENGAGEMENT.

93
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,872
Ivan:
LIEUTENANT PERIES...

94
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,499
PLEASE,
AVENGE LIEUTENANT MING

95
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,125
IN THE NEXT OPERATION...

96
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,253
NO... AVENGE ALL
OUR COMRADES!

97
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,256
I WILL COMPLETE MY MISSIONS
THE BEST THAT I CAN.

98
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,341
BECAUSE THAT IS
ESSENTIALLY

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,885
THE ONLY REASON THAT
I AM PERMITTED TO EXIST.

100
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,805
(Allelujah on recording):
STAY BACK!

101
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,723
(Screams)

102
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,768
AS THE LIEUTENANT'S TAOZI
APPROACHES,

103
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,480
THE GUNDAM PILOT
EXPERIENCES INCREASED PAIN.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,441
CLEARLY, THE PILOT IS
BEING AFFECTED

105
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,236
BY THE QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

106
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,823
(Computer beeps)

107
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,909
THERE IS ONE.
TEST SUBJECT E‐57.

108
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,329
E‐57. AFTER QUANTUM
BRAIN WAVE TREATMENT.

109
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,249
NEW PERSONALITY MANIFESTED
FEROCIOUS TENDENCIES...

110
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,295
AFTER DATA
WAS COLLECTED... DISPOSED OF.

111
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,921
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

112
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,673
IF THE TOP BRASS FINDS
OUT ABOUT THIS THERE'S‐‐

113
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,300
(Gasps)

114
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,801
DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING

115
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,553
FROM EXAMINING THE
TAOZI'S MISSION RECORDER?

116
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,762
WELL...

117
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,723
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT YET, SIR.

118
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,516
I BELIEVE THE
GUNDAM PILOT

119
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,560
AND LIEUTENANT
PERIES ARE THE SAME TYPE.

120
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,813
I CAN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES

121
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,025
MIGHT BE RESEARCHING QUANTUM
BRAIN WAVE TREATMENT AS WELL.

122
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,068
IF THEY ARE,
THEN IT JUST SHOWS

123
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,654
HOW TWISTED THIS WORLD
REALLY IS.

124
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,783
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO AGREE WITH
YOU ON THAT POINT, COLONEL.

125
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,248
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
SHOULD I REPORT THIS?

126
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,875
OR SHOULD I JUST‐‐

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,002
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING YOU CAN DO!

128
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,462
HALLELUJAH.

129
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,048
THAT DETESTABLE LABORATORY IS
STILL IN EXISTENCE

130
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,258
AND IT'S
STILL CHURNING OUT PEOPLE

131
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,469
LIKE YOU AND ME ONE AFTER
THE OTHER...

132
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,014
WHICH MAKES THAT INSTITUTE
GUILTY OF PROMOTING WAR.

133
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,560
YOU WANT ME TO DESTROY IT?
AND THE PEOPLE LIKE US.

134
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,646
IS THE KIND‐HEARTED
MR. ALLELUJAH

135
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,981
TOO GOOD
FOR THAT KIND OF WORK?

136
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,900
THEN HAND YOUR BODY
OVER TO ME,

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,527
I'LL DEAL WITH
THE ISSUE REAL QUICK.

138
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,154
JUST LIKE I DID BEFORE.

139
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,448
(Child's voice)
ARE WE GOING TO DIE?

140
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,827
OH, NO! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!
ALLELUJAH! ALLELUJAH!

141
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,829
IT'S NO GOOD!

142
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,123
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE!

143
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,125
ALLELUJAH, PLEASE‐‐

144
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,378
NO... MY NAME IS‐‐

145
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,796
(Gasps)

146
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,172
NO, FORGET IT,
HALLELUJAH.

147
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,049
WE DON'T HAVE TO
KILL ANYONE!

148
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,051
WE COULD JUST
TAKE THEM INTO CUSTODY!

149
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,387
WHAT FUTURE DOES
A PERSON WHO WAS REBUILT

150
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,639
FOR COMBAT POSSIBLY HAVE?

151
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,891
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

152
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:59,270
YEAH, CELESTIAL BEING'S
MR. GUNDAM MEISTER.

153
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,357
YOU'RE WRONG! THE REAL
REASON I CAME HERE WAS‐‐

154
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,275
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
YOU CAN DO IS FIGHT!

155
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,485
NO!

156
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,529
BECAUSE THAT IS OUR DESTINY!

157
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,406
YOU'RE WRONG!
I'M NOT...

158
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,407
(Gasps)

159
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,533
SETSUNA...

160
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,327
SOMETHING WRONG?

161
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,705
UH, NO...NOTHING'S WRONG.

162
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,835
Alejandro:
I UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE RECEIVER ANTENNAS

163
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,670
HAS FALLEN BEHIND SCHEDULE.

164
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,715
Marina:
THE CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN
INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF TIMES.

165
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,551
THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS
AMONG MY PEOPLE

166
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,761
WHO ARE OPPOSED TO
SOLAR POWER GENERATION.

167
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,305
PLEASE, WE'D LIKE YOU
TO MAKE THE SAFETY

168
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,266
OF OUR ENGINEERS
YOUR TOP PRIORITY.

169
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,893
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WE'D
REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE

170
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,770
BUT TO LEAVE
YOUR COUNTRY.

171
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,606
I UNDERSTAND AND I'VE CONVEYED
YOUR CONCERNS TO THE ARMY.

172
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,859
YOUR HIGHNESS...
WHY NOT TAKE SOME TIME

173
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,070
TO PAY A COURTESY VISIT
TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE?

174
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,031
IT WOULD GREATLY
IMPROVE THE MORALE

175
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,116
OF THE SOLDIERS AND
ENGINEERS‐‐

176
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,909
SO THAT SHE CAN
BE ASSASSINATED?

177
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,161
Marina:
SHIRIN!

178
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,580
AMBASSADOR CORNER,
WHY DID THE UNITED NATIONS

179
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,083
DECIDE TO GRANT TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE TO AZADISTAN?

180
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,793
IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES

181
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,795
THAT
ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY BACKWARDS.

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,797
SO WHY WOULD YOU HELP US?

183
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,384
THE SIMPLEST ANSWER IS THAT
YOU REQUESTED OUR ASSISTANCE.

184
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,720
THE UNITED NATIONS WISHES TO
EXTEND ITS SUPPORT

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,263
TO ALL THE
LANDS OF THE MIDDLE EAST,

186
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO
MAKE A MODEL CASE

187
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,100
OUT OF THE
KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN.

188
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,729
AND THE EXISTENCE OF CELESTIAL
BEING IS A CONCERN AS WELL.

189
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,731
CELESTIAL BEING...

190
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,066
THEY SEEK THE ERADICATION
OF WAR

191
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,611
AND SINCE THE MIDDLE
EAST IS PLAGUED BY PERPETUAL,

192
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,198
ALBEIT SMALL, CONFLICTS, THEIR
INTERVENTION IS INEVITABLE.

193
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,450
RATHER THAN SENDING
ASSISTANCE TO REBUILD,

194
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,494
I BELIEVE IT IS FAR
MORE BENEFICIAL

195
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,121
TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE
CONFLICTS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

196
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,999
THAT'S A NOBLE
SENTIMENT, INDEED.

197
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,335
AMBASSADOR...
CAN YOU SWEAR BY YOUR GOD

198
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,879
THAT THOSE FEELINGS
AND SENTIMENTS ARE TRUE?

199
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,424
ABSOLUTELY. AND
BY YOUR GOD AS WELL...

200
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,343
FOR AZADISTAN'S FUTURE.

201
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,636
(Ice clinks)

202
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,679
WHAT IS IT, ALLELUJAH?

203
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,640
LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE
ANGRY WITH ME TOO?

204
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,141
YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT,

205
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,435
SO I WOULDN'T BLAME
YOU ONE BIT.

206
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,605
I'M SORRY FOR BEING SUCH
A LOUSY TACTICAL FORECASTER.

207
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,524
UH, ARE YOU DRUNK?

208
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,150
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

209
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,027
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT TAKING IT EASY.

210
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,321
NO WAY. THIS IS THE
ONLY THING

211
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,365
THAT MAKES ME
WANT TO KEEP ON LIVING.

212
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,701
LISTEN...IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING‐‐

213
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,329
I HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR
A MISSION PLAN

214
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,747
I WANT TO
RUN BY YOU AND VEDA.

215
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
A MISSION PLAN?

216
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,210
YES, IT'S AN
ARMED INTERVENTION MISSION

217
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,212
AGAINST AN INSTITUTE
THAT PROMOTES WAR.

218
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,298
THIS INSTITUTE IS A VERY
IMPORTANT PLACE FROM MY PAST.

219
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,552
I'VE COLLECTED DETAILED
DATA ON IT.

220
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,222
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK
AT IT WHEN YOU'RE SOBER.

221
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,015
EXCUSE ME.

222
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,809
(Door slides open)

223
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,269
(Door closes)

224
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,937
HUH?

225
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,691
HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE,
SUPER SOLDIER SPECIAL DUTY

226
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,985
IT IS TRUE!

227
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,446
I'M GOING TO END THIS
NIGHTMARE ONCE AND FOR ALL!

228
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,739
AND THIS TIME...

229
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,491
IT'LL BE MY WILL!

230
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,956
Louise's mother:
OOH!

231
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,208
MY GOODNESS, LOUISE!
THE FACT YOU CAN

232
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,211
PREPARE JAPANESE
FOOD SO PERFECTLY AMAZES ME!

233
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,006
COME ON, TRY SOME! I SWEAR
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD!

234
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,593
MMM...

235
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,886
OH!

236
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,012
IT'S GOOD, HUH?

237
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,139
YES, IT'S VERY GOOD.

238
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,309
HEY MOM SAYS THE MEAL
IS VERY GOOD... SAJI!

239
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,602
WHAT?

240
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,520
UH...THANK YOU.

241
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,148
WELL, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN
COOK DOESN'T MEAN I APPROVE OF

242
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,567
YOU HAVING A RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

243
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,944
I MUST ADMIT, THOUGH

244
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,696
THAT I DO APPROVE
OF YOUR COOKING.

245
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,823
WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
YOU LIKE IT, MA'AM.

246
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,659
DEAD END.

247
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,078
MISS KINUE,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

248
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,081
HOW WE CAN TRACE THE
MOVEMENTS OF AEOLIA SCHENBERG?

249
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,375
ALL OF HIS RELATIVES ARE DEAD
AND EVEN IF YOU TRIED

250
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,961
TO TRACK HIS FINANCES,
DATA SECURITY WAS FULL OF HOLES

251
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,504
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

252
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,091
I MEAN, IT COULD'VE BEEN ALTERED
BY NOW. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

253
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,885
I KNOW, THAT'S
WHY WE'RE SITTING HERE...

254
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,595
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

255
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,055
IT'S THEM!

256
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,139
WHO ARE THEY?

257
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,891
THEY'RE FROM THE UNION'S
SECURITY BUREAU.

258
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,602
HUH? FROM THE
UNION SECURITY BUREAU?

259
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,438
THEY'RE ALSO AFTER AEOLIA AND
I RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION

260
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,066
THAT THEY'VE BEEN HERE
THREE TIMES ALREADY THIS MONTH.

261
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,902
THIS IS PRETTY RISKY STUFF,
MISS KINUE!

262
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,279
LOOK, IF THEY FIND
OUT WHAT WE'RE UP TO...

263
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,908
WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE...
MISS KINUE!

264
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,743
I LOOKED AT EVERYTHING...

265
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,621
THE MISSION PLAN,
AS WELL AS YOUR PAST HISTORY.

266
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,749
WE DO HAVE GROUNDS FOR AN
ARMED INTERVENTION AND VEDA

267
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,001
HAS RECOMMENDED THE
OPERATION AS WELL.

268
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,505
BUT ARE YOU SURE GOING AFTER
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE YOU...

269
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,215
NO PROBLEM.

270
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,883
WHAT DOES
THE OTHER YOU SAY?

271
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
THERE'S NO NEED
TO ASK HIM.

272
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,971
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

273
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,182
I'LL FACE MY OWN PAST...
AND I WILL DO IT ALONE.

274
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,226
VERY WELL, THEN.

275
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,692
EXIA, DYNAMES...YOU'LL CARRY OUT
AN ARMED INTERVENTION

276
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,193
IN THE
CONFLICT ZONE

277
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,529
ALONG THE SOUTH AFRICAN
BORDER AS PLANNED.

278
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,197
AFTER THE TWO MACHINES
HAVE LAUNCHED,

279
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,616
THE PTOLEMY WILL
SET COURSE FOR LAGRANGE FOUR.

280
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,202
WE'LL BE MOVING AGAINST A HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE INSTITUTE

281
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,746
SITUATED AT THE
QUANQUI SPACE COLONY.

282
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,797
(Machines humming)

283
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,341
Feldt:
LAUNCH PREPARATIONS COMPLETE.

284
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,510
TRANSFERRING TIMING
CONTROL OVER TO EXIA.

285
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,513
DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY
JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT THERE.

286
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,056
ROGER THAT.

287
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,767
EXIA, SETSUNA F. SEIEI...
HEADING OUT.

288
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,228
(Whoosh)

289
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,900
Feldt:
NEXT... PREPARING FOR
DYNAMES' LAUNCH SEQUENCE.

290
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,820
COMMENCING CONTAINER LOADING.

291
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,989
DYNAMES TO THE CATAPULT DECK.

292
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,199
I'VE LOOKED AT
THE MISSION PLAN

293
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,410
AS WELL AS YOUR
PAST HISTORY.

294
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,747
BUT ARE YOU SURE GOING AFTER
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE YOU...

295
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,957
NO PROBLEM.

296
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,710
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM.
I SEE.

297
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,919
HE IS...

298
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,800
HUMANITY... HOW COULD PEOPLE
EVER DO ANYTHING SO FOOLISH?

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,185
THEY JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHERE
YOUR GREAT‐GRANDFATHER WENT?

300
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,313
YES. I WAS TOLD
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

301
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,815
THE SECURITY BUREAU HAS
BEEN GATHERING INFORMATION

302
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,734
ON MY GREAT‐GRANDFATHER,
WHO WENT MISSING

303
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,486
A LITTLE OVER
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

304
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,863
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT KIND
OF PERSON HE WAS?

305
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,699
THEY TELL ME HE WAS AN AUTHORITY
IN MATERIALS ENGINEERING

306
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,618
BUT I DON'T
KNOW THE DETAILS.

307
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,164
SO IN THE END WE
STILL HAVE NO CLUES.

308
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,459
NOT NECESSARILY. IT SEEMS
LIKE AEOLIA SCHENBERG

309
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,128
WAS PROBABLY SCOUTING
AND RECRUITING SCIENTISTS

310
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,130
HE COULD USE FOR HIS PROJECT
EVEN BACK THEN.

311
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,007
GRANTED YOU
CAN HACK INTO DATA

312
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,884
BUT YOU CAN'T DO
THAT WITH PEOPLE.

313
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,386
IT'S STARTING
TO COME INTO FOCUS...

314
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,014
THE SHADOW OF A MAN WHO
DIED TWO CENTURIES AGO.

315
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398
(Boom)

316
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,399
(Boom)

317
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,742
AN EASY WIN DOWN HERE,

318
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,744
BUT I WONDER HOW
THE OTHER TWO ARE DOING.

319
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,456
Feldt:
KYRIOS, VIRTUE...
LAUNCHES COMPLETE.

320
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,502
0042 UNTIL MISSION START TIME.

321
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,713
Lasse:
HUH, SO THAT'S THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE'S SPACE COLONY.

322
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,591
I HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT I'D
SET EYES ON THIS PLACE AGAIN...

323
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,766
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THESE GUYS, LIKE WE PLANNED.

324
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,518
YOU TAKE OUT THE TARGET.

325
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,769
I APPRECIATE THAT.

326
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,273
IF THAT MAN IS BEING CORRUPTED

327
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,816
BY THE THING HE
CALLS A PAST

328
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,278
THEN HE NEEDS TO PURIFY
HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN HANDS.

329
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,197
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE A GUNDAM MEISTER!

330
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,077
(Guns blasting)

331
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,205

332
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:06,215

SECURITY INFILTRATION

00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,936
FROM HERE ON IN...
I'LL JUST WING IT!

337
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,940
HUH?
WHAT?

338
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,692
A GUNDAM!

339
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,194
IT'S CELESTIAL BEING!

340
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,778
WHERE ARE THE
DEFENSE FORCES?

341
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,197
THEY'RE FIGHTING ANOTHER
GUNDAM OUTSIDE!

342
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,115
SEAL THE HATCH
IMMEDIATELY!

343
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,576
IT'S NO GOOD, SIR!
THE DATA'S BEEN OVERWRITTEN!

344
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,036
THE GUNDAM'S
ENTERING THE COLONY!

345
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,791
HUH? I'M CAUGHT UP
IN THE AIR CURRENTS!

346
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,294
SYNCHRONIZING KYRIOS
TO COLONY ROTATION.

347
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,924
CELESTIAL BEING IS HERE?!

348
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,383
DON'T THEY KNOW
THERE'S A TREATY

349
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,886
PROHIBITING ANY
COMBAT INSIDE COLONIES?!

350
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,763
TERRORISTS DON'T CARE
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT!

351
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,389
BUT WHAT'S THEIR OBJECTIVE?

352
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,645
JUST AS MISS SUMERAGI
FORECASTED...

353
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,688
THEY WON'T
FIGHT INSIDE THE COLONY.

354
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,898
(Gasps)

355
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,651
(Young voices screaming)

356
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,904
THEY'RE HERE...
THE ONES LIKE ME...

357
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,697
IN THAT ACCURSED PLACE!

358
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,994
LET'S GO!

359
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,955
I WON'T HESITATE

360
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,915
BECAUSE I'M A GUNDAM MEISTER!

361
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,208
(Children screaming):
STOP IT!

362
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,417
IT HURTS!

363
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,796
MY HEAD...

364
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,423
OWW! OWW!

365
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,842
IS IT NECESSARY TO
KILL THEM?

366
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,762
I MEAN I COULD TAKE
THEM INTO CUSTODY...

367
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,055
YOU'RE SO WEAK...

368
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,723
HALLELUJAH?

369
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,351
TAKE THEM INTO CUSTODY,
HOW? HOW WILL YOU RAISE THEM?

370
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,311
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO
LIVE A NORMAL LIFE

371
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,188
AFTER ESCAPING THIS PLACE?

372
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,648
(Chuckles)

373
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,650
STOP THINKING ABOUT
THINGS YOU CAN'T CHANGE!

374
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,445
I KNOW BUT...THEY'LL HAVE LIVES
OF MISERY IF I JUST LEAVE THEM!

375
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,489
MISERY?

376
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,616
MISERY, YOU SAY...

377
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,285
THOSE KIDS IN THE LAB

378
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,245
DON'T THINK OF THEMSELVES
AS MISERABLE.

379
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,456
BUT THEY'LL FEEL
THAT WAY EVENTUALLY!

380
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,293
WELL, DO YOU THINK THAT
GIRL FLYING THE TIEREN

381
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,378
FEELS SHE HAS
A MISERABLE LIFE?

382
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,588
THAT'S NOT THE CASE, IS IT?

383
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,300
DON'T PUSH YOUR OWN FEELINGS
ONTO OTHERS.

384
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,719
NO MATTER WHAT
PRETTY WORDS YOU STRING

385
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,929
TOGETHER, YOUR KINDNESS
IS JUST HYPOCRISY.

386
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,723
YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE NICE

387
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,683
JUST TO MAKE YOURSELF
FEEL BETTER.

388
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,476
BUT THEY'RE ALIVE!

389
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
THEY'RE NOT HUMAN ANY MORE!

390
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,606
ONE DAY THEY'RE GOING TO COME
AND TRY TO KILL US!

391
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,319
SHOW THE ENEMY NO MERCY!
BUT YOU DO HAVE AN OPTION...

392
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,154
I COULD TAKE OVER AGAIN.

393
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,905
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO
CLOSE YOUR EYES

394
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,657
TO WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

395
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,993
AND THEN SAY YOU DID NOTHING
WRONG AFTER IT'S ALL OVER?

396
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,579
I'M WILLING TO KILL THEM....

397
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,998
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYONE ELSE!

398
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,625
I FIGHT TO
ENSURE MY OWN SURVIVAL!

399
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,002
I'M NOT LIKE YOU!

400
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,796
THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

401
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,466
I CAME HERE BECAUSE I'M A
MEMBER OF CELESTIAL BEING.

402
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,176
NO, YOU CAME HERE TO KILL.

403
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,887
I DIDN'T! I CAME HERE
AS A GUNDAM MEISTER!

404
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,181
YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR JOB?

405
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,808
AT LEAST PULL THE
TRIGGER WITH YOUR OWN EMOTIONS!

406
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,852
PULL IT FOR YOURSELF!

407
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,980
AND DO IT WITHOUT MERCY!

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,649
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT...

409
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,567
ALLELUJAH!

410
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,986
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT!

411
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,990

412
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,412

00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,341

414
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,094
(Hallelujah laughing)

415
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,261
GOOD WORK!

416
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,597
THAT WAS NICELY DONE,
MY OTHER SELF!

417
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,141
THINGS ARE SURE
GOING TO GET INTERESTING.

418
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,232
THE SENSORS ARE PICKING UP
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE RETURNING.

419
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,900
THE MISSION'S COMPLETE.

420
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,027
CHRISTINA, GO AHEAD AND
LEAK THE INFORMATION

421
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,445
ABOUT THE SUPER
SOLDIER INSTITUTE

422
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,822
TO THE MEDIA AS PLANNED.

423
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,989
ROGER THAT.

424
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,408
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE HRL

425
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,867
WAS REBUILDING ITS
SOLDIERS' BODIES.

426
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994
THIS'LL BE A
MONSTER SCANDAL!

427
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,079
STOP THAT!

428
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,791
ALLELUJAH...

429
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,211
Sergei:
APPARENTLY CELESTIAL BEING
ATTACKED QUANQIU.

430
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,548
THEY TARGETED THE SUPER
SOLDIER INSTITUTE YOU BELONG TO.

431
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,842
HUH?
THEY... THEY WHAT?

432
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,970
AN ATTACK ON A FACILITY
THAT WAS A SECRET EVEN TO ME.

433
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,140
ONE OF THE GUNDAM
PILOTS HAD TO BE

434
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,016
FROM THE
SUPER SOLDIER INSTITUTE...

435
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,519
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

436
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,770
AM I WRONG?

437
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,440
NO, I...I HAD NO IDEA.

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,025
I'M USING MY AUTHORITY TO
CLOSE DOWN THIS FACILITY.

439
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,110
(Gasps)

440
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,570
AND YOU'LL BE THOROUGHLY
INTERROGATED.

441
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,281
I'M... I'M GOING TO BE WHAT?
JUST A MINUTE HERE!

442
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,824
THE WHOLE SORRY INCIDENT

443
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,701
HAS ALREADY BEEN LEAKED
TO THE WORLD.

444
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,619
YOU FAILED
TO REPORT THIS PROPERLY

445
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,830
FORCING US INTO AN
UNFAVORABLE SITUATION.

446
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,082
YOUR CRIMES
ARE VERY GRAVE.

447
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,375
TAKE HIM AWAY.

448
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,960
HUH?

449
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,006
CELESTIAL BEING IS GOING TO GET
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THIS...

450
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,468
COLONEL SMIRNOV.

451
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,344
STILL ON STANDBY, LIEUTENANT.

452
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,054
GET BACK TO YOUR STATION.

453
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,097
SIR.

454
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,065
(Sighs)

455
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,987
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
ALLELUJAH?

456
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,490
HAVE YOU COME UP
WITH A NEW MISSION?

457
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,993
MISS SUMERAGI...CAN I
HAVE A GLASS OF THAT, TOO?

458
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,786
AND THE REASON?

459
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,873
I JUST REALLY WANT ONE.

460
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,752
BUT YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH
YET. I'D BE BREAKING THE LAW.

461
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,254
BUT WE'RE ALREADY
NOTORIOUS TERRORISTS.

462
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,757
NEVERTHELESS, I CAN'T
GIVE YOU A DRINK.

463
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,300
BUT IT'S OKAY NOW.

464
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,302
HUH?

465
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,679
ACCORDING TO
GREENWICH MEAN TIME...

466
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,475
I JUST CAME OF AGE
A FEW MINUTES AGO...

467
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,893
IS THAT SO...

468
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,394
(Clink)

469
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,563
THIS MIGHT SOUND STRANGE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

470
