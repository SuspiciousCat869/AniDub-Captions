Alejandro:

AEOLIA SCHENBERG!

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,804
YOU SHOULD BE HONORED THAT I,

6
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:18,558
JUST TRY IT!

IF IT WORKS, YOU COULD AT LEAST
BLOW ITS ARMS OFF!

14
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:49,256
ROGER THAT!

15
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,679
WELL, DID IT WORK?

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,680
NEGATIVE.

(Chuckling wickedly)

19
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,979
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT
THE ALVATORE

20
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,731
WITH JUST THAT
PATHETIC LITTLE THING?

A SINGLE GUNDAM IS
DESTROYING MY ALVATORE!

YOU'RE FAR FROM BEING
A PERFECT SUPER‐SOLDIER!

117
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:02,436
YOUR QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES
GIVE YOU SUPER REFLEXES,

118
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,730
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOUR MIND
IS TOO SLUGGISH

119
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,108
TO KEEP UP WITH
THAT KIND OF REACTION SPEED!

120
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,527
YOU'RE JUST ACTING ON INSTINCT,
LIKE AN ANIMAL!

121
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,154
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:25,877
IT'S BEGINNING TO GLOW!

Sergei:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NEVER MIND ABOUT ME!

147
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,469
KEEP FIGHTING, LIEUTENANT!

148

I CAN'T!
HUH?

150

EVEN WITH A NOVICE PILOT!

168
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,867
SO YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TWISTED
AEOLIA'S ORIGINAL PLAN!

169
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,995
THIS IS ALL
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN!

170
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:27,415
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE NOW IS
I'VE BECOME THE LEAD ACTOR!

171
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:28,791
OH, YES!

172
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,336
THE LEAD ROLE BELONGS TO ME,
ALEJANDRO CORNER!

173
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,422
Setsuna:
WHAT DO YOU WANT
OUT OF ALL THIS?

174
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,967
Alejandro:
DESTRUCTION AND REBIRTH.

175
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,218
WHAT?

176
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,470
CELESTIAL BEING'S
ARMED INTERVENTIONS

177
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,015
HAVE DESTROYED
THE WORLD AS WE KNEW IT.

178
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,434
SO THAT IT CAN BE
REBORN IN UNITY!

179
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,311
AND NOW I WILL MAKE SURE

180
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,980
THAT THE WORLD IS REMADE
IN MY IMAGE!

181
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,691
Setsuna:
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT TO RULE THE WORLD?

182
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:56,319
I'M SAYING I'LL GUIDE IT
PROPERLY!

183
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:00,197
BUT, IN THAT NEW WORLD,
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU!

184
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:03,534
YOU'LL BE SWEPT AWAY LIKE DUST!
DIE, EXIA!

185
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,120
(Blast)

186
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,434
(Alejandro laughing)

187
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,853
(Laughing wickedly)

188
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:33,856
HOW UNFORTUNATE FOR YOU,
AEOLIA SCHENBERG!

189
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:36,150
THE ONE WHO WILL
ACTUALLY UNITE THE WORLD

190
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,487
AND GUIDE HUMANITY INTO
A NEW ERA WILL BE ME,

191
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,364
A PERSON WHO IS
LIVING IN THE PRESENT!

192
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:42,365
(Alarm beeping)

193
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:45,576
HUH?

194
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:47,244
IS...IS THAT‐‐

195
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,205
Alejandro:
EXIA!

196
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,082
DAMN AEOLIA'S SYSTEM!

197
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:52,249
Setsuna:
I'VE FOUND IT.

198
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,709
FOUND WHAT?

199
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,087
I'VE FOUND THE TWISTED
DISTORTION IN THIS WORLD!

200
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,296
THAT'S RIGHT!

201
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,048
(Screaming)
AND YOU'RE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE!

202
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,387
Alejandro:
THE REBIRTH
HAS ALREADY BEGUN!

203
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,305
YET YOU CONTINUE
TO DESTROY!

204
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,890
OF COURSE I DO!

205
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,025
HIS GN FIELD!

206
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,402
(Growling)

207
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,779
Lockon:
SETSUNA,
DO YOU KNOW WHY

208
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,989
EXIA IS EQUIPPED WITH
A PHYSICAL SWORD?

209
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,244
IT'S A COUNTERMEASURE
AGAINST GN FIELDS.

210
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:29,912
THE PLAN HAS PROVISIONS

211
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,914
FOR FIGHTING AGAINST
OTHER GUNDAMS AS WELL.

212
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,918
IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN,
YOU WOULD BE OUR TRUMP CARD.

213
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:38,754
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU,
SETSUNA.

214
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:45,469
(Thinking)
I KNOW, LOCKON. I'M A DESTROYER
WHO KNOWS ONLY HOW TO FIGHT.

215
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:49,515
BUT I FIGHT TO DEFEAT THOSE
WHO BRING ABOUT CONFLICT!

216
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,851
AND NOW I'LL DESTROY
THE TWISTEDNESS!

217
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,776
YOU BASTARD!

218
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:05,239
Setsuna:
THE ERADICATION OF WAR
THROUGH FORCE!

219
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,616
THAT IS CELESTIAL BEING!

220
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:09,743
MY FIELD IS GONE!

221
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:12,329
Setsuna:
AND THE GUNDAM WILL DO IT!

222
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,957
TOGETHER WITH ME!

223
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,333
THAT'S RIGHT!

224
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,294
THAT'S WHAT I AM!

225
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:24,091
WHAT ALL OF US ARE!
WE'RE GUNDAMS!

226
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,303
(Electricity flashing)

227
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,597
HMM?

228
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:31,891
RI... RIBBONS...

229
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:35,144
ALEJANDRO CORNER.
YOU PLAYED THE JESTER SO WELL.

230
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,353
I WHAT?

231
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,855
I SHOULD TELL YOU

232
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,857
THIS IS NO LONGER
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S PLAN.

233
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:42,526
YOU SEE,
IT HAS NOW BECOME MY PLAN.

234
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:45,613
(Struggling)
BUT, RIBBONS! HOW COULD YOU!

235
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,406
KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE LEAVING
THE FUTURE

236
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,700
OF THE UNIFIED WORLD
IN MY HANDS.

237
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,745
YOU TRAITOR! THIS IS
THE CORNER FAMILY'S DREAM!

238
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,788
THAT OBSESSION IS PRECISELY

239
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,832
WHAT MAKES YOU SUCH
A SMALL MAN.

240
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:58,792
RIBBONS!

241
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,254
(Boom)

242
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,261
(Panting)

243
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:10,596
(Beeping)

244
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,641
Setsuna:
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?

245
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,269
(Gasping)
IT'S A FLAG!

246
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,480
WITH A PSEUDO SOLAR REACTOR!

247
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,066
Graham:
I'VE SO WANTED TO MEET YOU.

248
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,235
I'VE WANTED TO MEET YOU
SO MUCH. GUNDAM!

249
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,495
THAT'S A BEAM SABER!

250
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,038
(Gasping)

251
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:39,458
Graham:
I WILL AVENGE HOWARD AND DARYL
WITH THIS GN FLAG!

252
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,793
HE'S HAILING ME!

253
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:42,378
(Gasps)

254
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,800
SO IT'S YOU!

255
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,386
Graham:
WHAT'S THIS?
YOU'RE THAT BOY!

256
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:55,057
IT SEEMS THAT OUR DESTINIES
HAVE BEEN CONNECTED ALL ALONG!

257
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:58,060
Graham:
INDEED! WE WERE DESTINED
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER!

258
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,479
Graham:
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND!

259
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,231
(Setsuna growls)

260
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:04,942
Graham: IT WAS YOUR
DISPLAY OF OVERWHELMING POWER

261
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,610
THAT STOLE MY HEART!

262
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,237
THAT FEELING I HAD,

263
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:10,155
CAN ONLY BE CALLED LOVE!

264
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,448
LOVE?

265
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:15,661
BUT IF YOU GO BEYOND LOVE,
IT BECOMES HATRED.

266
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:17,871
JUST AS PEOPLE TURN ON
EACH OTHER

267
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,582
WHEN THEY TAKE
RELIGIOUS FAITH TOO FAR!

268
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,126
(Growling)
IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT,

269
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:25,129
THEN WHY
DO YOU STILL FIGHT?

270
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,298
Graham:
YOU'RE ASKING A SOLDIER
WHY HE FIGHTS?

271
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,924
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

272
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,221
Setsuna:
YOU'VE BECOME TWISTED!

273
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,890
Graham:
YOU MADE ME THIS WAY!

274
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,267
(Growling)

275
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,894
Graham:
THIS IS BECAUSE
THE GUNDAMS EXIST!

276
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,193
THAT'S THE REAL REASON
I'M TAKING YOU OUT!

277
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:50,195
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

278
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:51,905
THIS IS MY OWN WILL!

279
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:53,532
DON'T KID YOURSELF!

280
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,492
YOU'RE A PART OF THIS WORLD,
AS WELL!

281
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:58,454
Graham:
THEN CONSIDER THIS
THE VOICE OF THE WORLD!

282
00:15:58,454 --> 00:15:59,830
YOU'RE NOT!

283
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,916
YOU'RE JUST FORCING YOUR
OWN DISTORTED EGO ON OTHERS!

284
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,002
AND NOW I'M COMING FOR YOU!

285
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,962
TO CUT THAT TWISTED PART
OUT OF YOU!

286
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:09,089
WELL SAID, GUNDAM!

287
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,924
(Aggressive yell)

288
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,968
(Aggressive yell)

289
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,396
(Boom)

290
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,022
YOU SEE, HOWARD?

291
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,065
DARYL,
I'VE AVENGED YOU.

292
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,150
(Boom)

293
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,443
(Gasping)

294
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:31,777
GUNDAM.

295
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:46,292
(Alarm beeping)

296
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,835
(Struggling)

297
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:53,132
(Gasping)
THIS ISN'T THE END.

298
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:56,385
THE PLAN, NO MATTER WHAT,
THE PLAN CONTINUES.

299
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,012
(Wincing)

300
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,726
Tieria:
I HAVE TO AT LEAST
SAVE THE SOLAR REACTOR.

301
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:16,322
Feldt (gasps):
NADLEEH EJECTED ITS GN DRIVE.

302
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:18,199
TIERIA.

303
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:19,951
(Struggling to breath)

304
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,245
NOW I CAN FINALLY GO

305
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:27,583
TO WHERE YOU HAVE GONE,
LOCKON.

306
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,087
(Electrical buzzing)

307
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:33,047
(Gasping)

308
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,507
IT CAN'T BE.

309
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:37,301
THAT PILOT SOMA PERIES
IS ACTUALLY MARIE!

310
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,554
DID YOU KNOW THAT,
HALLELUJAH?

311
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:42,139
IF YOU'D KNOWN,

312
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:45,476
YOU WOULD NO LONGER FIGHT BACK.
YOU WOULD JUST DIE.

313
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,270
(Startled sigh)

314
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,815
DON'T WORRY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER EITHER WAY.

315
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:52,316
(Chuckles)

316
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,527
I'LL BE GOING FIRST.

317
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,071
HALLELUJAH?

318
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,322
DOES THIS MEAN...

319
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,324
IT CAN'T BE.

320
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,703
(Sadly)
HALLELUJAH.

321
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:13,212
(Setsuna's voice reading letter)
MARINA ISMAIL.

322
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:20,219
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS,

323
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:22,597
I WILL NO LONGER BE
IN THIS WORLD.

324
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:28,769
THE ERADICATION OF WAR
THROUGH THE USE OF ARMED FORCE.

325
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,315
ALL I KNEW HOW TO DO WAS FIGHT.
BUT CELESTIAL BEING

326
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,817
GAVE ME A REASON
WHY I SHOULD FIGHT.

327
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,695
LIKE THAT DAY I SAW THE GUNDAM.

328
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:42,116
I WANTED TO KNOW,
WHY WAS THE WORLD SO TWISTED?

329
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:48,331
WHERE DID THIS TWISTEDNESS
COME FROM?

330
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:53,252
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO WICKED
WITHOUT MEANING TO BE?

331
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:57,840
AND WHY DON'T THEY REALIZE
THEIR WICKEDNESS?

332
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,762
WHY ARE THERE THINGS THAT
BRING CHAOS TO SO MANY LIVES?

333
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:07,224
WHY DO PEOPLE RULE,
AND LET THEMSELVES BE RULED?

334
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,895
AND WHY DO THEY
HURT EACH OTHER?

335
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:13,356
AND WHY, DESPITE ALL THAT,

336
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:16,525
DO PEOPLE STILL WANT TO
LIVE THEIR LIVES?

337
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:20,237
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

338
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,782
I THOUGHT THAT
IF I MET WITH YOU,

339
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,284
YOU'D GIVE ME THOSE ANSWERS.

340
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:27,912
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE SAME THING,

341
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,414
ALONG A DIFFERENT PATH
FROM MINE.

342
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:34,293
FOR THE PATH WHERE PEOPLE CAN
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER,

343
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,837
FOR THOSE ANSWERS.

345
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:46,389
I WAS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,
TOGETHER WITH MY GUNDAM...

346
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,892

I'D TRY ONE MORE TIME

350
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:05,991
SINCE I'VE GOT SOME REALLY
EXCITING NEWS

351
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:07,785
THAT I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU.

BEGINNING THIS YEAR,

353

I'VE ACTUALLY STARTED
WORKING IN SPACE.

354
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,003
A LOT OF SAD THINGS
HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY,

355
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:21,007
BUT AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO
MAKE ONE SMALL DREAM COME TRUE.

356
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:25,177
SO I WANT YOU TO LET ME MAKE
THE OTHER DREAM COME TRUE TOO.

357

LOOK AT THAT.

361
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,442
IS THAT A TRAIL OF LIGHT
FROM GN PARTICLES?

362
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,110
WHOSE SHIP
COULD THAT BE?

363
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,362
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ONE OF THE FEDERATION'S.

WHAT?

365

THE PARTICLES
ARE A DIFFERENT COLOR.

366

HUH...
YEAH.
