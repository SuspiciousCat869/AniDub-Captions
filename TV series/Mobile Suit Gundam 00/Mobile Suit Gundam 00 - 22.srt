00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,297
Lasse:
COME IN, PTOLEMAOIS.
THIS IS LASSE IN THE GN ARMS.

2
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:11,757
I'M READY...

3
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:14,635
I AM NOW ENTERING DOCKING
SEQUENCE WITH ASSAULT CONTAINER.

4
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:15,970
Christina:
ROGER.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,347
Lasse:
VELOCITY RELATIVE TO
CONTAINER, OKAY.

6
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,807
NAVIGATION LASER, LOCK ON.

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,851
(Laser humming)

8
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:35,990
Lasse:
GN ARMS DOCKING WITH
ASSAULT CONTAINER COMPLETE.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,118
GOOD WORK, LASSE.
YOU FOUGHT WELL OUT THERE.

10
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:42,037
HEY, OLD MAN,
WHAT'S LOCKON'S CONDITION LIKE?

11
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:45,165
FORTUNATELY, HIS INJURIES
AREN'T THAT LIFE‐THREATENING,

12
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:48,002
BUT... HIS SHOOTING EYE
WAS INJURED.

13
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,212
RIGHT NOW HE'S IN
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

14
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,465
DR. MORENO, HOW LONG
DO YOU EXPECT

15
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:54,967
IT WILL TAKE HIM
TO REGENERATE IT?

16
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,345
HE'LL NEED AT LEAST THREE WEEKS
TO HEAL THE DAMAGE.

17
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,640
I'M SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS,
BUT ONCE HE'S IN THE CAPSULE,

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,350
THERE'S NO COMING OUT
UNTIL HE'S FULLY HEALED.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,477
PLEASE, DO ALL
YOU CAN FOR HIM.

20
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,604
WHILE HE UNDERGOES TREATMENT,

21
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,565
WE'LL RETURN TO THE DOCK
AND REPAIR THE GUNDAMS.

22
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,774
Lockon:
HEY, COME ON...

23
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,735
DOESN'T MY OPINION
COUNT HERE?

24
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,319
LOCKON.

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,822
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
THE ENEMY MIGHT SHOW UP AGAIN.

26
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:18,240
JUST FORGET THE TREATMENT
FOR NOW.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,743
COME ON, YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO SHOOT ACCURATELY

28
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,036
WITH THAT KIND OF INJURY.

29
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,579
HARO AND I MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM,

30
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,330
SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US.

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,749
OF COURSE!
OF COURSE!

32
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:28,792
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

33
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:32,588
THERE'S A GUY WHO MUST FEEL
PRETTY BAD THAT I'M IN HERE.

34
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:36,133
HE TRIES TO ACT TOUGH BUT
HE'S ACTUALLY A BIG SOFTIE.

35
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:41,638
Thinking:
BECAUSE I INSISTED ON
STICKING WITH VEDA,

36
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,223
HE WOUND UP GETTING HURT.

37
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:48,729
IT'S ALL... MY FAULT.

RIGHT NOW,
WE, THE UN FORCES,

44
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,243
HAVE DEVELOPED A
NEW MOBILE SUIT

45
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,995
CAPABLE OF
FIGHTING THE GUNDAMS.

46
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:31,707
AN ELITE UNIT HAS BEEN FORMED
USING THESE NEW MACHINES,

47
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,501
AND HAS NOW BEGUN
THE ELIMINATION OF THE GUNDAMS.

48
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,296
THIS OPERATION IS NAMED
"FALLEN ANGELS".

49
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,298
WELL, THEY'VE FINALLY
GONE PUBLIC WITH IT.

50
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,091
FUNNY, HE MAKES IT
SEEM LIKE

51
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:43,010
THEY CREATED THE MACHINES
ALL ON THEIR OWN.

52
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,137
HOW'S THE FLAG
COMING ALONG?

53
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,389
Katagiri:
TAKE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF.

54
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,267
Katagiri:
WE'RE GOING
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

55
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,728
I WISH YOU'D GIVEN US
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

56
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:55,022
I'M A VERY IMPATIENT MAN
RIGHT NOW.

57
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,690
I KNOW YOU ARE.

58

COLONEL, THE COMPRESSION
SPACE OF ALL THE GN DRIVES

60
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:15,667
HAS STABILIZED AT
CRITICAL LEVELS.

00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,337

Sergei:
ACTIVATE GN‐XS!

65
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,236
THE GUNDAM ELIMINATION
OPERATION HAS NOW RESUMED!

66
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:45,405
Sergei:
ALL GN‐X MACHINES,
MOVE OUT!

67
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,665
I WILL NOT LET YOU GET AWAY
THIS TIME, GUNDAMS.

68
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,926
Allelujah:
HOW ARE THE REPAIRS TO
THE GUNDAMS COMING ALONG?

69
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,844
Ian:
WE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO DEAL WITH

70
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:09,346
THE DAMAGE TO VIRTUE,
NO PROBLEM.

71
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,597
WHAT ABOUT DYNAMES?

72
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:12,182
THAT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

73
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,351
THE COCKPIT IS
SEVERELY DAMAGED.

74
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,103
IT'S MORE THAN
THE KARELS CAN HANDLE.

75
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,063
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE IT TO THE DOCK

76
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,815
AND REPLACE THE WHOLE UNIT.

77
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:24,444
WE'VE ONLY GOT
THREE WORKING GUNDAMS.

78
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,363
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE
WHOLE "FALLEN ANGELS"?

79
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:27,614
WHO ARE THEY KIDDING?

80
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:31,493
ARE THEY SAYING WE'RE
LUCIFER'S FALLEN ANGELS?

81
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,870
BY THE WAY,
WHERE'S FELDT AT?

82
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,664
SHE'S A LITTLE
DISTRACTED RIGHT NOW.

83
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,416
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

84
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,167
(Sighs)
YOU'RE SO CLUELESS.

85
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,919
ABOUT WHAT?

86
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,505
HUH?

87
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,882
IT'S LOCKON.

88
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:54,099
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU
GOING TO BE LIKE THIS?

89
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,351
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST NOT LIKE YOU.

90
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,521
I'D RATHER SEE YOU ACTING
OBNOXIOUS LIKE YOU USUALLY ARE.

91
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:01,898
I'VE LOST THEM.

92
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:03,108
WHAT?

93
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,402
I'VE LOST THE QUALITIES
I USED TO POSSESS

94
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:07,404
THAT MADE ME A MEISTER.

95
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,740
NOW THAT I'M NO LONGER ABLE
TO LINK DIRECTLY TO VEDA.

96
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,951
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

97
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,329
LINK DIRECTLY TO VEDA?

98
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,039
Feldt:
MISS SUMERAGI!

99
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,291
THERE WAS AN ERROR IN
VIRTUE'S SYSTEM TRANSFER!

100
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,877
THE ERROR MUST'VE OCCURRED
DURING THE SWITCH

101
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:23,920
TO THE NEW SYSTEM
BECAUSE TIERIA,

102
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,715
WHO WAS LINKED
AT THE TIME, BLOCKED IT
SOMEHOW.

103
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:29,384
BUT, IS THAT EVEN
POSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN?

104
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:32,763
I'M JUST...NOT WORTHY
TO BE A MEISTER.

105
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:35,640
SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE NOT WORTHY.

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,225
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM.

107
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,894
YOU DON'T?

108
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:41,438
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED IS
YOU CAN'T LINK WITH IT ANYMORE.

109
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:44,358
THINK OF IT AS BECOMING
LIKE THE REST OF US.

110
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:47,903
THE REAL PROBLEM IS SOMEONE
HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF VEDA.

111
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,322
WITHOUT VEDA,
THE PLAN JUST ISN'T...

112
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,656
WE CAN DO IT.

113
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:52,991
HUH?

114
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:56,620
WITH OUR GUNDAMS, WE'RE
FIGHTING TO ERADICATE WAR.

115
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:01,249
BUT THE PROBABILITY THAT WE
CAN CARRY OUT THE PLAN IS‐‐

116
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,877
ENOUGH WITH THE DOUBTS AND
SPECULATION, JUST DO IT.

117
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,504
YOU CAN FOLLOW
THE EXAMPLE OF THE GUY

118
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,631
WHO'S STANDING
RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

119
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,592
HE MAY BE A FOOL BUT
IF HE BELIEVES IN SOMETHING

120
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,387
HE GIVES IT HIS ALL.

121
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:17,182
HE GIVES HIS ALL IF HE
BELIEVES IN SOMETHING.

122
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:20,060
LATER. GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND GET SOME REST.

123
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,061
LOCKON, WAIT.

124
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:21,812
HMM?

125
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:24,106
I AM SORRY.

126
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:25,190
HMM.

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,150
IT'S LIKE MISS SUMERAGI
TOLD YOU.

128
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,821
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES,
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST HUMAN BEINGS.

129
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,787
HE'S SO KIND TO EVERYONE.

130
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:39,955

131
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:42,374
Michael:
I WANT SOME REAL MEAT!

132
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,126
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF
ALL THIS CANNED FOOD!

133
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,461
THIS IS SO GROSS,
I WANT SOMETHING SWEET!

134
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,255
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE
WE GOING TO HAVE

135
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:50,132
TO KEEP RUNNING LIKE THIS,
JOHANN?

136
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:52,634
AND WE'RE RUNNING LOW
ON PARTICLES, TOO!

137
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,594
WE'D LIKE YOU TO MAKE
ARRANGEMENTS

138
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:57,305
SO THAT WE CAN GET BACK UP
INTO SPACE WITH OUR MACHINES.

139
00:07:57,305 --> 00:08:00,976
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, AND I
WOULD REALLY LOVE TO HELP YOU,

140
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,394
BUT IT APPEARS THAT
YOU'VE RUN OUT OF TIME.

141
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:03,937
WE HAVE?

142
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:07,149
A TEAM FROM THE UN FORCES IS
ALREADY ON ITS WAY THERE.

143
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,608
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

144
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:09,943
YOU SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY.

145
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,778
(Annoyed)
MICHAEL! NENA!

146
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,947
COME ON, WE HAVE TO ACTIVATE
THE THRONES! HURRY UP!

147
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,326
Peries:
COLONEL!
I'VE LOCATED THE GUNDAMS.

148
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:20,579
POINT E‐8590.

149
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,290
ALL MACHINES,
ASSUME INTERCEPT FORMATION!

150
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,458
All together:
ROGER!

151
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,714
Johann:
MICHAEL, NENA,

152
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:33,383
THE PARTICLE GENERATION RATE OF
OUR DRIVES IS DECREASING.

153
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:35,510
DON'T WASTE THEM!

154
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,137
OKAY THEN!
ROGER THAT!

155
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:39,806
ONLY 30% LEFT.
SO BE IT!

156

Sergei:
SCATTER!

157
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:44,895
ARGH!

158
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,564
SORRY ABOUT THIS, JOHANN,

159
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:50,192
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
HOLD BACK AGAINST THESE GUYS!

160
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,151
FLY, MY FANGS!

161
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,947
ASSUME TIGHT FORMATION!

162
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,578
(Shots blasting)

163
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:06,791
STOP MESSING THIS UP!

164
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:10,378
Michael:
DAMN IT!

165
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:12,672
YOU GUYS ARE DEAD!

166
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:13,882
I'M COMING FOR YOU JERKS AGAIN!

167
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,433
Marina:
GUNDAMS ARE FIGHTING IN THE
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY OF DOGULU?

168
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:27,145
THE UN'S BEGUN ITS OPERATION
TO WIPE OUT THE GUNDAMS.

169
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,272
Marina:
THOSE MACHINES ARE...

170
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:30,482
(Sighs)

171
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,192
NONE OF THEM ARE SETSUNA'S.

172
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:41,201
I HOPE YOU SUFFER, GUNDAMS!

173
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,410
(Blasting)

174
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,411
(Boom)

175
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,749
Michael:
DAMN IT.
NENA!

176
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:49,334
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE
GOT MORE MACHINES...

177
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:52,212
Peries:
A CHILDISH ATTACK LIKE THAT!

178
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:53,380
YOU'LL NEVER HIT ME!

179
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,467
(Panicked scream)

180
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,344
THIS IS HOW
A SUPER SOLDIER FIGHTS!

181
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,304
PREPARE YOURSELF!

182
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,430
Michael:
JOHANN!

183
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:05,892
WE'RE WITHDRAWING!

184
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,477
(Gasping)
ROGER!

185
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,937
DAMN IT!

186
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,855
WE'RE PILOTING GUNDAMS,
AND WE STILL LOST?

187
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:15,986
YOU WON'T ESCAPE!

188
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,613
Sergei:
THERE'S NO NEED.

189
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:19,698
Peries:
BUT SIR...

190
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,242
REMEMBER, WE DESTROYED
THEIR HIDEOUT.

191
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:25,161
THEIR DRIVES WILL REACH THEIR
OPERATING LIMIT SOON ENOUGH.

192
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,627
Ribbons:
I'VE CLEARED LEVEL SIX.

193
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,879
I'M NOW BEGINNING
THE FINAL STAGE.

194
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:40,051
Alejandro:
THE USEFULNESS OF THE TRINITYS
IS ALMOST AT AN END.

195
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:43,972
I SUGGEST WE HAVE THEM
ENTERTAIN US ONE LAST TIME.

196
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:59,321
Ian:
THE UN FORCES HAVE FINALLY
ATTACKED THE TRINITYS.

197
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,782
BY DEFEATING THE GUNDAMS,

198
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:05,452
THE WORLD IS BEING
BROUGHT TOGETHER.

199
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:06,953
I HAVE TO WONDER,

200
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,205
WERE WE CREATED JUST SO
WE COULD BE DESTROYED?

201
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:10,957
THIS IS IT.

202
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:13,335
THIS WAS
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S PLAN.

203
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:14,919
Setsuna:
WELL,
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

204
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,590
WHY ARE THERE EVEN
GUNDAMS AT ALL?

205
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,800
GUNDAMS ARE HERE
TO ERADICATE WAR.

206
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,428
THAT'S THEIR PURPOSE.
HOWEVER,

207
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:28,141
TEAM TRINITY ESCALATED THE WAR,
AND THEN CAME THE UN FORCES.

208
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,394
IS THIS WHAT GUNDAMS
SHOULD BE DOING IN THE WORLD?

209
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,771
IS IT?

210
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,356
SETSUNA.

211
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:38,026
THE UN ATTACK ON THE TRINITYS
IS CLEARLY A CONFLICT SITUATION.

212
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,278
I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR
AN ARMED INTERVENTION HERE.

213
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,697
HEY, HOLD ON,
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

214
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,158
THAT'S CRAZY!
WE'RE TOO EXHAUSTED FOR THAT

215
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:47,869
AND THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS
HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN...

216
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,496
AND, THE LAST TIME
WE WERE ATTACKED,

217
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:52,248
IT WAS BECAUSE THE ENEMY TRACED
EXIA AND DYNAMES BACK HERE...

218
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:55,627
CELESTIAL BEING CANNOT
STAY QUIET DURING ALL THIS.

219
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,128
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SETSUNA?

220
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,588
YEAH.

221
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:02,967
YOU MIGHT NEVER BE ABLE TO
GET BACK UP INTO SPACE AGAIN.

222
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:06,554
THEN I'LL GO ALONE.
I HAVE TO CONFIRM FOR MYSELF

223
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:10,225
WHAT THE REAL PURPOSE OF
THE GUNDAMS IS.

224
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,435
I THINK I'LL BE GOING WITH YOU.

225
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,771
PEOPLE WITH INJURIES ARE
SUPPOSED TO RECUPERATE.

226
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,980
I'LL GO INSTEAD.

227
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,607
BUT, LASSE!

228
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:20,402
Lasse:
THE ASSAULT CONTAINER HAS
ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE CAPABILITIES.

229
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,778
THIS'LL ALSO
GIVE ME A CHANCE

230
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,155
TO DO SOME MORE PERFORMANCE
TESTING ON THE GN ARMS.

231
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:26,157
DIVIDING OUR FORCES
RIGHT NOW ISN'T A VERY GOOD‐‐

232
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,622
HERE'S A MISSION PLAN FOR YOU.

233
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,791
THOUGH I DON'T
KNOW HOW USEFUL YOU'LL FIND IT

234
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,335
WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES
SURROUNDING THE SITUATION.

235
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:41,172
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU COME BACK.

236
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,216
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

237
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:48,221
Christina:
LOADING OF EXIA INTO ASSAULT
CONTAINER NOW COMPLETE.

238
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,850
CONFIRMING GN DRIVE
IS LINKED TO CONTAINER.

239
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,644
PREPARATIONS FOR LAUNCH
ARE NOW COMPLETE.

240
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:58,898
SETSUNA, I REALLY HOPE YOU
FIND YOUR ANSWER DOWN THERE.

241
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:00,191
YEAH.

242
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,068
Feldt:
YOU HAVE CLEARANCE
TO BEGIN MISSION.

243
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:05,780
ROGER THAT. THIS IS ASSAULT
CONTAINER. LASSE, LAUNCHING.

244
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,908
(Engine blasts)

245
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,960
Lockon:
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANT TO GO, IT'S OKAY.

246
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,879
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SETSUNA,
AREN'T YOU?

247
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,047
SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST PATHETIC.

248
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:24,340
HUH?

249
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,884
WHAT WAS THAT?

250
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:33,016
WHAT DID HE MEAN
BY THAT?

251
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:33,975
BEATS ME.

252
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:38,563
Kati:
THERE'S A MACHINE ENTERING
THE ATMOSPHERE? WHOSE IS IT?

253
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:41,065
WE'RE UNSURE, MA'AM,
BUT THE OBSERVATION TEAM

254
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,777
DEFINITELY CONFIRMED
GN PARTICLES JUST BEFORE ENTRY.

255
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,904
UNDERSTOOD.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

256
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,281
IT'S CELESTIAL BEING.

257
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,700
ARE THEY PLANNING ON HELPING
THEIR COMRADES ON THE SURFACE?

258
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:56,915
(Nena screams)

259
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,417
Nena:
LOOK WHAT THEY DID
TO MY DREI!

260
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,960
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW,
JOHANN?

261
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,629
I'VE ASKED WANG LIU MEI

262
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,631
TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
TO GET US INTO SPACE.

263
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,925
YEAH, BUT CAN WE TRUST HER?

264
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:07,926
HUH?

265
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:09,093
WHAT'S THAT?

266
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,474
Johann:
IT'S AN AEU ENACT.

267
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:16,434
Michael:
IT'S SIGNALING US?

268
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,645
SAYS IT DOESN'T INTEND
TO ATTACK US.

269
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,814
NENA, STANDBY IN YOUR THRONE.

270
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,773
ROGER THAT!

271
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,109
(Whoosh)

272
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:34,828
Al‐Saachez:
YO! ARE YOU GUYS TAKING ON
THE WHOLE WORLD

273
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:37,038
AND HAVING
A HARD TIME WITH IT?

274
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,206
WHO ARE YOU?

275
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:41,376
MY NAME IS ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

276
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,254
I'M A MERCENARY,
AS YOU CAN SEE.

277
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:46,923
I'VE BEEN ASKED BY MY SPONSOR
TO HELP YOU ON YOUR WAY.

278
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,510
ALL THEY COULD SEND FOR
REINFORCEMENTS WAS ONE MACHINE?

279
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,680
WHO WAS IT WHO HIRED YOU?
WAS IT LAGUNA?

280
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,809
LAGUNA? OH, YOU MEAN
LAGUNA HARVEY.

281
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,435
THAT OLD GUY'S DEAD.

282
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:00,144
HE'S WHAT?

283
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,062
HE'S WHAT?
(Gunshot)

284
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:01,677
(Gunshot)

285
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:03,857
Al‐Saachez:
I KILLED HIM.

286
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,859
MICHAEL!
(Gasps)

287
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,569
MICHAEL, NO!

288
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,736
TIME TO DIE.

289
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:09,737
BASTARD!

290
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,156
(Gunshot)

291
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,075
(Struggling)

292
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,660
JOHANN!

293
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,246
YOU'VE...YOU'VE GOT TO RUN
FOR IT, NENA!

294
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,247
BUT I...

295
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:20,290
GET OUT OF HERE!

296
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,499
OKAY!

297
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,795
A TOUCHING DISPLAY OF
SIBLING LOVE.

298
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:27,881
HURRY UP AND
GET IN YOUR MACHINE.

299
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,632
OTHERWISE THE BATTLE
WON'T BE ANY FUN.

300
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,302
(Wincing with pain)

301
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:33,845
THERE'S A GOOD BOY.

302
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:39,142
Nena:
JOHANN! MICHAEL IS GONE!
HE'S GONE!

303
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,185
Johann:
I'LL AVENGE HIS DEATH!

304
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,186
WHAT THE...

305
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:43,980
Al‐Saachez:
(Attacking laugh)

306
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,524
IMPOSSIBLE!

307
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,360
YOU CAN'T OPERATE THE ZWEI
WITHOUT MICHAEL'S BIOMETRICS!

308
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,780
HE MUST HAVE ALTERED
THE PROGRAM WITH VEDA'S HELP!

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,241
IT'S TOUGH OPERATING A MACHINE
I'M NOT USED TO.

310
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,201
BUT AS LONG AS I KNOW
HOW TO USE THE WEAPONS,

311
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,870
I GUESS I'LL MAKE DO!

312
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,080
Johann:
WHY?
WHY ARE YOU AFTER US?

313
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,790
Al‐Saachez:
THEY SAID
YOU'RE SACRIFICIAL LAMBS!

314
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,459
Johann:
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

315
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,085
Al‐Saachez:
I'M SORRY! I SYMPATHIZE
WITH YOU GUYS!

316
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:09,005
Johann:
BUT WE ARE GUNDAM MEISTERS!

317
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,594
DON'T STOP US,
WE'RE HERE TO CHANGE THE WORLD!

318
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,180
I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH
OF YOUR GIBBERISH!

319
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:22,101
JOHANN, NO!

320
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,269
TIME TO SAY GOODBYE!

321
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:30,234
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
WE WERE MEANT TO DO THIS,

322
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,320
WE WERE BORN TO BE
GUNDAM MEISTERS.

323
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,406
THIS IS WHAT WE LIVED FOR.

324
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,741
(Boom)

325
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:37,951
(Gasps)

326
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:50,254
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL
HOW GN PARTICLES SPARKLE?

327
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:51,589
(Grunting)

328
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,759
Al‐Saachez:
DON'T YOU AGREE, LITTLE GIRL?

329
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,177
(Screams)

330
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:57,345
(Determined growl)

331
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:59,681
Al‐Saachez:
(Laughing maniacally)

332
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:00,974
(Boom)

333
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,976
WHAT WAS THAT?

334
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,023
Al‐Saachez:
DON'T GET IN MY WAY,
YOU LITTLE KRUGIS PUNK!

335
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:12,110
THAT'S ALI AL‐SAACHEZ!
THAT CAN'T BE.

336
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,861
Setsuna:
HOW DID YOU
EVER GET ABOARD A GUNDAM?

337
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,743
THAT'S IT,
LEVEL 7 IS CLEAR.

338
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:23,121
WE NOW HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER VEDA.

339
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,123
DO WE NOW? FINALLY.

340
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:40,263
(Machine hissing)

341
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:45,476
I KNEW I'D FIND YOU HERE,
AEOLIA SCHENBERG.

342
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,687
HOPING TO WITNESS
THE WORLD'S REFORMATION,

343
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,772
YOU PLACED YOURSELF
IN COLD SLEEP,

344
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:52,191
WITH NO GUARANTEE
YOU COULD BE REVIVED.

345
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:56,029
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER

346
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:59,240
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO MISS
THE REFORMATION.

347
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,576
THE UNITED WORLD
YOU SO DESIRED,

348
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:04,996
AND YOUR ULTIMATE
DETERRENT, CELESTIAL BEING.

349
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:07,749
I AM ABOUT TO BECOME
THE INHERITOR OF THEM BOTH.

350
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:09,876
OH, YES.

351
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,545
I WILL CHANGE THIS WORLD!

352
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,881
I, ALEJANDRO CORNER!

353
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,090
(Shot)

354
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,927
(Laughing while shooting)

355
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:22,722
(Gun clicks)

356
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:27,018
(Laughing)

357
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,729
(Electronic shimmering)

358
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,647
WHAT IS THIS?

359
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,025
RIBBONS! WHAT'S HAPPENING?

360
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:34,776
HUH?

361
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,616
THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS
COME TO THIS PLACE

362
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:44,619
WITH EVIL INTENTIONS
TELLS ME THAT, UNFORTUNATELY,

363
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:47,371
THE WORLD HAS NOT
TURNED OUT AS I DESIRED.

364
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:51,000
IT'S...IT'S AEOLIA SCHENBERG.

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,086
IT'S A SYSTEM TRAP!

366
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:57,215
SO HUMANS ARE STILL FOOLISH,
THEY STILL LOVE WAR,

367
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,384
AND THEY'RE STILL GUIDING
THIS WORLD TO DESTRUCTION.

368
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,887
HEY, COME ON GUNDAM,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

369
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,640
HOW COULD A BASTARD LIKE YOU
EVER GET HIS HANDS ON A GUNDAM?

370
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,226
Al‐Saachez:
I DIDN'T KNOW
I NEEDED YOUR APPROVAL!

371
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:13,648
THANKFULLY, I STILL BELIEVE
THAT HUMANITY CAN SAVE ITSELF.

372
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:20,154
AND I WISH TO ENTRUST IT WITH
THE POWER TO DO SO.

373
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:21,155
(Grunting)

374
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:22,949

(Boom)

376
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,620
THAT PILOT'S A HELL OF A
GOOD SHOT!

377
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,914
THIS GUNDAM THING
IS JUST FANTASTIC!

378
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,415
SAY YOUR PRAYERS, PUNK!

379
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,959
(Setsuna yelling)

380
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:35,962
THIS WHOLE WORLD...

381
00:19:35,962 --> 00:19:37,839
(Sighs wearily)

382
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,842
Al‐Saachez:
THIS GUNDAM
IS AN INCREDIBLE WEAPON.

383
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:42,760
IT MAKES WAR
EVEN MORE FUN.

384
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:46,389
YOUR GUNDAM
WAS MADE FOR WAR TOO, WASN'T IT?

385
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:47,348
YOU'RE WRONG!

386
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:50,476
AND HUMANITY...

387
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:51,853
YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG!

388
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,939
MY GUNDAM'S NOT LIKE THAT!

389
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:58,276
I'VE GOT A MOVE THAT'LL
FINISH YOU OFF!

390
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:59,986
(Gasping)

391
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,822

NO MATTER WHAT!

HOW IS HE MOVING LIKE THAT?

397
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,797
THERE!

398
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,508
I KEEP MISSING!

399
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:24,302
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME!

400
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,018
WHAT IS THAT UP THERE?

401
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:36,147

CONTINUE FIGHTING

IN ORDER TO ATTAIN
TRUE PEACE

414

AND ERADICATE THE SCOURGE
OF WAR FROM OUR PLANET.

NOT FOR THE SAKE OF

TOGETHER WITH YOUR GUNDAMS.
