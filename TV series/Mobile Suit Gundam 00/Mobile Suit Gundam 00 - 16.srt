(Screams in extreme pain)

00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:18,892
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE
OF THE AGRISSA'S PLASMA FIELD?!

4
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:21,227
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND
LEAVE YOUR MACHINE BEHIND

5
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,479
YOU LITTLE KRUGIS PUNK!

I'M A REAL GUNDAM MEISTER!

(Giggles)

GUNDAM THRONE UNIT THREE,

Setsuna:
UNIT THREE?

31
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:32,708
THAT'S RIGHT, MY BIG BROS ARE
THE PILOTS OF UNITS ONE AND TWO.

00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,960
AND RIGHT ABOUT NOW...

00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,546
Patrick:
ALL MACHINES,
STAY IN FORMATION.

34
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,090
WE'RE TAKING THE GUNDAM
BACK TO HQ LIKE THIS.

35
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,385
AND I, PATRICK COLASOUR,
WAS IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.

36
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,595
THAT'S RIGHT,

37
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,138
IF I CAN CAPTURE A GUNDAM

38
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,140
THEN SURELY THE COLONEL'S HEART
WILL BE NEXT.

(Thinking)
THIS IS THE GUNDAM

52
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,557
THAT ATTACKED
THE SUPER HUMAN INSTITUTE

53
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:34,645
AND KILLED MY COMRADES.

54

Sergei:
ENEMY ATTACK!?

58
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,327
WHAT KIND OF WEAPON
IS THIS?

59
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,079
THESE THINGS AREN'T MISSILES!

60

SCATTER!

77
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,173
WITH THAT KIND OF RANGE,

78
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,883
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH
A NORMAL WEAPON HERE!

79
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,512
I DIDN'T THINK THEY HAD ANY MORE
OF THOSE DAMNED MACHINES!

80
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:53,640
NO ONE TOLD US. GUNDAMS!

OUR FORMATION'S BEEN
TORN TO PIECES.

83
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,520
WE'RE FALLING BACK!

86
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:08,405
WHO WAS THAT?

87
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:11,700
Lockon:
WHAT IS THAT MACHINE?

88
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,702
HARO! YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

89
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,496
NO DATA!
NO DATA!

90
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,331
(Beeps)

91
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,416
LOOKS LIKE I MADE IT
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

92
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,335
HUH?
WHO ARE YOU?

93
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,712
I AM THE GUNDAM MEISTER
OF THRONE EINS,

94
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:25,756
JOHANN TRINITY.

95
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:27,716
YOUR NAME'S JOHANN TRINITY?

96
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,679
THERE ARE ACTUALLY
THREE OF US

97
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,932
BUT MY BROTHER AND SISTER
HAVE ALREADY HEADED OUT

98
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:37,142
TO RESCUE YOUR FELLOW MEISTERS.

99
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,602
Lockon:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

100
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:39,728
Nena:

Nena:
I'VE COMPLETED MY MISSION HERE!

103
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,691
Johann:
I SEE.

104
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,903
NENA, DISPERSE GN PARTICLES
OVER MAXIMUM AREA.

105
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:49,905
WE WANT TO LEAVE
THIS AIRSPACE AT ONCE.

106
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,281
ROGER THAT, JOHANN!

107
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,533
LET'S GO, HARO!

108
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,910

WHATEVER!

109
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,913
GN PARTICLES!
MAXIMUM DISPERSAL!

STEALTH FIELD!

112
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:23,564
ALL THAT LIGHT...
THERE'S SO MUCH!

113
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:25,941
ARE THOSE ACTUALLY GN PARTICLES?

114
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,490
WHAT... WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

115
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,283
(Chuckles)

116
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:36,910
THAT'S OUR NENA!

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,413
THE DISPERSAL AREA IS HUGE!

118
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,582
THREE NEW GUNDAMS
JUST APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE?

119
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,125
YES, MA'AM!

120
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,710
IT APPEARS THAT BECAUSE OF
THE ENEMY'S NEW REINFORCEMENTS,

121
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,503
WE FAILED
TO CAPTURE THE GUNDAMS!

122
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,921
THEY FAILED?

123
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,339
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

124
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,132
COLONEL!

125
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,216
YES, WHAT IS IT?!

126
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:52,926
MA'AM, I'M SEEING
A DRAMATIC INCREASE

127
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,304
IN THE CUT OFF POINTS
FOR THE COMM LINKS!

128
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:56,722
(Angry grunt)

129
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,348
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

130
00:07:58,348 --> 00:07:59,766
ARE YOU SAYING
THOSE NEW MACHINES

131
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,435
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCATTER
THOSE SPECIAL PARTICLES

132
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,729
OVER A MUCH LARGER AREA?

133
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,189
Operator:
WITH ALL THIS,

134
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,232
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIND
THE GUNDAMS IS WITH OUR EYES!

135
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:10,319
I KNOW THAT!

136
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,323
THIS IS CAPTAIN GRAHAM AKER
OF THE OVER FLAGS.

137
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,909
WE FAILED TO CAPTURE THE GUNDAM.
WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS‐‐

138
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,494
(Static)

139
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:19,912
OUR COMMUNICATIONS.

140
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:20,704
(Gasps)

141
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:23,332
THE PARTICLES!

142
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:26,335
Sergei:
THE COMMUNICATION CUT OFF AREA
IS INCREASING?

143
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:27,920
IF THEY ALWAYS HAD
THIS ABILITY,

144
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,922
WHY DIDN'T
THEY DO IT BEFORE NOW?

145
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:33,759
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO,
CELESTIAL BEING?

146
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,135
Patrick:
HQ, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

147
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,095
THIS IS PATRICK!
PLEASE RESPOND!

148
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,931
(Static)

149
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,974
DAMN IT, I CAN'T GET THROUGH.

150
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,519
HOW THE HELL AM I GOING TO
GET BACK TO BASE NOW?

151
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,939
(Yelling)
COLONEL!

152
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,108
Christina:
(Gasps)

153
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,486
IT'S A CODED MESSAGE
FROM HARO!

154
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,112
ALL FOUR GUNDAMS MADE IT!

155
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,322
THEY'RE GOING TO
RENDEZVOUS

156
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:57,324
AT THE NUMBER SIX SPOT
IN THE PACIFIC!

157
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:58,534
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

158
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,244
THEY SURE HAD US WORRIED,
ALRIGHT!

159
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:01,745
AND ALL OF THEM...

160
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,705
MISSION COMPLETE,
MISS SUMERAGI!

161
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,499
HOW WONDERFUL!

162
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,750
YES, BUT HOW?

163
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,585
WHAT?

164
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,546
NO, IT'S OKAY,
IT'S NOTHING!

165
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,344
SOMETIMES IT'S A GOOD THING

166
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:19,930
WHEN YOUR FORECASTS
DON'T COME TRUE.

167
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:23,934
WHO COULD'VE IMAGINED THAT GROUP
WOULD HAVE

168
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:26,687
THREE MORE NEW GUNDAMS
THEY COULD DEPLOY.

169
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,355
IS IT POSSIBLE CELESTIAL BEING

170
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:31,525
ACTUALLY SAW THROUGH OUR PLAN
AND SET THIS WHOLE AFFAIR UP?

171
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,488
SEVEN GUNDAMS NOW.

172
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,335
SO THERE ARE THREE
NEW GUNDAMS.

173
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,255
DAMN IT.
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING.

174
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:56,133
WHAT KIND OF MACHINES
WERE THEY FLYING?

175
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,928
THOSE MACHINES...THEY AREN'T
A PART OF VEDA'S OPERATION PLAN.

176
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,097
WHAT KIND OF GUNDAMS ARE THEY?!

177
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,486
(Loud yawn)

178
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,405
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
SAJI?

179
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,449
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE,
YAWNING ALL DAY.

180
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,492
THEY WERE RUNNING CONSTANT
UPDATES ALL NIGHT

181
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:23,910
ABOUT CELESTIAL BEING AND

182
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,954
HOW THEY PERFORMED
AN ARMED INTERVENTION

183
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:29,124
DURING THAT BIG JOINT
MILITARY EXERCISE IN THE DESERT.

184
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,334
I WATCHED ALL NIGHT
AND THEN

185
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:31,752
BEFORE I KNEW IT,
IT WAS MORNING.

186
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,962
OH. THAT SOUNDS
INTERESTING.

187
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:36,173
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS IS A BIG DEAL?

188
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,759
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT
THE EXAMS THAT BEGIN TOMORROW.

189
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,927
(Despondent)
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

190
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,681
(Footsteps)

191
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,434
Alejandro:
OBSERVER ALEJANDRO CORNER.

192
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,444
J4:
THESE EMERGENCY MEETINGS
ARE SO UNSETTLING.

193
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:01,822
D3:
I'M GUESSING THIS IS
ABOUT THE TAKLAMAKAN REGION

194
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:05,201
AND THE THREE NEW GUNDAMS
THAT APPEARED THERE.

195
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,702
S8:
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

196
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,580
ANY MENTION OF THESE MACHINES
IN VEDA'S PLANS.

197
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,792
C5:
WE CAN OBVIOUSLY DEDUCE
FROM THIS THAT CELESTIAL BEING

198
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:16,212
HAS A SECRET SECOND TEAM.

199
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:19,507
I WISH TO MAKE A PROPOSAL
TO ALL THE ESTEEMED OBSERVERS.

200
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:21,801
IT CONCERNS WHETHER
WE SHOULD ACCEPT OR REJECT

201
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,970
THE THREE
NEWLY ACTIVATED GUNDAMS.

202
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,639
N1:
YOU'RE PUSHING FOR
A DECISION TOO QUICKLY.

203
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,432
T2:
BEFORE WE DO THAT,

204
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:31,227
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD RE‐EXAMINE
CELESTIAL BEING'S ACTIVITIES

205
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:33,604
AND THE RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN
ACHIEVED UP UNTIL NOW.

206
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,314
L9:
I SUPPORT THAT SUGGESTION.

207
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,691
V7:
AS DO I.

208
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,693
VERY WELL, THEN.

209
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:43,781
Alejandro:
CELESTIAL BEING'S
FIRST MISSION

210
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,825
BEGAN WITH
AN ARMED INTERVENTION

211
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,203
AT THE OFFICIAL UNVEILING OF
THE AEU'S NEWEST MOBILE SUIT,

212
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,371
THE ENACT.

213
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:53,040
240082 EXIA HAS TARGET
LOCATION IN SIGHT.

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,960
CEASE GN PARTICLE DISPERSAL
UPON ARRIVAL AT TARGET.

215
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:02,216
ALRIGHT, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
FROM THE UNION?

216
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,301
HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE?

217
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:05,052
WELL, EITHER WAY,

218
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:08,139
YOU'RE A PARTY‐CRASHER
AND YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

219
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,891
Patrick:
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO PAY THE PRICE!

220
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:18,816
ONCE THE EXIA
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE

221
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,027
IT COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED
THE ENACT,

222
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,404
BOTH DEMONSTRATING
ITS SUPERIOR CAPABILITIES

223
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:26,449
AND DELAYING DEPLOYMENT OF
THE NEW ENEMY MOBILE SUIT.

224
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,118
LATER, EXIA,
TOGETHER WITH DYNAMES,

225
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,954
REVEALED TO THE WORLD
THAT THE AEU HAD STATIONED

226
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:34,415
MORE MILITARY FORCES IN
ITS ORBITAL ELEVATOR

227
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:37,293
THAN WAS ALLOWED
BY TREATY LIMITATIONS.

228
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,045
IT'S LOCKON.

229
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,303
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS,

230
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:50,056
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE CARRIED OUT
A MISSION IN WHICH

231
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:52,975
THEY PREVENTED A TERRORIST
ATTACK ON HEAVEN'S PILLAR,

232
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,936
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S
ORBITAL ELEVATOR.

233
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:58,064
J4:
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF THIS MISSION?

234
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:01,651
N1:
I'D SAY THAT, BY PREVENTING
A TERRORIST ATTACK

235
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,779
RATHER THAN ENGAGING IN
CONFLICT INTERVENTION,

236
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,197
THEY WERE SEEKING

237
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:09,492
THE WORLD'S ACCEPTANCE
AND UNDERSTANDING.

238
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,827
Aeolia:
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS
THIS STATEMENT

239
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:16,040
TO EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING
BORN AND RAISED ON EARTH.

240
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,794
WE CALL OURSELVES
SIMPLY CELESTIAL BEING.

241
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:22,421
WE ARE A PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION

242
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,174
IN POSSESSION
OF THE MOBILE WEAPON GUNDAM.

243
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,134
Alejandro:
AND THEN, THE FOUNDER AND

244
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:30,554
CREATOR OF CELESTIAL BEING,
AEOLIA SCHENBERG,

245
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:34,892
BROADCAST A STATEMENT THAT WAS
SEEN AROUND THE WORLD.

246
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:38,062
THUS, A PLAN THAT WAS
TWO CENTURIES IN THE MAKING

247
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,190
HAD REACHED THE MOMENT WHERE
IT COULD BE SET IN MOTION.

248
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,651
T2:
THE SECOND MISSION
WAS AN ARMED INTERVENTION

249
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:46,195
INTO THE ETHNIC CONFLICT ON
THE ISLAND OF CEYLON,

250
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,823
FORMERLY KNOWN AS SRI LANKA.

251
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:52,034
L9:
THIS CONFLICT WAS WORSENING
BECAUSE THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE

252
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:55,037
BECAME INVOLVED
IN AN ATTEMPT TO GUARANTEE

253
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:58,165
THE SECURITY OF THEIR SOLAR
ENERGY TRANSMISSION TUBES.

254
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:03,379
Alejandro:
AFTER THAT,

255
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,840
THE GUNDAMS WERE DEPLOYED IN
DIFFERENT TEAM COMBINATIONS

256
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,217
IN ORDER TO COMPLETE
A VARIETY OF MISSIONS,

257
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:11,387
ALL ACCORDING TO THE PLANS
RECOMMENDED BY VEDA.

258
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,980
(Metal clashing)

259
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,193
YOU'RE MISTAKEN!

260
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:30,990
(Metal clashing)

261
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,543
Michael:
THINGS HAD BEEN GOING PRETTY
SMOOTHLY UP TO THAT POINT.

262
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,212
THEN THERE WAS TARIBIA,
THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLIC

263
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,798
WHERE THEY DECIDED TO PERFORM
AN ARMED INTERVENTION.

264
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:49,800
AMERICA AND TARIBIA
WERE PLAYING SOME GAME

265
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,385
AND THEY GOT
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

266
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:53,095
SEE, IF IT HAD BEEN ME

267
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,639
I WOULD HAVE BEATEN THE CRAP
OUT OF BOTH OF THOSE ARMIES.

268
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,224
YOU'RE SO EXTREME,
MICHAEL.

269
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:58,601
YES, BUT FOR THEM,

270
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,144
THEIR PLANS
WOULD SOON BE PLAGUED

271
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:02,521
BY A NUMBER OF ABERRATIONS.

272
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:06,233
D3:
KYRIOS'S RESCUE WORK WAS NOT
PART OF THAT MISSION.

273
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,612
N1: IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE
PILOT, ALLELUJAH HAPTISM,

274
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,032
TOOK INDEPENDENT ACTION
IN THAT MATTER.

275
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:15,201
C5:
AND THIS UNEXPECTED COURSE
OF ACTION RESULTED IN

276
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,788
DYNAMES REVEALING ITS HIGH
ALTITUDE FIRING CAPABILITY.

277
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,414
TARGETED AND FIRING!

278
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:22,291
V7:
THIS FORCED VEDA
TO MAKE REVISIONS

279
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,085
TO ITS OPERATION PLAN IN
THE FOLLOWING DAYS.

280
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,546
AND THEN STILL ANOTHER
UNBELIEVABLE INCIDENT

281
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:30,341
TOOK PLACE DURING THE ARMED
INTERVENTION IN MORALIA.

282
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,426
Johann:
EXIA'S PILOT OPENED
HIS COCKPIT HATCH

283
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,428
AND DELIBERATELY
REVEALED HIMSELF TO THE ENEMY.

284
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:36,222
WHAT THE HELL?

285
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:37,223
Nena:
(Giggles)

286
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:39,016
HOW STUPID CAN A PERSON BE?!

287
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:41,227
Michael:
SWEET! HE'S EVEN CRAZIER
THAN I AM!

288
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:42,812
DYNAMES.

289
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,567
S8:
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

290
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,778
V7:
THE PILOT,
SETSUNA F. SEIEI,

291
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:53,197
REFUSED TO FILE
A MISSION REPORT.

292
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:55,616
J4:
HOWEVER, THE MISSION ITSELF
WAS COMPLETED.

293
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:57,201
THERE WERE
THOSE WHO RECOMMENDED

294
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,786
REMOVING SETSUNA F. SEIEI,

295
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,038
SINCE HE WAS THE SOURCE
OF THE PROBLEM,

296
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:03,415
BUT SINCE A UNANIMOUS DECISION
COULDN'T BE REACHED,

297
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,626
THE ISSUE WAS DROPPED.

298
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:08,420
D3:
YES, UNLESS WE ALL ARE
OF THE SAME OPINION

299
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,799
WE CANNOT EXERCISE OUR VETO.

300
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,592
(Giggles)

301
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,511
N1:
AND THEN, AS PREDICTED,

302
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:18,973
THE WORLD BEGAN SHOWING
SIGNS OF RESISTANCE.

303
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,015
(Laughs)

304
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,016
(Gasps)

305
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,644
(Glass shatters)

306
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,814
L9:
DEMANDING THAT CELESTIAL BEING
CEASE ITS ACTIVITIES,

307
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:28,649
A TERRORIST NETWORK BEGAN

308
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,360
A CAMPAIGN OF
INDISCRIMINATE RETALIATION.

309
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,363
Saji:
THE... THE BUS!

310
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,198
(Gasps in horror)

311
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:38,158
Man:
THE BUS JUST EXPLODED!

312
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,201
TERRORISTS!

313
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,953
A TERRORIST ATTACK!

314
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:44,290
A CODED MESSAGE FROM THE NRO?

315
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,626
AND THE BND
AND DGSE, TOO.

316
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:50,170
CLEARLY IT'S A MESSAGE
FROM THE WORLD.

317
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,630
C5:
THANKS TO THE ASSISTANCE

318
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,716
OF THE WORLD'S
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES,

319
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:57,428
THE MATTER WAS QUICKLY
DEALT WITH.

320
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:59,054
D3:
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT,

321
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:01,223
THERE'S NO DOUBT THE WORLD
HAS COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE

322
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:04,393
THE EXISTENCE OF CELESTIAL
BEING AS A REAL ISSUE.

323
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,355
Alejandro:
HOWEVER,

324
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:12,067
THE MAJOR POWERS WERE NOT QUITE
AS WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM.

325
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,404
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE CREATED
THE CHOBU SPECIAL FORCES TEAM

326
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,823
AND LAUNCHED AN ATTACK
ON THE PTOLEMAIOS,

327
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,201
CELESTIAL BEING'S
MULTI‐PURPOSE TRANSPORT.

328
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,787
Sergei:
NUMBER THREE,
DON'T FORGET YOU'RE TRACKING

329
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:26,373
THE THIRD COMMUNICATION
CUTOFF POINT.

330
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,419
DYNAMES, OPEN FIRE!

331
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,754
Lockon:
I'M ON IT!

332
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,469
(Grunts)

333
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:40,179
N1:
BUT IN ACTUALITY,

334
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,806
THEY WERE LESS INTERESTED IN
ATTACKING THE PTOLEMAIOS,

335
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,809
THAN THEY WERE
IN CAPTURING A GUNDAM.

336
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,478
L9:
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM,

337
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,813
A FORMER TEST SUBJECT
OF THE SUPER HUMAN INSTITUTE,

338
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:52,650
WAS AFFECTED BY
QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

339
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,862
HE NEARLY ALLOWED THE KYRIOS
TO BE CAPTURED.

340
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:59,198
S8:
ALSO, IN A DESPERATE BID
TO ESCAPE,

341
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,616
VIRTUE WAS FORCED TO REVEAL

342
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:04,411
THE GN‐004 GUNDAM NADLEEH
TO THE ENEMY.

343
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,789
A MOST ESSENTIAL SYSTEM INDEED.

344
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,796
(Metal clashing)

345
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,053
T2:
THE SAME COULD BE SAID
ABOUT KYRIOS.

346
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:24,390
WE WEREN'T READY TO SHOW
THE ENEMY THAT WEAPON JUST YET.

347
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,812
NO, STOP!
STOP IT, PLEASE!

348
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:33,399
(Screaming)

349
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:43,617
J4:
ON THAT ISSUE, THERE WAS
SOME CONCERN EXPRESSED OVER

350
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,577
THE ABILITIES OF
THE TACTICAL FORECASTER,

351
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:46,996
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA.

352
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:49,790
AS WITH THE MATTER OF
SETSUNA F. SEIEI,

353
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,625
THOSE OPINIONS WERE
NOT UNANIMOUS

354
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,627
AND SO IT WAS PASSED OVER.

355
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:57,881
D3:
WHY WAS THE MATTER CONCERNING
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM PASSED OVER?

356
00:18:57,881 --> 00:19:00,551
S8:
OH THAT. IT'S BECAUSE
HE SUBMITTED A MISSION PLAN

357
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,553
THAT INCLUDED THE LOCATION
AND DESTRUCTION OF

358
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:05,639
THE SUPER HUMAN INSTITUTE'S
LABORATORY.

359
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:07,224
C5:
NEVERTHELESS,
HE REMAINS SUSCEPTIBLE

360
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,059
TO QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

361
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,646
THIS COULD BE
A PROBLEM IN FUTURE MISSIONS.

362
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,857
T2:
I BELIEVE THERE'S
ENOUGH REASON TO CONSIDER

363
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:17,943
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD
KEEP HIM AS A GUNDAM MEISTER.

364
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:21,071
(Allelujah screaming)

365
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:22,448
IN OTHER WORDS,

366
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:25,034
THEIR STYLE IS JUST
A LITTLE TOO SOFT FOR THE JOB.

367
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,244
BESIDES, I DON'T LIKE THEIR
SILLY HABIT OF NOT KILLING

368
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:30,414
THE ENEMY PILOTS THEY FIGHT
UNLESS THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

369
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:32,166
IT'D ONLY HELP US
IN THE LONG RUN

370
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,877
IF THE NUMBER OF EXPERIENCED
PILOTS OUT THERE WERE REDUCED.

371
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,545
DON'T YOU AGREE,
JOHANN?

372
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:38,630
DON'T BE SO HARD ON THEM,
MICHAEL.

373
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,007
THEY'RE JUST MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT

374
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,633
HOW THE PUBLIC PERCEIVES THEM.

375
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,303
THAT'S MY POINT!
THAT'S WHAT MAKES 'EM SO SOFT!

376
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,847
FIRST THEY PICK A FIGHT
WITH THE WHOLE WORLD AND THEN

377
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,932
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT HURTING
EVERYONE'S FEELINGS!

378
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:51,810
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T STAND
WISHY‐WASHY MEN.

379
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,228
THAT'S RIGHT!

380
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:55,814
FOR INSTANCE, TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT MESS IN AZADISTAN.

381
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:59,693
Setsuna:
THIS TIME...

382
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:18,170
YOU HAVE MY THANKS
FOR THIS.

383
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,798
PLEASE HURRY.

384
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,012
(Gasps)

385
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:27,805
PRINCESS!

386
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,389
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

387
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,725
MARINA ISMAIL,

388
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:36,313
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER WE COME BACK OR NOT.

389
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,524
Michael:
WAS THAT LIKE NON‐VIOLENT
RESISTANCE?

390
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,818
THAT CRAP THAT WAS POPULAR
A LONG TIME AGO?

391
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:44,279
WHAT'S HE DOING IN
A GUNDAM THEN?

392
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,117
L9:
AND NOW, TO THE MATTER
IN THE TAKLAMAKAN REGION.

393
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,202
V7:
VEDA'S REPORT IS INCOMPLETE,

394
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,621
BUT IF THE SECOND TEAM
HADN'T APPEARED

395
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,206
THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY

396
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,583
THE GUNDAMS
WOULD'VE BEEN CAPTURED.

397
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,836
J4:
I CONCUR.

398
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,796
N1:
BUT WHERE WERE
THE SECOND TEAM'S GUNDAM'S

399
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:03,048
SOLAR REACTORS MADE?

400
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:05,217
THERE SHOULD ONLY BE
FIVE OF THESE REACTORS

401
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,886
ACTIVE RIGHT NOW.

402
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:09,638
T2:
CONCERNING THAT ISSUE,

403
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:13,934
I'M SURE VEDA WILL BE GIVING US
PRECISE INFORMATION SOON.

404
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,394
C5:
BUT THAT MEANS
THERE IS INFORMATION

405
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,688
WE ARE NOT PRIVY TO.

406
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:21,441
S8:
IT'S OF NO CONCERN.
WE ARE JUST OBSERVERS.

407
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,235
REGARDLESS OF
WHAT THE WORLD DOES,

408
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:25,070
WE CAN ONLY EXERCISE OUR VETO

409
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,783
OVER CELESTIAL BEING
BY REACHING A CONSENSUS.

410
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,202
NOW THAT WE'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO EXPRESS OUR VIEWS,

411
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,538
I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL
ONCE AGAIN.

412
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:36,248
SHOULD WE OBSERVERS ACCEPT

413
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,043
THE THREE NEW GUNDAMS AND
THEIR SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS OR NOT?

414
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:41,587
V7:
I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.

415
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:42,629
L9:
I ACCEPT THEM.

416
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,381
D3:
I AGREE.

417
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:48,051
(The other observers agree)

418
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:50,053
SO BE IT.

419
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:55,809
WE'RE NOT FAR FROM
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT NOW.

420
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,686
SO, DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL SHOW UP, JOHANN?

421
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:59,855
THEY COULD BE AFRAID
OF US, YOU KNOW!

422
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:02,691
OH NO, THEY WILL BE THERE.

423
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:04,860
IF THEY REALLY ARE
GUNDAM MEISTERS,

424
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,862
THEY'LL BE CURIOUS
AND THEY'LL WANT TO LEARN

425
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,364
EVERYTHING THEY CAN ABOUT US
AND THE GUNDAM THRONES.

426
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:10,157
(Excited gasp)

427
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:11,491
I SEE THEM!

428
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:12,576
Johann:
(chuckles)

429
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:15,245
THEN LET US GO AND GREET THEM,

430
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:17,080
OUR FELLOW GUNDAM MEISTERS.

431
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,332
ALL RIGHT.

432
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:19,791
