ALMOST FOUR
MONTHS HAVE PASSED

12
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,325
SINCE CELESTIAL BEING
COMMENCED

13
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:11,370
ITS ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

14
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,663
IN THAT TIME, IT HAS
CARRIED OUT

15
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:14,957
OVER SIXTY OF
THESE INTERVENTIONS.

16
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:17,084
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS
LOVED OR HATED,

17
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:18,502
WHAT MATTERS
IS THAT PEOPLE

18
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:20,921
HAVE HAD TO
ACKNOWLEDGE ITS EXISTENCE.

19
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,881
THERE WERE THOSE WHO WOULD
REBUKE CELESTIAL BEING,

20
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,758
AND THOSE WHO
WOULD AFFIRM IT...

21
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,343
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
REJECTING WAR

22
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:29,847
BOTH SIDES FIND THEMSELVES
IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT.

23
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,599
NO ONE SEEKS CONFLICT
FOR ITS OWN SAKE.

24
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,730
OF THE THREE GROUPS
OF NATIONS ON EARTH,

25
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,357
THE UNION AND THE AEU
HAVE ANNOUNCED

26
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,234
THAT THEY WILL
ONLY TAKE DEFENSIVE MEASURES

27
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,611
AGAINST CELESTIAL BEING
IN CONFLICTS

28
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,448
THAT OCCUR WITHIN
THEIR TERRITORIES.

29
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:50,242
HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONFLICT
IN MORALIA...

30
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:54,621
THERE HASN'T BEEN
A SINGLE LARGE SCALE BATTLE.

31
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,331
THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS HAS
BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT

32
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,625
BECAUSE OF
THE SUPERIOR COMBAT ABILITIES

33
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,419

34
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,379

BLOODSHED

35
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,298

CONTINUE TO DIMINISH,

RESISTANCE AGAINST OPPRESSION
BY ARMED FORCE

37
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,635
HAS NOT DISAPPEARED.

38
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,056
AND NOW A SECRET PLAN IS BEING
SET IN MOTION

39
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:14,516
BY THE ONLY GROUP
TO CHALLENGE CELESTIAL BEING...

40
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,518
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE.

THE FINEST THAT THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE HAS TO OFFER.

44
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:31,075
YOUR MISSION IS
TO ENGAGE AND DESTROY

THAT ARMED GROUP OF
GLOBAL INTERVENTIONISTS...

COMPLETION OF THIS MISSION

160
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,935
WE COULD FINALLY GAIN ACCESS
TO THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM.

161
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,771
THE AMBASSADOR IS
ARRIVING NOW, PRINCESS.

162
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:32,443
(Cameras clicking)

163
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:35,571
(Marina thinking):
THIS IS THE PERSON WHO
COULD SAVE AZADISTAN.

164
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,408
IT IS A GREAT
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

165
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:42,244
I AM U. N. AMBASSADOR,
ALEJANDRO CORNER.

166
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:44,246
I AM MARINA ISMAIL,

167
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:47,082
PRINCESS ROYAL OF THE
KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN.

168
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,960
ON BEHALF OF MY NATION, I WANT
TO THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING

169
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,671
OUR REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
IN OUR TIME OF NEED.

170
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,673
THE U. N. WAS ORIGINALLY
MEANT

171
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,926
FOR EXACTLY
THIS KIND OF PURPOSE.

172
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:59,011
THOUGH, BECAUSE MEMBER
NATIONS ARE LESS GENEROUS

173
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,555
WITH THEIR FUNDING THESE DAYS,
THERE IS A LIMIT

174
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,390
AS TO WHAT WE CAN
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH.

175
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,310
NEVERTHELESS,
WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL.

176
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,271
(Thinking):
WHY ARE WE RECEIVING U. N.
ASSISTANCE NOW,

177
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,565
WHEN WE HAVE
NOTHING TO OFFER IN RETURN?

178
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:14,693
WHAT IS THAT MAN
REALLY UP TO?

179
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,782
(Door slides open)

180
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:21,200
HEY, WHERE'S FELDT?

181
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,576
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T
FEELING WELL

182
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:24,453
AND WENT TO SEE DR. MORENO.

183
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:26,413
SO YOU'RE WORKING
A DOUBLE SHIFT?

184
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,040
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

185
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,959
HEY, I'LL TAKE OVER
FOR A WHILE,

186
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,001
WHY DON'T YOU
GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

187
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,879
WHAT? REALLY?
THAT'S SO NICE!

188
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,964
AH, DON'T MENTION IT.

189
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,382
IT'S JUST TOO BAD

190
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:39,051
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MY TYPE!

191
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,719
YEAH, TOO BAD.

192
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:46,183
YO! WHAT'RE YOU UP TO?

193
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,393
LOCKON...

194
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,856
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

195
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,530
(Sighs)

196
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,659
(Eating quietly)

197
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,248
(Christina thinking):
THIS IS SO AWKWARD!

198
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,708
GN DRIVE CHARGING.

199
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,751
IT IS NOW READING
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT!

200
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,465
(Beeping)

201
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:21,635
Operator #9A:
WE'VE JUST LOST TWO‐WAY
COMMUNICATION WITH AE3288!

202
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:22,970
Ming:
NOTIFY THE COLONEL
IMMEDIATELY!

203
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,557
Operator #9B:
AND AR9763! LOCATION: N‐07.

204
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:29,101
I NEVER EXPECTED
THEM TO BE SO CLOSE.

205
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,687
ALRIGHT, NOTIFY THE CHOBU
SPECIAL FORCES TEAM!

206
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:34,648
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS:
SCRAMBLE IMMEDIATELY!

207
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:36,734
Ming:
PREPARE FOR IMMEDIATE
DEPLOYMENT!

208
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,194
LAUNCH IN SEQUENCE
FROM SHIP ONE AT 0655!

209
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,782
Ming:
ALL CREW MEMBERS,
PREPARE FOR ACCELERATION!

210
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:46,577
EMERGENCY ACCELERATION
IN 140 SECONDS!

211
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,039
LIEUTENANT PERIES...

212
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,374
HOW'S THE FULL SENSORY
PROJECTION SYSTEM?

213
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,503
NO PROBLEM, COLONEL SMIRNOV.

214
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,255
EVERYTHING IS GREEN
ACROSS THE BOARD.

215
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:00,466
Sergei:
THIS WILL BE YOUR FIRST
REAL BATTLE, LIEUTENANT.

216
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,594
I WANT TO AVOID A REPEAT
OF WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE.

217
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,013
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, SIR.

218
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,348
Ming:
ALL SHIPS HAVE REACHED
THE ACCELERATION ZONE.

219
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,559
COMMENCING ACCELERATION!

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,271
REALLY...
SO BOTH YOUR PARENTS

221
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,190
WERE MEMBERS OF
CELESTIAL BEING AS WELL?

222
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,151
YEAH, THEY WERE BOTH SECOND
GENERATION GUNDAM MEISTERS.

223
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:20,611
I SEE.

224
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,613
THEN I GUESS I'M
ABLE TO FIGHT

225
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,615
THANKS TO THE
WORK YOUR PARENTS DID.

226
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,243
SO, DID YOU GET HOMESICK
OR SOMETHING FELDT?

227
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,162
IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY...

228
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:31,038
OF THEIR DEATHS.

229
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,372
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

230
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:36,085
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
I ONLY KNOW THEY DIED.

231
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:37,586
ALL THE MEMBERS OF
CELESTIAL BEING

232
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:39,296
ARE SWORN TO SECRECY.

233
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,298
I DON'T KNOW
A SINGLE THING

234
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,050
ABOUT ANY OF THE
CURRENT MEMBERS.

235
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,468
BUT STILL...

236
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,553
NOT TELLING YOU
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS...

237
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:51,016
YOU'RE FOLLOWING
IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS.

238
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:52,392
YOU'RE STRONG, FELDT...

239
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:55,395
YOU'RE A REMARKABLY
STRONG GIRL.

240
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:59,149
IT'S NEIL.

241
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,192
HUH?

242
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:01,151
THAT'S MY REAL NAME.

243
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,778
NEIL DYLANDY.

244
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,571
YOUR REAL NAME?

245
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,616
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, FELDT.
I'M FROM IRELAND ORIGINALLY.

246
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:10,119
MY PARENTS WERE
KILLED BY TERRORISTS.

247
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:13,455
WHY TELL ME THAT?

248
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:15,707
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE UNFAIR

249
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,292
IF YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
SHARING YOUR PAST.

250
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,877
YOU'RE SO KIND.

251
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,712
YEAH, BUT ONLY TO THE LADIES.

252
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:22,297
LOCKON.

253
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:23,298
SORRY.

254
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,217
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

255
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,677
PHEW!

256
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:29,221
I COULDN'T EVEN TASTE MY FOOD,
IT WAS SO TENSE IN THERE!

257
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:30,264
YOU WHAT?

258
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,349
OH, NOTHING...

259
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,600
HUH?

260
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,936
SOMETHING ON THE E‐SENSOR...

261
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,438
THOSE ARE COMM DEVICES!

262
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:39,898
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
IDIOT!

263
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:41,233
WHAT DID I DO?

264
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,110
THE ENEMY KNOWS
OUR EXACT LOCATION!

265
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,660
Sumeragi:
ADJUST PTOLEMY'S COURSE.

266
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,829
PLOT THE SHORTEST ROUTE
TO THE ORBITAL RING.

267
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,372
Lichtendahl:
ROGER.

268
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,291
Sumeragi:
ALL MEISTERS, STAND
BY YOUR GUNDAMS.

269
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,334
IAN, WHAT'S THEIR
MAINTENANCE STATUS?

270
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,128
EXIA'S ALL FINISHED .

271
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:04,047
BUT DYNAMES CAN'T
USE ITS LEG GENERATORS...

272
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,550
AND ITS ARMOR IS STILL
STRIPPED.

273
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,052
THAT'S THE ONE I WANTED...

274
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,721
Sumeragi:
SEND OUT KYRIOS
AND VIRTUE FIRST.

275
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,639
RIGHT AWAY!
WAIT, FELDT...

276
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,559
MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVE.

277
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,271
Christina:
PTOLEMY: SWITCHING
TO CATAPULT MODE.

278
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,190
THEY SCATTERED HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS

279
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,317
OF COMM DEVICES
TO FIND THE AREAS WHERE

280
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,402
GN PARTICLES INTERFERE WITH
COMMUNICATIONS.

281
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:28,071
THE ONLY GROUP WITH THE
RESOURCES

282
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,656
TO MOUNT THIS
KIND OF OPERATION

283
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,200
IS THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE.

284
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,659
Sumeragi:
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

285
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,162
NOT GOOD. WE CAN'T GET OUT OF
ENEMY COMMUNICATION RANGE.

286
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,581
WE NEED TO HEAD FOR THE ORBITAL
RING'S POWER SATELLITES.

287
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:41,210
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MAKES
IT A COMMUNICATION DEAD ZONE.

288
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,295
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ERASE
OUR HANDICAP THERE.

289
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,504
RIGHT, CONSIDER IT DONE.

290
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,548
Christina:
KYRIOS HAS JUST LAUNCHED.

291
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:49,134
MOVING VIRTUE TO
THE CATAPULT DECK.

292
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:51,428
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW THEM
OFF WITH THE TWO GUNDAMS?

293
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,180
YEAH, THAT'S PART OF IT.

294
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,265
SORRY I'M LATE.

295
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,601
Christina:
FELDT, TAKE CARE OF
THE LAUNCHES, PLEASE.

296
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,852
ROGER.

297
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,940
Ian: I DID A QUICK FIX BY
PUTTING A STABILIZER ON THE LEFT
LEG,

298
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,149
BUT THE FIRE
CONTROL TUNING IS STILL‐‐

299
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,151
AS LONG AS I CAN SHOOT!

300
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,197
GO GET 'EM!
GO GET 'EM!
GO GET 'EM GO GET 'EM! GO GET 'EM! GO GET 'EM! GO GET 'EM GO GET 'EM!

301
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,991
THIS IS VIRTUE, TIERIA
ERDE... LAUNCHING.

302
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:21,750
Ming:
COLONEL, WE HAVE TWO ADDITIONAL
COMMUNICATION CUTOFF POINTS

303
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,252
AND THEY'RE
HEADED FOR THE RINGS.

304
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,963
ARE THE GUNDAMS
SPLITTING THEIR FORCES?

305
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,422
NO, THEY'RE TRYING TO
DRAW US OFF

306
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,800
BY SENDING OUT JUST TWO.

307
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,094
THEN THAT MEANS,
THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY

308
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:33,845
THAT THE FIRST CUTOFF POINT
IS ACTUALLY

309
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,847
CELESTIAL BEING'S
SPACE TRANSPORT.

310
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,017
THEN LET'S FALL FOR IT

311
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,186
AND THROW OUR OWN FEINT
RIGHT BACK AT THEM.

312
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,190
Sergei:
SHIPS ONE, TWO, AND THREE,
LAUNCH ALL MOBILE SUITS.

313
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,859
NAVIGATORS ON TWO AND THREE,
SWITCH TO AUTO‐PILOT,

314
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,113
DETACH BRIDGE
AND RETURN TO BASE.

315
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:53,699
NUMBER THREE, DON'T FORGET
YOU'RE TRACKING

316
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,492
THE THIRD
COMMUNICATION CUTOFF POINT.

317
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,914
Pilot #9A:
SHIPS ONE, TWO, AND THREE
LAUNCHING ALL MOBILE SUITS.

318
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:02,749
ASSUMING
STRAIGHT LINE FORMATION

319
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,335
BEHIND SHIP NUMBER ONE
AS PLANNED.

320
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,213
Pilot #9B:
SHIPS TWO AND THREE
DETACHING BRIDGES.

321
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,882
SHIP THREE TRACKING THIRD
COMMUNICATION CUTOFF POINT.

322
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,135
SHIP TWO, CHANGING COURSE

323
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,304
AND TRACKING SECOND
COMMUNICATION CUTOFF POINT.

324
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:18,557
SHIP ONE WILL LEAD OUR
MAIN FORCE

325
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:21,226
STRAIGHT BACK TO THE FIRST
COMMUNICATION CUTOFF POINT.

326
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:24,187
OUR TARGET IS THE POSSIBLE
ENEMY CARRIER.

327
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,149
WHEN YOU CATCH IT,
COMMENCE OPERATIONAL MANEUVERS!

328
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,859
Christina:
PTOLEMY HAS ENTERED THE
ORBITAL RING'S

329
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,777
ELECTROMAGNETIC
INTERFERENCE ZONE.

330
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,946
Feldt:
WE'RE GETTING A VISUAL
OF THE ENEMY FORCES

331
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,489
THEY'RE HERE.

332
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:36,491
Christina:
BRINGING UP MAXIMUM
MAGNIFICATION.

333
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,663
THE APPROACHING SHIPS ARE
FOUR HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE

334
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:45,751
MULTIPURPOSE TRANSPORTS
DESIGNATED EDI‐402 LAOHO.

335
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,502
TWO SHIPS ARE
BREAKING OFF,

336
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,004
TO THE LEFT
AND TO THE RIGHT.

337
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:51,256
PROBABLY TO ENGAGE
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE.

338
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,550
THEY FIGURED IT OUT.

339
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,469
CONTACT ALLELUJAH AND TIERIA.

340
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:58,680
BUT WE'RE IN THE INTERFERENCE
ZONE! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

341
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,849
LICHTY, CHANGE
COURSE IMMEDIATELY!

342
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,851
I NEED YOU TO GET AWAY FROM
THE ENEMY SHIPS

343
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,227
AND USE THE
ORBITAL RING AS A SHIELD!

344
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:05,437
ROGER THAT!

345
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,693
Ming:
ENEMY SHIP IS CHANGING COURSE.
IT'S HIDING BEHIND THE RING.

346
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:13,612
THEY'RE SHOWING SOME SKILL.

347
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,822
CAN WE GET A SILHOUETTE
OF THEIR SHIP?

348
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,574
Ming:
IT'LL BE AN A. I.
INTERPRETATION, SIR.

349
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:20,535
THAT'S FINE. GET IT.

350
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:24,206
SO THIS IS CELESTIAL
BEING'S SPACESHIP.

351
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,833
HOW LARGE MUST THAT
ORGANIZATION BE

352
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,461
IN ORDER TO
POSSESS SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

353
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,590
I'M GOING TO RELAY MY
TACTICAL FORECAST

354
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,425
OF THE SITUATION
TO ALL PERSONNEL.

355
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:36,968
I EXPECT THE SHIPS
APPROACHING US

356
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,553
WILL BE TWO LAOHO TRANSPORTS.

357
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,389
THOSE TWO SHIPS SHOULD HAVE

358
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:41,723
ALL OF THE ENEMY'S
FIGHTING STRENGTH.

359
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:43,558
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

360
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,352
Lasse:
WE KNOW THAT TWO SHIPS
ARE MOVING

361
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,145
TO ENGAGE
KYRIOS AND VIRTUE.

362
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:50,399
YEAH, I WAS KIND OF HOPING
THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT.

363
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,693
MY ORIGINAL PLAN HAD THE ENEMY
FLEET SEEING THROUGH MY FEINT,

364
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:57,447
IGNORING ALLELUJAH AND TIERIA,
AND COMING STRAIGHT AT OUR SHIP.

365
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,449
THEN, THE TWO GUNDAMS WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE

366
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:00,409
TO MAKE A
PINCER ATTACK FROM BEHIND.

367
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:05,997
BUT THE ENEMY RESPONDED TO OUR
FEINT. WITH ONE OF THEIR OWN.

368
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:08,625
I'M AFRAID THE MOBILE SUITS ON
THOSE TWO ATTACKING SHIPS

369
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,460
HAVE ALREADY BEEN LAUNCHED

370
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,588
AND ALLELUJAH AND TIERIA
ARE NOW WASTING TIME

371
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,715
INTERCEPTING EMPTY ENEMY
TRANSPORTS.

372
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,718
(Boom)

373
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,805
WELL, THAT WAS
A WASTE OF TIME.

374
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,974
Allelujah:
THEY WEREN'T CARRYING
ANY MOBILE SUITS.

375
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,350
THAT MEANS...

376
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,103
MY FORECAST HAS THEM
TAKING SIX MINUTES

377
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,730
TO GET BACK TO US AFTER
DEALING WITH THE ENEMY'S FEINT.

378
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,024
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE
GOING TO BE ATTACKED

379
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:35,026
BY WAVES
OF ENEMY MOBILE SUITS.

380
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:38,029
MISS SUMERAGI, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU BASING THIS ON?

381
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,824
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THE
EXACT SAME TACTIC WAS USED

382
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,410
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO DURING
THE FOURTH SOLAR POWER WAR.

383
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,329
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE'S
OPERATION COMMANDER WAS

384
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,249
CALLED "THE WILD BEAR OF
RUSSIA". SERGEI SMIRNOV.

385
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,002
MAIN FORCE, LET'S
BEGIN THE OPERATION!

386
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,838
DON'T THROW YOUR
LIVES AWAY TODAY!

387
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:58,049
Feldt:
EXIA, DYNAMES... OPENING
CONTAINER HATCHES.

388
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:01,678
Feldt:
EXIA IS TO TAKE UP AN
INTERCEPTION POSITION

389
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,305
IN FRONT OF THE PTOLEMAIOS.

390
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,732
Feldt:
DYNAMES IS TO SECURE ITS LEGS
TO THE CONTAINER

391
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,485
AND STANDBY TO
INTERCEPT WITH ITS GN RIFLE .

392
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:22,449
PTOLEMY'S PRIORITIES HAVE
NOW BEEN SHIFTED TO DEFENSE.

393
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:26,119
DISENGAGING NORMAL POWER.

394
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,663
WAIT, ARE WE REALLY
GOING TO FIGHT THOSE GUYS?

395
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:30,165
BUT THIS
SHIP'S UNARMED!

396
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,083
YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT GUNDAMS!

397
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,877
ONLY TWO
OF THEM...

398
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:35,128
ONLY TWO
OF THEM...
THE ENEMY SHOULD BE SHOWING UP RIGHT ABOUT NOW!

399
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:35,962
THE ENEMY SHOULD BE
SHOWING UP RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

400
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,881
TRY TO LAST FOR 360 SECONDS.

401
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,133
Feldt:
ENEMY TRANSPORT EMERGING
FROM BEHIND RING!

402
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,177
DYNAMES, OPEN FIRE!

403
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:43,345
Lockon:
I'M ON IT!

404
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,557
MY AIM IS OFF BECAUSE THE
MACHINE'S WEIGHT IS DIFFERENT!

405
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:49,476
HARO ADJUSTING! HARO ADJUSTING!

406
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,727
THERE'S NO TIME.

407
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,230
I'M JUST GOING TO WING IT.

408
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,524
WE HAVE INCOMING MISSILES.
TWENTY‐FOUR OF THEM!

409
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:56,900
Lockon:
I'M TAKING THEM OUT!

410
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,737
(Guns blasting)

411
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,240
DAMMIT!

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,324
DEPLOY GN FIELD!

413
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:05,659
ROGER THAT, MA'AM!

414
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,286
(Boom)

415
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,083
IT'S TOO FAST!

416
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,293
THEY'RE RAMMING US
WITH AN UNMANNED SHIP!

417
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:16,878
THEY'RE GOING TO RAM?

418
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:18,964
NO! NO!

419
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:20,340
NO, YOU DON'T!

420
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,342
♪

421
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,223

422
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:29,849
(Boom)

423
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,977
REDEPLOY GN FIELD!

424
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,436
NO... NO...

425
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,813
COME ON, CHRIS‐‐

426
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,606
(Boom)

427
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,277
PLEASE HURRY BACK,
ALLELUJAH.

428
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,654
I DON'T WANT TO DIE,
I DON'T WANT TO DIE...

429
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,030
CHRISTINA SIERRA!

430
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,615
WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE!

431
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,993
(Siren wailing)

432
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,745
WE'RE ALL...

433
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:52,956
GOING TO SURVIVE.

434
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:53,915
FELDT.

435
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,168
YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE
FELDT SAID.

436
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,546
WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE THIS!

437
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,548
WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH
THIS NO MATTER WHAT!

438
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,300
Lockon:
I'M CONFIRMING ENEMY
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS.

439
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,467
HUH?

440
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,621
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE HIDING
BEHIND THEIR LITTLE TRANSPORTS.

441
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,623
I'M COUNTING
THIRTY‐SIX ENEMY UNITS.

442
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:16,875
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE
CLEVER, DO YOU?!

443
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,672
THEY'RE IN MY BLIND SPOT!

444
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:24,800
BRIDGE, TURN THE
CONTAINER RIGHT NOW!

445
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:29,179
(Guns blasting)

446
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:35,227
THEY WANT ME TO FOLLOW.

447
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:43,819
IF I GO OUT TOO FAR,
OUR DEFENSES WILL COLLAPSE.

448
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,946
Lockon:
GOT YOU!

449
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,030
NOT AGAIN!

450
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,032
Lasse:
THE ENEMY IS GETTING COLD FEET.

451
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:52,244
Lichtendahl:
YEAH, AND THE GN FIELD CAN
TAKE THIS KIND OF ATTACK.

452
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,286
HANG ON CHRISTINA...

453
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,163
I HEAR YOU, FELDT.

454
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,122
JUST A LITTLE...

455
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,874
LITTLE LONGER.

456
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:00,585
THIS LONG‐RANGE ATTACK GOES
AGAINST STANDARD DOCTRINE

457
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,629
FOR A MOBILE
SUIT ASSAULT ON A SHIP...

458
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,715
I GET IT!
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS!

459
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,759
THE HRL...NO.

460
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,429
ACTUALLY IT MUST BE SERGEI
SMIRNOV. HIS OBJECTIVE

461
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:13,807
ISN'T THE PTOLEMY,
HE WANTS TO CAPTURE A GUNDAM!

462
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,225
(Slam)

463
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,143
MY FORECASTING WAS
COMPLETELY OFF!

464
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,020
DAMN IT ALL...

465
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,356
I SWORE I WOULD NEVER
MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE!

466
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:27,779
I CAN SEE THEM.

467
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,781
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

468
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,992
