1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,713
ACCORDING TO
THE JNN RESEARCH TEAM,

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,341
IT APPEARS THAT OVER THE COURSE
OF THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS,

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,551
MANY SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS
HAVE VANISHED

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,261
UNDER MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,763
WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,432
CELESTIAL BEING IS SOMEHOW
INVOLVED IN THAT.

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,976
DEVELOPING AN ENTIRELY
NEW MOBILE SUIT

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,312
TAKES A MINIMUM OF 10 YEARS!

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,940
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THEY SET THIS PLAN IN MOTION

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,859
OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO?

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,611
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

12
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,738
BUT IT'S STILL
MOSTLY CONJECTURE.

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,907
THE CIVILIAN MEDIA CAN'T
POSSIBLY GO DEEPER

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,035
THAN WHAT THEY'VE
FOUND SO FAR.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,036
HMM?

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,122
VERY WELL, THEN.

17
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,752
IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE
I'VE SEEN YOU TWO.

18
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,128
I BELIEVE
THE LAST TIME WE MET

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,840
WAS THE SOLAR POWER
GENERATION SUMMIT.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,302
IT'S A SHAME ABOUT THAT SCANDAL
WITH THE SUPER HUMAN INSTITUTE.

21
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,389
I DID NOT COME HERE
TO ENGAGE IN IDLE GOSSIP.

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,140
THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL
MEETING.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,560
LET US GET TO
THE MATTER AT HAND.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,854
I'VE GONE OVER THE MATERIALS
THOROUGHLY.

25
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,940
IF THIS PROPOSAL
BECOMES A REALITY,

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,067
IT WOULD MARK THE WORLD'S
FIRST ATTEMPT.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,861
I BELIEVE THE REWARD
IS MORE THAN WORTH THE EFFORT

28
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,115
IF WE GET A HOLD OF THE GUNDAMS.

THE BALANCE POINT OF GRAVITY
AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE

36
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,756
THAT LIES BETWEEN
THE EARTH AND THE MOON.

37
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,176
THIS IS THE LOCATION OF A SPACE
COLONY BELONGING TO THE UNION,

38
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,805
WHICH TOOK THE LEAD IN
SPACE DEVELOPMENT.

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,973
AN ENORMOUS ASTEROID FIELD

40
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,476
LIES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED
KILOMETERS AWAY,

41
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,770
MADE UP OF COUNTLESS
RESOURCE SATELLITES

42
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,024
WHICH WERE BROUGHT HERE FOR
COLONY CONSTRUCTION.

43
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,360
WITHIN THIS FIELD LIES
THE SECRET DOCK

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,489
OF THE PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION CELESTIAL BEING.

45
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,535
ALLELUJAH,
WHAT'S THE SITUATION LIKE?

46
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,911
NO PROBLEMS HERE.

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,704
GN PARTICLE DISPERSAL
AROUND THE SATELLITE

48
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,124
IS SHOWING NORMAL LEVELS.

49
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,750
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD'VE
LEFT THIS TO US

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,544
AND GONE DOWN
TO EARTH IF YOU WANTED.

51
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,962
I'M JUST FINE HERE.

52
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,340
MY BODY WAS DESIGNED
TO BE TOUGHER THAN OTHERS.

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,052
BESIDES, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I WANT TO THINK OVER.

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,430
THE PROBLEM IS
WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN.

55
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,307
THIS ISN'T A CAREER THAT
HAS ROOM FOR REGRETS.

56
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,600
(Grunts)

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,060
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,063
(Birds chirping)

59
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,565
Liu‐Mei:
WITH THE PROGRESS OF
NANO‐MACHINES

60
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,733
WE'VE REDUCED THE NEGATIVE
EFFECTS LIVING IN SPACE

61
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,444
CAN HAVE ON
THE HUMAN BODY.

62
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,695
HOWEVER,

63
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,363
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE
OF MENTAL HEALTH,

64
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,241
PEOPLE STILL NEED TO SPEND
SOME TIME ON THE GROUND.

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,325
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

66
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,119
LIVING IN SPACE
OUTSIDE OF COLONIES,

67
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,246
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A LOT MORE TIME.

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,832
DO YOU DISAPPROVE OF HUMANITY
MOVING INTO SPACE,

69
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,292
MISS SUMERAGI?

70
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,668
AS A SPECIES,

71
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,004
I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY STILL
A LITTLE BIT IMMATURE.

72
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,840
BUT, THAT'S NOT REALLY
A BAD THING.

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,093
ONE OF LIFE'S GREATEST PLEASURES
IS DRINKING IN GRAVITY.

74
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,929
DRINKING THIS EARLY IS
UNHEALTHY YOU KNOW.

75
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,848
IT'S HARDER THAN
IT LOOKS TO KICK A HABIT.

76
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,933
I'M IMMATURE, TOO.

77
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,728
(Birds chirping)

78
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,896
Lichtendahl:
WHAT ARE THEY UP TO?

79
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,938
THOSE TWO THERE.

80
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,065
THEY'LL CALL YOU
A PEEPING TOM.

81
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,442
AND HIM,

82
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,611
WHO WANTS TO BE AROUND
SOMEONE SO FULL OF HIMSELF?

83
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,820
(Grunting)

84
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,697
THOSE ARE "ROSES".

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,032
HARO, WHAT ARE THOSE?

86
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,700
ANEMONES!
ANEMONES!

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,910
(Feldt chuckles)

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,120
EVERYONE'S
DOING THEIR OWN THING.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,039
HEY, WHERE ARE THE MEISTERS?

90
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,124
SETSUNA WENT BACK TO
HIS APARTMENT,

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,460
LOCKON TOOK OFF
SOMEWHERE BY HIMSELF,

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,879
AND I THINK TIERIA
MIGHT BE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

93
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,173
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE NOTICED?
A LACK OF TEAM SPIRIT.

94
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,758
YEAH, BUT IT WOULD BE WEIRD

95
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,511
TO HANG OUT WITH
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

96
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,389
(Tieria thinking)
SINCE CELESTIAL BEING
BEGAN OPERATIONS,

97
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,977
CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD
HAVE DECREASED BY 38%.

98
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,189
63% OF CORPORATIONS
INVOLVED IN WEAPONS PRODUCTION

99
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,151
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL
LEAVE THE INDUSTRY.

100
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,153
IF WE GO STRICTLY BY
THESE NUMBERS,

101
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,990
WE'VE ACHIEVED VEDA'S
OPERATIONAL PREDICTIONS.

102
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,534
THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE EXPOSED

103
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,119
BOTH DYNAMES'S HIGH ALTITUDE
FIRING CAPABILITY

104
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,582
AND GN‐004 NADLEEH
TO THE WORLD.

105
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,752
AND THEN,
THERE'S SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

106
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,131
Setsuna:
WITH THE ASSISTANCE
OF THE UNITED NATIONS,

107
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,133
AZADISTAN HAS RESUMED
CONSTRUCTION

108
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,929
ON ITS SOLAR RECEIVER ANTENNAS.

109
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,097
(Girls talking)

110
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,932
Lockon:
OH, IT'S YOU, LICHTY.

111
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,685
I'VE BEEN CHECKING IN.
WHY ARE YOU CALLING?

112
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,353
AH...NO REASON.

113
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
BUT WAIT, IT SOUNDS LIKES
YOU'RE WITH SOME GIRLS!

114
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,566
HOW MANY CHICKS ARE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH, MAN?!

115
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,525
THAT DOG.

116
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,318
DON'T ASK
SUCH SILLY QUESTIONS.

117
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,571
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
I'M HANGING UP. LATER.

118
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,114
NO, HOLD ON!

119
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,240
Girl #1:
WHICH ONE OF US
DO YOU LIKE BEST?

120
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,700
Girl #2:
I HOPE YOU LIKE ME BEST!

121
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,702
(Turns off recording)

122
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,584
Lockon:
IT LOOKS SO BEATIFUL NOW.

123
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,148
GREAT NEWS, KINUE!

124
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,357
YESTERDAY'S NEWS SPECIAL

125
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,027
HAD AN AUDIENCE SHARE
OF OVER 40%!

126
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,570
REALLY?!

127
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,989
THOSE ARE THE BEST AUDIENCE
NUMBERS THIS SHOW'S EVER HAD!

128
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,407
THEN, I CAN KEEP WORKING ON IT?!

129
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,118
YEAH! THE TOP GUYS
WANT YOU TO!

130
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,745
NEXT WE'LL GET YOU
WORKING ON THE EFFECT

131
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,081
CELESTIAL BEING'S ACTIVITIES
ARE HAVING ON THE WORLD ECONOMY!

132
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,375
TEAM UP WITH SAKAZAKI
FROM ECONOMICS AND

133
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,461
LIST THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE
EITHER GONE BANKRUPT‐‐

134
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,920
BUT BOSS!

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,173
PLEASE, LET ME
KEEP RESEARCHING AEOLIA!

136
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,132
WHAT'S THE POINT?!

137
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,717
(Disappointed sigh)

138
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,052
I'M STARTING
TO GET THE FEELING

139
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,345
THAT CELESTIAL BEING
MIGHT HAVE

140
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,264
A DIFFERENT GOAL THAN
SIMPLY ERADICATING WAR.

141
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,558
IF I KEEP RESEARCHING
AEOLIA SCHENBERG,

142
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,895
THERE'S A CHANCE I COULD
GET TO THE TRUTH HERE!

143
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,355
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO!

144
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,856
(Grunts)

145
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,567
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S YOUR CALL!

146
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,029
JUST DON'T DO
ANYTHING RECKLESS.

147
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,448
DIG TOO DEEP AND YOU MIGHT NOT
BE ABLE TO CRAWL OUT.

148
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,366
YES, SIR.

149
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,704
WHEN YOU GET HOME,
SAY HI TO DAD FOR ME.

150
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,955
I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE
DOING WELL

151
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,791
AND THAT
YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD GIRL.

152
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,000
(Grunts)

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,919
I'VE FINISHED LOADING
YOUR LUGGAGE MA'AM!

154
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,921
OH, THANKS SO MUCH,
SAJI!

155
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
HUH?

156
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,550
Saji:
HELLO!

157
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,595
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LATELY.
DID YOU GO OUT OF TOWN?

158
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,763
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

159
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,014
Louise's Mom:
TAKE CARE!

160
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,391
BYE, MOM!

161
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,937
OH!

162
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,815
I KNOW IT'S OUT OF THE BLUE
BUT ARE YOU FREE TODAY?

163
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,317
WHY?

164
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,487
Saji:
I HAVE A FAVOR
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.

165
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,490
David:
MR. PRESIDENT,

166
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,909
HAVE YOU READ THE BRIEFING
CONCERNING PROJECT G?

167
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,786
UH‐HUH, I READ THEM.

168
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,246
TAKLAMAKAN.

169
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,540
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE
HAS CHOSEN A REGION

170
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,542
WHERE THEY
BURIED ENRICHED URANIUM,

171
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,168
A RELIC OF THE PAST.

172
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,088
IT'S PERFECT FOR
A MILITARY EXERCISE, SIR!

173
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,382
IT'S SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS
IN ALL DIRECTIONS,

174
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,927
AND IT'S SO BARREN THAT
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN GO NEAR IT.

175
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,762
SINCE THEY CAN KEEP AWAY
ANY MEDIA,

176
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,140
IT'LL WORK FINE FOR THEM.

177
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,308
THEY'RE SO DESPERATE,
AREN'T THEY?

178
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,603
Official:
THAT'S THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
TROOPS MY NATION CAN DEPLOY.

179
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,481
WE'VE BEEN TAKING STRONG PUBLIC
CRITICISM SINCE MORALIA.

180
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,776
AND TO USE THAT ACCURSED GROUND
FOR THE EXERCISE...

181
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,153
BUT IF WE DON'T
DEPLOY OUR FORCES,

182
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,904
WE'LL END UP FALLING
BEHIND THE UNION

183
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,115
AND THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE.

184
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,202
THE PUBLIC WILL BE FINE,
IF WE CAN GET RESULTS.

185
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,789
WE MUST OBTAIN A GUNDAM.
NO MATTER THE COST.

186
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,210
IT TOOK A WHILE BUT
EVERYTHING IS NOW IN PLACE.

187
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,547
IF THIS OPERATION SUCCEEDS,
SIR, AND IT SHOULD,

188
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,508
OUR PARTY WILL STAY IN POWER
FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

189
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,677
YOU HAVE TO LOOK
FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE.

190
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,972
TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF BECOMING
THE LEADER OF THE WORLD

191
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,683
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT
WE ACQUIRE THEM.

192
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,061
Howard:
OVER FLAGS?

193
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,440
THAT'S RIGHT. THE OFFICIAL TITLE
OF THE ANTI‐GUNDAM TASK FORCE.

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,275
ON THE SURFACE,
WE FUNCTION AS

195
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,819
THE EIGHTH INDEPENDENT
TACTICAL AIR SQUADRON,

196
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,280
CONSISTING
SOLELY OF FLAGS.

197
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,699
SO DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE
GETTING SOME MORE PILOTS?

198
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,118
WELL,
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

199
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,495
(Jets flying above)

200
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,496
HUH?

201
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,962
TWELVE MACHINES?!

202
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,547
Howard:
THE MARKINGS ON THAT MACHINE...

203
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,759
IS THAT JOSHUA FROM
ALASKA FLYING POINT?!

204
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,135
RANDY FROM GEORGIA,

205
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,346
AND STUART FROM ILLINOIS!

206
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,140
THEY'RE THE TOP PILOTS
FROM THEIR SQUADRONS.

207
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,022
THERE'S ANOTHER SURPRISE, TOO.

208
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,066
THE PLAN IS TO HAVE ALL
OF OUR FLAGS

209
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,652
CUSTOMIZED BY
PROFESSOR EIFMAN HIMSELF.

210
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,736
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

211
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,530
WOULD I LIE TO YOU?

212
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,366
Graham:
OUR TASK FORCE IS PART
OF THE REGULAR MILITARY NOW

213
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,077
AND TWELVE FLAG FIGHTERS ARE
BEING TRANSFERRED HERE.

214
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,830
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BIG
OPERATION IN THE WORKS, BOYS.

215
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,248
KEEP YOUR HEADS UP!

216
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,207
Both:
ROGER THAT!

217
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,336
Peries:
ARE WE MOVING OUT, COLONEL?

218
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,587
MOST LIKELY.

219
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,922
THOUGH I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN
ALL THE DETAILS

220
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,299
OF THE OPERATION JUST YET.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,134
Sergei:
I HEAR OTHER MOBILE SUIT TEAMS
BESIDES OURS

222
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,512
ARE GETTING THEIR
MARCHING ORDERS AS WELL.

223
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,223
THIS TIME, I WILL FOLLOW
YOUR ORDERS PRECISELY, SIR!

224
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,558
JUST RELAX.

225
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,308
YES, SIR!

226
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,897
(Woman moaning)

227
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,150
SORRY, BABE,
BUT DADDY'S GOT TO GO.

228
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,944
HA!

229
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,072
I'LL MAKE UP FOR IT NEXT TIME!

230
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,534
PATRICK COLASOUR,
AEU ACE IS HERE!

231
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,452
(Yelps in pain)

232
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,871
LIEUTENANT, YOU'RE LATE.

233
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,705
(Gasps)

234
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,123
DAMN YOU, WOMAN!

235
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,291
HITTING A MAN IN THE FACE
IS JUST‐‐

236
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,333
OWW!

237
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,335
YOU...YOU DID IT AGAIN!

238
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,254
I AM COLONEL
KATI MANNEQUIN

239
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,006
MISSION COMMANDER
OF THIS MOBILE SUIT TEAM.

240
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,675
(Grunts)

241
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,136
(Thinking)
SHE'S GORGEOUS!

242
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,430
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY FOR
BEING LATE, COLONEL!

243
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,806
I THINK I'M IN LOVE!

244
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,070
Alejandro:
THEY ACT LIKE THEY'RE MARTYRS.

245
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,866
IF THEY PERSIST IN THIS FASHION,
THEY'LL NEVER ERADICATE WAR.

246
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,702
PERHAPS THEY'VE MISTAKEN
THE ABILITIES OF THEIR GUNDAMS

247
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,162
FOR THE POWERS OF GOD.

248
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,872
THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH.

249
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,457
GUNDAMS ARE SIMPLY WEAPONS.

250
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,752
THEY WERE MADE TO ACHIEVE
CERTAIN OBJECTIVES,

251
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,087
AND THEY WERE
MADE FOR KILLING PEOPLE.

252
00:11:55,214 --> 00:12:03,848
(Phone beeping)

253
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,099
HMM?

254
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
I'M GETTING A MESSAGE ON
THE CIVILIAN LINE?

255
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,856
HI, HOW'RE YOU DOING,
KUJO?

256
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,817
I HAVE SOME MATERIAL HERE THAT
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK OVER.

257
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,986
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR OPINION.

258
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,322
HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON.

259
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,782
(Shocked gasp)

260
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,241
COULD THAT BE?!

261
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,618
NO WAY.

262
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,125
(Louise bawling)

263
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,627
MOM!

264
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,712
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

265
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,339
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

266
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,132
I'D HOPED IF WE HAD
MORE PEOPLE HERE,

267
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,717
LOUISE WOULD
HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED.

268
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,636
GUESS IT'S NOT
WORKING.

269
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,096
(Loud wailing)

270
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,139
YOUR MOTHER JUST WENT
BACK HOME, RIGHT?

271
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,557
SO WHY THE TEARS?

272
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,684
BECAUSE I MISS HER!

273
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,894
YOU CAN SEE HER
WHENEVER YOU WANT TO.

274
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,937
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S DEAD.

275
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,230
(Wails)

276
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,982
SAJI, I HATE THIS GUY!

277
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,108
EITHER PUNCH HIM
OR HIT HIM!

278
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,193
HEY, I CAN'T DO THAT!

279
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,528
AND PUNCHING AND HITTING
ARE THE SAME‐‐

280
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,571
(Crying continues)

281
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,489
(Sighs)

282
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,907
SORRY ABOUT THIS!

283
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,492
HUH?

284
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,119
YOU'RE SO PEACEFUL.

285
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,078
HUH?

286
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,454
(PDA beeps)

287
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,456
I'M SORRY, SOMETHING
HAS JUST COME UP.

288
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,041
OH.

289
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,293
YEAH, GO HOME!
BIG JERK!

290
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,424
ALL THREE BLOCS ARE ON THE MOVE?

291
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,134
I SEE.

292
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,303
Christina:
A JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE?

293
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,764
Lichtendahl:
THE UNION, HRL AND AEU?

294
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,933
THAT IS WHAT
MY AGENTS REPORT.

295
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,269
THERE'LL BE AN OFFICIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT IN A FEW DAYS.

296
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,063
IF IT'S REALLY TRUE,
IT'LL BE ON A HUGE SCALE.

297
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,150
SO THE UNION AND HUMAN REFORM
LEAGUE ARE ALL FRIENDLY NOW?

298
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,443
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

299
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,445
IT'S BECAUSE OF US.

300
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,989
THAT WOULD BE
THE APPROPRIATE CONCLUSION.

301
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,783
THE HRL'S
CAPTURE OPERATION FAILED.

302
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,660
SO IF THEY WANT TO KEEP US
IN CHECK,

303
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,038
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK
WITH THE OTHERS TO PULL IT OFF.

304
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,540
BUT IF IT'S JUST
A MILITARY EXERCISE,

305
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,542
WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD REASON
TO INTERVENE, DO WE?

306
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,127
THERE'S MORE TO THIS.

307
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,462
Everyone:
HMM?

308
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,922
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PUT
A LARGE FORCE IN THE FIELD.

309
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,132
THEY'RE NOT HOLDING
AN EXERCISE

310
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,217
OF THIS SCALE
TO KEEP US IN CHECK.

311
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,761
I AGREE WITH THAT.

312
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,138
WANG LIU MEI,
FIND OUT THE LOCATION, PLEASE.

313
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,556
IT'S BEING DONE.

314
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,974
KEEP ON IT.

315
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,977
EVERYONE, I THINK
WE'LL BE DEPLOYING YOU GUYS.

316
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,146
YOU SHOULD ENJOY YOURSELVES
WHILE YOU CAN.

317
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,230
(Determined grunt)

318
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,232
RIGHT, FELDT.
SHOPPING TIME! COME ON!

319
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,233
HEY!

320
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,318
YOU WANT TO‐‐

321
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,527
NO, I'LL PASS.

322
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,946
Lichtendahl:
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING YET!

323
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,744
(Thinking)
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THE WORLD
WOULD CHANGE SO QUICKLY?

324
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,788
IS THERE
A SHIFT IN HUMANITY THAT

325
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,290
NOT EVEN VEDA COULD PREDICT?

326
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,922
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY UP,
BUT BE CAREFUL OF THE G‐FORCES.

327
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,590
DON'T TREAT ME LIKE I'M OLD.

328
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,591
(Grunts)

329
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,134
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

330
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,473
Katagiri:
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO COME.

331
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,808
Sumeragi:
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,

332
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,893
AFTER SENDING ME
THAT DISTURBING FILE?

333
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,729
I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

334
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,440
SO, IS THIS FOR REAL?

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,486
HOW ABOUT I JUST CALL IT
THE MILITARY'S SIMULATION PLAN?

336
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,571
THE PROBABILITY
OF CAPTURING A GUNDAM

337
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,281
GIVEN CURRENT FORCE STRENGTH.

338
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,117
CAN I GET YOUR OPINION

339
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,828
AS A TACTICAL FORECASTER,
THAT IS?

340
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,996
THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH
DATA ON THE GUNDAMS.

341
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,915
AND NOT JUST THEIR
PERFORMANCE,

342
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,668
YOU CAN'T REALLY BE SURE
THERE ARE ONLY FOUR MACHINES.

343
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,129
I CAN'T IMAGINE MASS PRODUCTION.

344
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,923
THERE'D BE NO WAY TO HIDE ALL
THE PERSONNEL AND MATERIALS.

345
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,383
THAT'S TRUE.

346
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,427
LET'S SAY YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF
THIS OPERATION. NOW WHAT?

347
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,680
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.

348
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,181
YEAH, I KNOW.

349
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,600
WE CAN'T DEFEAT THEM
WITH OUR CURRENT FORCES.

350
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,396
BUT WHAT IF WE SURROUND THEM
WITH OVERWHELMING NUMBERS,

351
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,607
DRAW THE BATTLE OUT AND
SIMPLY EXHAUST THEIR PILOTS?

352
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,776
THERE'S THE CHANCE
THEY'D SWITCH TO AUTO‐PILOT

353
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,737
TO ENSURE SECRECY, OR EVEN
SELF‐DESTRUCT.

354
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,364
VERY ASTUTE.

355
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,449
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
CELESTIAL BEING

356
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,118
AND YOU HAVE ANALYZED THEM TOO.

357
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,036
HUH?

358
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,913
STOP IT.
DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

359
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,498
SORRY.

360
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,543
(Surprised gasp)

361
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,713
Sumeragi:
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVEN'T COPIED THE FILE.

362
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,924
YOU KNOW, THIS PROVES YOU'RE
NOT MUCH OF A SOLDIER

363
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,177
IF YOU'RE SHARING THIS
WITH ME.

364
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,262
DID YOU WANT TO
DROP BY THE BASE?

365
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,390
PROFESSOR EIFMAN WAS WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

366
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,851
NO, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

367
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,269
OH, IS SOMEONE WAITING
FOR YOU?

368
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,520
HUH?

369
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,938
AND IF THERE WAS?

370
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,858
WELL, THAT
WOULD MAKE ME JEALOUS.

371
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,152
I REALLY DO HAVE PLANS.

372
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,154
SEE YOU LATER.

373
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,118
THAT'S FINE.
I HOPE I DO SEE YOU.

374
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,661
Newscaster:
THIS NEWS JUST IN.

375
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,955
THE UNION, THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE AND THE AEU

376
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,374
HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT ALL THREE
OF
THEIR ARMED FORCES

377
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,710
WILL TAKE PART IN A MASSIVE
MILITARY EXERCISE.

378
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,128
ACCORDING TO
AN OFFICIAL COMMENT

379
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,130
FROM A UNION
PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER,

380
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,632
THE GOAL OF THE EXERCISE

381
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,634
IS BETTER DEFENSE
OF THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS.

382
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,052
TO THIS END,

383
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,637
JOINT COUNTERMEASURES
WILL BE PRACTICED

384
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,847
DEALING WITH A WIDE‐RANGE OF
POSSIBLE SITUATIONS.

385
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,515
AT THIS TIME,

386
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,517
THE SCHEDULE AND LOCATION OF
THE EXERCISE ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

387
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,602
GUESS IT'S STARTED.

388
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,520
UH‐HUH.

389
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,981
Announcer:
IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT UNION
FORCES STATIONED IN JAPAN

390
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,359
WILL BE TAKING PART AND
THAT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE FORCE

391
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,903
HAS ALSO BEEN ASKED TO
PARTICIPATE.

392
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,155
HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS DECIDED TO ADOPT

393
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,240
A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE.

394
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,454
Howard:
HIGH‐OUTPUT PLASMA JETS AND
NEW MODEL LINEAR RIFLES.

395
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,123
NOW THAT'S WHAT A SQUADRON
SHOULD LOOK LIKE!

396
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,959
Daryl:
BUT IS IT
GOING TO DO ANY GOOD

397
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,919
WHEN WE GO UP AGAINST
THOSE GUNDAMS?

398
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,047
Joshua:
COWARDICE EVEN
BEFORE THE MISSION'S STARTED?

399
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,549
FIRST LIEUTENANT GRAHAM
CAN'T BE MUCH OF A LEADER

400
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,968
WITH SUBORDINATES LIKE THIS.

401
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,011
HE'S A CAPTAIN,
NOT A LIEUTENANT!

402
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,514
HE WAS PROMOTED FOR
THE NEW SQUADRON.

403
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,182
MY. HOW IMPRESSIVE.

404
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,476
DID HE KILL HIS
COMMANDING OFFICER AGAIN?

405
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,353
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT CRAP!

406
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,354
(Chuckles)

407
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,605
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

408
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,899
IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT,
YOUR PRECIOUS CAPTAIN

409
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,359
COULD SHOOT YOU IN
THE BACK TOO.

410
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,360
YOU DIE!

411
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,736
Graham:
THAT'S ENOUGH.

412
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,862
Howard:
CAPTAIN!

413
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,864
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT YOU THINK.

414
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,408
I PLAN TO CLEAR MY NAME

415
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,202
BY MY ACTIONS
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

416
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,914
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT,
SQUADRON CAPTAIN GRAHAM AKER.

417
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,294
Hong‐Long:
MISTRESS. THE AMERICAN FLEET
IS ON THE MOVE.

418
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,712
IT APPEARS TO BE CROSSING
THE PACIFIC OCEAN

419
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,255
AND HEADING FOR EURASIA.

420
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,966
RIGHT NOW,
THE AEU SHOULD BE

421
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,551
ASSEMBLING
THEIR MOBILE SUIT TEAMS

422
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,970
AND HEADING FOR THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE'S BORDERS.

423
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,097
BUT, HOW COULD YOU
KNOW THAT?

424
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,976
MISS SUMERAGI.
HER FORECASTS ARE VERY ACCURATE.

425
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,352
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

426
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,605
Sumeragi:
VEDA'S OPINION
MATCHES MINE.

427
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,732
SO YOU'RE BOTH PREDICTING
SOME KIND OF CONFLICT?

428
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,483
OH, MOST CERTAINLY.

429
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,986
WHERE?

430
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,488
Sumeragi: THE TAKLAMAKAN DESERT
IN NORTHWESTERN CHINA.

431
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,490
ENRICHED URANIUM IS STORED
UNDERGROUND THERE.

432
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
URANIUM?

433
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,328
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH ORGANIZATION IT IS,

434
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,122
BUT A TERRORIST GROUP IS
PLANNING TO ATTACK IT.

435
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,957
EITHER THE UNION OR
THE HRL LEAKED

436
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,792
THE INFORMATION
WHEN THEY CHOSE THIS SPOT.

437
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,544
IF THE FACILITY IS ATTACKED,

438
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,254
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
COULD LEAK OUT

439
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,132
AND CAUSE DAMAGE
ON A WORLDWIDE SCALE.

440
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,217
THEN WE'VE NO CHOICE
BUT TO INTERVENE.

441
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,763
YES, BUT WE'LL BE DIVING INTO
AN ENEMY MILITARY EXERCISE.

442
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,099
ALL OF THEIR FORCES WILL
IMMEDIATELY GO ON THE DEFENSIVE.

443
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,143
NO, THEY'RE GOING TO GO
ON THE OFFENSIVE

444
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,811
TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE GUNDAMS.

445
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,106
BUT WE'RE CELESTIAL BEING,
WE MUST ACT.

446
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,566
TIERIA.

447
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,569
TO A GUNDAM MEISTER, OUR SECRETS
AND MISSION OBJECTIVES

448
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,780
ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
THAN LIFE OR DEATH.

449
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,783
ALL OF US ACCEPTED THAT
BEFORE PILOTING THE GUNDAMS.

450
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,993
IN FACT, WE COULDN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT THAT DETERMINATION.

451
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,960
Lockon:
ROGER. HEADING BACK
TO THE SAFEHOUSE.

452
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,930
THIS IS HEAVY STUFF.

453
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,224
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HOLD US
BACK THIS TIME!

454
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:38,646
THIS IS THE WORLD'S RESPONSE.

455
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:42,567
MAXIMUM GN PARTICLE EMISSION!
DEPLOYING AHEAD OF MACHINE!

456
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,570
KYRIOS,
COMMENCING ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY!

457
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:50,575
Setsuna:
ROGER. WILL RENDEZVOUS
AT DESIGNATED TIME AND PLACE.

458
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,660
THANK YOU.

459
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,661
HUH?

460
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:57,665
WHAT THE?
WHY IS EXIA THERE?

461
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,375
Lasse:
HEY, SOMETHING WRONG?

462
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,669
OH, NOPE!
NOTHING WRONG HERE!

463
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:02,670
Lasse:
OKAY.

464
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,838
(Nervous giggle)

465
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,340
DARN.

466
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,966
HE'S OFF ON HIS OWN AGAIN.

467
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,636
Christina:
I DON'T CARE IF YOU
GET IN TROUBLE.

468
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:18,227
(Sleepy moan)

469
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:22,148
(Footsteps)

470
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:23,566
HMM?

471
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:26,653
(Footsteps continue)

472
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,656
I CAN HEAR YOU.
WHO'S THERE?

473
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,660
(Footsteps continue)

474
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,664
S‐SETSUNA F. SEIEI?

475
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:39,290
BUT WHY?

476
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,670
TELL ME, WHY IS
THIS WORLD SO TWISTED?

477
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,837
HUH?

478
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:46,965
IS IT GOD'S FAULT?

479
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,174
OR IS IT OURS?

480
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:49,384
(Gasps)

481
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:56,975
(Sighs)

482
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,352
I KNOW GOD IS FAIR.

483
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,355
AND PEOPLE HAVE OPEN HEARTS

484
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:07,193
BUT, THE WORLD STILL
BECOMES TWISTED BEYOND HOPE.

485
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:10,655
THAT'S WHY, WE HAVE TO LEARN
TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER‐‐

486
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:11,823
(Gasps)

487
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,661
SETSUNA.

488
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,752
(Thinking)
WHAT IS IT THAT'S TWISTED?

489
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,255
AND, WHERE IS IT?

490
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,595
COLONEL, THE PERSON
YOU'RE WAITING FOR IS HERE.

491
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:35,722
SEND HIM IN.

492
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,684
EXCUSE ME, COLONEL.

493
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,728

YOU HAVE A SECRET
MISSION FOR MY TEAM?

494
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:44,272
YOU'LL HAVE TO READ THE ORDERS
FOR THE DETAILS.

495
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,399
NOT EVEN I KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

496
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,276
MY ROLE IN
THIS WHOLE ENDEAVOR,

THOSE ORDERS THERE.

00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,655
AND THEN TO GIVE YOU
THE AGRISSA.

499
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,907
AGRISSA.
THAT'S A MACHINE

500
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:58,119
THAT WAS USED IN THE FIFTH
SOLAR POWER WAR, WASN'T IT?

501
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,662
YOU'LL FIND
THE PICK‐UP POINT

502
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:03,332
FOR THE MACHINE
IN THE ORDERS AS WELL.
