00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,807
"If the private armed
organization Celestial Being
does not disarm..."

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,477
"...and cease its armed
interventions immediately..."

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,605
"...our campaign of retaliation
will continue."

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,316
"What we do is not evil."

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:28,362
"We are the voice of the people
and apostles in the name of
justice..."

6
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:32,282
"...rising against those who
oppress the world with military
force."

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,701
Man, it had to come to this.

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,620
Indiscriminate bombings.

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,707
A global terrorist network.

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,586
Those bastards!

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,725
Lockon! Lockon!

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,686
You're angry! You're angry!

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,521
Sorry, Haro.

14
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,564
Leave me alone for a little
while.

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,486
I'll target them...

16
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,862
Target and fire...

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:31,300

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,835
Indiscriminate terrorism.

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,837
Sure I knew it was a
possibility...

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,673
...but this is gonna turn people
against us even more.

37
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,635
It's nothing new, being hated.

38
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,679
Either way, as we're always up
in space, there's nothing we can
do.

39
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,265
We'll leave it to the guys on
the surface.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,987
Welcome home, Mistress.

41
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,282
Please leave us alone for now.
We have business to take care
of.

42
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,742
Excuse us.

43
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,459
Why are you dressed like that?

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,045
It's camouflage! Camouflage!

45
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,713
And this is my favorite style!

46
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,842
Do you understand our situation?

47
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,843
I know...

48
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,847
...but right now all we can do
is wait for information from
Wang Liu Mei's agents.

49
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,808
But it sure is hot.

50
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,768
Don't you have any cold beer?

51
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,688
She sure's got a lot of nerve.

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,523
She's just acting tough.

53
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,778
If only we could contact those
agents ourselves.

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,989
There's no need for us, the
combat team...

55
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,616
...to know everything about the
organization.

56
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,743
I guess I can trust in Veda's
directions...

57
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,832
Long time no see, Feldt! Long
time no see!

58
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,667
Haro.

59
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,961
I've finished contacting all our
agents...

60
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,839
...using an encrypted message on
a special wavelength.

61
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,257
What's the situation in the
various nations?

62
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,012
It appears the intelligence
agencies of the major nations
are already at work...

63
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,432
...searching for the stronghold
of this international terrorist
network.

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,933
Another bombing!

65
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,226
It's in the Human Reform League.

66
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,313
With this, the Union, AEU and
Human Reform League...

67
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,107
...have all become targets of
these terrorist attacks.

68
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,445
The probability is high that
it's the work of an
international terrorist network.

69
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,656
We can't deny the possibility
that some country is supporting
it.

70
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,952
It's terrible, having to just
sit and wait like this.

71
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,038
We can surmise...

72
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,999
...that the terrorist network
has several bases of operation.

73
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,752
To make sure we attack them
before they have a chance to
switch bases...

74
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,005
...we'll have all Gundam units
stand by at arranged locations.

75
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,424
Sorry. It's time to say goodbye.

76
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,676
See you, Feldt! See you, Feldt!

77
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,763
Haro.

78
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,105
Disengaging GN System Repause.

79
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,691
Priority to Setsuna F. Seiei.

80
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,195
GN particle dispersal density to
normal levels.

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,822
Kyrios, flying to target point.

82
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,666
Virtue, Tieria Erde, launching.

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,922
Exia, Dynames, ready to go!
Ready to go!

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,388
Exia, Setsuna F. Seiei, heading
to target.

85
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,599
Dynames, Lockon Stratos, taking
off.

86
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,947
A terrorist attack against us
too?

87
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,325
Twenty‐four dead, sixty‐seven
injured.

88
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,036
Intelligence has begun an
investigation.

89
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,913
All right.

90
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,207
Report to me if something turns
up.

91
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,959
Roger that, Lieutenant Colonel!

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,670
What's wrong?

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,255
I don't believe this is
something...

94
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,008
...you should be involved with,
Lieutenant Colonel.

95
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,386
The reason for these multiple
terrorist acts is Celestial
Being.

96
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,557
Which means there's a
possibility they'll step in at
some point.

97
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,434
Then it's our business.

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,859
First Lieutenant, we're not
gonna find the enemy doing this.

99
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,527
I know.

100
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,072
I am a restless, impatient
man...

101
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,577
...and furthermore, I can't
stand those who commit such
cowardly acts.

102
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,371
I know it's nonsense, but I just
can't sit still.

103
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,540
We'll accompany you, First
Lieutenant.

104
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,334
I appreciate your loyalty, guys!

105
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,007
A war in Moralia and multiple
terrorist attacks.

106
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,926
There certainly are a lot of
distractions on your diplomatic
tour, Princess.

107
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,473
Because of the terrorism, my
meeting with the British Foreign
Secretary is postponed.

108
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,892
This is all Celestial Being's
fault.

109
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,479
Think of it as a holiday and
enjoy yourself.

110
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,065
How could you suggest such a
thing to me?

111
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,443
There were complications at the
National Assembly the other day.

112
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,946
The leader of the Conservatives
was attacked and injured by
Reformists.

113
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,948
That's terrible.

114
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,952
It's only a matter of time
before this develops into a
clash between citizens.

115
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,623
This trip may be your first and
last.

116
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,043
Hey, Louise?

117
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,045
It's me. Are you all right?

118
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,115
Terrorist attacks continue
worldwide

119
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:43,963
I'm fine.

120
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,825
Terrorist attacks continue
worldwide

121
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,925
But Mom's insisting that I
return to Spain.

122
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,678
Go back for a visit and make her
feel better.

123
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,682
No way. She was against me
coming abroad to study to begin
with.

124
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,643
She'll come up with all kinds of
reasons to keep me there.

125
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,645
I'm home.

126
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,064
My sister's home.

127
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,942
See you later, Louise. Let me
know if anything happens.

128
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
Sure. See you.

129
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,158
Welcome home. You look
exhausted.

130
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,119
Of course I am.

131
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,456
A large‐scale war in Moralia and
simultaneous terrorist attacks.

132
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,043
Leaders of different nations
making official statements.

133
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,922
Worldwide demonstrations
denouncing Celestial Being.

134
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,926
We can't cover it all, even if
we had every staff member out
there reporting.

135
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,639
Honestly...I used to feel it was
all someone else's problem...

136
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,682
What was?

137
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,310
How do I put it? Everything
that's going on in the world.

138
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,311
Here.

139
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,147
Thanks.

140
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,984
Even after Celestial Being
showed up, there was no conflict
over here.

141
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,070
So I never really thought it
mattered to me.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,280
But then...

143
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,701
...that bus was bombed, and a
lot of people were affected.

144
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,956
When I saw that, I realized it
did matter a lot to me.

145
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,958
I just didn't know it.

146
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,961
I didn't know anything.

147
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,838
That's the same with me.

148
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,258
I just came back from
interviewing the families of the
victims...

149
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,051
...and honestly, it was hard.

150
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,345
They didn't do anything.

151
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
They just happened to be
there...

152
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,642
...and their entire lives
disappeared.

153
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,063
I understand why those families
hate Celestial Being.

154
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,234
It's impossible to rid the world
of war.

155
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,238
They're probably thinking the
exact same thing.

156
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,865
What do you mean?

157
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,744
There's something else behind
that impossible goal of
eradicating war.

158
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,749
I bet there's an ulterior motive
that Celestial Being wants to
accomplish.

159
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,253
Though that's just speculation.

160
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,507
But people died. A lot of people
died...

161
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,467
...and there are a lot of people
grieving.

162
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,179
You're right. I totally agree.

163
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,269
I wonder what Dad and Mom would
think if they were alive.

164
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,897
They would be saddened, just as
you are, Saji.

165
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,782
Virtue at target location.

166
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,075
Going into standby.

167
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,914
Kyrios will remain on standby.

168
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,876
How long is this gonna take?

169
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,385
This is so frustrating.

170
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,273
Are you going?

171
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,315
Of course I am.

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,110
I'm going to carry out my duty
in the name of God.

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,653
No! You'll die!

174
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,905
What? Are you afraid of dying?

175
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,491
That's a blasphemy against God!

176
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,620
He lived for God and died for
God.

177
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:07,625
Now his spirit will be guided to
God.

178
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,421
There is no God in death.

179
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,883
A heat source detected.

180
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,844
It's close to the predicted
terrorist attack location.

181
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,638
Terrorists, as predicted.

182
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,641
Setsuna here.

183
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,898
We saw a suspicious person
leaving the bombing site on the
security cameras.

184
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,610
You are the closest one to the
scene. Can I have you look into
it?

185
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,653
Roger. I'll head to the site.

186
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,323
You can't use Exia right now.

187
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,407
I know.

188
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,829
Is it true that there was a
terrorist attack?

189
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,165
It is confirmed information.

190
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,627
We've made arrangements for a
hotel in the outskirts of the
city.

191
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,887
The suspect is escaping in a
car. It's a brown coupe.

192
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,915
I will apprehend the target.

193
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,931
Hey! What are you doing?!

194
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,520
What were you trying to do?

195
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,938
Nothing.

196
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,731
Show me your identification!

197
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,610
What's wrong? Hurry and hand
over your identification!

198
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,368
Excuse me. That boy is with us.

199
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,452
Who are you?

200
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,787
This is who we are.

201
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,622
E‐Excuse me!

202
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,918
Mobile Suit Gundam 00

203
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,425
Mobile Suit Gundam 00

204
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,968
Did I overstep my bounds?

205
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,386
No.

206
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,306
I didn't think I'd meet someone
else from my homeland here.

207
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,600
You're from Azadistan, aren't
you?

208
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,310
No. I'm from Krugis.

209
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
Krugis?

210
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,982
I‐I see.

211
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,401
I don't know what to say.

212
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,781
I haven't introduced myself. I'm
Marina Ismail.

213
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,658
Kamal Mazirif.

214
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,785
Are you here on a sight‐seeing
trip?

215
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,664
W‐Wait!

216
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,584
Let me talk to you just a little
longer, please.

217
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,381
We've taken one of the culprits
into custody.

218
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,426
Yes, I will transmit the
biometrics.

219
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,513
Miss, I have confirmed
information.

220
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,892
It has been determined that the
international terrorist
network...

221
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,395
...is the European Nature
Revival Group "La Edenra".

222
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,773
Have our agents locate their
active bases quickly.

223
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,858
Diplomacy?

224
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
That's right.

225
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,528
As I'm sure you know, Kamal...

226
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,406
...Azadistan has been split into
the Reformists and
Conservatives.

227
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,450
The country is in chaos.

228
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,496
To rebuild the economy of
Azadistan under the current
restrictions on oil exports...

229
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,998
...we need a solar power
generation system.

230
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,835
But life has become difficult in
our nation...

231
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,546
...because of the solar power
generation system.

232
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,716
So the Conservatives aren't too
pleased with that idea.

233
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,220
Unless we stop the two sides
from confrontation...

234
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,638
...that group will step in.

235
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,473
Celestial Being.

236
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,437
They're a group of fanatics,
thinking they can stop war with
force.

237
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,066
Sure, war isn't right...

238
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,653
...but the reality is that
people are losing their lives...

239
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,863
...in these unilateral
interventions.

240
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,783
Countries have had their
economies ruined.

241
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,662
I wonder, do those people
believe that they're God?

242
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,956
People die in wars, too.

243
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,751
I'm only saying that their
interventions are too arbitrary.

244
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,380
Without any attempt to hold
talks, without looking into
peaceful solutions...

245
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,174
...they're restraining people
with the pressure of violence.

246
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,093
That's not right.

247
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,470
While talks are held, people
die.

248
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,721
Still...!

249
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,974
It was Azadistan that destroyed
Krugis!

250
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,060
You're right.

251
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,647
But right until the end, the two
countries always sought a
peaceful solution...!

252
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,399
And meanwhile, people died!

253
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,863
Kamal, were you...involved?

254
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,407
The fighting ended six years
ago.

255
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,492
But you're still a boy.

256
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,121
Were you fighting?

257
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,622
I am still fighting.

258
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm fighting now.

259
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,963
Are you a member of the
Conservatives? Are you here to
kill me?

260
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,341
Killing you won't change
anything.

261
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,801
The world won't change.

262
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,554
Kamal...

263
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,430
No.

264
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,725
My codename is Setsuna F. Seiei.

265
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,644
I'm a Gundam Meister of
Celestial Being!

266
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,939
Celestial Being?

267
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,528
If the conflict doesn't end, we
will eventually go to Azadistan.

268
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,244
‐ N‐No way... ‐ Princess!

269
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,330
That wasn't a very funny joke he
made...

270
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,291
We're getting reports from the
agents now.

271
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,462
La Edenra's main operating bases
have already been abandoned.

272
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,632
They're careful. That brings us
back to square one.

273
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,758
Wait.

274
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:54,013
The biometric data of a
suspected terrorist has been
released on the network.

275
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,807
A coded message from the NRO?

276
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,769
And the BND and DGSE, too.

277
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,312
Well, Mistress...?

278
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,565
The world is telling us to take
action.

279
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,611
Are you sure it was right to
release that information, Mr.
Secretary?

280
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,030
With our limited jurisdiction...

281
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,284
...we cannot easily take action
against terrorist organizations
in other countries.

282
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,120
However, that group is a little
different.

283
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,165
For this one time, we share
common interests.

284
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,627
La Edenra has three active
bases.

285
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,214
We will attack simultaneously at
1400 Greenwich Mean Time.

286
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,507
Roger.

287
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,177
Virtue will commence attack on
terrorist organization's
operating base.

288
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,973
Kyrios, providing backup.

289
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,227
Enemy strength is unknown.
There's a chance they may have
mobile suits.

290
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,230
Then I'll just shoot them down.

291
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,856
Roger.

292
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,817
Exia, commencing mission.

293
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,695
Disengaging GN System Repause.

294
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,281
Priority to Setsuna F. Seiei.

295
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,955
Dissolve external camouflage
membrane.

296
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,207
Maintain GN particle dispersal.

297
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,625
Enter boarding mode.

298
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,391
Exia, commencing intervention.

299
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,275
All Gundam units have launched.

300
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,736
Miss Sumeragi! Are there any
other orders?

301
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,070
Hm?

302
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,697
No, none at all.

303
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,658
Let's leave the rest up to the
Meisters, and go to the beach!

304
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,118
Are you sure?

305
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,580
You should know that after this
mission we're going back to
space...

306
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,875
I'm going! I'm going! Let's go,
Feldt!

307
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,668
‐ But... ‐ It's okay.

308
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,094
Look out! Over here, Feldt!

309
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,723
Who would've thought so many
nations' intelligence agencies
would help?

310
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,350
That was so nice of them.

311
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,018
We're just being used.

312
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,604
But it's a giant step forward.

313
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,398
It certainly is.

314
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,833
Virtue, target completely
destroyed.

315
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,251
Mission complete.

316
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm not holding back.

317
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,554
I'm not giving you any mercy.

318
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,686
Incoming mobile suits!

319
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,022
Incoming mobile suits!

320
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,533
Sorry, but today...

321
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,667
...don't expect any mercy from
me.

322
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,717
Exia, eliminating targets.

323
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
What?!

324
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,904
A mobile armor?

325
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,407
It's old, but I'm surprised they
even have one.

326
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,425
Did that get it?

327
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,233
Exia. Target destroyed.

328
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,446
All Gundam units have destroyed
their targets.

329
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,158
Please advise our agents to
continue monitoring La Edenra's
activities...

330
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,036
...and to look for the country
that supported them.

331
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,871
Very well.

332
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,958
Sometimes, this world is so...

333
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,211
The cradle rocks without knowing
love

334
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,131
Princess, I've been able to
reach Finland's Foreign
Minister...

335
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,798
The cradle rocks without knowing
love

336
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,760
...although I don't think we can
expect much help from them.

337
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,802
As the sleeping forest burns to
ash

338
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,889
My codename is Setsuna F. Seiei.

339
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,225
I'm a Gundam Meister of
Celestial Being!

340
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,518
As the sleeping forest burns to
ash

341
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,937
Impossible.

342
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:53,470
Even the joy of living together
in peace

343
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,147
Hey, look! A mobile suit!

344
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,645
Even the joy of living together
in peace

345
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:56,941
Which country is it from?

346
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,474
Even the joy of living together
in peace

347
00:21:57,474 --> 00:21:59,985
That white one, isn't it a
Gundam?

348
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,441
Vanishes into the distance

349
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:02,279
It's so cool!

350
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,281
Vanishes into the distance

351
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,783
Gundam.

352
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,660
Vanishes into the distance

353
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,719
zetsubou wa amai wana Despair is
a sweet trap

354
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,432
tozasareta sono tobira The doors
are locked securely

355
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,647
kokoro ga senjou dakara Because
our hearts are a battlefield

356
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:40,526
darenimo sukuenai Nobody can
save us

357
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:49,910
zenmai no shinzou ga unmei ni
ayatsurare Wind‐up hearts are
manipulated by fate

358
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:59,545
buriki no heitaitachi wa
satsuriku wo hajimeru The hollow
tin soldiers begin the massacre

359
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:04,925
ai wo shirazu yureru yurikago
The cradle rocks without knowing
love

360
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,597
moetsukiteku nemuri no mori de
As the sleeping forest burns to
ash

361
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:14,768
tomoni ikiru yorokobi sae mo
Even the joy of living together
in peace

362
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:19,857
kieteshimau tooku Vanishes into
the distance

363
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:30,284
yasashisa wo shinji subete wo

kindness, and forgive all

364
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,289
itsukushimuyouni Let us treasure
each other

365
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:41,211
tada wakachiatte wakariatte
Simply sharing and understanding

366
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,049
Celestial Being has gone too
far.

367
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,011
An annihilation operation is
planned with overwhelming
resources.

368
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,972
What is the true objective
hidden within the operation?

369
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,932
Next episode, "The Honor of a
Great Power".

370
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,935
No one can be all‐powerful.
