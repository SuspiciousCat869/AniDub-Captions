WHAT THE...
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

Setsuna:
THE TRANS‐AM SYSTEM...

00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,425
HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME.

8
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,223
JOHANN'S GONE!

00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,558

00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,913
Ribbons:
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT IT
IN THE DATABANKS.

(Growls)

19
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,041
MOST LIKELY,
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BUILT

20
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,001
INTO THE BLACK BOX OF
THE GN‐DRIVE DURING

21

ITS ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION.

ALSO, IT APPEARS THAT
ALL INFORMATION REGARDING

23
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:29,967

COMPLETELY DELETED FROM VEDA.

MY ATTEMPT TO CHANGE
HIS PLANS.

27
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,519
I WILL NO LONGER BE
TRIFLED WITH

28
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,564

00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,834
LET'S FINISH THINGS UP BEFORE

THAT HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,592
ARE RELEASED AT ONCE,

36
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,928
THIS ALLOWS IT TO PERFORM AT
THREE TIMES ITS NORMAL OUTPUT

37
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,638
FOR A LIMITED TIME.

38
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,348
IT'S A FEATURE
THAT WAS ONLY INCLUDED

39
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,183
IN THE ORIGINAL
SOLAR REACTORS.

40
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:21,644
THE TRANS‐AM SYSTEM.

41
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,563
(Chuckling) OLD MAN AEOLIA LEFT
US ONE HELL OF A GREAT PRESENT

00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,440
WHEN HE
DESIGNED THIS SYSTEM!

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,193
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
AFTER USING THE TRANS‐AM,

44
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,737
THE MACHINE'S PERFORMANCE
DROPS DRAMATICALLY.

45
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,155
IT'S A DOUBLE‐EDGED SWORD.

46
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:33,736
(Beeping)
IT'S A DOUBLE‐EDGED SWORD.

THIS IS EXIA. ORDERS TO RETURN
TO PTOLEMY HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.

53
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,752
I HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT.
ALL THE MOBILE SUITS

54
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:49,171

THAT WERE ON THE SURFACE

00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,840
SEEM TO BE HEADING FOR SPACE.

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,550
I KNEW IT.

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,177
AND ONE OF THE GUNDAM THRONES
HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY.

58
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:55,928
CAPTURED?

59
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,930
BY THE
UN FORCES?

60
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,975
Setsuna:
THE PILOT WHO TOOK THE THRONE
IS ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

61
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,601
THAT IS ALL.

62
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,603
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

63
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:07,398
THAT BASTARD'S COMING HERE!

64
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:09,442
HOW MUCH LONGER IS HE
GOING TO MESS WITH US?

65
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,193
WHO IS THIS MAN?

66
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,195
I HEARD HE'S SOME KIND OF
MERCENARY.

67
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,574
(Thinking)
WILL WE GET OUR RESUPPLY
FINISHED IN TIME

68
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,452
OR WILL THE UN FORCES
GET HERE FIRST?

69
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,537
EITHER WAY,
LAGRANGE ONE IS GOING TO BE

70
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,497
THE SITE OF A BATTLE.

71
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,543
(Al‐Saachez chuckling)

72
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:29,503
SURE WAS NICE OF THEM TO HAVE
ENOUGH SPARE PARTS

73
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,130
TO HELP ME GET FIXED UP.

74
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,926
SO, YOU'RE THE PILOT WHO
CAPTURED THIS GUNDAM.

75
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,847
I AM COLONEL SERGEI SMIRNOV OF
THE CHOBU SPECIAL FORCES TEAM.

76
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,223
(Surprised)

77
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:44,185
IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO HAVE
THE WILD BEAR OF RUSSIA

78
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:45,603
COME AND GREET ME
IN PERSON.

79
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,647
I AM LIEUTENANT GARY BIAGGI

80
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,608
OF THE FOURTH FOREIGN
MECHANIZED REGIMENT.

81
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,610
I AM HAPPY TO BE
TAKING PART IN THIS

82
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,570
GUNDAM ELIMINATION
OPERATION.

83
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,572
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING,
LIEUTENANT.

84
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,741
HOW WAS IT YOU WERE ABLE
TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE A GUNDAM?

85
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,785
(Chuckles)

86
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:03,746
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
A BUSINESS SECRET, COLONEL.

87
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,500
Announcer:
DISTANCE UNTIL VISUAL COMBAT
ZONE: TWO THOUSAND.

88
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,293
ALL HANDS TO
PRIMARY BATTLE STATIONS.

89
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,503
MOBILE SUIT TEAMS,
PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.

90
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,505
THE MOMENT WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR, HOWARD.

91
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:13,923
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

92
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:22,056
Lasse:
DID YOU GET YOUR ANSWER,
SETSUNA?

93
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,349
Setsuna:
I DON'T KNOW.

94
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,895
BUT I, I MEAN WE, HAVE HAD
A TRUST PLACED IN US

95
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,022
BY AEOLIA SCHENBERG.

96
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,024
THAT MEANS I'M GOING TO
KEEP FIGHTING

97
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:34,860
FOR THE ERADICATION OF WAR
OF MY OWN WILL AND CHOICE

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,403
TOGETHER WITH MY GUNDAM.

99
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,491
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T THINK IT'S
REALLY POSSIBLE FOR US

100
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,369
TO ERADICATE WAR AND CONFLICT.

101
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,579
Lasse:
BUT FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE,

102
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,165
OUR FOOLISH ATTEMPTS
TO DO JUST THAT

103
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,376
HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED
IN PEOPLES' HEARTS.

104
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,296
AT THIS POINT, I THINK

105
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:57,842
CELESTIAL BEING'S EXISTENCE,
THAT WE EXIST,

106
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:00,636
MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN LASTING
SIGNIFICANCE ALL BY ITSELF.

107
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:03,556
(Gasping)
JUST THAT WE EXIST?

108
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,308
Lasse:
I MEAN THAT PEOPLE CAN ONLY
TRULY UNDERSTAND THINGS

109
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:08,853
THAT THEY'VE
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED.

110
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:10,479
HMM.

111
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,438
(Beeping)

112
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:14,316
(Beeping)

113
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:16,485
PTOLEMY'S DETECTED
A UN FORCES FLEET!

114
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,740
Christina:
LOOKS LIKE THE THREE
APPROACHING TRANSPORTS

115
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,701
ARE UNION VIRGINIA
CLASS SHIPS.

116
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:27,246
4,200 UNTIL THEY'RE IN
VISUAL COMBAT RANGE.

117
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:28,581
PTOLEMY IS TO BACK OFF AND

118
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,708
USE THE RESOURCE SATELLITES
AS SHIELDS.

119
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,794
KYRIOS, VIRTUE,
PREPARE FOR DEFENSIVE BATTLE.

120
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,462
Sumeragi:
DYNAMES IS TO STANDBY
ON PTOLEMY.

121
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,591
HEY, COME ON.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND FAIR.

122
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,842
HUH?

123
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:40,634
(Beeping)

124
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,927
(Sighs)

125
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,679
THEY LOCKED THE DOOR ON ME.

126
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,849
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS
A LITTLE DRASTIC?

127
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,684
HE'S NOT THE TYPE
WHO LISTENS WELL.

128
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,145
HE TOOK A SHOT MEANT FOR ME

129
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,813
AND SAVED MY LIFE
IN THE LAST FIGHT.

130
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,691
THIS TIME, I'VE DECIDED
I'M GOING TO PROTECT HIM!

131
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,237
Christina:
KYRIOS STABILIZED WITH
LINEAR FIELD.

132
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:03,949
KYRIOS, ALLELUJAH
HAPTISM, COMMENCING OPERATION!

133
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,660

134
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:21,175
Feldt:
THE ENEMY TRANSPORTS
ARE LAUNCHING MOBILE SUITS.

135
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,552
VIRTUE, TIERIA ERDE, LAUNCHING!

136
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,389
(Engine blasting)

137
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,478
Feldt:
THE ENEMY FORCE
CONSISTS OF 26 MACHINES

138
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,356
EQUIPPED
WITH PSEUDO GN DRIVES.

139
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,816
Christina (alarmed):
THERE'S A THRONE WITH
THE ENEMY MOBILE SUIT TEAMS!

140
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:38,817
(Gasps)

141
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,944
(Angry growl)

142
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,075
Sergei:
ATTENTION ALL PILOTS: ONLY
TWO GUNDAMS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED.

143
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,619
RESPOND WITH FORMATION 245!

144
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,954
SURROUND THEM AND DESTROY THEM!

145
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:51,413
ROGER THAT.

146
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,291
COLONEL, YOU WON'T
BE DISAPPOINTED WITH ME!

147
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,418
THEY'RE GOING DOWN!
THEY'RE GOING DOWN!

148
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:57,795
(Whoosh)

149
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:02,341
OH, BOY!
EVERYONE SEEMS SO EXCITED!

150
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:03,842
HMM?

151
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,389
HERE THEY COME.

152
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,559
NOW COMMENCING
PRE‐EMPTIVE ATTACK!

153
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,811
GO!

154
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:15,646
(Blast)

155
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,439
(Boom)

156
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,190
WHAT THE...

157
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,566
A NEW WEAPON?!

158
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,985

WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

BECAUSE I'M A MERCENARY,
IT'S WHAT I DO. AND BESIDES...

293

00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,195
WHEN THE AEU BUILT

00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:52,704
LOCKON! LOCKON!

319
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:53,663
I CAN'T SEE!

320
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:54,664

321
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,336
(Lockon screaming)

322
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:06,760
Haro:
SEVERE DAMAGE! SEVERE DAMAGE!
SEVERE DAMAGE!

323
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,637
UNABLE TO FIGHT! UNABLE

324
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:10,013
UNABLE TO FIGHT!

325
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,399
I DON'T THINK
I FINISHED HIM OFF.

326
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,360
HE'S ONE TOUGH SON‐OF‐A‐BITCH!

327
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,283
(Groaning)

328
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:38,625
HARO, TAKE DYNAMES
BACK TO PTOLEMY.

329
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,628
LOCKON! LOCKON!

330
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,837
THAT'S AN ORDER.

LOCKON! LOCKON!

332
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:48,134
RELAX, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME!

333
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,387
I'LL COME BACK IN ONE PIECE.

334
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:57,269

00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:09,281
FAREWELL, LITTLE PARTNER.

339
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,325
(Pained sigh)

340
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,002
THE TRANS‐AM'S
RUNNING OUT OF TIME!

341
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,169
(Drive accelerating)

342
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,509
DAMN IT. WHERE THE HELL
DID HE GO?

343
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,054
(Lockon wincing)

344
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:36,558
(Breathing heavily)

345
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,437
Lockon:
WHAT AM I DOING OUT HERE?

346
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:48,987
(Struggling)
BUT UNLESS I GET RID OF HIM,

347
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:51,448
UNLESS I CAN AVENGE THEM,

348
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:55,368
I DON'T SEE HOW I COULD GO ON

349
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,121
OR HOW I COULD EVEN
FACE THE WORLD!

350
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,122
(Beeping)

351
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:00,665
I GOT A LIFE READING!

352
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,210
I'VE GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

353
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,714
(Labored breathing)

354
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,967
Lockon:
TARGETED AND FIRING!

355
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,887

356
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:24,022

MOTHER, AMY...

360
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:51,132
I KNOW THE THINGS I'VE DONE
MAY NOT CHANGE ANYTHING,

361
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:58,264
THAT THINGS WILL NEVER
GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

362
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,974
EVEN SO,

363
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,434

AFTER TODAY,

365

LYLE WILL KNOW...
