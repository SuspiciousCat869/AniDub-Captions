1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,420
WHAT THE?!

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,546
THOSE ARE PARTICLE BEAMS!

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,631
(Grunts)

4
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,132
A GUNDAM!

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,802
Johann:
IT'S THE GUNDAM EXIA!

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,388
EXIA HAS LOCATED THE TARGETS.

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,557
HAVE CONCLUDED THAT
THE THREE GUNDAM THRONE UNITS

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,809
ARE GUILTY OF
PROMOTING CONFLICT.

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,812
COMMENCING ARMED INTERVENTION.

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,315
EXIA WILL ELIMINATE TARGETS!

11
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,614
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,782
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE!

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,407
Setsuna:
WRONG.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,701
HUH?

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,119
Setsuna:
THE THREE OF YOU

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,330
AND THOSE MACHINES OF YOURS

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,706
CANNOT POSSIBLY BE

18
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,708
GUNDAMS!

Nena:
WHAT... WHAT SHOULD
WE DO, JOHANN?!

26
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,272
COME IN, EXIA'S PILOT,
DO YOU READ ME?

27
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,733
WHY ARE YOU INTERFERING WITH US?

28
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,902
WE'RE DOING THIS TO
ERADICATE WAR.

29
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,236
Setsuna:
YOU'RE NOT!

30
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,907
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GUNDAM!

31
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,743
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE CONFUSED, EXIA.

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,161
YOU CAN TAKE HIM OUT,
MICHAEL.

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,330
I ROGER THAT, JOHANN!

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
FANGS, FLY!

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,514
I'VE GOT MORE OF THEM!

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,515
(Growls)

37
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,935
(Surprised gasp)

38
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,062
BACKUP?

39
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:07,979
WHAT NOW?!

40
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,941
TIERIA ERDE'S HERE?!

41
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,070
VIRTUE!
READY TO DESTROY TARGETS!

42
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,614
Sumeragi:
EXIA IS FIGHTING THE THRONES?!

43
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,909
AND JUST NOW, VIRTUE SEEMS TO
HAVE JOINED THE BATTLE AS WELL.

44
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,536
TIERIA'S FIGHTING TOO?!

45
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,539
IT'S A DARK DAY WHEN GUNDAMS
FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES.

46
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,833
THEY COULD END UP
WIPING EACH OTHER OUT.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,668
JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE,
OLD MAN.

48
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,170
YEAH, THE TRINITYS' BEHAVIOR
REALLY BUGS THE HELL OUT OF ME!

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,967
A SHAME HE'S SO
GOOD‐LOOKING.

50
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,343
THERE'S ALSO
THE REAL POSSIBILITY

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,637
THAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE
SOMEHOW PART OF THE PLAN.

52
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,389
AND MAYBE IT'S JUST
AS LIKELY THAT

53
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,142
WHAT WE'RE NOW DOING IN RESPONSE
IS PART OF THE PLAN AS WELL.

54
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,768
MISS SUMERAGI.

55
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,729
I'M GETTING AN URGENT CODED
MESSAGE FROM LOCKON STRATOS.

56
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,691
HE'S REQUESTING INSTRUCTIONS.

57
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,069
TELL HIM TO TRY TO STOP THE
GUNDAMS FROM FIGHTING IF HE CAN.

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,280
HOWEVER, I'LL RESPECT
HIS DECISION MAKING

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,407
IN RESPONSE TO WHATEVER'S
HAPPENING IN THE FIELD.

60
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,741
YES, MA'AM.

61
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,909
SO, WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
SAYING IS,

62
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,536
"YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO IMPROVISE."

63
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,122
SHAMEFUL FOR A
TACTICAL FORECASTER.

64
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,623
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

65
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,333
IT CERTAINLY IS.

66
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,211
HEY, ALLELUJAH,
ARE YOU LAUNCHING TOO?

67
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,173
NO, I'M GOING TO STAY HERE AND
PROTECT THE PTOLEMAOIS.

68
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,967
GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, THIS SHIP
MIGHT BE IN DANGER TOO.

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,177
ALTHOUGH TRUTHFULLY,

70
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,512
I'M HAVING TO STOP MYSELF
FROM JOINING THEM.

71
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,352
MAN, THAT UNRULY BRAT

72
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,771
HAS A REAL KNACK
FOR DOING CRAZY THINGS.

73
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,191
LOCKON! YOU DIDN'T STOP HIM!
YOU DIDN'T STOP HIM!

74
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,734
YOU WERE SPYING ON US!

75
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,360
WELL, THANKS TO WHAT HE DID,

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
MISS SUMERAGI'S MIND WAS
MADE UP FOR HER!

77
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,198
BESIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT?

78
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,285
I KIND OF UNDERSTAND
HOW SETSUNA FEELS.

79
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,038
SEE, HE'S TRYING TO
BECOME A GUNDAM HIMSELF.

80
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,082
AN EMBODIMENT OF
THE ERADICATION OF WAR.

81
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,709
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

82
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,629
TO BE HONEST, I'M ITCHING
TO START SHOOTING!

83
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,130
HERE WE GO, HARO!

84
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,133
DYNAMES, LOCKON,
I'M TAKING OFF!

85
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,141
Liu‐Mei:
SO, EXIA IS OPPOSING
THE NEW GUNDAMS.

86
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,477
IS HE JUSTIFIED
IN TAKING THIS ACTION?

87
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,812
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY.

88
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,190
IF IT CHANGES THE WORLD,

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,985
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS FINE
WITH ME, HONG LONG.

90
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,155
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT THEIR METHODS ARE.

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,408
Ribbons:
A FIGHT BETWEEN GUNDAMS.

92
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,453
THIS IS SOONER THAN
I EXPECTED.

93
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,331
(Thinking)
WE'VE MOVED
INTO THE THIRD STAGE.

94
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,917
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

95
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,675
ASSUME FORMATION S‐32.

96
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,134
Setsuna:
ROGER THAT.

97
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,438
THEY'RE IN A GN FIELD.

98
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,189
Nena:
JOHANN!

99
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,235
Michael:
WHY, YOU!

100
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,033
HUH. I HAVE TO ADMIT I NEVER
THOUGHT THE DAY WOULD COME

101
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,743
WHEN I'D BE
FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE

102
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,120
IN FORMATION WITH YOU.

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,329
YEAH, ME TOO.

104
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,123
EXIA AND VIRTUE ARE
STILL ENGAGED

105
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,083
IN COMBAT WITH
THE THREE THRONES.

106
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,460
LOOKS LIKE THE TWO OF THEM ARE
USING TACTICAL FORMATIONS!

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,420
HUH?!

108
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,382
S‐32, D‐07,
AND EVEN F‐52.

109
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,301
THOSE TWO ARE COOPERATING.

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,763
NENA, DOCK WITH MY MACHINE.

111
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,140
Nena:
OKAY!

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,686
DO YOU REALLY THINK

113
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,146
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
TIME TO SET UP?!

114
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,023
WELL, THINK AGAIN!

115
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,442
TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT FAST ENOUGH!

116
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,484
I'VE GOT YOU LINED UP!

117
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,902
NADLEEH!

118
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:05,884
(High‐pitched whining)

119
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,094
WHAT THE...!
THE CONTROLS ARE FROZEN!

120
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,138
IT HURTS!
IT HURTS!
SYSTEM DOWN!

121
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,561
(Screaming)

122
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,235
(High‐pitched whining)

123
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,236
(Grunts)

124
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,197
WHAT HAPPENED?

125
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,159
(High‐pitched whining)

126
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,702
I CAN TAKE CONTROL
OF ALL MACHINES

127
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,579
THAT ARE LINKED WITH VEDA.

128
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,540
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE
GUNDAM NADLEEH'S TRUE POWER IS.

129
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,835
FOR I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO WAS GIVEN THIS POWER.

130
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,255
I CAN TRIGGER THE TRIAL SYSTEM
FOR GUNDAM MEISTERS!

131
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,007
Michael:
JOHANN! NENA!

132
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,384
(Grunts in pain)

133
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,014
Tieria: YOU HAVE BROUGHT
DISHONOR ONTO THE GUNDAM
MEISTERS!

134
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
AND FOR THAT

135
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,062
YOU DESERVE TEN THOUSAND DEATHS!

136
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,941
WHAT THE...?!

137
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,942
HUH?

138
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,985
(Machine whirring)

139
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,614
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRIAL SYSTEM
WAS FORCIBLY DISENGAGED!

140
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,533
BUT HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?!

141
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,451
(Gasps)

142
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,121
Tieria:
SOME OF THE DATA FROM
LEVEL SEVEN HAS BEEN ALTERED.

143
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,708
I WONDER WHAT THIS DATA COVERS.

144
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,709
(Gasps)

145
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,377
I'VE BEEN REJECTED?!

146
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,755
BUT IT'S ME!
HOW COULD I BE DENIED ACCESS?!

147
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,549
THAT MEANS VEDA'S BEEN‐‐

148
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,299
(Alarm beeps)

149
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,595
ANOTHER GUNDAM?!

150
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,974
THAT ONE'S DYNAMES!

151
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,809
AND NOW IT'S THREE ON THREE!

152
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,936
LET'S STICK TO
PLAYING FAIR NOW, PEOPLE!

153
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,563
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT!

154
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,857
Johann:
MICHAEL! NENA!
WE'RE WITHDRAWING!

155
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,775
OH, COME ON JOHANN,
ARE YOU FOR REAL?!

156
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,027
YEAH, WHY SHOULD WE RUN?!

157
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,903
IT'S ONLY GOING TO
HINDER THE PLAN

158
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,697
IF GUNDAMS START DESTROYING
EACH OTHER.

159
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,698
Michael:
(Growls)

160
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,491
ALL RIGHT, THEN!

161
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,416
YOU THREE RUNNING AWAY?

162
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,460
Johann:
YOU HAVE OTHER ENEMIES
YOU SHOULD BE DEALING WITH

163
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,378
BEFORE FIGHTING US.

164
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,548
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
LOCKON STRATOS? OR IS THAT...

165
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,258
NEIL DYLANDY.

166
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,886
HIS NAME IS NEIL DYLANDY?

167
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,221
YOU BASTARD!
YOU'VE LOOKED AT MY DATA!

168
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,807
I'VE BEEN READING UP ON YOU,
WITH THE HELP OF VEDA.

169
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,267
(Gasps)

170
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
THAT'S THE INFORMATION
FROM LEVEL SEVEN!

171
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,896
OH, LOCKON.

172
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,315
YOU WERE LED TO BECOME
A GUNDAM MEISTER

173
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,358
BECAUSE YOU WANTED REVENGE
ON SOME PEOPLE

174
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,861
AND NOW ONE OF THEM IS
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

175
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,404
Lockon: (suspicious)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

176
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,114
Johann:
THE KPSA WAS A REBEL
GUERILLA GROUP

177
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,533
FROM THE REPUBLIC OF KRUGIS.

178
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,952
AMONG THEIR MEMBERS WAS
AN INDIVIDUAL

179
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,871
BY THE NAME OF SORAN IBRAHIM.

180
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,123
Lockon:
YEAH? SO WHAT,
WHO'S THAT?

181
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,292
SORAN IBRAHIM,

182
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,795
IS BETTER KNOWN BY THE CODENAME,
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

183
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,837
(Surprised gasp)

184
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,589
YOU'RE ACCUSING SETSUNA
OF BEING‐‐

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,840
THAT'S RIGHT.

186
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,133
HE WAS A MEMBER
OF THE ORGANIZATION

187
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,761
THAT KILLED YOUR PARENTS
AND SISTER.

188
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,387
(Grunts)

189
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,140
HE IS ONE OF THOSE YOU SWORE
TO TAKE REVENGE AGAINST.

190
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,151
SETSUNA.

191
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,790
SEVEN
GUNDAM MACHINES.

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,458
THAT'S CORRECT,
SIR.

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,878
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO
TO STOP THOSE THINGS.

194
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,088
Official:
IF WE KEEP FIGHTING THEM

195
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
AND END UP EXHAUSTING
OUR MILITARIES,

196
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,133
OUR ECONOMIES
WOULD BE TOTALLY DEVASTATED!

197
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,386
AND THEN WE'D BE LEFT
WITH NO CHOICE

198
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,180
BUT TO ACCEPT THEIR TERMS
AND DISARM OURSELVES!

199
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,391
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
ACCEPTING THEIR TERMS

200
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,810
WOULD LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE
OF OUR NATIONAL IDENTITIES!

201
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,645
HUH?

202
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,397
YES, GO AHEAD.

203
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,941
Chairman:
WHAT IS IT?

204
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,360
IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE CLAIMING
TO BE AFFILIATED WITH

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,989
CELESTIAL BEING HAS CONTACTED
US THROUGH THE NETWORK.

206
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:56,990
HUH.

207
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,200
DO YOU THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE?

208
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,995
THEY INCLUDED SOME DATA
RELATED TO THE ORGANIZATION.

209
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,414
WE'VE CONCLUDED
THIS PERSON IS FOR REAL.

210
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,623
HOW INTERESTING.

211
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,419
SEEMS THEY'RE DIVIDED
AMONGST THEMSELVES.

212
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,172
PERHAPS GOD HAS NOT
ABANDONED US AFTER ALL.

213
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,304
Ikeda:
THERE IS DEEP SORROW HERE

214
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,389
AMIDST THE RUBBLE
OF THE IRIS CORPORATION,

215
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,559
AS BEREAVED RELATIVES BEGIN
TO GATHER AT THE SITE.

216
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,144
THE MACHINES THAT CARRIED OUT
THE ATTACK

217
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,770
ARE THOUGHT
TO BE THREE NEW MODELS‐‐

218
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,564
DAMN GUNDAMS.

219
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,165
LOUISE, LOOK. SOME FLOWERS.

220
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
I'LL PUT THEM OVER HERE.

221
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,478
SAJI.
GO BACK TO JAPAN.

222
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,021
WHAT?

223
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,357
DON'T TAKE ANY MORE TIME OFF
FROM SCHOOL.

224
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,901
I'M SO HAPPY THAT
YOU COULD COME BE WITH ME.

225
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,195
BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
STAY HERE FOREVER.

226
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,155
COME ON,
I COULDN'T DO THAT!

227
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,158
I COULDN'T JUST GO AND
LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE!

228
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,662
SAJI, YOUR DREAM IS
TO WORK IN SPACE, RIGHT?

229
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,413
WELL LOOK, I DON'T WANT
YOUR LIFELONG DREAM

230
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,499
TO GO UNFULFILLED
BECAUSE I HELD YOU BACK.

231
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,458
YEAH, BUT‐‐

232
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,709
IF YOU STAY WITH ME,

233
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,754
THINGS WILL GET
DIFFICULT BETWEEN US.

234
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,340
I'LL ALWAYS FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT HOLDING YOU BACK,

235
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,593
AND YOU'LL REGRET ALL
THE THINGS YOU NEVER DID.

236
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,304
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!

237
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,764
(Sigh)

238
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,267
SAJI, CAN I ASK YOU TO
REALIZE MY DREAM FOR ME?

239
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,018
WHAT?

240
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,562
MY DREAM IS SIMPLE.

241
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,899
IT'S TO MAKE
YOUR DREAM COME TRUE.

242
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,861
SO, PLEASE, I NEED YOU TO
HELP ME FULFILL MY DREAM, SAJI.

243
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,364
OH, LOUISE.

244
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,033
(Sigh)

245
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,411
THEN IT'S A PROMISE.

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,142
I'M USED TO IT.

269
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,772
IT WAS LAGUNA HARVEY AFTER ALL.

270
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,524
OF COURSE IT WAS HIM.

271
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,526
HE RUNS A
LINEAR TRAIN COMPANY,

272
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,696
AND HEADS UP THEIR
INTERNATIONAL CARTEL.

THE MAN'S RICH.

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

277
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,789

JUST CAME TO A HALT.

HE'S A MAJOR SHAREHOLDER

IF WE MESS WITH HIM
HE'LL SQUASH US.

282
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,507
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
WE'LL KEEP IT TO OURSELVES.

283
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,550
YEAH, BUT‐‐

284
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,343
I'M NOT STOPPING NOW.

NOT WHEN I'VE FINALLY
FOUND MY FIRST CLUE.

286
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,097
MISS KINUE.

287
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,647
Lockon:
IS THAT TRUE, SETSUNA?

288
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,984
WERE YOU ACTUALLY
AFFILIATED WITH THE KPSA?

289
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,027
YEAH.

290
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,945
AND YOU'RE ORIGINALLY
FROM KRUGIS?

291
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,948
YES.

292
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,243
A CHILD GUERILLA SOLDIER.

293
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,204
LOCKON, LOOK.

294
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,872
ABOUT WHAT TRINITY SAID...

295
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,081
IT'S THE TRUTH.

296
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,708
BOTH OF MY PARENTS AND
MY LITTLE SISTER

297
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,543
WERE KILLED BY THE KPSA

298
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:47,673
IN AN ATTACK
BY A SUICIDE BOMBER.

299
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,967
IT ALL BEGAN WHEN
THE GLOBAL RESTRICTIONS

300
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,386
ON OIL EXPORTS
CAME INTO EFFECT,

301
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,348
RIGHT AFTER THE
SOLAR POWER GENERATION PLAN.

302
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,350
THEY SAID WE HAD TO STOP
DEPENDING ON

303
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,354
FOSSIL FUELS TO LIVE OUR LIVES.

304
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,897
BUT IT WAS THE
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES

305
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,899
THAT SUFFERED THE MOST.

306
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,984
THE EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
CRIPPLED THEIR ECONOMIES

307
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,029
AND THEIR CITIZENS WERE
PLUNGED INTO POVERTY.

308
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,989
THE POOR TURNED TO THEIR GOD

309
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,952
AND OPENED THEIR EARS TO
HIS SELF‐PROCLAIMED SPOKESMEN.

310
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,120
THEY WERE INFLUENCED BY
DESPICABLE PEOPLE

311
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,209
WHO SOUGHT ONLY
WEALTH AND POWER!

312
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,170
AND SO, THIS LED TO THE
SOLAR POWER WARS

313
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,215
THAT WOULD LAST
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS.

314
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,134
FOR THOSE LIVING IN THE
LAND OF GOD IT WAS A HOLY WAR,

315
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,970
A SELFISH PRETEXT.

316
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,554
OF COURSE YOU CAN SAY
THE SAME THING

317
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,474
ABOUT THE UN AND
THEIR EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.

318
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,936
BUT IT ISN'T GOD OR RELIGION
THAT WAS AT FAULT HERE.

319
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,564
AND NEITHER WAS THE
SOLAR POWER GENERATION SYSTEM.

320
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,860
BUT SOMEHOW, THE WORLD BECAME
TWISTED BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS.

321
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,322
I KNOW THAT MUCH ANYWAY.

322
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,576
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE
JUST BEING USED BY THE KPSA,

323
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,662
AND THAT YOU WERE FIGHTING
A BATTLE THAT YOU NEVER WANTED.

324
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,747
BUT I WAS DRAGGED INTO
THAT TWISTED WORLD

325
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,000
AND I LOST MY FAMILY!

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,002
I LOST THEM.

327
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,592
IS THAT THE REASON WHY

328
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,886
YOU ACCEPTED THE OFFER
TO BECOME A MEISTER?

329
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,596
YEAH, THAT'S THE REASON.

330
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
AND I REALIZE I'M
A WALKING CONTRADICTION.

331
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,810
NOW I'M DOING THE SAME THINGS
A TERRORIST DOES.

332
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,979
INSTEAD OF CUTTING
THE CHAIN OF VIOLENCE,

333
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,189
I MADE THE CHOICE
TO FIGHT BACK.

334
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,858
BECAUSE I SINCERELY
BELIEVE THAT

335
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,569
THE WORLD NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS

336
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,031
SO THAT A TRAGEDY LIKE THAT
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

337
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,991
IF ONLY I HAD SOMETHING
SO POWERFUL

338
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,660
IT COULD SERVE AS
A DETERRENT TO THE WORLD.

339
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,912
THAT'S A GUNDAM.

340
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,332
I WILL ACCEPT MY PUNISHMENT
FOR NOT STOPPING THE KILLING

341
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,917
AFTER I'VE CHANGED THE WORLD.

342
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:53,382
BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

343
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,759
LOCKON, WAIT!

344
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,596
SETSUNA, I WANT TO SHOOT YOU
SO VERY BADLY RIGHT NOW.

345
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,557
LET ME AVENGE MY FAMILY.

346
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:06,062
LET ME SETTLE THIS SCORE.

347
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,064
(Gunshot)

348
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,823
AT ONE TIME,

349
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,576
I USED TO BELIEVE IN GOD.

350
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,453
I WAS FORCED TO BELIEVE.

351
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,664
AND SO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE?

352
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,084
BUT IN THIS WORLD
THERE IS NO GOD.

353
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,835
Setsuna's mother:
WHY?

354
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,379
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, SORAN?

355
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,714
(Sobbing)

356
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,051
GOD DOES NOT EXIST,

357
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,095
NOT IN THIS WORLD.

358
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,638
THAT'S NOT A
GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER!

359
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,139
I BELIEVED IN GOD,

360
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,724
AND THEN FOUND OUT THAT
HE DIDN'T EXIST.

361
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,643
ALL BECAUSE OF ONE MAN.

362
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,186
AND WHICH MAN IS THAT?

363
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
HE WAS THE LEADER
OF THE KPSA.

364
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,654
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ.

365
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,656
WHO IS THIS ALI AL‐‐

366
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,449
‐‐SAACHEZ PERSON?

367
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,869
Setsuna:
HE WAS WORKING
FOR THE PMCS IN MORALIA.

368
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,080
Tieria:
THE PRIVATE MILITARY
COMPANIES?

369
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,541
FIRST A GUERILLA THEN
A MERCENARY?!

370
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,127
WHAT IS THIS GUY, SOME KIND OF
A DAMNED WAR JUNKIE?!

371
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,921
ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF MORALIA,

372
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,258
I SAW HIM AGAIN.

373
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,051
THAT'S WHY.

374
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,721
WHY YOU LEFT YOUR COCKPIT
THAT TIME.

375
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,849
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
IT REALLY WAS HIM.

376
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,978
I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE
HIS GOD WAS!

377
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,524
AND, IF THERE WAS NO GOD
INSIDE HIM,

378
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,901
ALL THIS TIME...

379
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,987
I JUST...

380
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,029
SETSUNA.

381
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,030
Lockon:
SETSUNA!

382
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,950
LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.

383
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,786
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
ACHIEVE WITH EXIA?

384
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,414
I'LL ERADICATE WAR!

385
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,708
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
IF I SHOOT YOU!

386
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,960
I DON'T MIND.

387
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,463
YOU COULD DO IT
INSTEAD OF ME.

388
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:59,258
CHANGE THIS TWISTED WORLD
IN MY PLACE.

389
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,553
BUT WHILE I'M ALIVE
I'LL KEEP FIGHTING.

390
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,014
AND NOT AS POOR SORAN IBRAHIM,

391
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,766
BUT AS CELESTIAL BEING'S
GUNDAM MEISTER.

392
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,519
AS SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

393
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,645
PILOTING A GUNDAM?

394
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,646
Setsuna:
YES.

395
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,356
I AM...

396
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,151
GUNDAM.

397
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,946
(Chuckles)

398
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,574
CRAZY, I DON'T WANT TO
SHOOT YOU ANYMORE!

399
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,744
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE AN IMPOSSIBLE
GUNDAM NUT, DON'T YOU?

400
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,745
THANK YOU.

401
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,954
HUH?

402
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,123
TO ME, THAT'S
A GREAT COMPLIMENT.

403
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,587
(Laughing)

404
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,839
HMM.

405
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,759
SO, THIS IS BEING HUMAN?

406
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,854
Johann:
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D COME
UNDER ATTACK FROM GUNDAMS.

407
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
AH, THEY MUST HAVE GONE
CRAZY OR SOMETHING!

408
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,900
AND TO THINK
I ACTUALLY KISSED HIM!

409
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,194
WE'LL ASK LAGUNA
FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

410
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,071
DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION,

411
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,114
WE MAY END UP
FIGHTING GUNDAMS AGAIN.

412
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,366
HELL YEAH!

413
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,742
I SAY BRING THEM ON!

414
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,503
