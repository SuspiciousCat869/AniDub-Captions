1
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:08,756
Sumeragi:
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
OUR NEWEST GUNDAM MEISTER.

2
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:11,092
HIS CODENAME IS
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

3
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:14,095
HE'LL BE PILOTING
THE GN‐001.

4
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,222
AH, HOLD ON A MINUTE,
MISS SUMERAGI.

5
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,474
HE'S STILL JUST A CHILD,
REALLY.

6
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:21,227
Sumeragi:
HIS PILOTING CHARACTERISTICS
MEET ALL THE STANDARD LEVELS.

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,563
WAS IT VEDA
THAT MADE THIS CHOICE?

8
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,939
OF COURSE IT WAS.

9
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,440
Tieria:
I FIND THAT HARD
TO BELIEVE.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,359
Lockon:
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,570
WE'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE
WE MADE THE DECISION

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,364
TO JOIN THIS ORGANIZATION AND
BECOME GUNDAM MEISTERS.

13
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,283
AGE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

14
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,118
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

15
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:38,703
AND YOUR NAME IS?

16
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:41,622
MY CODENAME IS
LOCKON STRATOS.

17
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:44,709
THE MAN WHO CAN TARGET AND FIRE
FROM BEYOND THE STRATOSPHERE.

18
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,544
I GUESS YOU WANT TO
CHANGE THE WORLD

19
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,379
WITH YOUR GUNDAM TOO, RIGHT?

20
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,380
YES.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,757
WELL, SO DO I,
SETSUNA.

22
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,218
Haro:
LOCKON! LOCKON!

23
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:59,056
(Incessant)
LOCKON! LOCKON!

24
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:05,187
SO DO I,
LOCKON STRATOS.

25
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:11,485
Haro (repeating):
LOCKON! LOCKON!

26

(Weeping)

27
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:17,158

WE JUST RECEIVED

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,384
A SPECIAL ENCODED
MESSAGE FROM THE PTOLEMAIOS.

37
00:02:58,384 --> 00:02:59,885
CONCERNING WHAT?

38
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,013
"WE'VE BEGUN
EXCHANGING FIRE

39
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,765
WITH THE UN FORCES MOBILE SUITS
EQUIPPED WITH PSEUDO GN DRIVES."

THAT'S ALL.

41
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:08,227
I SEE.

42
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:12,023
Liu Mei:
I WONDER WHICH SIDE
THE WORLD WILL LEAN TOWARDS.

43
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,692
THE UN'S OR THEIRS?

44
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:18,738
Tieria:
IT WAS YOU!

45
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,489
TAKE IT EASY,
TIERIA!

46
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,532
TAKE IT EASY,
TIERIA!
BECAUSE YOU WENT DOWN TO THE SURFACE

47
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,825
BECAUSE YOU WENT DOWN
TO THE SURFACE

48
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:23,492
OUR FIGHTING STRENGTH
WAS CRITICALLY DIVIDED!

49
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:24,368
Tieria:
ANSWER ME!

50
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:27,038
WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?

51
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,832
WHY DID HE... HAVE TO DIE?

52
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,000
HUH?

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,626
THE ENEMY'S STILL OUT THERE!

54
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,837
USE THIS TIME TO HELP US
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING!

55
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:41,385
(Weeping)

56
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,637
SORRY, FELDT.
SORRY, FELDT.

57
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:46,182
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT, HARO.

58
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,893
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE.

59
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,228
(Crying)

60
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,897
OH, FELDT.

61
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,650
IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THIS

62
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,152
THAT ARE THE WORST.

63
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,655
Sergei:
OUT OF THE 27 MACHINES

64
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:04,075
ONLY 11 WERE ABLE TO
MAKE IT BACK.

65
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,994
WE EVEN LOST THE MACHINE
WE'D CAPTURED EARLIER.

66
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:10,831
ALSO, THE GUNDAMS
SEEM TO HAVE NEW ABILITIES.

67
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,958
COLONEL MANNEQUIN,

68
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,420
I SUGGEST WE WITHDRAW FROM
THIS AIRSPACE, AT LEAST FOR NOW.

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,632
CONTINUING WOULD NEEDLESSLY RISK
THE LIVES OF OUR SOLDIERS.

70
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:22,551
I DO AGREE WITH YOU,
BUT UN HEADQUARTERS SAYS

71
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:24,595
IT'S SENDING REINFORCEMENTS
TO BOLSTER OUR NUMBERS.

72
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,097
THEY HAVE REINFORCEMENTS?

73
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,557
DO YOU MEAN THE UN
HAS MORE MACHINES

74
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,101
EQUIPPED WITH THOSE
GN DRIVES?

75
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:31,936
I DON'T KNOW.

76
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,896
BUT OUR ORDERS ARE TO LAUNCH

77
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,981
A SECOND ASSAULT
AS SOON AS THEY GET HERE.

78
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,358
(Beeping)

79
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,151
I'M DETECTING A GN‐X
APPROACHING THE SHIP, COLONEL.

80
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:40,402
REALLY?

81
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,863
MUST BE ANOTHER SURVIVOR.

82
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:45,366
Operator 23B:
WE HAVE A MATCH ON
THE MACHINE.

83
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,619
THE PILOT IS LIEUTENANT
PATRICK COLASOUR OF THE AEU.

84
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,621
SORRY, I LET YOU DOWN,
COLONEL.

85
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,915
THEY KIND OF DID
A NUMBER ON ME.

86
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:55,376
YOU REALLY HAD ME
WORRIED THERE

87
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,877
YOU SILLY DUMBASS.

88
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:09,890
(Thinking)
THAT WINGED GUNDAM.

89
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,310
IT WASN'T AFFECTED BY
MY QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

90
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,606
CAN IT BLOCK THEM OUT NOW?
OR MAYBE...

91
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:20,818
WHATEVER THE CASE, I'LL
SETTLE THIS IN THE NEXT BATTLE!

92
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:23,070
I AM A PERFECT SUPER‐SOLDIER.

93
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,615
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LOSE TO
THAT INFERIOR SUBJECT E‐57!

94
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,037
Ian:
WELL, AS YOU INSTRUCTED,

95
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,665
I DEPLOYED SOME SATELLITES
THAT ARE EMITTING GN PARTICLES.

96
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:37,042
BUT DO YOU THINK THE ENEMY WILL
REALLY FALL FOR THIS TRICK?

97
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:38,794
IT CAN'T HURT TO TRY.

98
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:39,879
AND YOU KNOW
THEY'RE GOING TO BE

99
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,881
WATCHING THE ASTEROID FIELD
CLOSELY.

100
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,592
WE NEED TO TRY EVERYTHING
WE POSSIBLY CAN.

101
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:46,635
AND, WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON THE GUNDAMS?

102
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:50,181
KYRIOS IS GOOD TO GO
ONCE WE REMOVE ITS FLIGHT UNIT.

103
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:52,516
WITH VIRTUE, WE'LL STRIP
ITS OUTER ARMOR

104
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,518
AND DEPLOY IT AS NADLEEH.

105
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,145
I'VE PREPARED
WEAPONS FOR IT, TOO.

106
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,063
HOW LONG UNTIL YOU'RE ALL DONE?

107
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,149
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US
AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS.

108
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,193
HAVE IT FINISHED IN SIX HOURS,
PLEASE.

109
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,736
GOTCHA.

110
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:04,695
(Sighs)

111
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,824
(Thinking)
RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY THINGS
WE CAN COUNT ON IN A FIGHT

112
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:12,578
ARE THE ASSAULT CONTAINERS,
EXIA AND THE GN ARMS.

113
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:16,207
THE TRANS‐AM IS OUR SAFETY NET,
BUT IT HAS A TIME LIMIT.

114
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,750
HUH?
TIERIA?

115
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,419
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA,
WHEN IT'S DONE,

116
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,879
PLEASE SUBMIT
YOUR NEXT MISSION PLAN.

117
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,005
(Gasp)

118
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,090
YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND
FIGHT ALREADY?

119
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,759
OF COURSE I DO.

120
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,886
WIPING OUT THE REMAINING
ENEMY MACHINES

121
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:30,763
EQUIPPED WITH THE
PSEUDO GN DRIVES

122
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:33,098
WOULD PROVE TO THE WORLD
HOW STRONG WE STILL ARE.

123
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:35,476
THEN WE COULD CONTINUE
WITH THE PLAN.

124
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:37,269
BUT THE RISK HERE IS ENORMOUS.

125
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,271
AND THE ENEMY COULD HAVE
REINFORCEMENTS.

126
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,689
I UNDERSTAND.

127
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,441
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

128
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,901
WHO'S THINKING
LIKE THIS.

129
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,319
ALL THE
MEISTERS FEEL THIS WAY.

130
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,238
HUH?

131
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,573
ALLELUJAH, TOO?
AND SETSUNA?

132
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:50,950
PLEASE.

133
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,083
(Thinking)
WE SIMPLY HAVE TO SURVIVE.

134
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,800
ALI AL‐SAACHEZ!

135
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,345
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO KILLED LOCKON!

136
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,891
BOTH OF MY PARENTS AND MY LITTLE
SISTER WERE KILLED BY THE KPSA

137
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:18,435
IN AN ATTACK
BY A SUICIDE BOMBER.

138
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,813
LET ME AVENGE MY FAMILY'S DEATH.

139
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:22,523
LET ME SETTLE THIS SCORE.

140
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:26,026
IN A DESPERATE BID
FOR REVENGE,

141
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:29,530
DID YOU
THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE, LOCKON?

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,906
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

143
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,784
WHAT'S WRONG...
ARE YOU AFRAID OF DYING?

144
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,786
THAT'S BLASPHEMY AGAINST GOD!

145
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:42,459
AFTER DEATH,
THERE IS NO GOD.

146
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,586
Lasse (flashback):
AT THIS POINT, I THINK

147
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,923
CELESTIAL BEING'S EXISTENCE,
THAT WE EXIST,

148
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,010
MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN LASTING
SIGNIFICANCE ALL BY ITSELF.

149
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,594
(Gasps)

150
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,888
WHAT IT MEANS TO EXIST,

151
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,725
THAT IS,
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE,

152
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,518
IS TO FACE THE WORLD

153
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:02,104
AND TRY TO CARRY ON THE IDEAS
OF THOSE WHO'VE DIED.

154
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,940
AND NOT FOR GOD...

155
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,943
I'LL DO IT BY MY OWN WILL.

156
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,405
Operator 23A:
MESSAGE FROM
OBSERVATION TEAM 34.

157
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,532
THEY'VE DETECTED
FOUR OBJECTS

158
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:15,200
MOVING AWAY FROM
THE ASTEROID FIELD.

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,702
HAVE THE RECON TEAM

160
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:18,454
PATROLLING THE ASTEROIDS'
PERIMETER CONFIRM THIS.

161
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,455
YES, MA'AM!

162
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,664
IT'S A DIVERSION.

163
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:22,541
YES, I'M SURE IT IS.

164
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,251
Operator 23B:
MA'AM, SILHOUETTE APPROACHING
FROM BEHIND US!

165
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:25,336
HUH?
HUH?

166
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:29,882
WHAT KIND OF MACHINE IS THAT?

167
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:31,467
I WONDER.

168
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:34,636
IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT
WAS TAKEN FROM CELESTIAL BEING?

169
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,308
Lichtendahl:
REALLY?

170
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,685
SO, SETSUNA AND THE OTHER
MEISTERS HAVE DECIDED TO FIGHT?

171
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,395
THAT MEANS BE PREPARED
FOR THE WORST.

172
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,897
MAN, THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT!

173
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:47,608
Feldt:
REALLY WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO FIGHT.

174
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:49,735
HUH?

175
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,739
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, FELDT?

176
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:54,740
IT'S A LETTER.

177
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,949
A LETTER?

178
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,201
(Sighs)

179
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,203
IT'S TO MY MOM AND DAD
IN HEAVEN.

180
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,080
AND THERE'S ONE TO LOCKON.

181
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,083
FELDT, YOUR PARENTS ARE...

182
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,377
WRITING A WILL'S SUPPOSED
TO BE BAD LUCK!

183
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:09,963
IT'S NOT A WILL!
I PLAN ON STAYING ALIVE.

184
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,799
AND I WON'T SEE THEM
FOR A WHILE.

185
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,384
SO I'M APOLOGIZING.

186
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,177
(Realizing)
I SEE.

187
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,637
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, FELDT.

188
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,639
I PROMISED LOCKON THAT
I'D SURVIVE.

189
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,641
GOOD, MAKE SURE
YOU KEEP THAT PROMISE.

190
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,769
HEY, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD
BE WRITING A LETTER AS WELL.

191
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,312
YEAH, TO WHO?

192
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,772
MY MOM IN THE COLONIES.

193
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:27,773
HMM?

194
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:29,983
THE WOMAN WHO RAISED ME.

195
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,820
THOUGH I DON'T REALLY HAVE
FOND MEMORIES.

196
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,322
I KIND OF RAN AWAY FROM THERE.

197
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:36,573
THEN VEDA CHOSE ME.

198
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,158
AT LEAST
YOU HAVE SOMEONE.

199
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:39,618
YOU CAN
SAY THAT AGAIN.

200
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,370
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU,
LICHTY?

201
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,247
MY MOM AND DAD
WERE BOTH ENGINEERS

202
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:44,915
WHO WORKED ON ONE OF
THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS.

203
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:46,667
WHEN I WAS JUST A KID

204
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,378
THEY CASHED IN THEIR CHIPS
IN THE SOLAR POWER WARS.

205
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,171
EVERYONE'S GOT A STORY.

206
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:53,340
WELL IT'S BECAUSE
OF OUR STORIES

207
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,758
THAT WE ALL JOINED UP
WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

208
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:56,969
COME TO THINK OF IT,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

209
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,929
WE'VE EVER TALKED ABOUT
EACH OTHER'S PASTS LIKE THIS.

210
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,223
WE WERE SWORN TO
CONFIDENTIALITY.

211
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,599
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

212
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,143
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

213
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,395
(Sighs)

214
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,274
SO, HOW'S NADLEEH DOING?

215
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,317
THEY'RE ALL DONE.

216
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:15,028
BUT THERE'S NO MORE
TRIAL SYSTEM, IS THERE?

217
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,156
AND NADLEEH DOESN'T HAVE A LOT
OF PARTICLE STORAGE CAPACITY‐‐

218
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:19,366
I'M STILL DOING IT.

219
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,576
THERE'S NO CHOICE.

220
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,953
I HAVE TO TAKE REVENGE
FOR LOCKON.

221
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:25,456
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GET
SO WORKED UP ABOUT THIS.

222
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,083
I NEED TO FINISH THIS.

223
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:36,258
Feldt:
SETSUNA.

224
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,427
FELDT GRACE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

225
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,764
I WROTE
A LETTER TO LOCKON.

226
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:56,445
IS THERE ANYONE YOU WANT TO
WRITE A LETTER TO, SETSUNA?

227
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:00,949
NO, THERE ISN'T.

228
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,326
I SEE.

229
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,161
HOW LONELY FOR YOU.

230
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,164
NO, HE'S THE LONELY ONE.

231
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,000
SO HARO,

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,169
YOU STAY BY HIS SIDE.

233
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,338
HERE, NEXT TO LOCKON.

234
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,423
LOCKON! LOCKON!

235
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,762
KEEP HIM COMPANY, HARO.

236
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,805
ROGER! ROGER!

237
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,349
THANKS SO MUCH.

238
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,684
(Siren rings)

239
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:29,603
(Gasps)

240
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:31,688
Christina:
THE E‐SENSOR HAS PICKED UP
SOMETHING. ENEMY TEAM DETECTED.

241
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:33,065
COME ON, FELDT. LET'S GO.

242
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,066
RIGHT.

243
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,277
HOW MANY MACHINES
IN THE ENEMY TEAM?

244
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,780
13 OF THEM! BUT THERE'S
A REALLY BIG ONE

245
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,406
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ENTIRE GROUP!

246
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:42,658
WHAT KIND OF
BIG ONE?

247
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,243
I'LL PUT IT
ON THE MONITOR!

248
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:45,160
SORRY I'M LATE.

249
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,161
(Gasps)

250
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,041
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF BATTLESHIP?

251
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,626
NO LICHTY.

252
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,920
I'M AFRAID NOT.

253
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,673
THAT'S A MOBILE ARMOR
LOADED WITH PSEUDO GN DRIVES!

254
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,719
(Confidently)
HMM.

255
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,640
(Blast)

256
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,975
IT'S FIRING A PARTICLE BEAM!

257
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:09,142
FROM THAT FAR AWAY?

258
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,143
OH MAN!

259
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:16,692
(Crash)

260
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,579
Feldt:
NUMBER ONE PARTICLE EMITTER
WAS HIT.

261
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,247
Sumeragi:
TRANSFER PARTICLE SUPPLY TO
NUMBER TWO EMITTER!

262
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:31,790
Feldt:
ROGER!

263
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,000
SECOND SHOT COMING IN!

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,126
LICHTY, MOVE!

265
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,210
YEAH, I'M ON IT!

266
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,213
(Blast)

267
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:39,423
(Screaming)

268
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,300
LAUNCH THE ASSAULT CONTAINER!

269
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,135
YOUR TARGET'S
THE ENEMY MOBILE ARMOR!

270
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,344
ROGER.

271
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:46,305
ASSAULT CONTAINER IS PREPPED
AND HEADING OUT!

272
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,806
(Powering up)

273
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,228
KEEP THE PTOLEMY HIDDEN BEHIND
THE ASTEROIDS, LICHTY.

274
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,230
ROGER THAT!

275
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,898
Sumeragi:
KYRIOS AND NADLEEH LAUNCH
STRAIGHT FROM THE CONTAINERS.

276
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,358
PROTECT PTOLEMY!

277
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,901
Allelujah:
ROGER THAT!
ROGER!

278
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,370
Sergei:
STICK TO THE PLAN
AND ENGAGE THEIR SPACESHIP

279
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,205
IN A TWO‐PRONGED ATTACK.

280
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,041
USE THE ASTEROIDS
TO COVER YOUR APPROACH,

281
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,500
AND THEN DESTROY IT!

282
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,793
All together:
ROGER!

283
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,754
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO
WIN SOME GLORY!

284
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,591
HIGH VELOCITY OBJECT
APPROACHING FROM DEAD AHEAD!

285
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,592
Peries:
AN ENEMY!

286
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,971
Peries:
COLONEL!

287
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:29,473
Sergei:
LEAVE IT TO ALVATORE!

288
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,891
Peries:
YES, SIR!
Sergei: LEAVE IT TO ALVATORE!

289
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,435
THIS TIME WE'LL BRING THE BATTLE
TO A CLEAR DECISIVE END!

290
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,188
Christina:
ENEMY MOBILE SUITS APPROACHING
FROM PORT AND STARBOARD!

291
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:40,359
Pilot 24A:
G... GUNDAM!

292
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,486
YOU WILL NOT GET PAST ME!

293
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,447
Patrick:
WHERE THE HELL'S YOUR ARMOR?

294
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:48,700
(Grunting)

295
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,494
IT'S TOO EARLY TO USE
THE TRANS‐AM!

296
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,791
Peries (gasping):
WHAT'S WRONG?

297
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,792
HUH?

298
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,212
(Hallelujah cackling)

299
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:03,298
Peries:
THAT SUIT...IT'S YOU!

300
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:05,467
I'M SORRY, ALLELUJAH...

301
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,885
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

302
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,637
I DON'T WANT
TO DIE JUST YET!

303
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,389
SUBJECT E‐57!

304
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,390
Hallelujah:
THAT'S ME.

305
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,391
(Gasps)

306
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,601
Sergei:
LEAVE THIS ONE TO ME!

307
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,019
(Laughing wickedly)

308
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,360
WE'RE IN RANGE!

309
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,903
TIME TO LAUNCH THE ATTACK!

310
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,864
(Barrage of shots)

311
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:36,915
A GN FIELD? HOW DID THESE GUYS
MAKE ONE SO STRONG?

312
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,125
(Growling)

313
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,168
Lasse:
IN THAT CASE, HOW ABOUT THIS!

314
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,219
(Blast)

315
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,723
PTOLEMY, WATCH OUT!

316
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,725
(Pilot 24B screaming)

317
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,520
(Blast)

318
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,314
WHAT'S THIS?

319
