1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,545
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,881
YOU AND I MEETING
LIKE THIS.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,383
YOU KNOW, BEING
A SENTIMENTAL VIRGO AND ALL,

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,428
I CAN'T HELP FEELING WE WERE
DESTINED TO MEET.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,180
OR PERHAPS
I FOUND YOU BECAUSE

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,599
YOU JUST STOPPED EMITTING
THOSE LIGHT PARTICLES.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,434
THAT'S PROBABLY IT!

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,144
(Groans)

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,317
HE FORCED ME BACK.
HOLD ON!

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,695
GOOD LUCK HITTING ME WITH
THAT BIG BLADE OF YOURS!

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,489
HE DODGED IT!

12
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,950
BEFORE I LEAVE...

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,118
I THINK I'LL COLLECT
A LITTLE SOUVENIR!

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,038
DON'T YOU...TOUCH ME!

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,623

00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,626

(Slash)

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,303
HE HAS A BEAM SABER?

THE PRIVATE ARMED ORGANIZATION,
CELESTIAL BEING,

27
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,125
DECLARES THAT IT WILL

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,710
ELIMINATE
ALL WARS AROUND THE WORLD.

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,130
SUBSEQUENTLY, IT BEGINS ITS
ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

30
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,759
AFTER SHOCKING
THE WORLD BY INTERVENING

31
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,762
IN THE CEYLON ETHNIC CONFLICT
IN SOUTHERN INDIA,

32
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,138
THE GUNDAM MEISTERS
RECEIVE ORDERS

33
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,724
FOR A NEW MISSION.

34
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,186
IS THIS GOD'S JUDGMENT
VISITED UPON HUMANITY...

35
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,313
OR IS IT THE PRECURSOR
TO A REVOLUTION?

36
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,696
Katagari:
MY, OH MY, YOU ARE
UNPREDICTABLE AREN'T YOU?

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,907
I WENT AND
LOST MY RIFLE.

38
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,617
I'LL WRITE UP
AN APOLOGY.

39
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,035
AH, I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT THAT

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,328
IF I WERE YOU GRAHAM.

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,913
THE DATA WE COLLECTED
ON THE GUNDAM

42
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,123
MADE THE TRADE
A GOOD ONE.

43
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,749
HECK, IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN WORTH LOSING

44
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,000
THE FLAG ALTOGETHER.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,419
THE PAINT
YOU SCRAPED OFF IT

46
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,837
WHEN YOU MADE CONTACT

47
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,839
COULD GIVE US SOME
GOOD LEADS.

48
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,133
THAT CELESTIAL BEING
PILOT...

49
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,760
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT HOW YOUNG HE WAS.

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,178
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

51
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,471
OF COURSE NOT.

52
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,973
HE SIGNALED HIS EMOTIONS

53
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,933
THROUGH THE WAY
HIS MOBILE SUIT MOVED.

54
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,146
(Ringing)

55
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,523
Officer:
WE'VE LOST THE GUNDAM, SIR.

56
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,691
WE GOT DUMPED.

57
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,531
LAUNCHING ALONE
LIKE THAT...

58
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,283
WHO WAS IN THAT FLAG?

59
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,872
Journalist: ANYTHING FROM OUR
REPORTER ON THE SCENE?! YEAH,
UH‐HUH, NOTHING YET!

60
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,250
A GUNDAM! EVEN IF IT'S A SMALL
CLIP I WANT TO SEE A GUNDAM!

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,587
STILL NO STATEMENT
FROM CELESTIAL BEING!

62
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,047
NEWS UPDATE IN
TEN MINUTES, PEOPLE!

63
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,049
WE'LL BE BROADCASTING LIVE
FROM THE SCENE!

64
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,759
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF...
AND THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE CHAIRMAN'S

65
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,596
GOT A STATEMENT COMING
SO KEEP A SLOT OPEN!

66
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,805
HERE'S
THE FIRST DRAFT!

67
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,140
RIGHT.

68
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,935
UM, KINUE'S ON‐‐
NOT NOW, KID!

69
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,979
AEOLIA SCHENBERG....

70
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,939
A SCIENTIST
AND LEGENDARY INVENTOR

71
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,233
FROM THE LATE 21ST CENTURY.

72
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,110
HE PROPOSED
THE BASIC THEORY

73
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,071
OF THE SOLAR POWER
GENERATION SYSTEM.

74
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,157
HE RARELY APPEARED IN PUBLIC

75
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,910
AND NOTHING EXCEPT HIS FAME
IS REMEMBERED NOW.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,162
GIVEN HIS GENIUS AND WEALTH,

77
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,164
I COULD SEE
HIM BEING THE PERSON

78
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:53,126
BEHIND THE CREATION OF
CELESTIAL BEING.

79
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
BUT WHY ARE THEY MAKING
THEIR MOVE NOW?

80
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,297
OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER?

81
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,515
SCHENBERG'S BLOODLINE
ENDED WITH HIM.

82
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,099
HE HAS NO HEIRS.

83
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,061
I SEE. AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIS FORTUNE?

84
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,771
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT
IT IN THE RECORDS.

85
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,273
HE PROBABLY HAD
A HAND IN THAT DETAIL.

86
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,776
SECURITY WAS PRETTY MUCH
NONEXISTENT

87
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,486
BACK IN
THE 21ST CENTURY.

88
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,946
YES, SIR.

89
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,199
CELESTIAL BEING HAS
BEEN SURPRISINGLY METICULOUS.

90
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,953
MR. SECRETARY,
DO YOU THINK

91
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,497
THEY'LL CONTINUE
THEIR ARMED INTERVENTIONS?

92
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,457
I WOULD,
IF I WERE THEM.

93
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,125
PREPARE THE APPROPRIATE
MATERIALS

94
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,169
FOR OUR REPORT
TO THE ASSEMBLY.

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,004
AND OUR EXCUSES.

98
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,102
PLEASE
PROCEED TO GATE A12.

99
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,103
HMM?

100
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,522
HEY, YOU KNOW HOW LATE
YOU ARE?

101
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,482
UNRULY BRAT.

102
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,442
I ASSUMED
YOU WERE DEAD.

103
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,944
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN?

104
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,029
I SUBMITTED
MY REPORT TO VEDA.

105
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,323
PERHAPS I'LL HAVE
A LOOK AT IT LATER.

106
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,243
SURE.

107
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,329
ANYWAY, THE IMPORTANT
THING IS WE'RE ALL SAFE.

108
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,957
I'LL LEAVE SPACE
TO YOU, TIERIA.

109
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,793
WE'RE GOING TO GET READY
FOR OUR NEXT MISSION.

110
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,628
I'LL FOLLOW THE ORDERS.

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,797
THOUGH I HAVE
MY DOUBTS.

112
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,881
(Both chuckle)

113
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,759
HERE ARE YOUR
ORDERS.

114
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,470
ENJOY YOUR DRINKS,
GENTLEMEN.

115
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,557
IT'S MILK.

116
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,351
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

117
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,979
Allelujah:
BUT, DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'LL WORK?

118
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,733
USING THE ELEVATOR
TO GET A UNIT BACK INTO SPACE?

119
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,067
Lockon:
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

120
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,360
IT'S MIXED IN WITH

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,280
THE COLONY CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS, AS PLANNED.

122
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,115
AS LONG AS
IT'S THE SAME WEIGHT

123
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,366
AND IT GETS THROUGH
BOARDING,

124
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,536
THERE ARE NO CHECKS AFTER THAT.
ESPECIALLY HERE.

125
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,331
THAT'S DEFINITELY
THEIR ACHILLES HEEL.

126
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,875
AND IF WE HAVE A WEAK POINT
OF OUR OWN...

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,336
I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE FACT
THAT WITHOUT THE GUNDAMS,

128
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,421
THE PTOLEMAOIS'S
OPERATING TIME

129
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,756
IS SEVERELY LIMITED

130
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,549
WITH ONLY
FOUR SOLAR REACTORS.

131
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,552
DON'T TALK ABOUT
OUR SECRETS.

132
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,389
RIGHT, MY MISTAKE.

133
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,683
TIERIA'S TRAIN IS
LEAVING NOW.

134

Announcer:

135
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,524
NOW DEPARTING
ON SCHEDULE AT 14:18...

136
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,110
(Thinking)
A LINEAR TRAIN TO SPACE.

137
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,495
I CAN FINALLY GET BACK.
I HATE THE SURFACE.

138
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,082
ALRIGHT THEN,
LET'S GO HOME!

139
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,501
I WISH WE COULD TAKE
A BIT OF A BREAK.

140
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,878
GOT TO STRIKE WHILE
THE IRON'S HOT.

141
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,463
THE WORLD'S NOT GOING TO
LISTEN TO US

142
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,090
THE FIRST FEW TIMES AROUND.

143
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,888
GOOD DAY, COLONEL,
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

144
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,307
AND HOW DID SPACE
TREAT YOU, SIR?

145
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,686
I FIND THERE'S SOMETHING
COMFORTING ABOUT GRAVITY.

146
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,145
I AGREE, SIR.

147
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,356
THE COMMANDER HAS BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

148
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,982
THIS WAY.

149
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,777
I'D LIKE TO
STOP BY CEYLON FIRST.

150
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,612
BUT, SIR,
IF WE DO THAT‐‐

151
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,114
I ONLY BELIEVE
IN THINGS

152
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,741
THAT I'VE SEE WITH
MY OWN TWO EYES.

153
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,743
THE COMMANDER
WILL UNDERSTAND.

154
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,537
SIR!
I WILL JOIN YOU!

155
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,333
YOU WERE THERE TO
SEE THE A. E. U.'S NEW MODEL.

156
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,544
BUT INSTEAD OBSERVED
A HUGE MESS.

157
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,963
I WAS THERE AND I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE

158
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,006
A MACHINE
LIKE THAT EXISTS.

159
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,843
I THINK IT'S WELL WORTH OUR
TIME TO RESEARCH IT.

160
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,761
THE TOP BRASS
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

161
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,138
Both:
HUH?

162
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,977
BECAUSE YOU TWO HAVE ACTUALLY
SEEN THIS GUNDAM

163
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,229
YOU'VE BOTH
RECEIVED TRANSFERS.

164
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,732
ANTI‐GUNDAM
INVESTIGATIVE...

165
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,066
TASK FORCE?

166
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,068
A NEWLY FORMED TEAM.

167
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,280
COMMAND WILL GIVE IT
AN OFFICIAL NAME LATER.

168
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,115
PROFESSOR RALPH EIFMAN.

169
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,742
YOU MEAN HE'S
GOING TO BE

170
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,160
OUR CHIEF
TECHNOLOGIST?

171
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,121
AN INDICATOR OF HOW SERIOUS
THE BRASS THINKS THIS IS.

172
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,206
DEAL WITH IT IMMEDIATELY.

173
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,709
SIR!
LIEUTENANT GRAHAM AKER.

174
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,878
TECH ADVISOR
KATAGIRI.

175
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,755
TRANSFERRING
TO THE ANTI‐GUNDAM

176
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,298
INVESTIGATIVE
TASK FORCE!

177
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,927
THAT WAS A SURPRISE.

178
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,929
DID YOU FORESEE THAT
HAPPENING?

179
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,807
MY GOD‐LIKE POWERS
MUST BE SLIPPING.

180
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,102
ALTHOUGH I DO FEEL
FATE IS AT WORK HERE.

181
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,192
Professor:
THOUGH SPORADIC,
TERRORIST ACTIVITY

182
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,153
IN THE ULSTER REGION
OF IRELAND HAS CONTINUED

183
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,739
FOR ALMOST
FOUR CENTURIES.

184
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,116
IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
ORIGINATED WITH A CONFLICT

185
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,952
BETWEEN TWO CHRISTIAN
DENOMINATIONS,

186
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,163
THE CATHOLICS
AND THE PROTESTANTS,

187
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,707
BUT THAT IS NOT
THE ONLY ISSUE DIVIDING THEM

188
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,167
FOR THIS TERM PAPER,

189
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,379
YOU ARE TO USE THE NORTHERN
IRELAND CONFLICT MAP...

190
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,631
(Sighs)

191
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,341
ANOTHER PAPER?

192
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,967
WHY DO WE NEED
A HISTORY CREDIT

193
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,178
IF WE'RE ENGINEERING
MAJORS?

194
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,138
FURTHER TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATIONS WILL BE BASED

195
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,140
UPON ORBITAL ELEVATOR
MAINTENANCE

196
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,810
AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SPACE COLONIES.

197
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,770
A SENSE OF HISTORY
IS REQUIRED

198
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,146
IN ORDER TO
RELATE TO ENGINEERS

199
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
FROM OTHER NATIONS

200
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,941
(Giggles)

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,026
HE SAID THAT
IN THE FIRST CLASS!

202
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
YEAH, I KNOW THAT,
BUT STILL...

203
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,738
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
THEY LET ME COME HERE

204
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,365
AS AN EXCHANGE
STUDENT.

205
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,201
AND I SURE DO
APPRECIATE THAT.

206
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,369
REALLY?

207
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,370
HUH?

208
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,124
MY STUDY EXCHANGE

209
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,544
IS GOING TO END
IN TWO YEARS.

210
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,171
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

211
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,466
HEY, DO YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE, SAJI?

212
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,844
YEAH, I GUESS.

213
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,097
WHEN YOU DO...
AM I IN IT?

214
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,932
YEAH, I GUESS.

215
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,933
AUGH!

216
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,103
WHAT?
H‐HEY, WHAT'S UP?

217
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,563
LOUISE!

218
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,107
AH, GIRLS CAN
BE SO‐‐

219
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,192
THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CHASE ME!

220
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,320
OH! RIGHT!

221
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,121
A SOFT DRINK?

222
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,706
THEY SERVE AN ORIGINAL
COCKTAIL HERE

223
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,958
THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

224
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,751
I'M STILL A MINOR,
YOU KNOW.

225
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,713
OH, DO
EXCUSE ME.

226
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,631
I'LL HAVE THE USUAL.

227
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,799
YES, SIR.

228
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,848
THE THIRD MISSION IS
ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY.

229
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,766
IF YOU PLAN ON FOLLOWING
THE ACTION,

230
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,811
I SUGGEST YOU THINK
ABOUT SETTING UP THREE MONITORS.

231
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,439
AH, I SIMPLY CAN'T WAIT.

232
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,524
I'LL BE SURE TO FOLLOW
YOUR SUGGESTION.

233
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,239
YOU LIKE TO WATCH?

234
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,990
(Groans)

235
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,877
THIS WAY, COLONEL.

236
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,421
SO, THAT'S IT.

237
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,423
HAVE YOU LEARNED
ANYTHING YET?

238
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,216
YES. YOU THERE!

239
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,100
GIVE COLONEL SERGEI
HERE THE DETAILS.

240
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,352
YES, SIR.

241
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,187
IT'S AN OPTIONAL
BOMBING MODULE

242
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,022
FOR A MOBILE SUIT
MADE OUT OF E‐CARBON.

243
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,024
THE MATERIAL'S STATE
OF THE ART,

244
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,984
BUT WE HAVEN'T
FOUND ANY EVIDENCE

245
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,780
OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
IN ITS CONSTRUCTION, SIR.

246
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,032
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE MISSILES INSIDE?

247
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,034
RIGHT. AFTER STUDYING
THE RESIDUE,

248
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,869
WE'VE DETERMINED
THEY WERE OF

249
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,829
THE THREE HUNDRED
KILOGRAM GUIDED TYPE.

250
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,081
BY THE WAY,

251
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,376
NO COUNTRY OR MANUFACTURER
PRODUCES THIS TYPE.

252
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,711
THEY'RE PRODUCING THEM
ON THEIR OWN.

253
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,966
Katagiri:
JUDGING FROM THE IMPACT
YOUR MACHINE TOOK,

254
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,342
I BELIEVE THE GUNDAM'S OUTPUT
IS ROUGHLY

255
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,761
SIX TIMES
THAT OF THE FLAG'S.

256
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,972
I WONDER WHAT
KIND OF ENGINE IT USES...

257
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,556
Sergei:
IT HAS A LOT OF POWER,

258
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,600
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
SO AGILE.

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,894
YES, THE COMBAT
DATA CONFIRMS THAT.

260
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,771
AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE FACTOR

261
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,564
THAT MAKES THAT
MOBILITY POSSIBLE.

262
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,899
THAT LIGHT?

263
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,151
YES. APPARENTLY
THE GUNDAM'S BODY

264
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,321
EMITTED GLOWING
PARTICLES OF SOME KIND.

265
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,032
THAT EXPLAINS SOME
OF MY QUESTIONS.

266
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,701
IT MUST BE WHY
THEY WEREN'T PICKED UP

267
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,412
BY OUR RADAR OR SENSORS.

268
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,331
YEAH, THOSE PARTICLES
AREN'T ONLY USED FOR STEALTH,

269
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,167
BUT ALSO FOR CONTROLLING
THE MACHINE.

270
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,752
MORE THAN LIKELY

271
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,922
THEY'RE ALSO UTILIZED
IN ITS WEAPONRY.

272
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,674
PROFESSOR
RALPH EIFMAN!

273
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,552
WHAT A REMARKABLE MAN.

274
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:26,806
HE POSSESSES TECHNOLOGY SEVERAL
DECADES IN ADVANCE OF OURS.

275
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,225
AEOLIA SCHENBERG....

276
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,768
HE'S THE
HISTORICAL FIGURE

277
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,145
WHO APPEARED IN
CELESTIAL BEING'S

278
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,063
STATEMENT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

279
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,190
YES, I KNOW THE NAME.

280
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,402
HE PROPOSED THE SOLAR POWER
GENERATION SYSTEM.

281
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,237
INTELLIGENCE IS
FOLLOWING THAT ANGLE

282
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,032
IN ITS
GUNDAM INVESTIGATION.

283
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,201
THEY WON'T FIND
ANYTHING DOWN THAT PATH.

284
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,120
THEY COULD THROW AWAY
THIS MODULE

285
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,663
BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE TO

286
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,123
KEEP THIS
TECHNOLOGY SECRET.

287
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,333
Eifman:
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO DO

288
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,128
IS FOCUS ON CAPTURING
A GUNDAM.

289
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,337
IF IT'S POSSIBLE.

290
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,756
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

291
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,467
AND THAT'S WHY
I WANT THIS MACHINE MODIFIED.

292
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,969
WHAT ABOUT THE STRESS
ON THE PILOT?

293
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,055
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE PILOT'S SAFETY.

294
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,891
HOWEVER, I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET IT DONE IN ONE WEEK.

295
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,935
OH? YOU DON'T ASK
FOR MUCH DO YOU?

296
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,771
IF WE'RE COURTING
A GUNDAM,

297
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,856
WE'LL HAVE TO
BE A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE

298
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,358
HE THINKS HE'S FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH IT.

299
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,694
(Phone rings)

300
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,988
YEAH, IT'S ME.

301
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,157
WHAT? THE GUNDAMS
ARE BACK?

302
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,283
LOCATION?

303
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,577
SIR! THERE
ARE TWO LOCATIONS!

304
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,661
TWO PLACES?

305
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,538
SIMULTANEOUSLY?

306
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,624
IN SOUTH AFRICA?

307
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,125
MOST LIKELY,
THEY'RE INTERVENING

308
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,127
IN THE CIVIL WAR OVER
THE MINING RIGHTS

309
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,712
TO THE COUNTRY'S
MINERAL DEPOSITS.

310
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,387
AUGH, I HATE THIS.

311
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,642
THIS FEELS WAY TOO MUCH
LIKE BEING A BULLY.

312
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,602
COME ON,
HURRY UP AND DISARM.

313
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,359
I'LL START HITTING YOU...

314
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,152
(Shots firing)

315
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,536
THEY RAN! THEY RAN!

316
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,287
HEY, THEY WISED UP!

317
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,581
GOOD STUFF!
GOOD STUFF!

318
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,041
Eifman:
DON'T DO IT!

319
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,961
AND WHY NOT?
ONE'S IN TARIBIA!

320
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,712
WE CAN GET THERE
FROM HERE!

321
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,756
I HAVE A DEEP‐ROOTED
LOATHING

322
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,216
FOR ILLEGAL
NARCOTICS.

323
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,385
IF THEY'RE GOING TO
BURN IT DOWN

324
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,554
THEN I'M MORE
INCLINED TO HELP THE GUNDAMS!

325
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,389
NARCOTICS...

326
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,808
THEY'RE PLANNING ON
DESTROYING THE REASON

327
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,309
FOR THE WAR ITSELF.

328
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,190
Allelujah:
THIRTY MINUTES HAVE ELAPSED

329
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,358

00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,985
WARNING COMPLETE.

331
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,321

333
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,296

334
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,551
NINETY‐SEVEN PERCENT
OF OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED.

335
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,137
MISSION COMPLETE.

336
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,307
MISSIONS LIKE THIS ONE
ARE A PLEASURE.

337
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,314
A THIRD UNIT JUST
APPEARED HERE ON CEYLON?

338
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,151
YES, SIR!
GARRISON POST SEVEN!

339
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,570
IS THERE A TIEREN
I CAN USE?

340
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,571
I'LL HEAD OUT.

341
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,156
YOU'RE GOING
IN PERSON, COLONEL?!

342
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,199
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

343
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,159
I ONLY BELIEVE
IN SOMETHING

344
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,203
AFTER I'VE SEEN IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

345
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,877
WE JUST
LOST NUMBER THREE!

346
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,503
THIS GUNDAM THING'S
A MONSTER!

347
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,760
EXIA CONTINUING
CONFLICT INTERVENTION.

348
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,720
ELIMINATING TARGETS.

349
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,308
Soldier:
FIRE! FIRE!!

350
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,146
IT'S TOO FAST!

351
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,314
(Crash)

352
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,944
(Slash)

353
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,158

(Boom)

357
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,128
REINFORCEMENTS?

358
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,511
SO, THAT'S A GUNDAM.

359
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,143
(Thud)

360
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:58,119
NO RIFLE?
IS HE TESTING ME?

361
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,497
SHOW ME YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT
ELIMINATING WAR.

362
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,545
(Slash)

363
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,714
HE'S TAKEN THE BAIT!

364
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,510
(Grunts)

365
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,518
HMPH!
THAT HEAD OF YOURS...

366
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,103
I'M TAKING IT!

367

00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,495
(Yelling)

372
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,722
NO ONE TOUCHES ME.

373
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,165
NOW ARRIVING
AT RENDEZVOUS POINT.

374

READY FOR ENERGY TRANSFER
FROM VIRTUE TO PTOLEMY.

384
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,131
COMMENCING TRANSFER.

385
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,510
SPACE IS MUCH BETTER.

386
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,554
GOOD WORK.

387
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,847
HOW'D THE MISSIONS GO?

388
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,640
WENT OFF WITHOUT
A HITCH.

389
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,726
HURRY UP, WE'LL
CELEBRATE WITH A DRINK.

390
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,104
I RESPECTFULLY DECLINE.

391
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,814

YOU'RE NO FUN.

392
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,488
HUH?

SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

397
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,546
SEIEI?
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL NAME.

398
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,131
NICE TO MEET YOU.

399
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,299
(Door unlocks)

400
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,095
NOT TOO SOCIABLE.

401
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,308
I'M HOME. HMM?

402
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,269

405
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,649
THANKS TO
CELESTIAL BEING.

406
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,151
THAT AGAIN?

407
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,820
MAKE YOURSELF SOME
DINNER. SEE YOU.

408
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,946
RIGHT...

409
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,533

410
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,704
Louise:
HELLO, SAJI?!

411
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,623
LOUISE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

412
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,874

THIS MEANS THE CONFLICT
IN NORTHERN IRELAND

419
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,768
THAT HAS CONTINUED FOR ALMOST
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS...

424
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,569
I WONDER HOW
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT

435
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,760
