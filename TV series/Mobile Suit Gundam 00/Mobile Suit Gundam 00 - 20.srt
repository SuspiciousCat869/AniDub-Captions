00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,185
Saji:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,687
WHY WON'T THE REGENERATION
TREATMENT WORK ON HER HAND?

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,565
WE FOUND ABNORMALITIES IN THE
STEM CELLS AROUND THE INJURY.

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,401
THE DOCTOR THINKS THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ABOUT

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,030
THE GUNDAM'S BEAM WEAPON THAT
CAUSED THESE CELLULAR DEFECTS.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
YOU...YOU MEAN SHE...

00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
(Incoming message alert)

8
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,937
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE, SAJI.
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK HOME.

9
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:07,985
WAIT FOR ME IN SPACE.
I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOON.

10
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,989
IN SPACE.

OF IMMORAL TERRORISM

19
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,551
CARRIED OUT BY CELESTIAL BEING,

20
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,762
THE UNION,
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE,

21
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,474
AND THE AEU WILL FORM
A MILITARY ALLIANCE.

22
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,769
THUS, MILITARY OPERATIONS,
UNDER UN SUPERVISION,

23
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,396
WILL BE CONDUCTED
FOR THE PURPOSE OF

24
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,148
DESTROYING CELESTIAL BEING!

25
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,945
(Applause)

26
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,988
THE THREE BLOCS HAVE
ANNOUNCED

27
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,825
A MILITARY ALLIANCE
TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE UN.

28
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,451
WITH THIS AGREEMENT,

29
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,870
THE LARGEST UN MILITARY FORCE
IN HISTORY IS BORN.

30
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,039
IT APPEARS THAT THINGS ARE
STILL PROGRESSING

31
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,165
ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPT

32
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,042
THAT CELESTIAL BEING
HAS WRITTEN FOR US.

33
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,545
THEN THESE RECENT RADICAL
INTERVENTIONS WERE DONE

34
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,339
TO CREATE A UNIFIED
UN MILITARY.

35
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,968
Shirin:
THAT SEEMS LIKE
A REASONABLE CONCLUSION.

36
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,137
Marina: (Thinking)
CELESTIAL BEING'S TRUE GOAL

37
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,223
WAS TO UNITE THE WORLD AS ONE.

38
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,560
REJECT FIGHTING WITH FIGHTING,
AND YOU WIN PEACE.

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,312
IS THIS THE WORLD
YOU WERE HOPING FOR, SETSUNA?

40
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,900
Lockon:
JUDGING BY THE REACTION,

41
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,403
WE'VE FINALLY CLEARED
THE FIRST STAGE OF THE PLAN.

42
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,405
THOUGH I'M UNEASY WITH THE FACT

43
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,782
THAT IT WAS THE TRINITYS'
ACTIONS THAT TRIGGERED IT.

44
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,534
BUT WE STILL HAVE A MYSTERY.

45
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,952
ABOUT WHAT?

46
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,371
THE TRINITYS INFLICTED
SERIOUS DAMAGE

47
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,498
TO THE MILITARY BASES
OF MANY OF THOSE COUNTRIES.

48
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,334
IN THEIR CONDITION,
EVEN IF THEY UNITED THEIR ARMIES

49
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,420
THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

50
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,256
THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD
ONLY REACT WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,092
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON.

52
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,553
TO BE HONEST, I'M UNEASY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

53
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,972
THERE'S THE FACT THAT
TEAM TRINITY ISN'T MENTIONED

54
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,724
ANYWHERE IN
VEDA'S INFORMATION.

55
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,976
NEVER MIND THE DISTURBING
REALIZATION

56
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,770
THAT VEDA'S DATA
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ALTERED.

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,607
IT JUST MAKES ME UNEASY.

58
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,567
IS THAT SO?

59
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,318
(Beeping)

60
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,361
HMM.

61
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,573
Setsuna:
A CODED MESSAGE
FROM SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA.

62
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,035
ALL MEISTERS ARE TO RETURN TO
PTOLEMAIOS WITH THEIR MACHINES.

63
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,703
Lockon:
OKAY, MISSION BRIEFING.

64
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,079
BACK TO SPACE, BOYS.

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,006
Lasse:
SO, THE QUESTION
IS WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,592
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE UN
DOES FIRST.

67
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,928
Ian:
YEAH, BUT I'M SURE
YOU'VE MADE A FORECAST, RIGHT?

68
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,138
IN ANY EVENT, WE SHOULD PREPARE
WHATEVER WE CAN

69
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,515
WHILE WE STILL HAVE TIME.

70
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,391
SINCE YOU ASKED,

71
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,478
IAN, WOULD YOU MIND TAKING LASSE
AND PICKING UP THE GN ARMS?

72
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,313
ROGER THAT!

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,524
NO WAY, YOU MEAN THE GN ARMS
HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT?

74
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,275
WELL, JUST ONE OF THEM
FOR NOW.

75
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,405
THE REMAINING MEMBERS
WILL CONTINUE ON

76
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,824
AND HELP RETRIEVE THE GUNDAMS
THAT ARE COMING UP RIGHT NOW.

77
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,159
ROGER!
ROGER!
ROGER!

78
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,290
FINALLY, A CHANCE TO
DEPLOY THE GN ARMS.

79
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,417
THE CURRENT SITUATION IS
PRECARIOUS ENOUGH

80
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,294
THAT WE MAY
JUST NEED TO USE IT.

81
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,345
KATAGIRI,

82
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,972
ABOUT THAT ANALYSIS WE RAN ON

83
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,307
THE NEW MODEL GUNDAM'S
BEAM SABER...

84
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,768
WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT
MATTERS RIGHT NOW.

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,978
WHY? WHAT'S HAPPENED?

86
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,563
APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A TRAITOR

87
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,731
IN THE CELESTIAL BEING
ORGANIZATION.

88
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,316
WAIT, DID YOU SAY "TRAITOR"?

89
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,401
YES.

90
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,986
AND THEY BROUGHT GIFTS.

91
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,154
SPECIFICALLY, THE SAME KIND OF
ENGINES THE GUNDAMS USE

92
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,366
AND SOME MOBILE SUITS
TO PUT THEM INTO.

93
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
WHAT, FOR REAL?

94
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,703
AND WE'RE TALKING
THIRTY MACHINES.

95
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,455
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THOSE GUYS
COULD MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.

96
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,001
Graham:
I SEE. NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

97
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,752
Katagiri:
THE PILOTS FOR THE MACHINES
THEY'RE GIVING US

98
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,464
WILL PROBABLY BE CHOSEN FROM
AMONG THE OVER FLAGS MEMBERS.

99
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,092
AND OF COURSE,
YOU'D BE IN CHARGE.

100
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,343
I'LL HAVE TO REFUSE THAT.

101
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,553
HUH?

102
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,389
I WILL DEFEAT THE GUNDAMS
WITH A FLAG.

103
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,975
I STOOD OVER HOWARD MASON'S
GRAVE AND MADE A VOW.

104
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,894
Daryl:
BUT CAPTAIN! AGAINST A GUNDAM,
THE FLAG'S PERFORMANCE‐‐

105
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,063
A MAN CANNOT GO BACK ON HIS VOW!

106
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
(Sighs)

107
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,483
OKAY, THEN.

108
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,796
SO THIS IS THE GUNDAM'S
MAIN ENGINE.

109
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,006
ACCORDING TO OUR DATA

110
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,009
THE ENGINE IS OFFICIALLY
CALLED A "GN DRIVE".

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,761
A GN DRIVE.

112
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,182
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE WAS
GIVEN TEN OF THESE GN DRIVES.

113
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,433
COLONEL,

114
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
YOU'LL BE IN CHARGE OF
SELECTING THE PILOTS.

115
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,978
YES, SIR.

116
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,439
COLONEL, PERMIT ME TO PILOT
ONE OF THE NEW MODELS.

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,815
LIEUTENANT.

118
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,192
OF COURSE YOU'LL BE PERMITTED.

119
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,610
COMMANDER.

120
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,196
I HEAR THAT THE YOUNG
LIEUTENANT'S QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES

121
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,574
HAVE A DISABLING EFFECT UPON
THE PILOT OF THE WINGED GUNDAM.

122
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,118
WE MUST MAKE USE OF
THAT ADVANTAGE.

123
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,870
I WILL DO MY BEST, SIR!

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,372
Commander:
WE EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

125
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,122
Peries:
YES, SIR!

126
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,377
FOR PILOT CANDIDATES,

127
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,172
WE'LL ASSEMBLE THE TOP GUNS
FROM THE AEU MEMBER NATIONS.

128
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,716
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT
I SHOULD INCLUDE HIM.

129
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,717
(Doorbell rings)

130
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,927
HMM?

131
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,558
GOOD EVENING, COLONEL!
IT IS I, PATRICK COLASOUR!

132
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
LIEUTENANT?

133
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,981
IT'S SIMPLE COLONEL, I WANTED TO
ASK YOU OUT FOR DINNER.

134
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,358
(Sigh)

135
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,568
LIEUTENANT, THE WORLD IS
ABOUT TO UNDERGO

136
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,904
A REFORMATION
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING.

137
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,699
DOESN'T THE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
LIKE THAT GIVE YOU ANY PAUSE?

138
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,160
NOPE! NOT AT ALL!

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,078
(Sigh)

140
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,663
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A BIG KID.

141
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,872
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

142
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,959
WAIT HERE. I'LL GET READY.

143
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,335
(Excited giggle)

144
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,087
OH BOY!

145
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,759
JNN AGAIN?

146
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,969
TELL THEM I HAVE NO INTENTION

147
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,012
OF ANSWERING
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.

148
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514
Secreatary:
VERY GOOD, SIR.

149
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,598
(Sigh)

150
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,475
MUST BE HARD
BEING SO POPULAR.

151
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,727
DON'T MOCK ME.

152
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,978
RIGHT THEN.

153
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,563
I HEAR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE MACHINES

154
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,273
IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.

155
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,401
MISTER LAGUNA HARVEY,
IF I'M PAID FOR A JOB,

156
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,778
I MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE.

157
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,239
SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

158
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,908
A SIMPLE REQUEST,
I'LL GET RIGHT TO THE POINT.

159
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,995
I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS ON
ONE OF THOSE NEW MODEL MACHINES

160
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,496
THAT WE'RE NOW DISTRIBUTING.

161
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,497
(Unimpressed grunt)

162
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,999
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, MAN.

163
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,333
WELL THEN I'D LIKE YOU TO

164
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,377
USE YOUR INFLUENCE TO
GET ME ASSIGNED

165
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,130
TO SOMEONE'S MILITARY,
THE UNION OR THE AEU,

166
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,382
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME.

167
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,759
WEREN'T YOU ASSIGNED TO

168
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,427
THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION
OR SOMETHING?

169
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,138
UNDER THE NAME OF
LIEUTENANT GARY BIAGGI.

170
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,682
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
YOUR GREAT INSTINCTS.

171
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,561
BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO PILOT
ONE OF THOSE THINGS SO BADLY?

172
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,731
THERE'S SOMEONE
I OWE A LITTLE PAYBACK TO,

173
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,025
THREE TIMES OVER NOW.

174
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,777
AND I HAVE
THIS FEELING IN MY GUT

175
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,653
THAT TELLS ME MERCENARIES
AREN'T GOING TO BE

176
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,572
THAT NECESSARY
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

177
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,158
SO, I JUST WANT TO GO
WHERE I CAN FIGHT.

178
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,994
THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP.

179
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,038
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY?

180
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,707
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S ONLY A GUT FEELING!

181
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,293
PLEASE, THINK IT OVER,
MR. HARVEY.

182
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,089
DAMN IT.

183
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,133
ALL BECAUSE OF THOSE
CELESTIAL WHATYOUMALLITS.

184
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,887
(Disappointed sigh)

185
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,348
I CAN'T GET AN INTERVIEW.

186
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,808
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

187
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,809
(Car drives by)

188
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,937
HUH?

189
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,148
FUNNY, THEY TOLD ME
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN A MEETING.

190
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,149
HMM.

191
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,365
UH, HELLO?

192
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,033
HOW MAY I HELP YOU, MISS?

193
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,786
I'M A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
FROM JNN

194
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,955
AND I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS,

195
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,206
IF THAT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

196
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,000
YOU'RE A REPORTER FROM JNN?

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,754
OH, I DON'T MIND. BUT SEE,
I AM IN A BIT OF A HURRY.

198
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,589
COULD YOU ASK THEM IN THE CAR?

199
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,633
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

200
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,552
Al‐Saachez:
WELL, I GUESS
YOU'D RATHER NOT.

201
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,470
(Grunts)

202
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,222
OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

203
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,352
Al‐Saachez:
MISS KINUE CROSSROAD.

204
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,981
HOW REFRESHING. NICE TO SEE A
BEAUTIFUL REPORTER FOR A CHANGE.

205
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,274
THANK YOU.

206
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,985
SO, WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO ASK ME ANYWAY?

207
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,696
I APOLOGIZE
IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THIS,

208
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,199
BUT MR. BIAGGI, WERE YOU JUST
IN A MEETING WITH LAGUNA HARVEY,

209
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,742
THE PRESIDENT OF
THE TRAIN CORPORATION?

210
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,578
YES. I DID MEET WITH HIM.

211
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,329
WHAT DID THE
TWO OF YOU DISCUSS?

212
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,499
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I WORK IN DISTRIBUTION.

213
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,376
I WAS REPORTING TO
THE PRESIDENT

214
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,545
TO CONFIRM THE DISTRIBUTION
OF CERTAIN GOODS.

215
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,505
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT?

216
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756
YES.

217
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,466
ARE THESE GOODS FOR
PRIVATE USE?

218
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,760
YES. PRIVATE USE.

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,305
IF YOU DON'T MIND, COULD YOU
PLEASE TELL ME EXACTLY

220
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,557
WHAT KIND OF PRIVATE GOODS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

221
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,183
(Chuckles)

222
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,935
GN DRIVES.

223
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,479
GN DRIVES FOR...

224
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,441
ARE THEY LIKE COMPONENTS
FOR LINEAR TRAINS OR SOMETHING?

225
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,194
NO. THEY'RE ENGINES
FOR POWERING MOBILE SUITS.

226
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,155
DID YOU SAY MOBILE SUITS?

227
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,531
GUNDAMS, IN FACT.

228
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,657
(Gasps)

229
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,159
YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM.

230
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,828
THE ONES POSSESSED BY
CELESTIAL BEING.

231
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,998
ONE OF THEIR PILOTS IS
AN EX‐CHILD SOLDIER FROM KRUGIS.

232
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,833
I MEAN THOSE GUNDAMS.

233
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,753
A CHILD SOLDIER
FROM KRUGIS?

234
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,130
JUST A PUNK, REALLY.

235
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,716
SOMEONE ABDUCTED HIM,
BRAINWASHED HIM,

236
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,384
TRAINED HIM TO FIGHT

237
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,220
AND ESSENTIALLY MOLDED HIM
INTO A GUERILLA SOLDIER.

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,680
I'M THE ONE WHO DID ALL THAT.

239
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,723
(Scared gasp)

240
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,308
WHO... WHO ARE YOU?

241
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,143
I'M A WARMONGER.

242
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,938
I CAN'T HELP IT,
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT WAR.

243
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,565
I'M THE VERY WORST
KIND OF PERSON,

244
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,192
SOMEONE WHO LIVES AND DIES

245
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,153
FOR HUMANITY'S
MOST PRIMITIVE IMPULSE.

246
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
(Terrified gasp)

247
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
GUESS SHE'S ON ANOTHER
BUSINESS TRIP.

248
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,131
Laguna:
IT'S ME.

249
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,926
I TOOK CARE OF THAT PESKY RAT
THAT WAS SCURRYING AROUND.

250
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,636
THAT WASN'T NECESSARY.

251
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,554
I THINK
IT'LL BE GOOD PROPAGANDA,

252
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,516
HELP US GET MORE PUBLIC SUPPORT
AND ALL THAT.

253
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,477
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A HARD MAN
TO FIGURE OUT.

254
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,145
(Chuckles)

255
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,324
LOUISE.

256
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:20,550
(Painful gasping)

257
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,886
FATHER.

258
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,140
SA... SAJI.

259
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,144
(Struggling gasps)

260
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:38,526
(Heavy rain)

261
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,543
Ribbons:
MASTER ALEJANDRO,

262
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,128
I REALLY DON'T SEE
THE NEED FOR YOU

263
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,047
TO ACCOMPANY ME IN PERSON.

264
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,341
Alejandro:
WELL, THIS IS INFORMATION YOU
WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO OBTAIN.

265
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,594
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

266
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,555
BESIDES, THIS HAS BEEN AN
ARDENT WISH OF THE CORNER FAMILY

267
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,140
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

268
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,935
MASTER ALEJANDRO, OR,
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY...

269
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,562
I TAKE IT YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING

270
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,731
TO INTERFERE WITH THIS PROJECT
FOR MANY GENERATIONS.

271
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,566
INDEED WE HAVE.

272
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,402
BUT AS LONG AS VEDA WAS
UP AND RUNNING,

273
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,654
THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD REALLY DO ABOUT IT.

274
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,157
AND THEN ONE DAY,
PURELY BY CHANCE,

275
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,576
AN ANGEL DESCENDED BEFORE ME.

276
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,161
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU,

277
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,663
RIBBONS ALMARK.

278
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,334
I WILL REPAY YOU FOR TAKING ME
IN AND TREATING ME SO WELL.

279
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,044
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO FIND

280
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,213
THE LOCATION
OF THE MAIN SYSTEM.

281
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,299
SORRY, I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
TAKE THAT LONG TO TRACE IT.

282
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,929
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
YOU TRULY ARE MY ANGEL.

283
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
Nena:
AFTER MAKING US
WORK LIKE, NONSTOP,

284
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,604
HOW COULD THEY SUDDENLY CUT OFF
CONTACT WITH US?

285
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,981
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE ASKING ME, NENA.

286
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,692
I'M NO GOOD AT THINKING ABOUT
COMPLICATED STUFF LIKE THAT.

287
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,820
YEAH, YOU'RE THE
SIMPLE TYPE ALRIGHT!

288
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,404
HEY, STOP
MAKING FUN OF ME!

289
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,990
MORON! MORON!
MORON! MORON!

290
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,118
DAMN YOU, HARO!
YOU WANT TO GET SLICED UP?!

291
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,285
MICHAEL!

292
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,871
HARO'S AN INVALUABLE ASSET
TO TEAM TRINITY.

293
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,916
UH, I WAS JOKING JOHANN,
JUST JOKING!

294
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,210
WE'VE JUST RECEIVED
A MISSION PLAN FROM LAGUNA.

295
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,045
IT'S THE SAME THING AS USUAL.

296
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,422
THE MISSION WILL COMMENCE
IN THREE DAYS.

297
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,216
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

298
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,717
Liu‐Mei:
FINALLY, I'VE FOUND YOU.

299
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,136
(Gasp)
(Gasp)

300
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,222
Nena:
BUT HOW?! HOW'D YOU GET PAST
OUR SECURITY?!

301
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,557
THAT DOESN'T MATTER!

302
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,142
NOW THAT SHE'S FOUND US
AND SEEN THE PLACE

303
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,227
WE CAN'T LET HER
GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE!

304
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,230
STAND DOWN, MICHAEL.
I KNOW WHO SHE IS.

305
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,108
I RECALL READING ABOUT HER
IN THE MATERIAL FROM VEDA.

306
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,861
I AM HONORED THAT YOU REMEMBERED
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

307
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,113
MY NAME IS WANG LIU MEI.

308
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,116
I'M AN UNDERCOVER AGENT
FOR CELESTIAL BEING.

309
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,785
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER IN CRIME,
HONG LONG.

310
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,120
OH, HE'S TOTALLY YUMMY.

311
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,371
WHAT, HIM?!

312
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,957
GIVEN THE FACT
YOU ACTUALLY FOUND THIS PLACE,

313
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
YOUR SKILLS
ARE FORMIDABLE INDEED.

314
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,129
WELL THEN, HOW CAN THE THREE
OF US BE OF SERVICE TO YOU?

315
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,423
I SIMPLY DROPPED IN
TO SAY HELLO.

316
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,883
HMM?

317
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,761
TEAM TRINITY ARE MEMBERS OF
CELESTIAL BEING AND SO ARE WE.

318
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,140
AS AN AGENT I FEEL I SHOULD DO
MY BEST TO AID AND ASSIST YOU.

319
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,766
IT IS ONLY NATURAL.

320
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,226
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

321
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,979
IN CASE YOU FORGOT, YOUR GUNDAMS
LAUNCHED AN ATTACK ON US!

322
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,732
YES, I HAVE ALREADY HEARD
ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

323
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,400
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW,

324
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,570
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY ON THE
SIDE OF THOSE WHO ATTACKED YOU.

325
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,615
HANG ON. ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU'RE NEUTRAL?

326
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,993
OH NO, I AM SIMPLY
A FOLLOWER OF THE ORIGINAL IDEAS

327
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,204
THAT AEOLIA SCHENBERG ADVOCATED.

328
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:40,166
AND THAT'S ALL, NOTHING MORE,
AND NOTHING LESS.

329
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,585
I SEE, SO THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

330
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,711
Liu‐Mei:
INDEED.

331
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,921
HUH?
HMM?

332
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,632
I UNDERSTAND.
WANG LIU MEI,

333
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,133
SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY,

334
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,510
I WILL BE COUNTING ON
YOUR FULL SUPPORT.

335
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,845
AS YOU WISH.

336
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,555
AND WHAT ABOUT
OUR LOCATION?

337
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,516
I PROMISE I WILL NOT TELL THEM
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

338
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
GOOD BYE.

339
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,191
(Door closes)

340
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,027
ARE YOU SURE, JOHANN?
SHOULD WE JUST LET THEM LEAVE?

341
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,862
OH, I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

342
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,948
BESIDES, THE MORE CARDS
WE HAVE TO PLAY,

343
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,366
THE BETTER OFF WE ARE.

344
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,826
SHE WAS PRETTY!
SHE WAS PRETTY!

345
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,161
SHUT UP!

346
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,121
SOMEONE'S JEALOUS!
SOMEONE'S JEALOUS!

347
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,125
IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
MISTRESS?

348
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,544
CELESTIAL BEING
IS HOSTILE TOWARDS THEM.

349
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,837
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

350
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,381
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
TEAM TRINITY

351
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,925
HAS TRIGGERED
THE WORLD'S REFORMATION.

352
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,136
DO YOU TRULY DISLIKE THE CURRENT
WORLD THAT MUCH, MISTRESS?

353
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,097
YES. AND IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE,

354
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,557
I WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL

355
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,309
IF THIS WORLD
WAS SMASHED TO PIECES.

356
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
Christina:
EXIA HAS DOCKED.

357
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,196
WHAT'S OUR SITUATION?

358
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,532
NOTHING'S REALLY
CHANGED AS OF YET.

359
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,075
Allelujah:
THE TRINITYS HAVE BEEN
PRETTY QUIET.

360
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,578
I AM GUILTY OF
DISOBEYING ORDERS.

361
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,539
REALLY, WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

362
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,540
BUT I...

363
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,791
AH!

364
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,502
LOOK, JUST ACCEPT IT.

365
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,463
HMM.

366
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,631
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

367
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,591
NOT AT ALL.

368
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,718
Christina:
MISS SUMERAGI!

369
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,595
TEAM TRINITY APPEARS TO BE
ON THE MOVE.

370
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,971
Lockon:
NOW WHAT?

371
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,140
ALRIGHT, WHAT'S
THEIR ATTACK TARGET, FELDT?

372
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,559
THERE'S AN HRL BASE
ON THEIR ROUTE.

373
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,060
IT'S THE GUANGZHOU MILITARY
DISTRICT.

374
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,983
Announcer:
MESSAGE FOR ALL PERSONNEL FROM
THE OBSERVATION TEAM:

375
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,318
THREE MOBILE SUITS
BELIEVED TO BE

376
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,569
THE NEW MODEL GUNDAMS
ARE APPROACHING

377
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,154
FROM DIRECTION S‐9788.

378
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,363
IT IS BELIEVED THEY INTEND TO

379
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,241
PERFORM AN ARMED
INTERVENTION.

380
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,077
I'M STILL PISSED ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY!

381
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,080
Michael:
I'M GOING TO REALLY CUT LOOSE!
IS THAT OKAY, JOHANN?

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,665
Johann:
SEEMS FINE
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN.

383
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,000
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT!

384
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,001
(Growls)

385
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,087
Michael:
HERE I GO!

386
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:50,796
Soldier #1:
(Gasps)

387
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,089
THERE'S ONE MORE COMING!

388
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,133
Nena:
HIT 'EM HARD!

389
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,225
Soldier #2:
DON'T HESITATE!
CONCENTRATE YOUR FIRE!

390
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,811
SHOOTING FROM BEHIND ISN'T FAIR!

391
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,147
DON'T MESS WITH US,
YOU LITTLE PESTS!

392
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,860
Soldier #3:
THOSE DAMN DEMONS!

393
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,571
LET'S WRAP THIS MISSION UP.
PREPARE FOR DOCKING.

394
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,156
ROGER!
ROGER!

395
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,241
The Trinitys:
(Startled yell)

396
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,159
WHAT WAS THAT?!

397
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,786
IS IT THE EXIA AGAIN?!

398
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,746
Johann:
NO, IT ISN'T.

399
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,290
A FORMATION OF TEN?

400
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,251
THOSE AREN'T GUNDAMS!

401
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,753
Michael:
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?!

402
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,214
Nena:
AND THEY'RE EMITTING
GN PARTICLES!

403
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:37,385
COULD IT BE THEY'RE MEMBERS
OF CELESTIAL BEING TOO?!

404
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,180
Sergei:
CHOBU GN‐X TEAM,
COMMENCE OFFENSIVE MANEUVERS.

405
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,766
THESE BABIES ARE PRECIOUS.
DON'T LET THEM GET WRECKED!

406
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,268
ATTACK!

407
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,145
Nena:
(Painful yelps)

408
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,315
WHAT IS WITH THEIR MOBILITY?!

409
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,528
WHAT SUPERB PERFORMANCE!
THIS MACHINE IS AMAZING!

410
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,574
(Crash)

411
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,118
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!

412
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,162
THE DAYS OF FEARING GUNDAMS
HAVE COME TO AN END!

413
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,456
Nena:
OH, YEAH?!

414
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,707
I MISSED!

415
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,126
(Aggressive yell)

416
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,460
(Metal crashing)

417
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,837
(Screams)

418
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,838
Michael:
NENA!

419
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,714
I SHALL BE YOUR NEXT OPPONENT!

420
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,924
THAT'S YOUR FUNERAL!

421
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,134
Michael:
FANGS!

422
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,054
WHAT THE HELL?!

423
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,934
THIS MACHINE CAN KEEP UP
WITH MY REACTION SPEED.

424
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,145
THIS IS THE POWER OF A GUNDAM!

425
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,566
STOP TRASHING MY FANGS!

426
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,316
WE'RE LEAVING!

427
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,359
JOHANN!

428
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,527
NO ARGUING FROM YOU!

429
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,154
ARGH!

430
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,824
Peries:
STOP!

431
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,117
Sergei:
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY!

432
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,660
BUT WHY, COLONEL?!

433
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,704
LOOK DOWN AT THE BASE.

434
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,625
(Soldiers cheering)

435
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,128
WHY ARE THEY CHEERING?

436
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,881
THEY TOOK SO MUCH DAMAGE
IN THE FIGHT.

437
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,757
I GUESS THIS IS
YOUR FIRST TASTE,

438
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,384
ISN'T IT, LIEUTENANT?

439
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,554
THIS IS THE SWEET TASTE
OF VICTORY.

440
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:07,475
(Soldiers cheering)

441
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,729
Feldt:
THE TRINITYS SEEM TO HAVE LEFT
THE COMBAT AIRSPACE.

442
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,105
DID THEY ACTUALLY
RETREAT?

443
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,482
YEAH,
WHAT HAPPENED?!

444
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,400
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE DEPLOYED

445
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,069
A TEAM OF MOBILE SUITS
EQUIPPED WITH SOLAR REACTORS.

446
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,279
SOLAR REACTORS.

447
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
BUT THAT'S...

448
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,492
THE INFORMATION MUST HAVE BEEN
TAKEN FROM VEDA.

449
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,162
FROM NOW ON, IT'S GOING TO BE
LIKE GUNDAM FIGHTING GUNDAM.

450
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,293
GUNDAMS FIGHTING.

451
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,380
ALREADY, THE WORLD HAS
CHANGED SO MUCH.

452
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,509
AFTER ALL THIS, WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY BE COMING NEXT?

453
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,314
Ribbons:
MASTER ALEJANDRO,
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

SO THIS IS VEDA!

THIS IS AEOLIA SCHENBERG!

458

465
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,636
IS THIS THE CONDEMNATION
OF THOSE

WHO DREAMED OF
