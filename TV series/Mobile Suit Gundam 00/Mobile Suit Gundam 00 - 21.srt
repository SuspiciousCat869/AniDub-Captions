BUT WHY?

00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,825
WHY HER?!

Alejandro:
SO THIS IS
VEDA'S MAINFRAME.

18
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,646
THIS IS AEOLIA SCHENBERG!

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,898
OR RATHER,

20
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,983
THE SYSTEM THAT IS
AT THE VERY HEART OF

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,945
ALL CELESTIAL BEING'S PLANS!

22
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,365
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO IT, RIBBONS?

23
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,701
YES, BUT I'M GOING TO
REQUIRE SOME TIME TO DO THIS.

24
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,453
I'M NOT CONCERNED.

25
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,705
THE CORNER FAMILY HAS
GREAT PATIENCE.

26
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,123
WE HAVE WAITED OVER

27
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,709
TWO HUNDRED YEARS
FOR THIS MOMENT.

28
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,963
Sumeragi:
CHRIS, ACCESS VEDA.

29
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,215
BRING UP AN IMAGE OF THE TEAM

30
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,966
THAT DROVE OFF THE TRINITYS
ON THE MONITOR.

31
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,593
TRY AND MAKE SURE THE DATA
FROM OUR SIDE DOESN'T‐‐

32
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,345
I'M BLOCKING IT.

33
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,262
READY, FELDT?

34
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,264
I'VE COMPLETED THE DOWNLOAD.

35
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,016
BRINGING UP THE VISUAL.

36
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,687
LOOK AT THAT THING MOVE!

37
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,440
THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH
PSEUDO SOLAR REACTORS.

HAVEN'T YOU BEEN ABLE
TO GET AHOLD OF LAGUNA YET?!

42
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,541
I CAN'T! I CAN'T!
I CAN'T!

43
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,960
NO CONTACT AND THE UN
HAS NEW MACHINES,

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,420
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?!

45
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,546
COME ON, JOHANN,

46
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,298
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO NEXT?

47
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,974
Alejandro:
HOW'S IT COMING?

48
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,309
I HAVE ALREADY CLEARED
LEVEL FIVE.

49
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,062
I'M NOW BEGINNING TO
SEIZE CONTROL OF LEVEL SIX.

50
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,982
WELL DONE.

51
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,318
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE INFORMATION
UPDATE TO HELP PASS THE TIME?

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,028
HUH.

53
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,489
WELL, LAGUNA HARVEY
SEEMS TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,408
ALL OF THE GN‐XS.

55
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,035
AND, IF THAT IS THE CASE,

56
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,580
IT MEANS HE'S ALREADY
PLAYED HIS PART.

00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,266
WHO ARE YOU?

61
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,729
WHAT KIND OF PILOT ARE YOU,
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ME?!

62
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,147
PATRICK COLASOUR,

63
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,483
NUMBER ONE ACE
OF THE AEU!

64
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,734
YOUR NAME IS
COLASOUR?

65
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,110
UH‐HUH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,362
OH, RIGHT. YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO GOT HIS ASS KICKED

67
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,323
IN THE GUNDAM'S
FIRST ARMED INTERVENTION.

68
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,366
THAT'S A SORE SPOT
WITH ME!

69
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,162
BY THE WAY, WHERE'S
THE UNION'S TOP GUN HIDING?

70
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,290
CAPTAIN AKER WILL NOT BE
TAKING PART IN THIS OPERATION.

71
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:50,916
WHAT?

72
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,417
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

73
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,877
HUH?

74
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,295
I SEE.

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,964
HE GOT SCARED AND
LOST HIS NERVE, DID HE?

76
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,424
THE UNION'S ACE
ISN'T MUCH‐‐

77
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,092
(Chokes)

78
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,260
SOMETHING WRONG?

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,554
DON'T INSULT
THE CAPTAIN, GOT IT?!

80
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,264
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN VIOLENCE!

81
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,224
Kati:
THAT'S ENOUGH!

82
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,266
(Relieved sigh)

83
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,519
PLEASE EXCUSE
HIS RUDENESS.

84
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,062
COLONEL!

85
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,314
UNION WARRANT OFFICER
DARYL DODGE, MA'AM.

86
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,108
AND I AM AEU COLONEL
KATI MANNEQUIN.

87
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,486
I'VE BEEN GIVEN COMMAND
OF THIS OPERATION.

88
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,446
NICE TO MEET YOU,
WARRANT OFFICER.

89
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,907
Daryl:
LIKEWISE, MA'AM!
YOU'LL GET MY BEST!

90
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,118
I EXPECT NOTHING LESS.
COME, PATRICK, NOW!

91
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,289
WAIT UP, COLONEL!
WAIT FOR ME!

92
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,962
IF I DON'T TASTE VICTORY,

93
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,631
GIVING UP THE FLAG
WOULD HAVE BEEN POINTLESS.

94
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,384
AND I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FACE THE CAPTAIN.

95
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,401
SORRY, I'VE BEEN
PUSHING YOU SO HARD.

96
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,569
(Gasps)

97
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,778
JUST WHAT I NEEDED!

98
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,530
Christina:
THANKS VERY MUCH!

99
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,408
Sumeragi:
YOU TOO, FELDT!

100
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,784
(Gasps)

101
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,327
BUT THIS IS MY DUTY.

102
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,620
HMM.

103
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,497
HOW'S THE NEW SYSTEM
COMING ALONG?

104
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,126
IT'S ABOUT 80% DONE.
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

105
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,337
IF WE HAVE TO CUT THE GUNDAMS
OFF FROM ANY OF VEDA'S SUPPORT,

106
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,881
IT'LL BE TOUGH ON THE PILOTS.

107
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,924
(Chokes)

108
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,843
THERE'S ALCOHOL IN THIS DRINK!

109
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,387
OOPS, SORRY!

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,807
(Giggles)

111
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,311
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT AS TENSE
AS YOU USED TO BE, FELDT.

112
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,229
(Gasps)

113
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,481
YOU...YOU REALLY THINK SO?

114
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,983
I DO.

115
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,152
ALL IN ALL, I THINK
IT'S A GOOD TREND.

116
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,032
OKAY. KEEP AT IT JUST
A LITTLE LONGER, PLEASE.

117
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,116
RIGHT!
RIGHT!

118
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,414
Thinking:
GIVEN THE EVIDENCE,

119
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:59,252
IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMEONE IS
MANIPULATING VEDA'S SYSTEMS.

120
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,338
BUT WITHOUT VEDA,

121
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,131
HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO
BE ABLE TO FIGHT

122
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,925
MACHINES THAT ARE
JUST LIKE OURS?

123
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,218
(Door opens)

124
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,928
Lockon:
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

125
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,347
LOCKON STRATOS.

126
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,641
DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

127
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,769
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD IF
WE CAN'T RELY ON VEDA'S SUPPORT.

128
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,354
FOR TWO REASONS.

129
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,149
WE'VE GOT GUNDAMS
AND MISS SUMERAGI'S FORECASTS.

130
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,568
I TAKE IT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER PAST.

131
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,570
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CRIME
SHE COMMITTED?

132
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,905
I KNOW.

133
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,866
BUT ANYONE CAN MAKE
A MISTAKE.

134
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,745
IN HER CASE, IT JUST HAPPENED
TO BE A VERY BIG ONE.

135
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,331
BUT THE REASON MISS SUMERAGI
CHOSE TO FIGHT

136
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,375
WAS TO ATONE FOR HER PAST.

137
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,213
AND SHE DRINKS TO DROWN
THE REGRET SHE HAS IN HER HEART.

138
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,340
AND THE ONLY REASON
SHE CAN DO THAT

139
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,259
IS BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT HUMANS DO.

140
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,887
HUMANS...DO IT.

141
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,971
LOCKON,

142
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,307
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU KNOW ABOUT ME?

143
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:54,933
HMM?

144
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,101
LISTEN GUYS,

145
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,435
MISS SUMERAGI JUST
GAVE ORDERS

146
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,687
FOR US TO STANDBY
IN THE CONTAINERS.

147
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,815
ROGER THAT.

148
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,276
TIERIA, LET ME GET SOMETHING
OFF MY CHEST.

149
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,070
NOW THAT THE TIDE
IS TURNING AGAINST US,

150
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,571
IT'S IMPORTANT

151
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,533
THAT THE FOUR GUNDAMS
COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER.

152
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,284
LET'S DO THIS.

153
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,162
I GET YOUR POINT,

154
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,916
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
SAYING THIS TO SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

155
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,668
YEAH! MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,647
Marina:
EVEN IN THIS PLACE,

164
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,776
LITTLE FLOWERS
ARE STARTING TO BLOOM.

165
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,652
WITH THE SOLAR POWER,

166
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,654
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
WILL REVIVE.

167
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,407
I'M CERTAIN
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.

168
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,911
MARINA.

169
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,329
THE BEST THING IS,

170
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,999
THESE CHANGES MEAN
YOU WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

171
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,709
(Gasps)

172
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,712
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH, SORAN.

175
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,268
IT WAS ALL JUST A DREAM.

176
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,564
BUT WHY ABOUT MARINA ISMAIL?

177
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,944
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
DO I WANT TO QUIT?

178
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,489
IS MY MIND REALLY SET ON

179
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,241
QUITTING?

180
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,663

HOW'D THEY KNOW
WE WERE COMING FOR THEM?!

THAT'S ONE DOWN!

WE ONLY TOOK OUT ONE WITH
THE HIGH‐MEGA?!

192
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,404
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BETRAYED US.

193
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,905
Johann:
OR PERHAPS,

00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,158
YOU HAD ALWAYS INTENDED

EVEN DETECTED

00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,486
BY THE E‐SENSOR
UNTIL NOW MEANS...

THERE ISN'T A JOURNALIST

WITH YOUR SISTER
DECIDING TO JOIN OUR COMPANY.

230
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:13,530
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED BY
A COMPANY HE WAS INVESTIGATING.

231
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,115
HE WENT TO PRISON
FOR THAT.

YEAH, I KNOW.

233

MY SISTER SAID THAT WHEN
SHE SAW HIM ON VISITING DAYS,

234
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,790
HE WOULD OFTEN SAY THIS TO HER.

THEN STRING THEM ALL TOGETHER,

MY SISTER WAS INVESTIGATING?!

WE WERE GOING TO
LAUNCH AN ATTACK?

DOESN'T MATTER TO ME!
I'VE NEVER LOST A MOCK BATTLE.

HAVE STOPPED MOVING!
