00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,992
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

164
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,453
WE TOO ARE
BOUND BY CONFIDENTIALITY.

165
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,954
AWWW TOO BAD.

166
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,289
HMM.

167
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,750
I'D LIKE TO KNOW... WHERE YOU GOT
YOUR SOLAR REACTORS,

168
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,376
YOUR GN
DRIVES FROM?

169
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,545
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT EITHER.

170
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,255
ONCE AGAIN,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

171
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,341
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHY DID
YOU EVEN BOTHER COMING HERE?

172
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,010
WE JUST WANTED
TO PAY OUR RESPECTS

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,720
TO A BUNCH OF HAS‐BEEN
MEISTERS

174
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,513
WHO TOTALLY GOT
THEIR ASSES HANDED TO THEM

175
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
BY SOME ANTIQUE
MOBILE SUITS.

176
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,141
WATCH YOUR MOUTH!

177
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,435
AH, I'M JUST
KIDDING! RELAX!

178
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,603
(Growls)

179
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,647
I'M SUDDENLY FEELING ILL.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

180
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,066
SEND VEDA A REPORT
ON THIS LATER.

181
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,443
YES, I'LL DO THAT.

182
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,865
BOY, HE'S PRETTY.

183
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,242
IF HE WAS A GIRL,
I'D BE ALL OVER HIM.

184
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,368
ENOUGH MICHAEL.

185
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,620
YEAH, YEAH...

186
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,289
LIKE, JOHANN...
THIS IS SO BORING.

187
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,416
I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT AND
EXPLORE THE SHIP, OKAY?

188
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,918
WOULD THAT
BE ALRIGHT?

189
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,461
HUH?
UH, SURE.

190
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,257
WANT TO COME
WITH ME?

191
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,343
WANT TO COME?

192
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,764
HUH?

193
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,058
YOU BETTER NOT PISS ME OFF.
YOU HEAR ME?

194
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,648
HMM.

195
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,197
ANYWAY, AT LEAST
ANSWER ME THIS, PLEASE...

196
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,367
YOU HAVE THESE GUNDAMS BUT WHAT
DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH THEM?

197
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,702
THAT'S EASY.
WE WILL ERADICATE WAR.

198
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,371
REALLY?

199
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,915
WE ARE NO DIFFERENT
THAN YOU...

200
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,708
WE ALL SEEK
THE SAME GOAL

201
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,168
WE ARE ALL
GUNDAM MEISTERS.

202
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,838
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO
JOIN FORCES?

203
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,757
DUMB‐ASS!
AS IF WE'D JOIN YOU!

204
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,259
OUR TURN'S COME AROUND
BECAUSE YOU GUYS

205
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,219
ARE ONLY DOING
TOUCHY‐FEELY INTERVENTIONS

206
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,512
LIKE A BUNCH OF PANSIES!

207
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,805
AND JUST WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

208
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,932
IT MEANS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

209
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,892
YOU CAN'T BE COUNTED ON.

210
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,687
RIGHT? YOU'RE A DEFECTIVE
REBUILT SOLDIER BOY.

211
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,855
WHAT?

212
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,773
OH? YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

213
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,149
HUH!

214
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,444
TERRIBLY SORRY. I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY BROTHER'S RUDENESS.

215
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,780
HOWEVER,
IT APPEARS THAT THOSE

216
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,490
WHO GIVE US
OUR MISSION ORDERS

217
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,159
ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE SOME
UNSETTLING DOUBTS

218
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,204
CONCERNING THE WAY YOU EXECUTE
YOUR ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

219
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,124
DOES THIS MEAN ALL OF US
ARE BEING DISMISSED?

220
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,834
PLEASE CONTINUE WITH
YOUR OPERATIONS

221
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,127
AS YOU
HAVE IN THE PAST.

222
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,837
IN THE MEAN TIME...

223
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,132
WE'LL CONDUCT INTERVENTIONS
ACCORDING TO OUR OWN JUDGMENT.

224
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,135
IS YOUR INDEPENDENT TEAM
A NECESSARY COMPONENT

225
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,179
FOR THE COMPLETION OF AEOLIA
SCHENBERG'S OVERALL PLAN?

226
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,806
LET'S WAIT AND SEE.

227
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
I BELIEVE THE ANSWER TO
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS

228
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,437
WILL BECOME CLEAR WHEN YOU SEE
THE ACTIONS WE'LL BE TAKING.

229
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,192
WHO GAVE PEOPLE
LIKE THAT GUNDAMS?

230
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,738
IN ANY CASE, I NEED TO VERIFY
THIS INFORMATION WITH VEDA.

231
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,489
HUH?

232
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,492
VEDA'S TERMINAL UNIT!
IT'S WIDE OPEN!

233
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,707
(Machinery humming)

234
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,918
Tieria:
WHO'S IN THERE?

235
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,590
HOW DID YOU GET
IN HERE?

236
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,758
(Chuckles)

237
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,469
(Gasps)

238
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,140
I JUST WANDERED IN.

239
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,558
(Gasps)

240
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,060
WHO ARE YOU?

241
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,020
JUST WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS?

242
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,521
(Giggles)

243
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,315
THAT'S A SECRET!

244
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,529
Christina:
(Sighs)

245
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,490
WELL, THERE THEY GO.

246
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,076
THEY ONLY TOLD US
WHAT THEY FELT LIKE TELLING US.

247
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,329
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT JOHANN
GUY IS SURE SOMETHING ELSE.

248
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,081
WHAT?
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

249
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
HEY! WHEN DID YOU FIND
THE TIME TO GET A PHOTO?

250
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,669
I HAVE MY WAYS.

251
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,045
(Chuckles)

252
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,047
Lockon:
YOU THINK IT WAS OKAY TO
JUST LET THEM GO?

253
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,550
WE KEPT ASKING, BUT WE REALLY
DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING.

254
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,718
THAT'S NOT
QUITE TRUE.

255
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,719
YO!

256
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,929
HEY, OLD MAN.

257
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,056
WHILE YOU GUYS
WERE CHATTING IT UP IN HERE,

258
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,600
I WAS BUSY DOING AN INSPECTION
OF THAT THRONE UNIT OF THEIRS.

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,853
HUH! NICELY DONE,
TACTICAL FORECASTER!

260
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,023
MAKE SURE YOU SUBMIT YOUR REPORT
ON AN ISOLATED TERMINAL.

261
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,859
DON'T ENTER
ANY OF THIS INTO VEDA.

262
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,486
HMM!

263
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,821
ROGER THAT, MA'AM.

264
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,368
BIG BROTHER...
BIG BROTHER...

265
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,999
NENA. THAT PILOT OF
THE EXIA, SETSUNA?

266
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,042
JUST WHAT DO YOU FIND
SO GREAT ABOUT HIM ANYWAY?

267
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,544
HE'S A REAL CUTIE!

268
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,546
IT'S LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT FOR ME.

269
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,839
IS THAT SO?

270
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,466
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HIM,
I'M SHOOTING HIM DOWN.

271
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,844
MISSION RECEIVED!
MISSION RECEIVED!

272
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,178
WHAT, ALREADY?

273
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,556
THEY SURE DIDN'T
GIVE US MUCH OF A REST!

274
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,559
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD
WE MEAN BUSINESS.

275
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,311
THAT CELESTIAL BEING
IS DEADLY SERIOUS.

276
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,650
THANK YOU FOR THIS VALUABLE
INFORMATION, RIBBONS.

277
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,402
EVERY DAY I THANK GOD

278
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,237
THAT I WAS FORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO MEET YOU.

279
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,739
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED...

280
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,158
THAT'S THE REAL REASON
YOU PICKED ME UP, ISN'T IT?

281
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,494
OH NO. THAT ENCOUNTER
WAS DESTINY.

282
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,788
AND, MY BECOMING
AN OBSERVER

283
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,583
FOR CELESTIAL BEING
WAS FATE AS WELL.

284
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,585
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WITH THE WORLD?

285
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,628
I WON'T DO ANYTHING.

286
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,630
I AM AN OBSERVER.

287
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,216
I AM... SOMEONE WHO
SIMPLY WANTS TO WATCH

288
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,469
THE WORLD
AS IT REFORMS.

289
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,139
Louise:
REGULAR EXAMS ARE
FINALLY OVER AND DONE WITH!

290
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,099
THAT WAS EXHAUSTING!

291
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,018
AND I HAD TO WORK
DURING EXAMS TOO!

292
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,562
YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN
SOME TIME OFF BEFOREHAND.

293
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,147
I'M SURPRISED
YOU'D SAY THAT!

294
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,857
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

295
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,983
OH, NEVER MIND.

296
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984
WHAT?

297
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,569
SO, I WANTED TO ASK YOU,

298
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,071
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ON YOUR BREAK?

299
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,947
MAYBE THERE'S A MOVIE
YOU WANT TO GO SEE?

300
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,866
UH... SORRY.

301
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,285
YOU SEE, I'M GOING BACK TO
SPAIN FOR A LITTLE BIT.

302
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,996
I'M GOING TO
GO TO MY COUSIN'S WEDDING.

303
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,290
IS THAT SO...

304
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,000
THEN HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD TIME!

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,043
YEAH!

306
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,252
DON'T CHEAT ON ME.

307
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,545
WHAT WAS THAT?

308
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,089
DON'T CHEAT ON ME!

309
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,632
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

310
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,011
(Sighs)

311
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,055
YOU LOOK TIRED,
MISS KINUE.

312
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,100
MY RESEARCH KEEPS HITTING
ALL THESE DEAD ENDS.

313
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,601
HEAR THE LATEST?

314
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,812
THE THREE BLOCS
JUST RELEASED A STATEMENT.

315
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,065
A TOTAL OF 87 MOBILE SUITS
WERE HEAVILY DAMAGED.

316
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,235
THEY'RE SAYING OVER
TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

317
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,653
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

318
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,072
ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY FROM
A SOLDIER ON THE SCENE,

319
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,407
IT SEEMS SOME NEW GUNDAMS
APPEARED ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

320
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,826
HUH?

321
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,661
THERE'RE SOME NEW GUNDAMS?

322
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,163
THE INFORMATION IS STILL
UNCONFIRMED,

323
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,873
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
CELESTIAL BEING WAS

324
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,542
HIDING A COUPLE ACES
UP THEIR SLEEVE!

325
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,211
WHAT ABOUT THE SOLDIER'S NAME
AND ARMY, DO YOU REMEMBER?

326
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,214
WELL, THIS WAS JUST A RUMOR
FROM MR. IKEDA.

327
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,465
MAYBE HE'D‐‐

328
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,176
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT RIGHT NOW!
PLEASE.

329
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,594
CONSIDER IT DONE.

330
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,058
Graham:
NOT ONLY DID WE FAIL TO CARRY
OUT OUR APPOINTED MISSION,

331
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,270
BUT WE ALLOWED THREE SKILLED
FLAG FIGHTERS TO FALL IN COMBAT.

332
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,064
I'M A COMPLETE FAILURE AS A
SQUADRON COMMANDER.

333
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,483
IT COULDN'T BE HELPED.

334
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,944
THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREDICT
THAT NEW GUNDAMS WOULD SHOW UP

335
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,237
TO TIP THE BALANCE.

336
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,698
AND OUR MACHINES ARE JUST
TOO BADLY OUT‐MATCHED.

337
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,116
IF ONLY
WE HAD SOMETHING

338
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,034
THAT COULD COMPETE
WITH THE GUNDAMS.

339
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,370
THE FLAG IS OUR MILITARY'S
STATE‐OF‐THE‐ART MACHINE!

340
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,081
LOOK, I KNOW THAT.
BUT STILL‐‐

341
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,458
DARYL, REMEMBER,
THEY CALL US FLAG FIGHTERS!

342
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,043
SHOW SOME PRIDE, MAN!

343
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,003
(Phone ringing)

344
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,421
HMM?

345
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,548
GRAHAM HERE.

346
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,551
WHAT? WE'VE GOT
UNKNOWN MACHINES

347
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,927
ENTERING THE
ATMOSPHERE?

348
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,262
ARE THEY GUNDAMS?

349
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,140
WELL, THEN WHAT'S THEIR
DESTINATION POINT?

350
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,558
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

351
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,856
IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT

352
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,609
AND THE GUNDAMS'
ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS

353
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,777
UTILIZE TOPOLOGICAL DEFECTS

354
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,905
THEN EVERYTHING
WOULD LOGICALLY FALL INTO
PLACE.

355
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,115
IT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY

356
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,201
THERE ARE ONLY
A FEW OF THESE GUNDAMS,

357
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,619
AND WHY
THEY NEEDED MORE THAN

358
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,245
TWO HUNDRED YEARS
TO DEVELOP THEM.

359
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,998
THE ONLY ENVIRONMENT IN
WHICH SUCH AN ENERGY SYSTEM

360
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,833
COULD BE CONSTRUCTED
IS A JOVIAN ONE....

361
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,293
(Gasps)

362
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,046
120 YEARS AGO THERE WAS THAT

363
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,256
MANNED EXPEDITION
TO JUPITER!

364
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,718
WAS THAT PROJECT RELATED TO
THE DEVELOPMENT OF GUNDAMS?

365
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,763
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN
AEOLIA SCHENBERG'S TRUE GOAL

366
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,723
ISN'T THE ERADICATION OF WAR,

367
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,309
BUT SOMETHING ELSE
ALTOGETHER...

368
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,645
HUH?
WHAT HAPPENED?

369
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,610
WHAT?

370
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,945
(Alarm wailing)

371
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,446
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

372
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,823
THIS IS AN ALERT FROM
THE OBSERVATION ROOM!

373
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,742
THREE MOBILE SUITS,
POSSIBLY GUNDAMS,

374
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,371
ARE APPROACHING
THE BASE FROM DIRECTION
EW‐9877.

375
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,164
OH MY...

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,670
(Alarm wailing)

377
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,047
REQUEST REINFORCEMENTS
FROM ALL BASES!

378
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,258
WE HAVE VISUALS
ON THE UNKNOWNS!

379
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,425
DAMN, THEY'RE FAST!

380
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,471
ARE THOSE...

381
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,890
THE NEW GUNDAMS?

382
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,475
Johann:
WE'VE REACHED
THE TARGET POINT.

383
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,560
NENA,
DOCK WITH MY MACHINE.

384
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,229
WE'LL SMASH EVERYTHING
AT ONCE.

385
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,230
Nena:
ROGER!

386
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,242
Nena:
NOW TRANSFERRING HIGH‐DENSITY
GN PARTICLES!

387
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,373
GOOD HEAVENS!

388
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,375
COULD I BE
THEIR REAL TARGET?

389
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,794
GN PARTICLE TRANSFER,
NOW COMPLETE!

390
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,213
ROGER THAT.
THRONE EINS...

391
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,632
GN MEGA LAUNCHER, FIRING.

392
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,721
(Boom)

393
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,849
(Screaming)

394
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,101
(Launcher blasting)

395
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,564
(Buildings shatter)

396
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,154
(Screaming)

397
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,323
(Boom)

398
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,491
(Launcher blasting)

399
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,745
(Glass shatters)

400
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,958
(Boom)

401
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,088
Michael:
ALL RIGHT!
THAT WAS AWESOME!

402
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,675
WAY TO GO, JOHANN! THAT WAS
LIKE FREAKING BRUTAL, DUDE!

403
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,676
(Alarm beeping)

404
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
HUH?

405
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,596
(Laughing):
HERE THEY COME...

406
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,140
A WHOLE LOT OF SMALL FRY!

407
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,061
Daryl:
CAPTAIN, THERE ARE
THREE NEW UNITS!

408
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,437
Graham:
YEAH, I SEE THEM...

409
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,024
THEY WIPED OUT OUR BASE...

410
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,025
Katagiri:
GRAHAM...

411
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:11,859
(Gasps)

412
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
KATAGIRI!

413
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,279
THE PROFESSOR...

414
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,198
THE PROFESSOR'S GONE.

415
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,616
THEY KILLED HIM?

416
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,785
(Growling)

417
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,496
YOU MURDERING BASTARDS
ARE GOING TO PAY!

418
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,289
TIME TO DIE,
GUNDAMS!

419
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,332
Johann:
PREPARE TO WITHDRAW.

420
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,334
Michael:
AW, DO WE HAVE TO?

421
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,211
AT LEAST LET ME HAVE SOME FUN,
JOHANN!

422
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,213
JUST A LITTLE!

423
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,882
RELAX, IT'LL BE OVER SOON.

424
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,842
I'M JUST GOING TO SMASH YOU
AND DESTROY YOU

425
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,427
AND THEN
WIPE YOU ALL OUT!

426
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,429
FLY, MY FANGS!

427
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,644
WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE?

428
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,436
(Gasps)

429
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,438
THAT BASTARD!

430
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,656
HOWARD, NO!

431
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,575
(Growling)

432
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,620
I'LL SHOW YOU, GUNDAM!

433
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,205
(Aggressive yell)

434
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
Michael:
(Gasps)

435
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,084
(Metal clashing)

436
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,211
Howard:
THIS IS THE POWER
OF THE FLAG!

437
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,295
(Gasps)

438
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,589
I'M IN TROUBLE
IF HE KEEPS THIS UP...

439
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,427
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!

440
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,554
(Howard grunts in pain)

441
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,430
HOWARD!

442
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,223
HOWARD, GET OUT OF THERE!

443
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,643
(Metal crashing)

444
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,820
CAPTAIN, I'M PROUD...
OF THE FLAGS...

445
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,822
(Boom)

446
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,121
Michael:
THESE ARE MY FANGS!

447
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,205
Johann:
HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH?

448
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,123
WE'RE WITHDRAWING!

449
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,791
AW, JOHANN...

450
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,710
WE HAVE ANOTHER MISSION
TO DEAL WITH.

451
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,838
GUNDAM MEISTERS ARE
BUSY PEOPLE AFTER ALL.

452
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,631
Michael:
YEAH, YEAH.

453
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,468
(Emotional)
CAPTAIN!

454
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,094
NOT WITHOUT A PLAN!

455
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,221
YES, SIR.

456
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,765
(Heavy breathing)

457
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,519
THE PROFESSOR... AND HOWARD.

458
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,438
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GOING TO DISHONOR ME

459
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,274
BY RUBBING MY FACE
IN THE DIRT?

460
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,652
GUNDAMS!

461
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,905
Lockon:
THEY ATTACKED
AN AMERICAN MILITARY BASE?

462
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,072
FOR WHAT REASON?

463
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,365
IT'S NOT CLEAR.

464
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,118
VEDA DOESN'T HAVE ANY
INFORMATION ON IT EITHER.

465
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,703
THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT.

466
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
AW GREAT. THAT'S
GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY

467
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,875
START SAYING BAD THINGS
ABOUT CELESTIAL BEING.

468
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,669
Setsuna:
ARE THEY MEISTERS?

469
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,171
THEY SAID SO...

470
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,924
BUT ARE THOSE GUYS REALLY
GUNDAM MEISTERS?

471
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,637
Saji:
YOU TAKE CARE NOW,
LOUISE.

472
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,306
SAY HI TO YOUR
MOM AND DAD FOR ME.

473
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,390
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S ABOUT‐‐

474
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,392
NEVER MIND
ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF.

475
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,310
WHAT?

476
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,186
MMM...

477
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,812
UH... WHAT'S UP?

478
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,481
KISS ME GOODBYE,
SAJI.

479
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,398
WHAT?

480
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,900
KISS ME GOODBYE!

481
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,276
(Nervous mumbling)

482
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,153
I CAN'T DO IT!

483
