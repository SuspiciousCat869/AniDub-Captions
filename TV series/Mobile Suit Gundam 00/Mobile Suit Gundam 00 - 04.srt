1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,090
AS A RESULT OF CELESTIAL
BEING'S ARMED INTERVENTION

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,926
ON THE ISLAND OF CEYLON,

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,221
148 OF OUR BRAVE AND
NOBLE SOLDIERS

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,056
LOST THEIR LIVES.

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,809
ALTHOUGH THEY SPEAK OF
ELIMINATING CONFLICT,

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,436
CELESTIAL BEING'S ACTIONS

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,438
ARE NOTHING
MORE THAN TERRORISM,

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,023
PERPETRATED IN
A BLATANT ATTEMPT

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,692
TO DISRUPT
THE NATIONAL ORDER.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,945
WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE,

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,988
INTEND TO TAKE A FIRM STANCE

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,450
AND CONFRONT
THEIR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,118
THEY SURE
DON'T LIKE US.

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,204
IT'S THE OBVIOUS
REACTION.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,581
BUT ISN'T THE HUMAN REFORM
LEAGUE JUST GOING TO

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,209
BUILD UP ITS MILITARY IN
RESPONSE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING?

17
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,961
IF THAT'S WHAT
THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO

18
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,754
THEN WE'LL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RESPOND

19
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,714
WITH MORE
ARMED INTERVENTIONS.

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,758
THE ELIMINATION OF WAR.

21
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,803
YES. FOR THAT IS

22
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,972
CELESTIAL BEING'S
TRUE GOAL.

23
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,015
Chairman:
AND TO STOP CELESTIAL BEING

24
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,226
FROM PERPETRATING FURTHER
VIOLENCE,

25
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,478

ALSO BE IMPLEMENTING NEW...

HAVE BEEN DEPLETED.

32
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,354
THREE GROUPS OF NATIONS HAVE
CREATED ORBITAL ELEVATORS

33
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,856
AND A SOLAR
POWER GENERATION SYSTEM,

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,483
GIVING HUMANITY ACCESS

TO A NEARLY INFINITE
SOURCE OF ENERGY.

36
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,283
HOWEVER, TO FURTHER THEIR OWN
PRESTIGE AND PROSPERITY,

37
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,452
EACH GROUP OF NATIONS
INSISTS ON PLAYING

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,788
A GRAND ZERO‐SUM GAME.

39
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,127
YES, EVEN IN THE 24TH CENTURY,

40
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,797
HUMANITY IS STILL UNABLE
TO LIVE TOGETHER AS ONE.

41
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,010
BUT NOW A SMALL BAND OF
PEOPLE HAVE ARISEN

42
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,013
TO CHALLENGE THIS WORLD.

43
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,432
CELESTIAL BEING.

44
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,350
THE PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,353
THAT POSSESSES THE MOBILE
SUITS CALLED...GUNDAMS.

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,815
IT HAS BEGUN CARRYING OUT
OPERATIONS THAT TRANSCEND RACE,

47
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,608
NATIONALITY AND RELIGION

48
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,902
IN A QUEST
TO ERADICATE WAR.

49
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,781
AND NOW ONCE AGAIN,

50
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,783
THE GUNDAM MEISTERS ARE
ABOUT TO BEGIN

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,618
A NEW MISSION THAT
HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THEM.

52
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
(Sirens wail)

53
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,254
(Boom)

54
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,632
WELL PRINCESS,

55
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,384
IT APPEARS THAT
THE WAVE OF TERRORISM

56
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,760
HAS FINALLY
REACHED THE CITY.

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,845
INDEED.

58
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,972
WE NEED TO PUSH
THE REFORMS THROUGH

59
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,433
BEFORE THE MODERATES DECIDE
TO JOIN THEM.

60
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,101
I AM AWARE OF THAT.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,562
OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN
RELIANT ON FOSSIL FUELS

62
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,689
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

63
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,816
TO REVIVE WE MUST
APPROACH THE NATIONS

64
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,485
THAT CONTROL
THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM.

65
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,320
AND ASK FOR AID.

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,363
BUT SINCE OUR COUNTRY
DIDN'T PARTICIPATE

67
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,364
IN THE CONSTRUCTION

68
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,283
OF THE THREE
ORBITAL ELEVATORS,

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,701
WE DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO

70
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,703
ACCESS
THEIR ENERGY SUPPLY.

71
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,705
NOW THAT OUR
PRECIOUS OIL IS SUBJECT

72
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,124
TO SEVERE EXPORT
RESTRICTIONS,

73
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,210
WHY WOULD ANY OTHER
NATION BE WILLING

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,045
TO HELP US FOR
NOTHING?

75
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,756
BUT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
RESTORED THE MONARCHY

76
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,759
AND PUT ME IN POWER
TO FIND THAT ASSISTANCE.

77
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,637
THEREFORE, THERE'S ONLY
ONE TASK AHEAD OF ME.

78
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,640
STILL, THE IMMEDIATE
SITUATION IS DIRE.

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,725
IF THE COUNTRY DESCENDS
FURTHER INTO CHAOS,

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,561
THEY WILL COME.

81
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,147
THAT PRIVATE ARMED FORCE...

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,857
CALLED
CELESTIAL BEING.

83
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,109
(Gasps)

84
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,862
CELESTIAL BEING WILL COME...

85
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,656
(Bang)

86
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,664
(Sparking)

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,668
ALLELUJAH,
DID YOU HEAR?

88
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,503
THE REAL I. R. A.
DECLARED A CEASEFIRE.

89
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,754
YEAH.

90
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,090
THAT DECLARATION MIGHT
GET SOME COUNTRIES

91
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,800
TO LOOK AT US MORE
FAVORABLY.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,843
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING
TO LAST FOR TOO LONG.

93
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,637
THEY ONLY
MADE THE FIRST MOVE

94
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,764
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
WE'D INTERVENE.

95
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,599
IF WE WEREN'T THERE TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THEM,

96
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,935
THEY'D JUST GO AHEAD
AND START UP ALL OVER AGAIN.

97
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,353
I KNOW THEY WOULD.

98
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,188
OUR GOAL IS
TO ELIMINATE WAR

99
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,691
AND THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE
AN EASY THING TO DO.

100
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,150
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD
HIT THE RACK

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,777
AND GET SOME REST
WHILE YOU CAN.

102
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
WE'LL BE
BUSY AGAIN REAL SOON.

103
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,243
REALIZING A PERMANENT PEACE...

104
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,163
THAT'S WHY THE
GUNDAMS WERE CREATED.

105
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,919
WELL, HOW WAS IT,
COLONEL?

106
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,131
YOU TRADED BLOWS
WITH THE GUNDAM, DIDN'T YOU?

107
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,173
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR
HONEST OPINION

108
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,800
ON ITS CAPABILITIES.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,051
I'LL DO MY BEST, SIR.

110
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,262
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS
I DON'T BELIEVE

111
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,514
THERE'S A MOBILE SUIT
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

112
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,807
THAT CAN STAND UP

113
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,101
TO A GUNDAM
IN A FAIR FIGHT.

114
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,186
ITS PERFORMANCE
IS THAT OVERWHELMING?

115
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,022
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION, SIR.

116
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,026
THEN CALLING YOU DOWN HERE WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

117
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,279
COLONEL SMIRNOFF, YOU ARE
TO ACQUIRE A GUNDAM FOR US,

118
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,197
BEFORE THE UNION
OR THE A. E. U.

119
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,324
SIR!

120
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,076
I AM FORMING A TEAM
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

121
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,329
I'LL LEAVE THE SELECTION
OF PERSONNEL TO YOU.

122
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,331
BUT THERE IS ONE SOLDIER

123
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,625
I'D LIKE TO
ENTRUST YOU WITH.

124
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,126
PLEASE COME IN.

125
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,465
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

126
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,551
I AM LIEUTENANT SOMA PERIES,
SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE.

127
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,180
DISPATCHED FROM THE
SUPER‐HUMAN INSTITUTE LABS.

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,265
SUPER‐HUMAN?

129
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,684
BUT SIR, I THOUGHT THAT
PROJECT WAS‐‐

130
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,312
APPARENTLY, THEY CONTINUED TO
CARRY IT OUT IN SECRET.

131
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,730
THE HIGHER UPS BELIEVE

132
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,149
IT MAY WELL BE OUR TRUMP CARD
AGAINST THE GUNDAMS.

133
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,776
AS OF TODAY,
I HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED

134
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,903
TO SERVE IN YOUR ELITE UNIT,
COLONEL.

135
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,198
IT IS A GREAT HONOR
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

136
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,158
YOU ARE MUCH
TOO YOUNG FOR THIS.

137
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,501
(Laughter)

138
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,086
BUT IT WAS
TOTALLY HILARIOUS!

139
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,712
YEAH, NO KIDDING!

140
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,089
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

141
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,091
(Laughter continues)

142
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
(Boom)

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
(Screaming)

144
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,613
(Heavy breath echoes)

145
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,371
OH, YEAH!

146
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,039
NO WAY, REALLY?!

147
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,041
(Laughter)

148
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,048
HEY, IT'S YOU!

149
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,092
SAJI CROSSROAD.

150
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,176
THAT'S IT.

151
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,220
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME!

152
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,221
WHO IS THIS?

153
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,223
OH, HE LIVES
NEXT DOOR TO ME.

154
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,599
HE'S, UM...

155
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,310
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

156
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,688
Eifman:
I'VE REINFORCED THE BACKPACK
AND THE JOINTS.

157
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,690
AND I'VE APPLIED
AN ANTI‐BEAM COATING

158
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,108
TO THE UNIT'S SURFACE.

159
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,652
FOR WEAPONRY I PROCURED
A NEW PROTOTYPE RIFLE

160
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,738
FROM THE IRIS CORPORATION.

161
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,614
IT'S MAGNIFICENT,
PROFESSOR.

162
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,825
BUT, EVEN WITH THE
ANTI‐G SYSTEM ACTIVATED,

163
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,410
YOU'LL BE FEELING
ABOUT 12GS

164
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,871
WHEN TURNING
AT FULL SPEED.

165
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,123
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS HOPING FOR.

166
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,377
SO! THIS IS
THE LIEUTENANT'S FLAG!

167
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,004
WARRANT OFFICER
HOWARD MASON,

168
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,797
MASTER SERGEANT
DARYL DODGE.

169
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,007
WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED

170
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,800
TO THE ANTI‐GUNDAM
INVESTIGATIVE TASK FORCE

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,385
AS PER
YOUR REQUEST, SIR!

172
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,887
AH, YOU CAME.

173
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,055
LET ME WELCOME YOU,
FLAG FIGHTERS!

174
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,058
DID YOU SEE THE NEWS
THIS AFTERNOON, DAVID?

175
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,810
THE COMMENTATOR
WAS MAKING SUGGESTIONS

176
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,437
ABOUT APPOINTING
CELESTIAL BEING

177
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,022
AS A KIND OF WORLD POLICE

178
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,232
OR SOMETHING
ALONG THOSE LINES!

179
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,610
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

180
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,321
AND UNLIKE THE UNITED NATIONS,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT!

181
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,614
(Scoffs)

182
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,533
MOST OF HUMANITY HAS
BLOOD ON ITS HANDS.

183
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,368
ALONG WITH ITS NATIONS.

184
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,538
I DOUBT ANYONE IS GOING TO BE
WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM.

185
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,790
(Knocking)

186
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,999
UH, MISTER PRESIDENT.

187
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,376
WE HAVE REPORTS THAT
TARIBIA IS GOING TO MAKE

188
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,920
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TOMORROW.

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,466
HMM...

190
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,718
Sumeragi:
VEDA, LET ME SEE
YOUR PREDICTION.

191
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,808
SO IT'S THE SAME AS MINE.

192
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,185
THERE ARE
TWELVE COUNTERPLANS.

193
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,812
NO MATTER WHICH ONE
WE CHOOSE,

194
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,773
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF RISK
ATTACHED TO EACH OF THEM.

195
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,526
WE KNOW WHAT HAS TO
BE DONE BUT IT'S SO HARD.

196
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,110
MISS SUMERAGI!

197
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,946
TARIBIA IS ON AIR MAKING
AN ANNOUNCEMENT RIGHT NOW!

198
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,202
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TARIBIA.

199
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,955
THE UNION IS A CONGRESS OF
OVER FIFTY COUNTRIES.

200
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,332
BUT IN FACT IT
FUNCTIONS AS A DICTATORSHIP

201
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,792
BY THE U. S.

202
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,752
WHICH CONTROLS THE DISTRIBUTION
OF SOLAR ENERGY...

203
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,172
DAVID, CALL A SPECIAL SESSION
OF THE UNION PARLIAMENT

204
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,508
AND ASSEMBLE THE REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE MAJOR NATIONS.

205
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,344
VERY WELL, SIR.

206
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,346
THEREFORE,
THE REPUBLIC OF TARIBIA

207
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,348
IS SECEDING FROM
THE UNION.

208
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,434
AND WE CLAIM INDEPENDENT
ACCESS TO THIS ENGERY!

209
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,938
IF ANY NATION BRINGS POLITICAL
OR MILITARY PRESSURE

210
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,566
TO BEAR IN
ORDER TO DENY US OUR CLAIM...

211
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,152
THEN WE SHALL RESPOND WITH
MILITARY ACTION!

212
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,612
OUR NATION
DEFIANTLY OPPOSES DOMINATION

213
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,614
BY THE DESPICABLE U. S.!

214
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,616
(Applause)

215
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,915
Shirin:
LOOKS LIKE TARIBIA'S
MAKING ITS MOVE.

216
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,500
THAT COUNTRY
HAS ALWAYS HAD

217
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,919
STRONG ANTI‐AMERICAN
SENTIMENTS.

218
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,671
BUT TO SECEDE FROM
THE UNION

219
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,506
AND DEMAND
THEIR ENERGY RIGHTS

220
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,674
LIKE THAT IS JUST‐‐

221
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,301
MAYBE IT'S POLITICAL
POSTURING

222
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,719
FOR THEIR
UPCOMING ELECTIONS.

223
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,137
NO WAY...

224
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,889
IF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
COUNTRIES AROUND THE ELEVATOR

225
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,515
TAKE A TURN FOR
THE WORSE,

226
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,933
IT'LL ONLY INTERFERE

227
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,935
WITH THE OPERATION
OF THE SOLAR POWER SYSTEM.

228
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,187
OF COURSE,
AT THE REQUEST OF AMERICA,

229
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,773
THE UNION IS GOING TO BECOME
INVOLVED MILITARILY.

230
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,775
AND THAT IS
EXACTLY WHAT TARIBIA

231
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,153
IS PREDICTING WILL HAPPEN.

232
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,865
THEY KNOW IT.

233
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,075
LIEUTENANT, DO YOU KNOW
WHY TARIBIA

234
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,995
HAS DECIDED TO TAKE
SUCH A HARD‐LINE APPROACH?

235
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,247
IF THE UNION
TAKES MILITARY ACTION...

236
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,291
THEN THEY KNOW THAT
CELESTIAL BEING

237
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,375
WILL INTERVENE

238
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,835
IN ORDER TO PREVENT
A CONFLICT.

239
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,754
THAT'S IT EXACTLY.

240
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,673
WILL YOU ACCEPT THE INVITE,
GUNDAM, AND SHOW UP?

241
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,469
SO, YOU THINK TARIBIA IS TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF CELESTIAL BEING.

242
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,887
I'M JEALOUS OF THEM.

243
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,473
THE REASON THEY CAN TAKE
SUCH AN EXTORTIONIST,

244
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,891
HARD‐LINE APPROACH

245
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,102
IS BECAUSE OF THEIR PROXIMITY
TO THE ORBITAL ELEVATOR.

246
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,354
UNLIKE US,

247
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,230
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE
A CARD THEY CAN PLAY.

248
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,400
DO YOU THINK CELESTIAL BEING
WILL REALLY MAKE AN APPEARANCE?

249
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,652
WHO KNOWS?

250
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,528
BUT THE FUTURE
OF OUR OWN COUNTRY

251
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,780
MAY WELL
DEPEND ON HOW

252
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,033
CELESTIAL BEING DEALS
WITH TARIBIA.

253
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,077
THE FUTURE
OF OUR COUNTRY.

254
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,246
IT MEANS WE CAN TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEM, AS WELL.

255
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,166
(Sighs)

256
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,422
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW
WE'RE BEING MANIPULATED,

257
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,424
WE'LL STILL MAKE
OUR MOVE.

258
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,177
BECAUSE THAT IS
WHAT CELESTIAL BEING DOES.

259
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,517
Everyone:
HMM?

260
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,936
PREPARE TO BEGIN
THE INTERVENTION.

261
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,730
CONTACT THE GUNDAM
MEISTERS IMMEDIATELY.

262
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,443
HAVING RECEIVED APPROVAL

263
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,820
FROM A MAJORITY OF
ITS PARLIAMENT,

264
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,655
THE UNION HAS MADE THE DECISION

265
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,573
TO DISPATCH A MILITARY FORCE
TO TARIBIA.

266
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,325
FURTHERMORE,
AMERICA HAS ANNOUNCED

267
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,160
THAT IT WILL BE SENDING AN
INDEPENDENT FORCE OF ITS OWN.

268
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,745
(Thinking)
TARIBIA...

269
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
HARO! LET'S GO!

270
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,925
ROGER! ROGER!

271
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,138

00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,668
COMMENCING INTERVENTION.

277
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,337
DYNAMES, LOCKON STRATOS,

278
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,505
I'M GOING TO
SHOOT THEM UP!

279
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,608
EXIA, SETSUNA F. SEIEI,
HEADING OUT.

280
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,406
WE'RE FINALLY GOING
TO MEET THESE GUNDAMS.

281
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,158
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
THIS, LIEUTENANT!

282
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,951
YEAH, ME TOO!

283
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,496
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW
THIS CUSTOM FLAG HERE

284
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,039
STANDS UP
AGAINST THE GUNDAMS.

285
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,751
BECAUSE, IT IS VITAL THAT
IT STANDS UP TO THEM!

286
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,590
Feldt:
THE UNION FLEET
AND AMERICA'S SECOND FLEET

287
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,259
HAVE ARRIVED OFF
THE COAST OF TARIBIA.

288
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
Christina:
AIR FORCES HAVE ALSO SCRAMBLED

289
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,429
FROM THE BRAZILIAN
GARRISON BASE.

290
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,014
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY
HAVE CONTROL OF THE AIRSPACE

291
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,058
OVER THE MAJOR TARIBIAN CITIES.

292
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,810
Sumeragi:
WHAT ABOUT THE TARIBIANS?

293
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,311
Christina:
THEY'RE CONCENTRATING
GROUND MOBILE SUITS

294
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,854
AROUND THREE
OF THEIR MAIN CITIES.

295
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,358
Lasse:
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
I EXPECTED.

296
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,485
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE
DOING, MISS SUMERAGI?

297
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,112
IT'S OBVIOUS.

298
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,155
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE REALLY CAN DO.

299
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,165
UH...!

300
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,793
CAPTAIN!
A GUNDAM JUST SHOWED UP!

301
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,794
(Grunts)

302
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:23,589
SO THAT'S A GUNDAM!

303
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,841
Pilot:
THIS IS BLUE SHARK.

304
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,801
I HAVE A VISUAL ON
TWO GUNDAMS!

305
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,219
THEY'RE HEADING FOR
THE CAPITAL.

306
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,304
PREPARE TO INTERCEPT!

307
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,850
LOOKS LIKE COMMUNICATIONS
ARE BEING JAMMED.

308
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,018
THE GUNDAMS MUST BE
RESPONSIBLE.

309
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,855
MR. PRIME MINISTER,

310
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,523
CELESTIAL BEING
JUST APPEARED.

311
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,650
SO, THEY DID SHOW UP.

312
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,903
Sailor:
THE GUNDAMS HAVE SPLIT UP.

313
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,197
WE THINK EACH ONE IS
HEADING FOR A MAJOR CITY.

314
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,407
WHAT ARE THEY PLANNING?

315
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,783
ARE THEY
GOING TO INTERVENE

316
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,952
AGAINST BOTH AMERICA
AND THE UNION?!

317
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,124
IF CELESTIAL BEING
ACTUALLY INTERVENES,

318
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,585
IT'LL BE HELPING
THE HARD‐LINERS IN TARIBIA

319
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,003
WITH THEIR AGENDA.

320
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,422
BUT LET'S SAY
THEY DON'T INTERVENE.

321
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,840
IF THEY STAND BACK

322
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,675
AND ALLOW THE
UNION ARMED FORCES TO ATTACK,

323
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,218
THEIR DOCTRINE
OF ELIMINATING WAR

324
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,095
WILL BE HOPELESSLY COMPROMISED.

325
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,763
Newscaster:
IT IS EXPECTED THAT
CELESTIAL BEING WILL MAKE

326
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,140
AN ARMED INTERVENTION
IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN REGION.

327
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,601
THE QUESTION IS WHICH
ONE ARE YOU GOING TO CHOOSE,

328
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,187
CELESTIALBEING?

329
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,607
Newscaster:
HOW WILL CELESTIAL BEING MAKE
THEIR ARMED INTERVENTION?

330
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,327
COMMENCE MISSION.

331
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,329
(Shots firing)

332
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,791
WHAT THE...?

333
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,126
IS THIS THE START OF
THE UNION ATTACK?

334
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,127
(Beeping)

335
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,921
UH...

336
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,423
(Grunts)

337
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,091
A GUNDAM!

338
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,594
BUT... BUT WHY?!

339
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,138
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
YET TO DESERVE THIS!

340
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
Liu‐Mei:
CELESTIAL BEING'S
FOUNDER WAS QUITE CLEAR.

341
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,189
AEOLIA SHENBERG EVEN
MENTIONED IT

342
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,857
DURING HIS
DECLARATION.

343
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,651
TO THE MEMBERS
OF CELESTIAL BEING,

344
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,402
ALL COUNTRIES THAT
PROMOTE WAR

345
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,529
ARE LEGITIMATE TARGETS FOR
ARMED INTERVENTION.

346
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
I'VE DETERMINED THAT
TARIBIA IS PROMOTING WAR.

347
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,999
ELIMINATING TARGETS.

348
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,421
(Shots firing)

349
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,675
(Clang)

350
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,474
KYRIOS, NOW COMMENCING
INTERVENTION MISSION.

351
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,519
(Firing continues)

352
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,950
DYNAMES, TARGETED AND
READY TO FIRE.

353
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,451
(Beeping)

354
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,709
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US

355
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,711
WITHOUT OUR EXPRESS PERMISSION
IS NOT ALLOWED!

356
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,051
BUT THIS...
IT'S JUST SO ONE‐SIDED.

357
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,390
SIR, THE GUNDAMS ARE ENGAGING
THE TARIBIAN FORCES!

358
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,641
THEY'RE DOING WHAT?!

359
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,018
I SEE...

360
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,646
THE GUNDAMS ARE
ATTACKING OUR MILITARY.

361
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,232
GET ME PRESIDENT STEGMEYER
ON THE HOT LINE.

362
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,233
YES, SIR.

363
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,739
President:
IT SEEMS CELESTIAL BEING
HAS DETERMINED

364
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,490
THAT YOUR COUNTRY
IS A SOURCE OF CONFLICT.

365
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,744
CAUSING IT TO ATTACK YOU.

366
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,329
I SYMPATHIZE WITH
YOUR PLIGHT

367
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,497
AND I FEEL ITS
ACTIONS ARE REGRETTABLE.

368
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,378
OF COURSE,
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO REVERSE

369
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,630
YOUR DECISION TO SECEDE
FROM THE UNION,

370
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,841
WE WILL GLADLY
DEPLOY OUR ARMED FORCES

371
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,426
TO PROTECT YOUR COUNTRY.

372
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,013
I SEE. VERY WELL.

373
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,060
IN ORDER TO ENSURE
THE PROTECTION

374
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,436
OF THE REPUBLIC OF TARIBIA,

375
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,979
A NATION ALLIED
WITH US...

376
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,397
OUR MILITARY WILL LAUNCH

377
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,274
AN ATTACK ON
CELESTIAL BEING.

378
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,110
Christina:
THE AMERICAN MOBILE SUIT
TEAMS ARE TAKING OFF.

379
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,572
IT APPEARS THEY'RE ACTING TO
PROTECT TARIBIA, AS PREDICTED.

380
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,074
I SEE.

381
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,992
IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE MISSION PLAN,

382
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,912
EACH GUNDAM WILL WITHDRAW
AND FALL BACK TO A SAFE ZONE.

383
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,914
WHAT A COMPLETE FARCE!

384
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,374
JUST A MOMENT!

385
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,792
I HAVE A MACHINE THAT
IS CURRENTLY

386
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,959
CLOSING IN ON THE EXIA!

387
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,628
IT'S ONE OF
AMERICA'S FLAGS!

388
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,214
AMERICAN?
WHAT ARE THEY UP TO?

389
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,591
IT'S MORE THAN
TWICE AS FAST AS ITS SPECS.

390
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,176
AND ITS HEADING
FOR THE EXIA!

391
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,389
IT'S THAT FLAG AGAIN.

392
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,810
ANOTHER CHANCE
TO FIGHT THE GUNDAM!

393
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,188
THAT, MR. PRESIDENT,
WAS WELL PLAYED!

394
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,400
(Gasps)

395
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,406
(Grunts)

396
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,326
(Shots firing)

397
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,912
HE'S FAST!

398
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,916
(Bang)

399
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
GOT HIM!

400
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,008
Howard:
EXCELLENT, LIEUTENANT!

401
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,429
Graham:
HE GOT AWAY.

402
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,431
IN THE CUSTOM FLAG...

403
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,684
I WAS ABLE TO STAND UP
TO THE GUNDAM.

404
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,062
BUT THEN IT TURNED OUT
TO HAVE UNDERWATER CAPABILITY.

405
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,232
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE
TOO VERSATILE, GUNDAM.

406
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,451
I'M SHOCKED.

407
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,786
I NEVER EXPECTED THEM TO
ATTACK THE TARIBIANS.

408
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,622
IT LOOKS LIKE
BOTH TARIBIA AND AMERICA

409
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,708
EXPECTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

410
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,585
THEY EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN?

411
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,671
ONCE CELESTIAL BEING BEGAN
THEIR INTERVENTION,

412
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,840
TARIBIA IMMEDIATELY
BORROWED THE HELP

413
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,633
OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY.

414
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,552
(Gasps)

415
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,054
Shirin:
NOW, ANTI‐AMERICAN SENTIMENTS
WITHIN TARIBIA

416
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,056
WILL DIE DOWN AND AS A RESULT,

417
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,850
THEY CAN SUPPORT THE
U. S. LEADERSHIP

418
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,143
AS A MATTER OF POLICY.

419
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,145
THE CURRENT TARIBIAN
ADMINISTRATION

420
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,732
WILL HAVE AMERICAN AID AND
A MORE SECURE POWER BASE.

421
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,442
AND TO AVOID
TARIBIA'S FATE,

422
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,027
OTHER COUNTRIES WILL
THINK TWICE

423
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,445
BEFORE DECIDING TO IMPLEMENT

424
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,031
ANY OVERT
ANTI‐AMERICAN POLICIES.

425
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,282
(Sighs)

426
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,242
I JUST WONDER WHO
ACTUALLY BENEFITED

427
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,453
THE MOST
FROM THESE EVENTS?

428
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,997
IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS ...

429
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,417
THEN YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED
TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY.

430
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,377
MARINA ISMAIL,

431
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,130
PRINCESS ROYAL OF
THE KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN.

432
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,221
HEY, SIS, WHAT DOES
ALL THIS MEAN, ANYWAY?

433
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,516
CELESTIAL BEING ATTACKED
THE TARIBIAN ARMY.

434
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,560
BUT THAT COUNTRY DIDN'T EVEN
START A FIGHT OR ANYTHING.

435
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,895
YOU'RE RIGHT.

436
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,981
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING
TO END FIGHTING AND WAR...

437
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,816
BUT THEY STARTED
THIS ONE.

438
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,736
THAT JUST DOESN'T
SEEM RIGHT!

439
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,404
I HATE TO
TELL YOU SAJI,

440
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,782
BUT SOMETIMES THE WORLD
JUST ISN'T THAT SIMPLE.

441
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,995
NO, THE WORLD ISN'T
SIMPLE AT ALL.
