1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,839
THIS CELESTIAL
WHATCHAMACALLIT...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,634
IS TERRIBLE FOR BUSINESS.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,052
IF FOLKS HERE CAN'T COLLECT
THESE ROCKS,

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,137
THIS NATION'S
ECONOMY WILL GO BUST...

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,889
CARE TO GUESS HOW MANY
COUNTRIES AND INDUSTRIES

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,849
WILL BE AFFECTED BY THAT?

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,352
AS LONG AS THEY CAN
STOP WAR THEY DON'T REALLY

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,438
CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO
THE PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,274
BOSS! YOU GOT A CALL
FROM THE PMC TRUST.

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,153
HELLO, ALI AL‐SAACHEZ HERE.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,530
SO YOU SENT US ALL THE
WAY OUT HERE AND THEN

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,324
YOU JUST
CANCEL THE CONTRACT?

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,409
MERCENARIES MAKE THEIR
LIVING BY FIGHTING!

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,995
KEEP THIS UP AND
MORALIA'S GOING TO COLLAPSE!

15
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,000
GOT IT, WE'LL RETURN TO
HEADQUARTERS.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,210
SOMETHING WRONG?

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,753
(Chuckles)

18
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,631
THE BIG SHOTS AT THE
AEU ARE WISING UP.

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,549
THEY'RE FINALLY GETTING
OFF THEIR BUTTS

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,426
AND DOING SOMETHING.

21
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,845
SO, DO YOU INTEND
TO SEND THE ARMY

22
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,597
TO MORALIA NO MATTER WHAT?

23
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,016
AT THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT
THE OTHER DAY,

24
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,185
WE CONFIRMED THAT MORALIA'S
PMC'S ARE NECESSARY

25
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,854
FOR OUR SPACE
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

26
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,274
NO MATTER HOW BAD ITS
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

27
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,609
SEEM TO BE, IF WE
KEEP SUPPORTING MORALIA,

28
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,403
CELESTIAL BEING WILL BE‐‐

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,364
AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY
WE MUST SEND THE MILITARY.

30
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,283
BUT LET'S NOT BE TOO RASH,

31
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,285
THINK OF THE
PUBLIC OPINION BACKLASH

32
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,495
IF WE SEND OUR SOLDIERS
ONTO FOREIGN SOIL.

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,205
WE SHOULDN'T BE WORRYING ABOUT

34
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,457
WHAT HAPPENED
THREE CENTURIES AGO,

35
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,043
WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE AEU OF TODAY.

36
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,421
WE SHOULD LEAVE THE
ACTUAL COLONY DEVELOPMENT

37
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,256
TO THE UNION AND THE HRL.

38
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,508
AFTER ALL THEY
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT

39
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,844
WITHOUT OUR GENEROUS
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

40
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,637
THAT MAY WORK FOR
NATIONS LIKE YOURS

41
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,222
THAT POSSESS TREMENDOUS
WEALTH...

42
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,974
BUT I'M AFRAID THE
SITUATION

43
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,767
IS QUITE A BIT
DIFFERENT FOR MY COUNTRY.

44
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,769
IS YOUR COUNTRY
THAT DESPERATE

45
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,439
TO SELL ALL THOSE WEAPONS
YOU'VE BEEN DEVELOPING?

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,733
MOVING INTO SPACE
WITHOUT A STRONG MILITARY

47
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,276
WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE.

48
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,028
IF WE GIVE UP CONTROL OF SPACE

49
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,030
TO THE UNION AND THE HUMAN
REFORM LEAGUE,

50
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,699
THE FINAL FRONTIER
WILL BE LOST TO US.

51
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,534
UNDOUBTEDLY.

52
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,910
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO FALL

53
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,120
ANY FURTHER BEHIND

54
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,747
IN THE SPACE
DEVELOPMENT RACE.

55
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,749
FORCES MUST BE
DEPLOYED TO MORALIA,

56
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,876
BUT ONLY BY COUNTRIES THAT
AGREE TO DO SO.

57
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,003
IF THAT'S THE WAY IT IS...

58
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,338
HOWEVER...

59
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,340
WE SHALL REQUIRE THE CONSENSUS

60
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,301
OF ALL
THE AEU MEMBER NATIONS.

61
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,635
IN EFFECT...

62
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,180
WE SHALL BE THE WHITE
KNIGHT WHO SAVES MORALIA.

WHERE DID THIS

79
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,559
(Yelling in pain)

80
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,728
WHO... WAS THAT...?

81
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,651
HI.

82
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,612
SO, IS MY SENTENCE UP?

83
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,947
FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT...

84
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,033
YOU DON'T FEEL SORRY ABOUT
YOUR ACTIONS, DO YOU?

85
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,618
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,536
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM.

87
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,248
YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF
BEING A GUNDAM MEISTER.

88
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,417
WHAT, YOU WANT TO
PULL ME OFF KYRIOS?

89
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,627
THAT'S RIGHT.

90
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,545
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO.

91
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,340
BUT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T
AFFORD TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.

92
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,925
WE HAVE A TASK
THAT WILL

93
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,301
REQUIRE YOUR
ABILITIES AGAIN.

94
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,844
MISS SUMERAGI.

95
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,221
WE HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION

96
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,223
THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
MORALIAN REPUBLIC

97
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,225
IS HAVING
CLANDESTINE MEETINGS WITH

98
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,478
THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF
THE MAJOR AEU NATIONS.

99
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,521
MORALIA?

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,856
THE PMC'S, RIGHT?

101
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,441
WE CAN CONSIDER
THESE ACTIONS

102
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,984
TO BE A DIRECT
CHALLENGE TO US.

103
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,819
THIS WILL BE
A HARD MISSION.

104
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,365
WE'LL BE HEADING DOWN TO THE
SURFACE TO PROVIDE BACK UP.

105
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,534
ALLELUJAH, YOU'RE
RELEASED FROM CONFINEMENT.

106
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,495
BOTH OF YOU ARE GOING, SO
PREPARE FOR AN IMMEDIATE LAUNCH.

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,454
ROGER THAT.

108
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,961
WE'VE CONDUCTED A THOROUGH
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

109
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,172
OF THE LIEUTENANT, BUT
WE'VE FOUND NO PROBLEMS.

110
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,383
THE NUMBERS INDICATE HER
BRAIN'S SYNAPTIC NERVE

111
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,553
IMPULSES AND GLIAL CELLS
ARE ALL AT NORMAL LEVELS.

112
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,555
I SEE. THEN WHY DID THE
LIEUTENANT

113
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,390
SUDDENLY
LOSE CONTROL LIKE THAT?

114
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,229
WE ANALYZED HER TAOZI'S
MISSION RECORDER AND DETECTED

115
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,232
ABNORMALITIES IN HER QUANTUM
BRAIN WAVES.

116
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,027
ORDINARILY,
THIS SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

117
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,405
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT AN
EXTERNAL INFLUENCE.

118
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,948
EXTERNAL INFLUENCE?

119
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,534
IF THAT'S SO, THEN
THE ONLY KIND OF INDIVIDUAL

120
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,161
WHO COULD CAUSE THIS REACTION
WOULD BE SOMEONE

121
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,539
LIKE THE LIEUTENANT,
WITH ENHANCED GLIAL CELLS

122
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,499
AND USING QUANTUM BRAIN WAVES.

123
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,626
SOMEONE ELSE LIKE
HER WAS OUT THERE?

124
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,629
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING IT
MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY.

125
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,715
HOW DO WE
DEAL WITH THIS?

126
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,508
WE'VE MODIFIED
THE LIEUTENANT'S SUIT

127
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,302
SO IT BLOCKS QUANTUM
BRAIN WAVES.

128
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,012
THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

129
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,055
IS IT THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU

130
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,641
TO HAVE THE LIEUTENANT
OUT ON THE BATTLEFIELD?

131
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,727
IF THIS CELESTIAL BEING
ORGANIZATION

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,729
HAD NEVER
APPEARED ON THE SCENE...

133
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,230
OUR RESEARCH HERE...

134
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,316
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
EXPOSED TO THE WORLD.

135
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,484
Sergei:
IT ALWAYS LEADS
BACK TO THAT GROUP.

136
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,449
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH
SOLAR POWER GENERATION?

137
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,160
YES, WE DESPERATELY NEED
ASSISTANCE IN THAT MATTER.

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,163
HMM... I REALLY WISH
OUR NATION COULD HELP

139
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,540
WITH THIS DILEMMA
YOU'RE FACING, HOWEVER...

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,335
YOUR COUNTRY IS VERY
UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW.

141
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,129
WITHOUT A GUARANTEE THAT OUR
TECHNICIANS WOULD BE SAFE,

142
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,131
IT'S UNLIKELY WE'D RECEIVE

143
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,133
THE CONSENT OF THE ASSEMBLY.

144
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,344
BESIDES...
SINCE THE AEU'S ELEVATOR

145
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,928
ISN'T FULLY OPERATIONAL,

146
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,972
I DON'T KNOW IF
WE'D EVEN HAVE

147
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,599
THE TECHNICIANS
TO SEND ELSEWHERE.

148
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,517
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

149
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,145
THOUGH I'LL MAKE
EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE

150
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,564
THAT AZADISTAN CONTINUES
TO RECEIVE FOOD AID.

151
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,524
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

152
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,818
TO PROTECT HER COUNTRY,

153
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,029
A YOUNG
PRINCESS ENTERS

154
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,781
THE UNFAMILIAR
WORLD OF FOREIGN POLICY.

155
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,741
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER...

156
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,534
BUT THESE ARE
SERIOUS MATTERS

157
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,411
AND WE'RE NOT RUNNING
A CHARITY.

158
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,789
I GUESS IT'S ALL
UP TO MORALIA NOW.

159
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,712
THAT'S GOOD TIMING!

160
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,506
MY SISTER MADE TOO MUCH
STEWED CHICKEN

161
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,049
AND WE CAN'T FINISH IT.

162
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,634
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU'D LIKE SOME.

163
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,552
IT'S STILL WARM.

164
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,513
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

165
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,597
OH.
I SEE.

166
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,602
THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL.

167
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,562
OH, AT THE STATION.

168
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,147
YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.

169
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,982
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
CELESTIAL BEING

170
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,401
WOULD SHOW UP
AND RESCUE US?

171
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,319
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT.

172
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,654
NEITHER DID I.

173
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,655
HUH?

174
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,910
Feldt:
THE MORALIAN REPUBLIC.

175
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,538
FOUNDED IN 2284,
IT IS A SMALL COUNTRY

176
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,331
SITUATED IN SOUTHERN EUROPE.

177
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,876
THE POPULATION IS
A RELATIVELY LOW 180,000,

178
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,378
BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN
THREE MILLION

179
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,547
FOREIGN WORKERS
RESIDING WITHIN ITS BORDERS.

180
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,174
PMC'S ACCOUNT
FOR TWENTY PERCENT

181
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,927
OF THE ROUGHLY FOUR THOUSAND
PRIVATE COMPANIES.

182
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,263
PMC STANDS FOR
PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY.

183
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,057
THESE CONTRACTORS DEAL IN
MERCENARY DEPLOYMENTS,

184
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,351
THE TRAINING OF SOLDIERS,
WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT,

185
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,145
TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICAL
SUPPORT,

186
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,148
ALL BASED ON BUSINESS MODELS
FOR PROFIT.

187
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,733
YOU WORK WAY
TOO MUCH, FELDT.

188
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,192
JUST DOING MY DUTY.

189
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,737
MISS SUMERAGI,
MORALIA HAS DEVELOPED

190
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,156
BY INVITING IN THE PRIVATE
MILITARY COMPANIES

191
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,867
AND THEN GIVING THEM
FAVORABLE TREATMENT, RIGHT?

192
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,370
SO WHY WAS IT NEVER CONSIDERED
ONE OF OUR TARGETS UNTIL NOW?

193
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,873
IF WARS AROUND THE WORLD
DIMINISHED IN NUMBER...

194
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,751
THEN THEIR BUSINESS WOULDN'T
BE PROFITABLE ANYMORE.

195
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,878
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF THEY ENDED UP

196
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,838
SELF‐DESTRUCTING ON
THEIR OWN.

197
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,301
SO, THE WORD IS...

198
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,345
MORALIA'S SPOILING FOR A
FIGHT WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

199
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,474
AND THE AEU HAS DECIDED
TO BACK THEM UP.

200
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,643
IF THEY WANT TO COMPLETE THEIR
SOLAR POWER GENERATION SYSTEM

201
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,062
AND MOVE ONTO SPACE
COLONY DEVELOPMENT...

202
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,065
THEN THE MANPOWER
AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PMC'S

203
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,066
ARE CRITICAL
TO THEIR WHOLE PLAN.

204
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,985
AND ON THE OTHER HAND
THERE'S MORALIA,

205
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,362
WHICH JUST WANTS TO
REVIVE ITS FAILING ECONOMY.

206
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,407
EVEN IF THEIR COUNTRY DOES
BECOME A BATTLEFIELD,

207
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,951
THEY STILL NEED
BACKUP FROM THE AEU.

208
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,370
YOU KNOW...
IF THEY'RE LUCKY

209
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,581
THEY MIGHT EVEN CAPTURE
ONE OF THOSE MACHINES....

210
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,708
A GUNDAM.

211
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,959
(Chuckles)

212
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,545
WELL THEN, I GUESS
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

213
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,423
HAND THIS ONE OVER TO THE
SO‐CALLED ACE OF THE AEU.

214
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,301
Patrick:
YA‐HOOO!

215
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,637
THIS IS THE MORALIAN
AIR FORCE BASE.

216
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,222
YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO LAND.

217
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,807
PLEASE USE RUNWAY
NUMBER SEVEN.

218
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,434
(Startled shouting)

219
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,186
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!

220
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,282
YO! I'M THE ACE OF THE AEU,
PATRICK COLASOUR!

221
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,702
MEMBERS OF THE MORALIAN AIR
FORCE, I'M HERE TO HELP.

222
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,746
MAN... WHAT A BIG MOUTH!

223
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,748
DON'T KEEP ME WAITING,
GUNDAM!

224
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,167
I'M GOING TO TEAR YOU
INTO LITTLE PIECES!

225
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,796
MORALIA AND THE AEU ON A
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE?

226
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,465
Hong‐Long:
THE AEU SENT A FULL REGIMENT
OF MOBILE SUITS

227
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,884
AND THE PMC TRUST,
WHO, AS I'M SURE YOU REALIZE,

228
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,137
IS AN ALLIANCE OF MORALIA'S
PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES,

229
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,056
IS ALSO TAKING PART
IN THE EXERCISE.

230
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,141
ADDING ALL THE
MOBILE SUITS TOGETHER,

231
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,061
IT'S ESTIMATED THEY HAVE
OVER 130 MACHINES.

232
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,401
A FULL‐SCALE MISSION.
THEY'VE NO CHOICE...

233
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,071
THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO TAKE
NOTICE OF CELESTIAL BEING NOW.

234
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,364
MISS SUMERAGI!

235
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,950
WE AREN'T LEAVING FOR MORALIA
UNTIL TOMORROW,

236
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,077
SO CAN WE PLEASE
HAVE SOME TIME OFF UNTIL THEN?

237
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,287
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

238
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,288
UH‐HUH!

239
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,622
WELL,
OKAY THEN!

240
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,208
AWESOME!
LET'S GO SHOPPING, FELDT!

241
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,252
I STILL NEED TO ANALYZE
THE MISSION PLAN.

242
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,963
COME ON! LET'S JUST GO!
THE MORE BATTLES WE HAVE

243
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,340
THE MORE INFLATION
IS GOING TO SKYROCKET!

244
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,593
IF WE WANT SOMETHING,
WE SHOULD BE BUYING IT NOW!

245
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,428
BUT THE DATA...

246
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,972
ALL RIGHT THEN, MISS SUMERAGI!
WE'RE LEAVING NOW!

247
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,348
BUT THE
ANALYSIS...

248
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,725
IT'LL BE JUST FINE.

249
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,019
WELL!
NOW TO FIND A DRINK!

250
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:37,030
♪

251
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,491
HEY! SETSUNA,
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME!

252
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,285
AH, IAN VASHTI.

253
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,203
I HAVE SOME THINGS I WANTED
TO BRING TO YOU GUYS

254
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,663
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

255
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,832
HE BROUGHT OUT A COUPLE
OF SURPRISES FOR US!

256
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,001
PRESENTS! PRESENTS!

257
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,128
I'VE ALREADY EQUIPPED THE
DYNAMES OVER THERE

258
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,088
WITH ITS
ADDITIONAL WEAPONRY.

259
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,801
AND YOURS...
IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

260
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,733
THE GN BLADES ARE MADE
EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE EXIA.

261
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,319
THEY EMIT THE SAME
SUPER‐COMPRESSED PARTICLES

262
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,779
AS THE GN SWORD.

263
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,905
THEY'LL EASILY CUT THROUGH

264
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,990
THREE‐METER‐THICK
E‐CARBON PLATE.

265
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,701
WELL. ARE YOU IMPRESSED?

266
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,204
EXIA'S GN BLADES...

267
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,373
IT'S THE GUNDAM
SEVEN SWORDS.

268
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,375
SO, THE EXIA IS
FINALLY LIVING UP

269
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,834
TO ITS DEVELOPMENT CODE.

270
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,586
(Grunts)

271
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,213
HEY, WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

272
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,965
I RUSHED ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE TO THIS LITTLE ISLAND

273
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,591
JUST TO SHOW HIM
THE BLADES.

274
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,760
YOU'D THINK HE'D BE A LITTLE
MORE GRATEFUL THAN THAT!

275
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,845
DON'T WORRY, HE'S
PLENTY GRATEFUL OLD MAN.

276
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
WHAT?

277
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,265
SEE, SETSUNA
IS INFATUATED

278
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,393
WITH EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE EXIA.

279
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,436
EXIA.

280
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,064
MY GUNDAM.

281
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,320
IT'S THE OTHERS...

282
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,914
Newscaster:
IT IS TWELVE NOON.

283
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,875
ON JNN NEWS TODAY,
A SPECIAL REPORT

284
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,753
ON THE JOINT MILITARY
EXERCISE TAKING PLACE

285
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,131
IN THE MORALIAN REPUBLIC
WITH THE AEU FORCES,

286
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,133
CODE NAME
"OPERATION DAWN".

287
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,884
(Quiet murmuring)

288
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,387
THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED
MOBILE SUITS

289
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,223
FROM THE TWO COMBINED FORCES
TAKING PART IN THE EXERCISE,

290
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,766
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS:
WHY CONDUCT

291
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,476
DOES THIS INTEREST YOU?

292
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,227
HUH?

293
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,355
HI.

294
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,149
Bartender:
WELCOME, SIR.

295
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,942
AH...
AN UNE PUREE.

296
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,194
RIGHT AWAY SIR.

297
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,573
HOW DO YOU INTERPRET
MORALIA'S RECENT ACTIONS?

298
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,324
LET'S NOT
TALK ABOUT THAT.

299
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,535
WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH
OTHER IN A WHILE.

300
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,121
YEAH, SINCE
GRADUATE SCHOOL, RIGHT?

301
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,956
HOW MANY YEARS
HAS IT BEEN?

302
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,624
(Laughing):
KEEP QUIET,

303
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,334
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO FIND OUT HOW OLD I AM.

304
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,545
I ALREADY KNOW
HOW OLD YOU ARE.

305
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,213
AND HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

306
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,716
WHEN A WOMAN'S REAL AGE
IS MENTIONED,

307
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,385
SHE LOSES
SOME OF HER YOUTH.

308
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,055
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA
TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY?

309
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,306
(Laughs)

310
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,267
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A
BIT, HAVE YOU, BILLY?

311
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,895
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD
YOU CALLED ME UP.

312
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,564
OH! I FEEL GREAT!

313
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,149
I FEEL TIRED.

314
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,401
THE ANTI‐GUNDAM
TASK FORCE?

315
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,904
WHAT KIND OF
A NAME IS THAT?

316
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,572
IT WAS JUST
FORMED RECENTLY

317
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,866
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY
HAVE AN OFFICIAL NAME YET.

318
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,869
AND SO YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED
TO THIS TASK FORCE?

319
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,537
YEAH, BUT I'M
NOT ALONE.

320
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,999
WOULD YOU BELIEVE OUR TECHNICAL
CHIEF IS PROFESSOR RALPH EIFMAN?

321
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
THE PROFESSOR?

322
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,044
YEAH, HE'S BEEN INVALUABLE.

323
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,004
HE ALREADY FIGURED OUT
THE CONCEPT BEHIND

324
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,131
THE PARTICLES
EMITTED BY THE GUNDAMS.

325
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,968
HMM... THAT
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

326
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,887
WHAT KIND OF PARTICLE IS IT?

327
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,056
I WANT TO KNOW TOO
BUT HE WON'T TELL ME

328
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,141
NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES I ASK HIM.

329
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,144
IS THAT SO?
THAT'S A SHAME.

330
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,938
AH, NEVER MIND THAT.

331
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,773
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO NOW?

332
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,317
WELL...
A LOT OF THINGS.

333
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,570
LISTEN, ABOUT THAT TIME...

334
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,531
I'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT.

335
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,658
I SEE.

336
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,868
THAT'S FINE THEN.

337
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,454
I'M JUST GLAD WE'VE
RECONNECTED.

338
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,789
YEAH.

339
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,916
(Gasps)

340
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,584
THIS IS NICE, TOO!

341
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,920
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
CUTE!

342
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,589
LET ME SLEEP...

343
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,301
Shirin:
AS WE EXPECTED, WE WERE
ONLY ABLE TO GET FOOD AID.

344
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,304
DON'T SAY IT LIKE IT'S
A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.

345
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,142
WE HAVE TO GET TECHNICAL
SUPPORT... SOMEHOW.

346
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,185
I'M SURE YOU'VE
SEEN THE NEWS BY NOW.

347
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,312
IT LOOKS LIKE MORALIA
IS HEADING STRAIGHT

348
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,982
FOR A CONFRONTATION
WITH CELESTIAL BEING.

349
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,900
IF THERE'S A CHANCE OF WAR
BREAKING OUT,

350
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,069
I'LL HAVE YOU RETURN HOME.

351
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,572
(Thinking)
AGAIN, CELESTIAL BEING...
EVEN HERE.

352
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,620
Al‐Saachez:
A JOINT EXERCISE?

353
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,331
I NEVER THOUGHT THE AEU
WOULD TAKE PART.

354
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,417
Commander:
THE FRUIT OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.

355
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,628
WE CAN'T ALWAYS BE GETTING THE
SHORT END OF THE STICK.

356
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,590
THE AEU BETTER SHOW
UP AND DO THEIR PART.

357
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,549
Al Saachez:
(Chuckles)

358
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,758
NO KIDDING.

359
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,345
I WANT YOU TO USE
THIS MACHINE.

360
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,890
A NEW AEU MODEL?

361
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT
TEST MACHINE

362
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,978
BUT OUR COMPANY'S ENGINEERING
BRANCH TUNED IT UP.

363
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,230
YOU WANT ME TO BEAT
A GUNDAM WITH THIS?

364
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,398
CAPTURE ONE.

365
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,608
(Scoffs)

366
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,359
EASIER SAID
THAN DONE.

367
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,986
WE'RE PREPARED
TO PAY YOU MORE

368
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,362
MONEY THAN YOU
CAN IMAGINE.

369
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,530
(Whistles)

370
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,742
NOW THAT...
IS TEMPTING INDEED.

371
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,911
(Brakes squeal)

372
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,499
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

373
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,918
HERE WE ARE.

374
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,128
COME ON,
I'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY.

375
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,972
IMPRESSIVE, WANG LIU‐MEI.
THIS IS ALL EXCELLENT.

376
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,850
WHY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

377
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,604
Hong‐Long:
THIS SHOWS HOW THE MORALIAN
AND AEU FORCES ARE DEPLOYED.

378
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,857
Sumeragi:
AS WELL AS THE PMC TRUST...
AND IT'S IN REAL‐TIME.

379
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,776
WHEN DID YOU
HACK THIS?

380
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,361
OH, JUST BEFORE BREAKFAST.

381
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,572
THE MISSION WILL GET UNDERWAY AT
ZERO HUNDRED HOURS AS PLANNED.

382
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,367
WE'RE GOING TO TARGET EVERYTHING
THAT IS HOSTILE TO US.

383
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,534
ROGER THAT.
ROGER THAT.

384
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,996
AH, YOU MET WITH
KUJO, DID YOU?

385
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,539
AND HOW IS SHE DOING?

386
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,958
JUST FINE.

387
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,918
DID YOU DISCUSS
THE INCIDENT?

388
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,294
I ASKED HER...

389
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,129
SHE SAID SHE'D
FORGOTTEN.

390
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,798
I SEE...

391
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,549
KUJO? ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT

392
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,261
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THAT COMBAT FORECASTER?

393
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,929
SIR, I'M GETTING A
VISUAL FROM THE SCENE.

394
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,722
IT'S ON THE MONITOR.

395
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,016
(Computer beeping)

396
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,810
WHAT'S THAT
EQUIPMENT?

397
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,353
THEY'RE NOT
IN OUR DATA.

398
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,147
CELESTIAL BEING
IS SERIOUS THIS TIME.

399
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,070
VISUAL CONFIRMATION OF
GUNDAMS. POINT A4576.

400
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,281
LOOKS LIKE THE ENEMY
MANAGED TO SPOT US.

401
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,784
OKAY, ALL MACHINES, RESPOND
ACCORDING TO THE MISSION PLAN.

402
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,370
KEEP THE CODED LINES
OPEN AT ALL TIMES.

403
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,163
EXPECT REVISIONS TO
THE PLAN FROM MISS SUMERAGI.

404
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,039
ROGER THAT.

405
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,915
ROGER THAT.

406
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,791
ROGER.

407
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,839
MORALIA HAS JUST DECLARED
A STATE OF EMERGENCY!

408
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,174
URGENT REPORT!
PREPARE THE GRAPHICS!

409
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,302
HURRY UP WITH THE BREAKING
NEWS UPDATE GET MOVING!

410
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,177
RIGHT!

411
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,013
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR MOVE NOW!

412
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,099
IF THE REPUBLIC OF MORALIA HAS
DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY

413
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,851
THEN THAT MEANS
CELESTIAL BEING

414
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,811
HAS BEGUN ITS ARMED
INTERVENTION AND THE FIGHTING

415
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,229
THEY HAVING A WAR?

416
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,314
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

417
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,523
ANY GUNDAMS YET?

418
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,233
WHY DO THIS?

419
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,776
WHAT?

420
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,530
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, LOUISE.
CELESTIAL BEING RESCUED US

421
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,075
NOW THEY'RE
STARTING A WAR THEMSELVES?

422
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,494
DOING THIS ISN'T GOING TO
CHANGE THE WORLD A BIT.

423
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,039
IT JUST CREATES HATE.

424
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,791
THEY'RE PLUNGING
THE WORLD INTO CHAOS.

425
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,214
YOU HEAR THEM, RIBBONS?
I KNOW I CAN...

426
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,301
ALL THE EVILS
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

427
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,637
ENEMY AIR SQUADRON
SPOTTED IN E‐332.

428
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,307
JUST LIKE MISS SUMERAGI'S

429
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,060
(Guns blasting)

430
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,645
WHAT THE...?

431
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,022
I CAN'T EVADE THIS!

432
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,940
(Boom)

433
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,026
ENEMY FORMATION DESTROYED.

434
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,071
THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO YOUR
MISSION PLAN, KYRIOS...

435
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,948
ROGER.
CONTINUING INTERVENTION.

436
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,700
DYNAMES AND VIRTUE
ARE SWITCHING

437
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,453
TO ARMED
INTERVENTION IN D883.

438
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,248
(Guns blasting)

439
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,001
ALRIGHT HARO, YOU TAKE
CARE OF SHIELD CONTROL!

440
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,378
LEAVE IT TO ME!
LEAVE IT TO ME!

441
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,889
Laughing:
I DON'T EVEN NEED TO TAKE AIM!

442
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,058
AT THIS RATE...!

443
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,351
WATCH BEHIND YOU!
WATCH BEHIND YOU!

444
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,937
Chuckling: I'M READY FOR YOUR
SNEAK ATTACKS!

445
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,279
VIRTUE, PREPARING TO
ELIMINATE HELLION SQUAD.

446
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,372
THERE YOU ARE!

447
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,332
YOU'RE A DIFFERENT MODEL
FROM THE LAST TIME,

448
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,334
BUT YOU'RE STILL A GUNDAM,
AREN'T YOU?!

449
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,921
THAT MEANS YOU
ARE OBVIOUSLY MY ENEMY!

450
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,508
YOU HAVE ENEMY MOBILE SUITS
COMING IN FAST FROM G653.

451
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,968
ROGER.

452
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,011
I WILL ELIMINATE
THE TARGETS.

453

A NEW MODEL...

475
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,585
(Shots blasting)

476
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,794
WHAT?

477
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,547
(Computer beeps)

478
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,592
HE'S READING MY MOVES!

Al‐Saachez:
NICE MACHINE.
SHAME ABOUT THE PILOT, THOUGH!

481
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,766
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MR. GUNDAM?

482
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,142
I KNOW THAT VOICE...

483
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,061
YOU'RE INTERFERING
WITH MY BUSINESS!

484
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,479
(Gasps)

485
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,690
NO... IT CAN'T BE!

486
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,736
I'VE GOT A BONUS
RIDING ON THIS!

487
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,783
IT IS HIM...

488
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,956
WELL, GUNDAM...YOU'RE MINE.

Narrator:
ACTING UPON MORALS
IS PART OF BEING HUMAN,

495
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,968
BUT SO IS ACTING
FOR PERSONAL GAIN.

496
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,720
A BRIEF VICTORY AND THEN
THE DESPAIR
