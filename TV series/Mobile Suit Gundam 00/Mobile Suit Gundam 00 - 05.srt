1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,339
(Cameras snap)

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,174
TARIBIA RETURNS TO
THE UNION,

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,344
AND THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
MAKES AN EMERGENCY VISIT.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,137
HE PROMISES
MORE MATERIAL AID

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,848
AND AN INCREASE IN THEIR
ENERGY SUPPLY.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,767
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS
ALL COOKED UP

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,645
BY AMERICA AND TARIBIA.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,730
THAT MEANS CELESTIAL BEING
WAS BEING USED

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,482
AS A TOOL ALL ALONG.

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,859
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,945
CELESTIAL BEING WAS JUST
FOLLOWING ITS MANDATE

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,738
TO ELIMINATE WAR.

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,074
LEADING IT TO
ATTACK TARIBIA.

14
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,161
EVEN IF IT WENT
AGAINST WORLD OPINION.

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,247
IT MIGHT NOT BE SO WISE
TO TRY USING THEM

16
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,332
FOR OUR PURPOSES,
AFTER ALL.

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,541
I SEE.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,960
IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,544
YOUR INTERNATIONAL
TOUR, PRINCESS.

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,630
I'M ANTICIPATING
GOOD RESULTS.

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,756
I KNOW YOU ARE,

22
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,384
AND I PROMISE I'LL TRY
TO DO MY BEST.

23
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,177
TO SAVE AZADISTAN,

24
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,930
WE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS
TO SOLAR ENERGY.

25
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,601
MAY I ASK YOU ONE
THING, PRINCESS?

26
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,771
WHY EXACTLY DID
YOU ACCEPT THIS ROLE?

27
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,316
I HAD NO CHOICE.
BECAUSE ONLY I CAN DO IT.

GOOD DAY AND
THANK YOU FOR USING

34
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,874
HEAVEN'S PILLAR TRAVEL
BUREAU...

35
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,211
Saji:
AW, SIS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME SEE ME OFF.

36
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,129
I HAD SOME BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF HERE.

37
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,923
NOW LISTEN, SAJI,

38
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,342
STUDY HARD WHEN YOU'RE
UP THERE.

39
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,761
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP IS
TAKING CARE OF YOUR STUDY TOUR,

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,305
BUT I'M THE ONE PAYING
FOR YOUR TICKET.

41
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,140
YEAH, I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE TROUBLE.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,310
BUT LOUISE INSISTED
ON GETTING A PRIVATE CAR.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,520
AUGH!

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,064
LITTLE RICH GIRLS CAN
BE JUST SO‐‐

45
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,483
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT ME?

46
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,692
LOUISE...

47
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,903
PLEASE, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING, KINUE!

48
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,321
SAJI NEEDS SOMEONE TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM

49
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,990
AND BELIEVE ME,
I'M MORE THAN CAPABLE!

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,994
UH, OKAY. I GUESS I CAN
RELAX IF LOUISE IS THERE.

51
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,746
BUT THIS ISN'T SOME KIND
OF VACATION

52
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,416
SO IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN TAKE IT EASY.

53
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,626
AND NO FUNNY STUFF
WITH LOUISE, GOT IT?

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,336
JUST WHAT ARE YOU
IMPLYING, SIS?!

55
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,546
(Laughing)

56
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,172
OH, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT THERE!

57
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,716
SAJI WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO,
EVEN IF HE WANTED!

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,719
UH...REALLY?

59
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,555
HONESTLY,
I'M STARTING TO WONDER

60
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,432
IF SHE'S THE RIGHT GIRL
FOR YOU!

61
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,143
HEY KINUE, I CAN HEAR YOU.

62
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,519
(Chuckles)

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,356
ALRIGHT,
THE PAPERWORK'S DONE.

64
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,691
LET'S GO,
LIEUTENANT.

65
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,109
ROGER THAT, COLONEL.

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,374
AN EXPERIMENTAL
MOBILE SUIT TEST.

67
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,633
Allelujah:
THE MISSION PLAN JUST
ARRIVED FROM MISS SUMERAGI.

68
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,135
WE'LL OBSERVE
THE PERFORMANCE

69
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,761
OF AN EXPERIMENTAL
MOBILE SUIT.

70
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,139
DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION,
WE MAY EVEN HAVE TO DESTROY IT.

71
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,766
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL

72
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,058
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE,
ALLELUJAH.

73
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,768
EVER SINCE THAT
AFFAIR IN TARIBIA,

74
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,145
THE WORLD HAS BECOME
A LITTLE LESS

75
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,688
FRIENDLY TO US.

76
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,148
YEAH, THANKS.

77
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,524
I'LL BE SURE TO
WATCH OUT.

78
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,488

GOOD DAY AND THANK YOU

NUMBER E‐603 TODAY.

81

THIS LINEAR TRAIN
IS A DIRECT,

82
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,746
NON‐STOP ASCENT TO

THE LOW ORBITAL STATION
TRUE PILLAR.

84
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,543
WE WILL BE
ARRIVING AT 18:32.

85
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,130
09:32 OF THE FOLLOWING DAY,
GREENWICH MEAN TIME.

86
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,218
WE HAVE NOW COMPLETED OUR
INITIAL ACCELERATION.

87
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,802
FROM THIS POINT ON,

88
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,555
THE TRAIN WILL BE IN
A GENTLE DECELERATION STAGE.

89
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,140
THE CAR INTERIOR
WILL EXPERIENCE

90
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,601
A QUASI‐WEIGHTLESS
ENVIRONMENT.

91
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,728
PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN
UNFASTENING YOUR SEATBELTS.

THE SOLAR POWER ARRAY
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.

93
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,402
AN UNDERTAKING WHICH BEGAN
FIFTY YEARS AGO,

94
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,531
INITIATED WHEN EARTH'S
FOSSIL FUELS WERE EXHAUSTED

95
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,699
AND HUMANITY BEGAN THE SEARCH
FOR A NEW SOURCE OF ENERGY.

96
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,326
(Humming)
HUH?

97
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,036
THE ARRAY CONSISTS OF ROUGHLY

98
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,289
30,000 POWER GENERATION
SATELLITES PLACED IN...

WHOA!

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,924
YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE
I EVER ASKED YOU

101
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,551
WHY YOU VOLUNTEERED
TO JOIN

102
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,803
THE SUPER‐HUMAN
INSTITUTE.

103
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,304
I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER.

104
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,557
IN FACT,
I AM A DESIGNER BABY

105
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,309
CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE SUPER‐SOLDIER PROGRAM.

106
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,531
NUMBER ONE HAS NANO‐MACHINES
EMBEDDED IN HER

107
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,866
TO MAINTAIN
HER PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS.

108
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,119
THIS ALLOWS HER TO REMAIN
ACTIVE IN SPACE

109
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,079
FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.

110
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,540
IN ADDITION, THE SENSORY
AMPLIFICATION TREATMENT

111
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,874
WE APPLIED
TO HER NERVOUS‐‐

112
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,334
THAT'S ENOUGH!

113
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,795
IS THERE SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS?

114
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,338
YOU PEOPLE DON'T SEE
ANYTHING WRONG

115
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,756
WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING

116
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,675
IN YOUR
SECRET LABORATORIES?

117
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,302
NO, NOT AT ALL.

118
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,054
IF WE'RE TO ADJUST TO
THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE,

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,599
THE LIEUTENANT HERE
IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY.

120
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,816
SOMETHING WRONG...COLONEL?

121
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,817
HUH?

122
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,695
NO.

123
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,156
Announcer:
THE SATELLITES,
CHARGED WITH SOLAR ENERGY,

124
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,743
TRANSMIT THE POWER TO THE
ORBITAL ELEVATOR VIA MICROWAVE.

125
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,161
AND THROUGH THE ELEVATOR,

126
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,537
IT IS SUBSEQUENTLY
DISTRIBUTED

127
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,539
TO VARIOUS
REGIONS ON THE SURFACE.

(Humming)

129
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,127
OVER 1.2 EXAJOULES OF POWER
ARE COLLECTED

130
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,963
AND TRANSFERRED IN
A SINGLE DAY.

THE USE OF ENERGY TUBES AND...

134
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,268
LOUISE,
I WAS WATCHING THAT!

135
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,353
NEVER MIND THAT.

136
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,937
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT
AND PLAY!

138
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,616

(Sighs)

140
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,077
WHAT'S WRONG?

141
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,411
I'M KIND OF TIRED.

142
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,789
YOU'VE BEEN DRAGGING ME
EVERYWHERE NON‐STOP.

143
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,248
YOU'RE SO OUT
OF SHAPE.

144
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,250
YOU'RE JUST OUT OF
CONTROL, LOUISE!

145
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,420
AH, YOU TWO MUST BE SAJI
CROSSROAD AND LOUISE HALEVY!

146
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,755
AH, YES!

147
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,256
THAT'S US!

I'M BORS ASSAN

149

YOUR TRAINING.

WELCOME TO THE LOW ORBITAL
STATION TRUE PILLAR!

151

Bors:
SAJI, DO YOU KNOW WHY THE LOW
ORBITAL RING IS NECESSARY?

152
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,563
Saji:
YEAH, FORCING A MAGNETIC
FLUID THROUGH THE RING

153
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,565
CREATES THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE NEEDED

154
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,318
TO MAINTAIN THE STATION'S
ORBITAL ALTITUDE, RIGHT?

155
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,530
I SEE SOMEONE'S
DONE HIS HOMEWORK!

HEY, SAJI!
COME LOOK AT THIS!

LOUISE,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE!

158
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,663
THIS AREA IS OUT OF BOUNDS!

159

HUH?

00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,882
BEAUTIFUL.

161
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,177
YEAH, IT SURE IS.

162
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,972
THIS IS WAY DIFFERENT
THAN A PICTURE.

163
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,348
YEAH.

164
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,891
BE CAREFUL, YOU TWO.

165
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,270
THERE'S STILL A LITTLE GRAVITY
AT TEN THOUSAND KILOMETERS.

166
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,730
ONE WRONG STEP AND
YOU'LL END UP FALLING

167
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,231
ALL THE WAY BACK TO EARTH.

168
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,399
AH, RIGHT SIR!

169
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,526
WE'RE SORRY!

170
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,153
(Screams)

171
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,739
(Grunts)

172
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,116
(Grunting)

173
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,826
(Screams)

174
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,746
SAJI, YOU IDIOT!
YOU'VE GOT TO SAVE ME PROPERLY!

175
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,330
(Louise screaming)

176
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,629
OH, BOY.

177
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,176
COLONEL, THIS WAY,
PLEASE.

178
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,552
SO THIS IS THE ONE?

179
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,012
YES, SIR.

180
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,180
A MACHINE
ADAPTED TO

181
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,016
SUPER SOLDIER NUMBER ONE'S
REACTION SPEED.

182
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:22,604
THE M. S. J. 06II‐SP,
TIEREN TAOZI.

183
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:27,150
TIEREN TAOZI.
THIS WILL BE MY MOBILE SUIT.

184
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,736
OUR ACE IN THE HOLE AGAINST
THE GUNDAMS.

185
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,376
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR MEAL?

186
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,669
THANKS.

187
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,506
AND WOULD YOU CARE
FOR ANYTHING TO DRINK?

188
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,715
COFFEE'S FINE.

189
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,510
CERTAINLY SIR.
ARE YOU ON VACATION?

190
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,136
I MUCH PREFER
THE WAY

191
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,138
THE EARTH LOOKS
FROM UP IN SPACE.

192
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,140
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU MEAN.

193
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,351
THE SURFACE
CAN BE SO COMPLICATED.

194
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,977
AND IT'S ONLY
GOTTEN WORSE

195
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,355
WITH THIS
CELESTIAL BEING GROUP.

196
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,024
INDEED.
THEY ARE A PAIN.

197
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,984
WE'LL BE ARRIVING
SHORTLY, SIR.

198
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,861
UNTIL THEN,
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

199
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,459
WALKING IN GRAVITY
AGAIN IS REALLY GREAT!

200
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,461
THAT'S FOR SURE! HMM?

201
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,005
MISTRESS,
IT IS ALMOST TIME.

202
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,715
YES. I AM AWARE OF THAT.

203
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,720
HMM...

204
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,888
HUH?

205
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,764
YEOW!

206
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,224
EYES FORWARD,
MISTER!

207
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,725
I‐I'M SORRY.

208
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,651
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT, LET'S CHECK OUT
YOUR MACHINE'S MANEUVERABILITY.

209
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,362
FOLLOW THE DESIGNATED COURSE
AT FULL ACCELERATION.

210
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,530
Peries:
ROGER THAT, COLONEL.

211
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,910
HERE I GO.

212
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,001
I AM NOW AT
FULL ACCELERATION.

213
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,133
A COURSE ERROR OF ONLY 0.25
AT MAXIMUM ACCELERATION.

214
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,552
IS THIS WHAT
A SUPER SOLDIER CAN DO?

215
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,348
Sergei:
BUT SHE'S STILL
JUST A CHILD, REALLY.

216
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,601
(Gasps)

217
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,227
WHAT IS THIS FEELING?

218
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,148
(Grunts)

219
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,902
WHAT IS THIS?

220
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,153
MY HEAD!

221
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,698
IT HURTS!

222
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,116
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT!

223
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,160
YOU'RE VEERING OFF
THE DESIGNATED COURSE.

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,453
WHAT'S WRONG?

225
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:49,918
C‐COLONEL SOMETHING'S...
THROBBING...IN MY HEAD.

226
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,004
(Groaning)

227
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,425
WHERE DID THIS
HEADACHE COME FROM?!

228
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,135
(Groaning)

229
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,889
DAMN!

230
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,307
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,

231
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,726
AND JUST WHO IS SCREWING
AROUND WITH MY HEAD?!

232
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,313
WHO ARE YOU?!

233
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,523
I AM GOING TO
KILL YOU!

234
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,317
N‐NO...!

235
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,449
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT! STOP!

236
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,117
NO! STOP!

237
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,872
NO...!

238
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,795
STOP IT! LIEUTENANT!

239
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,053
Peries:
NO!

240
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,056
GET OUT! STOP IT!

241
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,099
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT!

242
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:46,891
NO!

243
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,184
LIEUTENANT, CEASE FIRE!

244
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,728
(Peries screaming)

245
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,146
(Boom)

246
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,274
WHAT'S THAT?

247
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,569
MAYBE THERE'S
SOME DEBRIS HITTING US.

248
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,571
NO!
THAT'S ENOUGH,
LIEUTENANT! STOP!

249
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,286
(Creaking)

250
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,457
(Screaming)

251
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,959
WHAT IS GOING
ON HERE?

252
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,712
(Alarm ringing)

253
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,921
LOUISE!

254
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,589
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

255
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,758
THE GRAVITY'S GONE.

256
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,720
WHO IS IT?
WHO IS THAT PERSON?

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,638
HEY, LOOK!

258
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,975
ISN'T THAT
A GRAVITY BLOCK?

259
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,352
AN ACCIDENT?

260
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,646
IT SURE SUCKS TO BE THEM.

261
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,190
HALLELUJAH.

262
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,651
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.

263
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,905
HALLELUJAH!

264
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,742
Boy:
ARE WE... GOING TO DIE?

265
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,995
OH, NO!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

266
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,706
PLEASE, KILL ME...
ALLELUJAH.

267
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,753
NOT AGAIN, NOT AGAIN!

268
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,510
Sergei:
LIEUTENANT,
THIS IS A DISASTER.

269
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,138
LIEUTENANT!

270
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,391
CONTROL ROOM,
THIS IS SERGEI.

271
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,894
GIVE ME A DAMAGE REPORT ON
THE GRAVITY BLOCKS.

272
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,687
HERE'S THE SITUATION
COLONEL.

273
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,981
GRAVITY BLOCK
NUMBER SEVEN IS DRIFTING.

274
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,150
AND ACCORDING TO THE
DISTRESS SIGNAL WE RECEIVED,

275
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,320
THERE ARE 232 PEOPLE
STRANDED INSIDE IT.

276
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,696
WHAT ABOUT A RESCUE TEAM?

277
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,990
ONE IS SUPPOSED TO DEPLOY
IN SEVEN MINUTES.

278
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,909
AND WE'RE SCRAMBLING
A SMALL COMBAT TEAM

279
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,744
TO ESCORT THEM AS WELL.

280
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,788
HOWEVER, BECAUSE
OF THE EXPLOSIVE SHOCK

281
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,372
AND AN AIR LEAK,

282
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,792
GRAVITY BLOCK NUMBER SEVEN
IS LOSING VELOCITY!

283
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,460
IT'LL BE DRAGGED INTO

284
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,420
THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
IN FOURTEEN MINUTES!

285
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,880
WHAT?!

286
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,548
Sergei:
I'LL START THE RESCUE!

287
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,176
DEPLOY A RECOVERY TEAM
FOR THE LIEUTENANT'S MACHINE.

288
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,761
BUT, SIR, AN OBJECT
WITH THAT MUCH MASS‐‐

289
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,221
LIVES ARE AT
STAKE HERE!

290
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,687
Liu‐Mei:
THEY'RE SENDING A RESCUE TEAM.

291
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,897
PROBLEM IS...

292
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,441
THERE'S JUST NO WAY
IT'LL MAKE IT IN TIME.

293
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,193
EARTH'S GRAVITY IS GOING
TO SEIZE

294
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,195
THE GRAVITY BLOCK
AND THEN PULL IT IN.

295
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,572
MISTRESS!

296
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,615
EXCUSE ME,

297
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,534
BUT IT'S
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM.

298
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,535
WHAT?

299
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,287
Saji:
THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

300
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,123
HAS BEEN DETACHED FROM
THE STATION!

301
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,000
HOLD ON, DOES THAT
MEAN WE'RE ADRIFT?

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,127
NO WAY.

303
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,753
A RESCUE TEAM IS
ON ITS WAY.

304
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,505
WE JUST HAVE
TO BE PATIENT.

305
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,052
Sergei:
SEVEN MINUTES UNTIL
THE ESCAPE LIMIT ZONE.

306
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,137
TO BRING
THE SPEED OF THE BLOCK

307
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,472
UP TO ORBITAL VELOCITY...

308
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,308
I'LL HAVE TO ACCELERATE THAT
ENORMOUS STRUCTURE!

309
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,730
(Clang)

310
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
(Gasps)

311
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,024
WHAT'S THAT?!

312
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,573
(Grunting)

313
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,657
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

314
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,951
I JUST CALCULATED IT
ON MY TERMINAL!

315
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,327
THIS BLOCK IS
GOING TO BE TRAPPED

316
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,912
IN THE EARTH'S
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

317
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,747
IN ABOUT IN FIVE MINUTES!

318
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,249
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY?!

319
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,250
SAJI...

320
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,877
IS THAT GUY SERIOUS?

321
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,545
IN FIVE MINUTES
WE'RE GOING TO START...

322
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,970
BLOCK NUMBER SEVEN SIMPLY
HAS TOO MUCH MASS.

323
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,930
MY MACHINE
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH THRUST!

324
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,811
TWO HUNDRED SECONDS UNTIL
THE ESCAPE LIMIT ZONE.

325
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,188
AND AT THIS RATE,

326
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,564
MY MACHINE'S
GOING TO BE CAUGHT

327
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,192
IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
AS WELL.

328
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,152
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO
ABANDON THEM?

329
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,238
OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE!

330
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,366
WHY?! WHY DOES SPACE
HAVE TO BE SO MERCILESS?!

331
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,493
(Beeping)

332
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,330
WHAT KIND OF MACHINE
CAN APPROACH THIS FAST?

333
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,582
WHY DIDN'T IT SHOW
ON MY RADAR?

334
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,250
IS THAT A...?

335
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,172
A GUNDAM?

336
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,758
Liu‐Mei:
ALLELUJAH,
ALLELUJAH HAPTISM!

337
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,218
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

338
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,970
YOUR MISSION HAS GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

339
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,389
YOU COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND...

340
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,601
THE FEELINGS OF SOMEONE WHO
IS ADRIFT IN SPACE.

341
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,730
TWENTY SECONDS TILL
THE ESCAPE LIMIT ZONE!

342
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,106
KYRIOS!

343
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,577
WHAT THE HELL?!

344
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,120
HUH, AGAIN?!

345
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
GO...!

346
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,966
IT‐IT'S STOPPED FALLING!

347
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,219
BUT, WHY IS CELESTIAL BEING
DOING RESCUE WORK?

348
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,641
NOW IT'S ALL UP
TO MISS SUMERAGI.

349
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,270
Christina:
WE JUST GOT AN URGENT CODED
TRANSMISSION FROM WANG LIU‐MEI.

350
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,771
HE'S DOING RESCUE WORK?

351
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,606
WHAT IS THAT
BOY THINKING?

352
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,191
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

353
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,943
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?!

354
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,695
Journalist:
IT'S COMING IN!

355
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,530
A MISSING PERSONS LIST FROM
THE STATION ACCIDENT !

356
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,493
(Concerned chatter)

357
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,788
(Gasps)

358
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,206
NO WAY.

359
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,171
Sergei:
EVEN WITH THE GUNDAM'S THRUST,

360
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,756
THE BEST WE CAN DO IS
TO JUST MAINTAIN

361
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,300
OUR CURRENT POSITION.

362
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,051
AND THEN, WE'LL START TO

363
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,970
FALL WHEN WE RUN OUT OF ENERGY.

364
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,346
Allelujah:
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

365
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,557
EVERYONE, MOVE TO THE
CENTRAL BLOCK!

366
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,435
Sergei:
IS THAT THE GUNDAM
PILOT SPEAKING?

367
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,228
Allelujah:
I REPEAT, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO DIE,

368
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,480
MOVE TO THE CENTER!

369
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,190
IS SOMEONE TRYING
TO RESCUE US?

370
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,610
COME ON LOUISE,
LET'S GO!

371
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,821
THERE'S NO TIME!
HURRY UP!

372
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,115
HIS VOICE... HE'S A YOUNG MAN.

373
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,706
HEY, SAJI...

374
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,959
THERE'S A CHANCE YOU AND
I MIGHT DIE OUT HERE.

375
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,919
I JUST WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING.

376
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,922
LOUISE...

377
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,009
Sergei:
COME IN, GUNDAM PILOT!

378
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,137
THIS BLOCK IS ABOUT TO
ENTER THE ESCAPE LIMIT ZONE.

379
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,806
THIS IS THE END. GET AWAY!

380
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,850
(Allelujah scoffs)
I CAN'T DO THAT!

381
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,769
FAILURE IS NOT
AN OPTION.

382
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,520
NOT FOR CELESTIAL BEING.

383
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,147
BESIDES...

384
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,900
LOOK, SAJI,
I JUST WANT TO SAY...

385
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,818
A GUNDAM MEISTER
IS NEVER ALONE!

386
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,613
(Blast)

387
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,532
WHAT THE...?

388
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,867
NICELY DONE...

389
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,748
Allelujah:
LOCKON STRATOS.

390
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,626
G. N. PARTICLE COMPRESSION
IN PROGRESS.

391
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,963
CHARGING COMPLETE IN
TWENTY, NINETEEN, EIGHTEEN,

392
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,091
SEVENTEEN, SIXTEEN,
FIFTEEN...

393
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,344
CLOUDS ARE MOVING
IN AND BLOCKING MY SHOT.

394
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,929
TEAR THEM UP, SETSUNA!

395
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,517
ROGER THAT.

396
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,143
(Grunts)

397
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,939
Haro:
CHARGING COMPLETE!

398
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,607
TARGETED AND FIRING!

399
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,156
(Boom)

400
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,329
SOME NICE SUPPORT,
MISS SUMERAGI.

401
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,288
NOW, MOVE!

402
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,627
THEY TARGETED THE TWO BLOCKS
FROM THE GROUND

403
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,129
AND CUT THEM OFF.

404
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,755
THIS REDUCED
THE TOTAL MASS

405
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,090
SO THEY COULD PUSH IT
TO A STABLE ORBIT.

406
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,633
(Beep)

407
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,634
HUH?

408
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,429
Sergei:
THE RESCUE TEAM'S HERE.

409
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,607
Soldier:
C‐COLONEL,
IT'S THE GUNDAM!

410
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,443
THE RESCUE WORK TAKES
PRIORITY!

411
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,611
R‐ROGER!

412
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,531
I AM NOT SO CALLOUS AS TO BE
UNGRATEFUL FOR THEIR HELP.

413
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,161
Journalist:
THIS JUST IN!

414
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,495
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
WERE IN DANGER WERE RESCUED!

415
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,539
(Cheering)

416
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,124
(Gasps)

417
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,626
(Sighs)

418
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,424
MISSION COMPLETE!

419
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,303
HUH?

420
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,347
HUH?

421
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,808
WE ABANDONED THE MISSION
THAT VEDA RECOMMENDED

422
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,769
AND MADE A RESCUE OPERATION
OUR PRIORITY.

423
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,937
ON TOP OF THAT,

424
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,147
WE SHOWED THE WHOLE WORLD

425
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,609
DYNAMES' HIGH ALTITUDE
FIRING CAPABILITY.

426
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,527
SO, WE'LL HAVE TO
COMPLETELY REVISE OUR PLANS,

427
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,820
WON'T WE?

428
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,405
YOU CHANGED THE MISSION,

429
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,742
AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GAVE
LOCKON STRATOS HIS ORDERS.

430
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,537
I DIDN'T CHANGE THE MISSION
TO HELP ALLELUJAH HAPTISM.

431
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,831
I PROTECTED THE GUNDAM.

432
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,750
SOMEONE WITH HIS
TEMPERAMENT...

433
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,502
SHOULD NOT BE
PILOTING A GUNDAM.

434
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,298
AND WHAT OF
YOUR TEMPERAMENT?

435
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,221
Louise:
YOU AND I,

436
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,473
WE WERE PRETTY CLOSE TO
DYING WEREN'T WE?

437
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,183
IT'S OKAY!

438
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,144
IT WAS SO UNREAL.
BUT I'M GLAD IT'S OVER!

439
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,855
HEY, LOUISE,

440
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,732
YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME
SOMETHING EARLIER.

441
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,942
WHAT WAS IT?

442
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,151
OH...

443
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,239
GO AHEAD.

444
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,240
UH...

445
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,039
