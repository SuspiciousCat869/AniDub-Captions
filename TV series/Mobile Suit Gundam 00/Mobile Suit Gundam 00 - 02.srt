00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,089
Narrator:
2307 AD.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,842
WITH THE DEPLETION
OF EARTH'S FOSSIL FUELS,

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,221
HUMANITY TURNED TO A NEW SOURCE
OF ENERGY, SOLAR POWER.

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,181
A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED
TO BUILD

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,141
A SOLAR POWER
GENERATION SYSTEM,

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,560
BASED AROUND
THREE ORBITAL ELEVATORS,

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,981
EACH OVER
50,000 KILOMETERS HIGH.

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,608
NOW, AFTER ALMOST
HALF A CENTURY,

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,152
THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETED.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,112
THESE MEGA‐STRUCTURES
PROVIDE

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,698
AN ALMOST INEXHAUSTIBLE
ENERGY SUPPLY,

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,492
AND TO FACILITATE
THEIR CONSTRUCTION,

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:38,330
THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD HAVE
GATHERED AROUND THREE BLOCS.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,707
THE UNION OF SOLAR ENERGY
AND FREE NATIONS,

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,167
GROUPED
AROUND THE UNITED STATES,

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,962
IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS
THE UNION.

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,506
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE
WITH CHINA, RUSSIA,

18
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,717
AND INDIA
AS ITS CORE STATES.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,720
AND FINALLY, THERE IS
THE ADVANCED EUROPEAN UNION

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,015
KNOWN AS THE A. E. U.

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,684
GIVEN THEIR
TREMENDOUS SIZE,

22
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,770
DEFENDING THE ORBITAL ELEVATORS
IS A DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,730
EVEN FROM A CONSTRUCTION
POINT OF VIEW,

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,900
THEY ARE
EXTREMELY FRAGILE STRUCTURES.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,236
DESPITE THE PRECARIOUSNESS
OF THE SITUATION,

26
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,114
TO FURTHER THEIR
OWN PRESTIGE AND PROSPERITY,

27
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,949
THESE GROUPS OF NATIONS INSIST

28
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,868
ON PLAYING
A GRAND ZERO‐SUM GAME.

29
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,663
YES, EVEN IN THE 24TH CENTURY,

30
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,583
HUMANITY HAS YET
TO COME TOGETHER AS ONE.

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,627
BUT NOW A SMALL BAND OF
PEOPLE HAVE ARISEN

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,547
TO CHALLENGE THIS WORLD.

33
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,048
CELESTIAL BEING.

34
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,301
THE PRIVATE ARMED
ORGANIZATION

35
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,013
THAT POSSESSES THE MOBILE SUITS
CALLED... GUNDAMS.

36
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,891
IT HAS BEGUN CARRYING OUT
OPERATIONS THAT TRANSCEND RACE,

37
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,688
NATIONALITY AND RELIGION IN
A QUEST TO ERADICATE WAR.

38
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,482
CELESTIAL BEING
HAS TRIGGERED A REFORMATION

39
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,776
WHICH IS SWEEPING
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,752
WE ARE A PRIVATE ARMED

IN POSSESSION OF
THE MOBILE WEAPON GUNDAM.

48

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF
CELESTIAL BEING'S ACTIVITIES

49
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,137
IS TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE
ACTS OF WAR

50
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,555
AND CONFLICT FROM THIS WORLD.
PLAYING IT AGAIN?

51
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,348
HOW MANY TIMES
IS THAT?

52
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,186
WE DO NOT ACT FOR OUR OWN

LOUISE, DO YOU THINK
CELESTIAL BEING ACTUALLY EXISTS?

54
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,858
WHAT?

55
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,443
Saji:
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE
PEOPLE OUT THERE

56
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,861
WHO WILL TAKE ACTION EVEN

57
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,529
IF THERE'S
NOTHING IN IT FOR THEM?

58
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,406
THEY PROBABLY LOVE
VOLUNTEERING!

59
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,032
HUH?

60
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,495
HEY, WAIT UP!
SAJI!

61
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,875
Aeolia:
IF THERE IS AN EVIDENT
ACT OF WAR BEING CARRIED OUT

62
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,878
WE WILL COMMENCE INTERVENTION
WITH ARMED FORCE.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,631
ARE THEY THE ONES
WHO THWARTED

64
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,758
THE TERRORIST ATTACK
ON HEAVEN'S PILLAR?

65
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,511
WE BELIEVE THAT'S
HIGHLY POSSIBLE, SIR.

66
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,472
IN THE STATEMENT,
CELESTIAL BEING

67
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,307
CLAIMS TO POSSESS

68
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,434
THESE "GUNDAM" MOBILE
WEAPONS.

69
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,894
OBSERVE, SIR.

70
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,146
THIS IS AN IMAGE OF
THE UNIDENTIFIED MOBILE SUIT

71
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,939
RECORDED BY OUR
SPACE FORCES.

GUNDAM...

73
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,659
OUR LATEST MODEL...

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,620
AND IT WAS DEFEATED
SO EASILY.

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,038
CAN WE ASSUME
THIS MEANS

76
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,623
WE'LL HAVE TO CURTAIL
DEVELOPMENT

77
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,833
OF ANY NEW WEAPONS?

78
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,460
THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,045
THIS HAS GONE PUBLIC.

80
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,339
EVERYONE KNOWS WE HAVE
MORE FORCES IN THE ELEVATOR

81
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,174
THAN THE TREATY ALLOWS.

82
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,467
THEY ALL WANT
TO KNOW.

83
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,469
THEY'RE ASKING US
TO DISCLOSE EVERYTHING.

84
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,679
WE HAVE REPORTS THAT
IT MAY BE A PLOT

85
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,848
BY THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE
OR THE UNION.

86
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,266
AFTER ALL,

87
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,268
DEVELOPING A STATE OF THE ART
MOBILE SUIT IN SECRET

88
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,687
WOULD REQUIRE THE
TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCING

89
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,606
OF A PRETTY ADVANCED
NATION.

90
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,857
THAT'S FOR SURE.

91
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,567
AN ARMED ORGANIZATION
WOULD REQUIRE

92
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,152
THE SUPPORT
OF A POWERFUL ALLY.

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,570
YES, BUT...

94
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,572
NONE OF THE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES

95
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,990
HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO GATHER

96
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,825
CREDIBLE INFORMATION
ON THIS GROUP.

97
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,203
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN.

98
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,373
THIS GROUP CALLING ITSELF
CELESTIAL BEING,

99
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,791
HAS IN
ITS POSSESSION

100
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,417
A POWERFUL MOBILE SUIT

101
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,128
THAT IS FAR SUPERIOR
TO OUR ENACT.

102
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,464
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM.

103
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,888
THE ELIMINATION OF WAR
THROUGH ARMED FORCE...

104
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,808
WELL, DAVID, IT SOUNDS
LIKE SOMEBODY IS OFFERING

105
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,560
TO DO OUR JOB FOR US.

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,811
MISTER PRESIDENT,

107
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,605
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE ACTUALLY SERIOUS?

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,024
THEY SEEK NO
PERSONAL GAIN?

109
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,236
WELL WE INTERVENE IN
THE WARS OF OTHER NATIONS

110
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,737
TO ENSURE THE SAFETY

111
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,282
AND PROSPERITY OF
OUR CITIZENS.

112
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,076
WE AREN'T EXACTLY
RUNNING A CHARITY.

113
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,578
I'M SURE
THEIR TRUE NATURE

114
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,788
WILL BE REVEALED
IN DUE TIME.

115
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,373
AND WHEN
THAT TIME COMES,

116
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,167
IT WILL BE OUR DUTY
TO JUDGE THEM.

117
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,379
YES, INDEED.

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,382
TEN YEARS SINCE
THE ELEVATORS CAME ON LINE,

119
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,384
THE ECONOMY HAS
FINALLY STABILIZED

120
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,760
AND NOW THIS HAPPENS.

121
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,769
(Engines running)

122
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,563
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
THE TOP NEWS STORY

123
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,481

COUNTRY.

127
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,698

128
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,618
DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE

129
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,704

TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE.

AFTER ALL,
CELESTIAL BEING'S IDEALS

131

YOU SURE GOT HERE
QUICKLY.

134
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,297
TIME FOR YOUR SECOND MISSION!

135
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,554
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE MILITARY?

136
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,931
THEY'RE PROBABLY
PANICKING RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

137
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,517
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
THAT GUNDAM CAN DO.

138
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,603
THAT MACHINE
IS SOMETHING ELSE.

139
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,315
Graham:
ITS COMBAT PERFORMANCE
IS ONE THING,

140
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,941
BUT WHEN IT SHOWED UP,

141
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,361
RADAR, COMMUNICATIONS AND
ELECTRONIC DEVICES

142
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,071
WERE ALL DISRUPTED.

143
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,366
AND IT WAS CAUSED BY
THAT LIGHT.

144
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,743
KATAGIRI,
WHAT'S THE STORY THERE?

145
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,578
SO FAR,
ALL I KNOW IS THAT

146
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,081
IT'S SOME KIND
OF SPECIAL PARTICLE.

147
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,666
THAT LIGHT IS
PROBABLY CAUSED BY

148
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,294
SOME KIND OF
PHOTONIC DECAY PHENOMENON.

149
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,921
A SPECIAL PARTICLE...

150
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,674
(Door opens)

151
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,679
IT'S NOT JUST
THE PARTICLES.

152
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,097
I THINK THAT
MACHINE

153
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,057
HAS OTHER
SECRETS AS WELL.

154
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,350
I GUESS I LIKE THEM.

155
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,851
HUH?

156
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,688
I MEAN I HAVE MORE THAN
JUST A CASUAL INTEREST.

157

LIEUTENANT GRAHAM AKER.

TECHNICAL ADVISOR
KATAGIRI.

159
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
ORDERS FROM MSWAD
TO RETURN TO BASE.

ONE MOMENT, SIR.

SOUTHERN INDIA,
THE ISLAND OF CEYLON!

THAT ISLAND'S IN OUR

00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,624
INCREDIBLE.

IS THIS ONE OF

GOOD JOB, KYRIOS.

00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,691
IT'S ALRIGHT,

THEY'RE HERE, SETSUNA!

241
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,906
ALLELUJAH AND TIERIA!

242
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,324
I CONFIRM THAT.

243
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,535
AFTER THE RENDEZVOUS
WE'LL PROCEED...

244
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,744
TO FIRST PHASE.

245
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,251
CELESTIAL BEING'S
MAKING ITS MOVE?

246
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,627
DO WE HAVE A LOCATION?

247
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,007
LOOKS LIKE SOUTHERN INDIA,
IN THE FORMER SRI LANKA.

248
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,383
IN CEYLON?

249
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,594
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE
HAS FORCES THERE.

250
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,680
RESPOND ACCORDING
TO OUR PLAN.

251
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,349
YES, SIR.

252
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,309
THIS COULD WORK TO
OUR ADVANTAGE.

253
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,937
ESPECIALLY IF WE GET
OUR HANDS ON THOSE MACHINES.

254
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,071
CURRENTLY, CEYLON IS
IN A STATE OF ANARCHY.

255
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,698
THIS IS BECAUSE
OF ETHNIC WARFARE

256
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,283
BETWEEN THE SINHALESE
MAJORITY

257
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,910
AND THE TAMIL MINORITY.

258
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,912
Sumeragi:
THE FIGHTING HAS CONTINUED
ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED

259
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,914
SINCE THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

260
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,916
CELESTIAL BEING WILL
USE FORCE

261
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,211
TO INTERVENE IN
THIS ETHNIC CONFLICT.

262
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,671
AN ETHNIC CONFLICT.

263
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,218
Katagiri:
THE FORMER SRI LANKA, HEY?

264
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,928
IF I RECALL,
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE

265
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,930
HAS BEEN GIVING AID TO
THE TAMIL MINORITY

266
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,599
FOR ABOUT
TEN YEARS NOW.

267
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,725
YEAH.

268
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,394
UNDER THE PRETEXT
OF ENDING THE CONFLICT.

269
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,937
BUT IT'S A LIE.

270
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,439
IT'S ABOUT SOLAR ENERGY.

271
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,107
THE HUMAN REFORM LEAGUE
NEEDS TO

272
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,734
KEEP THE POWER FLOWING

273
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,153
ON THE SEA FLOOR OFF
EASTERN CEYLON.

274
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,988
AND THE TAMILS
ARE THE STRONGEST FORCE

275
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,782
IN THAT REGION.

276
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,451
BUT THEIR INTERFERENCE ONLY
INTENSIFIED THE FIGHTING.

277
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,660
IT EVEN LED TO

278
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,245
THE FALL OF
THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT.

279
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,835
HOW CAN I
HELP YOU, SIR?

280
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,253
YOU CAN
TELL THE CAPTAIN

281
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,297
TO CHANGE COURSE,
PLEASE.

282
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,257
ALSO, GET ME
A FULLY EQUIPPED FLAG.

283
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,258
SIR!

284
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,552
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THIS IS RISKY!

285
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,137
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

SUCKS TO BE YOU!

319
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,134
AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

320
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,345
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF LONG‐RANGE FIRE.

321
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,096
EVASIVE MANEUVERS
ARE UP TO YOU, HARO!

322
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
(Boom)

323
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,856
(Commander #1 gasps)

324
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,695
Commander #1:
HERE THEY COME.

325
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,447
CELESTIAL BEING!

326
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,661
EXIA,
CONFIRMING CONFLICT.

327
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,079
WILL ELIMINATE.

328
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,083
(Slash)

329
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,098
(Crash)

330
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,438
(Gun sizzles)

331
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,107
DID I GET HIM?

332
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,697
NOT A SCRATCH?!
WHAT KIND OF ARMOR IS‐‐

333
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,699
(Screams)

334
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,161
DYNAMES, TARGETED AND
READY TO FIRE.

335
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,164
(Shots firing)

336
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,005
WIPED OUT. WIPED OUT.

337
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,848
Lockon:
YOU'RE GETTING
TOO WORKED UP, SETSUNA!

338
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,017
(Alarm wails)

339
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,605
MOVE IT!

340
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,898
KYRIOS, MOVING ON TO
BOMBARD TARGETS.

341
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,194
(Screaming)

342
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,991
AND NOW I'VE BECOME
A MASS MURDERER.

343
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,242
SO BE IT!

344
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,792
DID THAT THING
JUST TRANSFORM?!

345
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,169
(Screaming)

346
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,297
(Gun shots firing)

347
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,303
THAT IS WHAT CELESTIAL BEING IS!

348
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,225
VIRTUE,
TARGET LOCATED,

349
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,602
PROCEEDING TO ELIMINATE.

350
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,730
(Firing continues)

351
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,732
(Whirring)

352
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,990
(Boom)

353
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,508
Commander #2:
FALL BACK! FALL BACK!

354
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,764
(Fire crackling)

355
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
THAT'S IT.

356
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,311
I THINK
THAT'S IT, SETSUNA.

357
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,444
(Sighs)

358
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,654
Commander #3:
THANKS FOR THE HELP!

359
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,905
HUH?!

360
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,989
THE ENEMY'S
RUNNING SCARED!

361
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,658
NOW'S OUR CHANCE TO
PAY THEM BACK!

362
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,951
Lockon:
YOU IDIOTS!

363
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,920
(Sighs tensely)

364
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,922
(Slash)

365
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
(Crash)

366
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,766
SETSUNA...

367
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,602
THIS IS...
WHAT A GUNDAM MEISTER DOES.

368
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,981
Kinue:
WELL? DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

369
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,316
Intern:
OH, YEAH!
BINGO, MISS KINUE!

370
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,694
I THOUGHT SO.
AEOLIA SCHENBERG.

371
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,737
REALLY?
BUT THIS GUY'S BEEN DEAD

372
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,865
FOR OVER
TWO HUNDRED YEARS!

373
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,950
Journalist:
CELESTIAL BEING
WAS THERE?!

374
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,536
AN ARMED INTERVENTION IN
THE SRI LANKAN WAR?

375
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,621
AND THEY
ATTACKED BOTH SIDES?!

376
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,707
ATTACKED BOTH SIDES?

377
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,208
BUT IF THEY KEEP
DOING THAT

378
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,211
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO END UP
PISSING EVERYONE OFF.

379
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,504
(Sighs)

380
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,089
Kinue:
CELESTIAL BEING...

381
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,801
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE
THEY THINKING?

382
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,179
MADNESS.
A SINGLE INTERVENTION.

383
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,139
AND THEY THINK THAT'S GOING
TO END A CONFLICT

384
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,932
THAT'S BEEN RAGING
FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS?

385
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,019
NOT A SINGLE TIME.

386
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,146
AS MANY TIMES AS
NECESSARY.

387
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,106
UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER.

388
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,691
AND THEY BEGIN TO TURN
THEIR HATRED

389
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,610
AGAINST US.

390
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,404
THAT IS CELESTIAL BEING.

391
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,572
WE ARE THE PAIN...

392
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,201
THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES
A GREAT CHANGE.

393
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,744
Allelujah:
WHAT HAPPENED TO EXIA?

394
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,746
HE WASN'T SHOT DOWN,
WAS HE?

395
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,080
Lockon:
HE WENT BACK AHEAD OF US.

396
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,041
THIS WAS HIS FIRST
INTERVENTION.

397
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,251
HE MIGHT JUST
NEED TO CALM DOWN.

398
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,836
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

399
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,838
THEN WHY IS HE
A GUNDAM MEISTER?

400
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,010
HUH?

401
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,013
A UNION TRANSPORT?
IN THIS AIRSPACE?

402
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,853
THAT'S A FLAG!

403
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,653
(Gasps)

404
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,196
(Clash)

405
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,907
PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, GUNDAM!

406
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,200
YEAH?
AND WHO ARE YOU?!

407
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,536
GRAHAM AKER.

408
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,954
A MAN WHO IS OBSESSED WITH

409
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,747

HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND SOMETHING

416
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,716
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE?

417
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,718
AS THE BLADES
TURN AGAINST HIM,

418
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,304
A YOUNG MAN FEELS
THE WORLD CHANGING.
