1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,007
Announcer:
ALTHOUGH THE COUP D'ETAT

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,384
BY A MILITARY FACTION
HAS BEEN DEALT WITH,

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,388
TERROR ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL
ARE STILL CONTINUING.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,141
CITIZENS ARE NOT TO
GO OUTSIDE FOR ANY REASON.

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,144
PLEASE REMAIN IN YOUR HOMES.

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,898
THIS IS
MARINA ISMAIL,

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,817
PRINCESS ROYAL OF
THE KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN.

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,445
I URGE EVERYONE LISTENING
TO REMAIN CALM.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,364
WE SHOULD NOT BE
HURTING EACH OTHER,

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,867
IN THIS, THE PROMISED LAND
GRANTED TO US BY GOD.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,120
Marina:
THERE IS NO REASON FOR
THIS TO HAPPEN.

12
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,125
IT'S ALL BECAUSE THE REFORMISTS
BROUGHT IN THE UN.

13
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,341
(Patients moaning)

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,384
OH,

15
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,345
PRINCESS MARINA,
MAY GOD PROTECT YOU.

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,976
WE STILL DON'T HAVE
ANY CLUES

17
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,978
TO MASSOUD RACHMADI'S
WHEREABOUTS?

18
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,562
WORKING TOGETHER WITH
THE UNION,

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,690
WE HAVE BEEN
SEARCHING HIGH AND LOW.

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,901
BUT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE
FINDING HIM SOON.

21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,279
I SEE.

22
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,364
(Thinking)
THIS IS THE WORST CASE
SCENARIO.

23
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,116
THE RECEIVER ANTENNAS
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED,

24
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:18,328
AND THE UN'S ENGINEERS
HAVE WITHDRAWN.

25
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,124
AND NOW WE HAVE CELESTIAL
BEING INTERVENING AS WELL.

26
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,379
THE ONLY WAY OUT OF
THIS SITUATION

27
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,716
IS FOR US TO BRING MASSOUD
RACHMADI UNDER OUR PROTECTION.

28
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:35,053
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

Narrator:
THE CIVIL UNREST THAT ERUPTED
IN THE KINGDOM OF AZADISTAN

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,945
WAS TRIGGERED BY THE KIDNAPPING

36
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,656
OF RELIGIOUS LEADER
MASSOUD RACHMADI.

37
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,533
WHEN THE TURMOIL ESCALATED
TO THE POINT

38
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,952
WHERE THE MILITARY
LAUNCHED A COUP D'ETAT,

39
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,537
CELESTIAL BEING AND
THEIR GUNDAMS

40
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,790
COMMENCED
AN ARMED INTERVENTION.

41
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,959
WITHOUT THE HELP
OF TACTICAL FORECASTER

42
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,836
SUMERAGI LEE NORIEGA,

43
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,171
WILL SETSUNA F. SEIEI
AND LOCKON STRATOS

44
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,548
BE ABLE TO DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION

45
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,300
AND STOP AZADISTAN'S
INTERNAL CONFLICT?

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,766
HMM.

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
YOU THINK
THERE'S A THIRD PARTY?

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,769
YEAH.

49
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,355
ASIDE FROM THE UNION, WHO
WERE CALLED IN TO HELP OUT,

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,567
AND US, WHO CAME IN TO
PERFORM AN ARMED INTERVENTION,

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,528
THERE'S A THIRD FORCE OUT THERE
THAT WANTS A CIVIL WAR.

52
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,155
AND YOU THINK
THIS THIRD PARTY

53
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,365
IS BEHIND MASSOUD
RACHMADI'S ABDUCTION?

54
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,534
IT'S JUST MY OWN
CONJECTURE, REALLY.

55
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,662
BUT DIDN'T VEDA SAY IT WAS
A POSSIBILITY, AS WELL?

56
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,414
ANY EVIDENCE
OF THIS?

57
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,960
Lockon:
THERE WAS A LONG‐RANGE MISSILE
ATTACK ON THE SITE

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
WHERE THEY WERE BUILDING
THE RECEIVER ANTENNAS.

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,380
FROM THE FIREPOWER,

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,341
IT'S LIKELY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A MOBILE SUIT HERE.

61
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,970
AN ORGANIZATION WITH ACCESS
TO MOBILE SUITS.

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,722
BUT WHY WOULD THEY DO ALL THIS?

63
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,390
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW!

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,101
THAT'S WHY I SENT SETSUNA
THERE TO INVESTIGATE.

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,769
Lockon:
BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY

66
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,522
THE REST OF US
JUST STAND OUT TOO MUCH.

67
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,651
ACCORDING TO
LOCKON'S INFORMATION,

68
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,529
THE MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED FROM
RIGHT AROUND THIS POINT HERE.

69
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,533
RESIDUAL READINGS.

70
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,703
THERE WAS DEFINITELY
A MOBILE SUIT ON THIS SPOT.

71
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,288
BUT WHOSE?

72
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,170
(Gasps)

73
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,175
THE UNION?

74
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,302
Katagiri:
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
THESE READINGS CONFIRM

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,680
WHAT WE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT POD WE RETRIEVED.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,225
GUESS THEY'RE INVESTIGATING
THIS AREA, TOO.

77
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,770
WHAT DID THE PMC TRUST
SAY ABOUT IT?

78
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,314
THAT IT WENT MISSING DURING
THE MORALIA CONFLICT‐‐

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,774
HUH?

80
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,733
WHAT IS IT?

81
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,197
(Shouting)
IT'S NOT POLITE
TO EAVESDROP!

82
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,156
(Gasps)

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,616
(Thinking)
HE SPOTTED ME!

84
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,993
Graham:
SHOW YOURSELF!

85
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,498
(Nervous gasp)

86
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,041
IT'S JUST
SOME LOCAL KID.

87
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,543
I WONDER...

88
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,920
(Nervously)
UM, I...I HEARD THERE'D
BEEN SOME FIGHTING

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,463
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

90
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,506
AND I JUST...

91
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,966
NOW I SEE.

92
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,384
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

93
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,136
HOW A KID YOUR AGE COULD FIND
THIS STUFF INTERESTING.

94
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,347
BUT THIS PLACE
IS STILL DANGEROUS.

95
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,599
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

96
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,768
OKAY. I'LL DO THAT.

97
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,728
EXCUSE ME.

98
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,610
YOUNG MAN!

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,154
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
CIVIL UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY?

100
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:03,989
(Gasps)

101
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,616
UH, GRAHAM?

102
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,661
I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THIS COUNTRY'S CIVIL UNREST?

103
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,663
I... WELL,
I...

104
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,165
Graham:
I BET IT'S HARD FOR YOU
TO BE OBJECTIVE.

105
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,876
ALRIGHT, WHICH SIDE
DO YOU REALLY SUPPORT?

106
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,546
UH, I DON'T SUPPORT EITHER.

107
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,382
BECAUSE I THINK
BOTH SIDES ARE JUSTIFIED.

108
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,636
BUT THEN, MANY PEOPLE
ARE DYING IN THE FIGHTING.

109
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,389
LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING.

110
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,474
I AGREE WITH YOU.

111
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,935
SHOULD A SOLDIER
LIKE YOU SAY THAT?

112
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,147
Graham:
DO YOU CONSIDER US A NUISANCE
FOR COMING TO THIS COUNTRY?

113
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,149
WELL, A LOT OF
SOLDIERS HERE MEANS

114
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,484
THERE'LL BE
A LOT OF CASUALTIES.

115
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,361
Graham:
BUT YOU'RE FIGHTING, TOO.

116
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,779
(Gasps)

117
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,156
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME SEE

118
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,158
WHAT YOU'RE HIDING
BEHIND YOUR BACK THERE?

119
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,744
(Gasps)

120
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,037
(Frustrated grunt)

121
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,039
THAT'S A SCARY FACE.

122
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,004
HMM.

123
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,339
KATAGIRI,

124
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,923
ABOUT THE MOBILE SUIT
THAT ATTACKED THE ANTENNAS

125
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,383
THE DAY
BEFORE YESTERDAY.

126
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,845
WASN'T IT AN ENACT,
THE LATEST AEU MODEL?

127
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,555
Katagiri:
WHY ARE YOU SAYING
THIS RIGHT NOW?

128
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,557
Graham:
AND APPARENTLY,
THAT MACHINE WAS STOLEN

129
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,851
FROM A PMC IN MORALIA.

130
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,478
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

131
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,854
UH...

132
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,147
(Sighs)

133
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,734
GRAHAM, EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU DID THAT?

134
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,986
YEAH, I WONDER WHY.

135
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,155
MAYBE IT JUST KIND OF
SLIPPED OUT OF ME.

136
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,371
AN ENACT FROM A PMC.

137
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,122
COULD IT BE?!

138
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,381
IT'S HIM.
COULD HE SOMEHOW BE...

139
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:49,135
INVOLVED IN THIS CIVIL UNREST?

140
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,555
BUT WHY?

141
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,932
I HAVE TO KNOW.

142
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,143
WHY IS HE HERE NOW?

143
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:06,861
(Screaming)

144
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,571
Daryl:
TERRORISTS AGAIN?!

145
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,532
Howard: IT'S BECAUSE THESE ARE
REFORMISTS NEIGHBORHOODS.

146
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,909
WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
IN MOBILE SUITS.

147
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,119
WE'LL HAVE TO ASK FOR

148
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,955
ANTI‐PERSONNEL
SUPPRESSION AUTOMATONS.

149
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,331
Howard:
THAT AIN'T
GOING TO HAPPEN.

150
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,875
OUR FORCES ARE HERE SPECIFICALLY
TO CAPTURE GUNDAMS.

151
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,212
THE BRASS ISN'T GOING TO DEPLOY
UNNECESSARY MILITARY STRENGTH.

152
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,132
Daryl:
IT'S A TOUGH WORLD,
ISN'T IT?

153
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,592
Woman:
STOP IT!

154
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:35,140
(Distant gunshots)

155
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,516
Man:
BRING THE WRATH OF GOD!

156
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,767
(Baby crying)

157
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,146
P... PRINCESS MARINA...

158
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,398
Woman:
MAY GOD PROTECT YOU...

159
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,316
WE SHOULD NOT BE HURTING
EACH OTHER, IN THIS‐‐

160
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,196
(Sighs)

161
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,492
I TRY BUT I'M JUST
SO POWERLESS.

162
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,119
(Knock on door)

163
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,707
EXCUSE ME.

164
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,960
WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?

165
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,378
YOUR DEATH!

166
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,588
PUPPET OF THE REFORMISTS!

167
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,131
(Gunshots)

168
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,134
(Gasps)

169
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,725
(Shocked gasp)

170
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,854
(Heavy sigh)

171
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,856
BUT WHY?

172
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,901
Marina:
WHY?

173
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,778
(Emotional gasp)

174
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,571
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!

175
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,114
HOW COULD
WE HATE EACH OTHER ENOUGH

176
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,075
TO RESORT TO SUCH MADNESS?!

177
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,828
HUH?
WHAT IS THAT?

178
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,916
POINT F3987?
WHAT'LL WE FIND THERE?

179
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,542
Setsuna:
MAYBE NOTHING.

180
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,669
BUT THERE USED TO BE
SOMETHING THERE.

181
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,339
WELL, I GUESS IT'S BETTER
THAN DOING NOTHING.

182
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,341
ROGER THAT,
SETSUNA.

183
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,718
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
HONG LONG WITH YOU.

184
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,636
HUH?

185
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,763
IN CASE OF A RESCUE,

186
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,515
HE COULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

187
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,312
DISENGAGING GN SYSTEM REPOSE.

188
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,107
Setsuna:
PRIORITY PASSED TO
SETSUNA F. SEIEI.

189
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,151
DISSOLVE EXTERNAL
CAMOUFLAGE MEMBRANE,

190
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,153
MAINTAIN GN PARTICLE
DISPERSAL.

191
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,155
ENTER BOARDING MODE.

192
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,167
EXIA, NOW COMMENCING MISSION.

193
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,430
SO MR. HONG LONG,
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

194
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,640
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,016
ROGER THAT
THEN!

196
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,144
DYNAMES, NOW HEADING TO TARGET!

197
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,526
HERE!

198
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,154
HEY, BOSS.

199
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,198
NOT ONLY IS HE
REFUSING TO EAT,

200
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,867
BUT THE OLD MAN
WON'T EVEN DRINK WATER.

201
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,119
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT TO

202
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,872
ACCEPT CHARITY
FROM HIS ENEMIES.

203
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,748
MAN, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY

204
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,251
ARE SO DAMN STUBBORN,
AREN'T THEY?

205
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,211
(Gulps)

206
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,337
(Sighs)

207
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,172
THE PLAN IS ALL
MESSED UP NOW BECAUSE OF

208
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,466
CELESTIAL WHATCHAMACALLIT'S
INTERFERENCE.

209
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,260
HEY BOSS!

210
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,887
THERE'S SOMETHING
HEADING OUR WAY!

211
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,638
IS IT A UNION PATROL?

212
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,556
NEGATIVE.

213
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,142
(Grunts)

214
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,977
IT'S THAT WHITE MOBILE SUIT!

215
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,061
(Gasps)

216
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,522
Al‐Saachez:
IT'S A GUNDAM!

217
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,993
EXIA HAS REACHED THE
TARGET POINT.

218
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,333
IF HE'S ANYWHERE, HE'S HERE.

219
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,924
(Beeps)

220
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,846
A MOBILE SUIT!

221
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,848
LET ME DEAL
WITH THE GUNDAM!

222
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,059
TAKE THE OLD MAN AND GET OUT!

223
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,226
Mercenary:
ROGER!

224
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,522
IT'S THAT ENACT AGAIN!

225
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,191
IT'S THAT GUNDAM.

226
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,359
I SEE.

227
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,320
THE PILOT IS
THAT KID FROM KRUGIS!

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,323
THEN IT'S NO WONDER
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS HIDEOUT!

229
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,621
(Metal clashes)

230
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,872
WHAT A SHOCKER!

231
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,666
WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED
THAT LITTLE PUNK

232
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,042
WOULD BE RIDING A GUNDAM!

233
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,544
ISN'T THAT WAR OF YOURS OVER
AND DONE WITH YET?!

234
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,421
HUH?
YOU WANT TO TALK?!

235
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,715
KRUGIS WAS DESTROYED!

236
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,300
(Metal creaking)

237
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,929
(Maniacally)
OF COURSE IT WAS!

238
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,564
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING IN THIS COUNTRY?!

239
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:58,027
TELL ME,
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?!

240
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,237
ANSWER ME!

241
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,822
I DON'T ANSWER
TO YOU!

242
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,824
(Angry grunt)

243
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,579
(Grunts)

244
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,249
(Yelps in pain)

245
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,126
Al‐Saachez:
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO RUIN
THIS MACHINE.

246
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,752
SO HAND IT OVER TO ME!

247
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,338
HOW ABOUT IT, GUNDAM?!

248
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,716
NOT A CHANCE!

249
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,012
HOW DARE YOU!

250
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,431
HOWEVER,

251
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,183
EVERYTHING'S STILL ON TRACK.

252
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,980
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

253
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,609
HUH?

254
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,404
THAT...
THAT'S A...

255
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,406
A GUNDAM!

256
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,536
HEY, BOSS,
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!

257
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,871
(Grunts)

258
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,122
DAMN, I'M GETTING
NOTHING HERE!

259
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,541
LOOK THERE!

260
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,294
DAMN IT!

261
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,504
(Grunts)

262
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,424
(Men yell in pain)

263
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,633
YOU BASTARD!

264
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,635
(Painful grunt)

265
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,515
Mercenary:
DON'T MOVE!

266
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,603
Hong‐Long:
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
HAND THAT MAN OVER.

267
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,480
(Gunshot)

268
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,148
(Two gunshots)

269
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:26,407
I WAS AFRAID I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE RUSTY BUT I GUESS NOT.

270
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,533
WHO ARE YOU?

271
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,285
WE'RE CELESTIAL BEING.

272
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,287
WHAT IS
"CELESTIAL BEING"?

273
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,540
A PRIVATE ARMED ORGANIZATION
THAT IS INTERVENING

274
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,668
IN YOUR COUNTRY'S
CIVIL WAR.

275
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,713
I SEE.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE ALL...

276
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,340
(Distant whirring)

277
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,092
HUH?

278
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,522
COME ABOARD, PLEASE.

279
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,940
WHAT?

280
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,198
THAT'S IT THEN.

281
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,159
I'VE RECEIVED THE FINAL PHASE,
MISS SUMERAGI.

282
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,704
WHAT KIND OF A MISSION
IS THAT?!

283
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,207
DID YOU REALLY SEND THEM
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS?!

284
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,084
THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE AND
EXIA COULD BE‐‐

285
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,419
IT'S THE MOST RELIABLE
OPTION OPEN TO US!

286
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,671
SO?!

287
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,382
I AGREE WITH
MISS SUMERAGI'S PLAN.

288
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,675
YOU WHAT?

289
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,761
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT WE REALLY MEAN.

290
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,514
DEMONSTRATE
CELESTIAL BEING'S IDEALS.

291
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,392
Attendant:
PRINCESS MARINA!

292
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,603
WE'VE RECEIVED AN URGENT
MESSAGE FROM CELESTIAL BEING!

293
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,397
FROM CELESTIAL BEING?!

294
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,775
"WE'VE TAKEN MASSOUD RACHMADI
UNDER OUR PROTECTION!"

295
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,360
"WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE PALACE.

296
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,571
WE WOULD LIKE THE PRINCESS TO
BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS

297
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,573
FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE."

298
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,575
THAT'S ALL.

299
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,452
I UNDERSTAND.
ARRANGE FOR A CONFERENCE.

300
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,373
IT WILL BE DONE.

301
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,333
PRINCESS MARINA.

302
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,377
I CERTAINLY
DO NOT CONDONE THE ACTIONS

303
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,129
THEY'VE TAKEN
AROUND THE WORLD.

304
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,840
AND THERE IS A CHANCE
THIS IS A TRAP.

305
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,469
BUT, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,

306
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,455
I WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

307
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:21,760
(Protesters shouting)

308
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,596
Howard:
IS IT TRUE CELESTIAL BEING
IS HEADING FOR THE PALACE?

309
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,473
AND THEY'VE GOT
THE HOSTAGE WITH THEM?

310
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:29,809
Daryl:
IF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THEN
THIS IS OUR CHANCE, LIEUTENANT!

311
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,352
(Grunts)

312
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:34,647
I'LL BE HERE, GUNDAM,
WATCHING.

313
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,524
(Protesters shouting)

314
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:38,693
Ikeda:
I'M IN FRONT OF
AZADISTAN'S ROYAL PALACE.

315
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,737
AFTER HEARING THAT
MASSOUD RACHMADI

316
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:42,530
HAS BEEN TAKEN
INTO PROTECTIVE CUSTODY

317
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,449
AND IS BEING BROUGHT
TO THE PALACE,

318
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,535
THE CITIZENS HAVE BEGUN
GATHERING HERE.

319
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,955
THIS IS STILL UNCONFIRMED
INFORMATION BUT WE'VE HEARD

320
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:54,334
IT WAS CELESTIAL BEING
THAT ACTUALLY RESCUED RACHMADI.

321
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:55,502
IS IT POSSIBLE
WE'RE GOING TO SEE

322
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:58,129
AN APPEARANCE BY
A GUNDAM SOON?

323
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,548
IN ANY CASE, SHOULD A
CONFERENCE
ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE

324
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,342
BETWEEN PRINCESS MARINA ISMAIL,

325
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,968
THE SYMBOLIC HEAD OF
THE REFORMISTS

326
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:06,554
AND THE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS
LEADER MR. QATAF,

327
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,723
THEN THERE IS NO QUESTION
THAT AZADISTAN WILL BE TAKING

328
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,726
DEFINITE STEPS
TO END THE CIVIL UNREST.

329
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,855
A GUNDAM IS COMING.

330
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:17,232
(Sighs)

331
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:18,566
(Irritated grunt)

332
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,152
GET AWAY FROM SAJI!
HE'S MY MAN!

333
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:25,657
(Protesters shouting)

334
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:26,866
WHAT'S THAT?!

335
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:27,992
Howard:
LIEUTENANT!

336
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,662
YEAH, I SEE IT!

337
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,038
PRINCESS!

338
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,709
(Determined grunt)

339
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:41,130
Ikeda:
IT... IT'S A GUNDAM!

340
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,550
A GUNDAM IS DESCENDING DOWN
ON US FROM ABOVE!

341
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,302
AMAZING!
IT REALLY SHOWED UP!

342
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:48,304
GUNDAM.

343
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:57,438
Ikeda:
THE GUNDAM HAS JUST GENTLY
LANDED IN FRONT OF THE PALACE!

344
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:59,315
IT'S NOT CARRYING ANY WEAPONS!

345
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,527
THE FOOL! SHOWING UP
COMPLETELY UNARMED!

346
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:04,237
I FORBID YOU TO
ATTACK THE GUNDAM!

347
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,196
Agent:
BUT PRINCESS!

348
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,906
AND THAT IS AN ORDER!

349
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,491
(Distant gunshots)

350
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,618
LEAVE OUR PROMISED LAND NOW!

351
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:11,744
Ikeda:
THEY'RE SHOOTING!

352
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:14,664
SEVERAL CITIZENS
ARE FIRING AT THE GUNDAM!

353
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:15,832
BUT WHY?!

354
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,001
SAJI!
LOOK THERE!

355
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,587
Man:
LET ME GO!

356
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:22,714
Ikeda:
THE... THE GUNDAM
HAS BEGUN TO MOVE!

357
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:27,343
IT'S SLOWLY HEADING TOWARD
THE PALACE!

358
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,137
(Panicked shouting)

359
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:30,972
Pilot:
RELEASE THE HOSTAGE
YOU HAVE IN YOUR POSSESSION!

360
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:34,350
I REPEAT! RELEASE THE HOSTAGE
YOU HAVE IN YOUR POSSESSION!

361
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,185
Daryl:
LIEUTENANT!

362
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,811
STAND BY, DARYL!

363
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,153
Setsuna:
THIS TIME...

364
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,574
(Surprised gasp)

365
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:50,575
BUT WHY?!

366
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:52,702
PRINCESS MARINA!

367
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,874
(Shocked gasp)

368
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,043
GUNDAM.

369
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:11,054
(People murmuring)

370
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:17,769
Setsuna:
THIS TIME...

371
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,729
(Thinking)
I'LL BECOME A GUNDAM!

372
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,719
THIS IS THE PALACE.

373
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,180
NOT THE MOST
COMFORTABLE RIDE.

374
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,474
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

375
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:59,018
YOU HAVE MY THANKS
FOR THIS.

376
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,770
PLEASE HURRY.

377
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:08,111
Ikeda:
IT'S MASSOUD RACHMADI!

378
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:10,321
CELESTIAL BEING HAS RESCUED
MR. RACHMADI

379
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,865
AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE PALACE!

380
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,120
(Gasps)

381
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,162
PRINCESS!

382
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:19,080
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

383
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,750
SETSUNA!

384
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,089
IS IT REALLY...
IS IT REALLY YOU UP THERE?

385
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,134
MARINA ISMAIL,
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

386
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:35,471
WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER WE COME BACK OR NOT.

387
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:38,349
SETSUNA.

388
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:43,229
FIGHT FOR THE GOD
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

389
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:45,231
SETSUNA!

390
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,822
Howard:
LIEUTENANT!
LET'S GO AFTER IT!

391
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:54,115
Daryl:
WE CAN TAKE IT!

392
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,409
HOW COULD WE?!

393
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,411
TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT

394
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:01,289
AND WE'D BE SEEN AS VILLAINS
BY THE ENTIRE WORLD!

395
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,128
(Relieved sigh)

396
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:09,380
THAT WAS A NERVOUS MOMENT!

397
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,632
I WONDER, YOUNG LADY,

398
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:14,594
IS THIS REALLY GOING TO SOLVE
THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE HERE?

399
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:16,846
NO, PROBABLY NOT.

400
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:20,558
BUT IT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE
TO TAKE THE FIRST REAL STEPS

401
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,770
TOWARD RESOLVING
THE CONFLICT.

402
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,314
Liu‐Mei:
THEY CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT.

403
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:39,160
Narrator:
MASSOUD RACHMADI PUBLICLY
ANNOUNCED THAT

404
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,121
A GROUP OF MERCENARIES WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KIDNAPPING,

405
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:43,706
AND THAT THE RESULTING
CIVIL UNREST

406
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:45,958
WAS DELIBERATELY PROVOKED.

407
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,544
IT IS BELIEVED THAT A SHADOWY
ORGANIZATION WAS BEHIND

408
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:51,547
THIS ATTEMPT TO DERAIL THE
MODERNIZATION OF AZADISTAN.

409
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:54,926
BUT NO ONE HAS STEPPED FORWARD
TO CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY.

410
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:58,346
SUBSEQUENTLY, MARINA ISMAIL
AND MASSOUD RACHMADI

411
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,765
RELEASED A JOINT STATEMENT
PLEADING FOR THE CITIZENS

412
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:04,477
TO END THE CIVIL WAR AND
REFRAIN FROM TERRORISM.

413
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:09,899
HOWEVER, IN AZADISTAN,
THE CIVIL UNREST CONTINUES.

Narrator:
THE THREE NATIONAL GROUPS
INITIATE A CONFLICT

420
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:47,538
BY HOLDING
A JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE.

421
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,123
WHAT CROSSES
THE MEISTERS' MINDS

422
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,334
AS THEY HEAD TO THEIR
PLACE OF DEATH?

423
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:54,462
NEXT EPISODE:
"DAWN OF DETERMINATION".

424
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:56,714
IS THIS WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A GUNDAM?
