00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,583
[Music]

2
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,125
No, it can't be.

3
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,875
Eren is dead.

4
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,333
I killed her.

5
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,583
For the longest time,
I tried to hang on,

6
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,791
I tried to convince myself
that she was still alive.

7
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,791
That was my only hope
to gain her forgiveness.

8
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,666
But I can't
believe that anymore.

9
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,166
She's gone.

10
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,416
This is really starting
to wear on my patience.

11
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,541
I lost four goddamn men
on your coke deal,

12
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,000
and another one today.

13
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,708
This last one
hits too close to home.

14
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,250
Muroto's been
a good friend of mine

15
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,833
since we were kids
coming up in the family.

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,708
I want you to tell me
what's going on,

17
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,083
and if I don't like
what I hear, Shiga,

18
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,208
feel free
to kill them both.

19
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,958
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:42,750
Lizzie...

21
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,541
Mr. Godo, I'll ask you
to be rational.

22
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,791
Shooting each other here,

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,041
it would certainly thrill
Muroto's killer.

24
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
But would do nothing
to bring your friend back,

25
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,250
or help you get a seat
at Inferno's table.

26
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,833
I was under the impression
that you ordered the killing.

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,500
If you want to be
suspicious of me,

28
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,666
that's your prerogative.

29
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,041
However, if you choose to
fire your weapon,

30
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,125
you should be prepared
for the fallout.

31
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,125
C'mon, Claudia, I know
you're better than that.

32
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,958
I'm sure you have a plan
that'll save us the trouble

33
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,416
of blowing
each other's brains out.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,333
Yes, of course I do,

35
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,083
and I'd like you to stand by
while I put it into action.

36
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,250
In three days,

37
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,083
I'll have the ringleader
smoked out.

38
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,041
Then you can do
what you will with them.

39
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,708
This'll be interesting.

40
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,375
Let's see how Inferno takes
responsibility for this mess.

41
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,416
You wanna try
a counter snipe?

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,416
That's right.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,708
I don't know.

44
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,875
Day after tomorrow,
the Godos will be invited

45
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,291
to a meeting
of Inferno's senior members.

46
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,250
Once there,
they will be officially approved

47
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,875
to join the organization.

48
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,208
Once that happens,

49
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,083
even Wisemel with
all of his underhanded dealings,

50
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,708
can't touch them.

51
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,708
So this will be
his last opportunity.

52
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,208
I suspect he'll take it.

53
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,458
Isaac...

54
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,083
You're still suspicious
of that guy?

55
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,708
All of those shootings
that happened the other day,

56
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,458
and Muroto's murder.

57
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,333
Wisemel's the only one
who would stand to benefit.

58
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
So we need to watch him
carefully.

59
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,416
The meeting will be held
in a conference room

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,791
with a large window

61
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,333
on the fifth floor
of the Atrium Hotel.

62
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,708
So we're putting
the prey on display.

63
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,333
It shouldn't be difficult
to find a spot

64
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,083
with a clear view
of the meeting.

65
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,166
You really think it's smart

66
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,416
to keep using
the Godo family as bait?

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,541
If it works, then yes.

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,875
However, I haven't
forgotten what a gamble it is

69
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,958
without my one and only...

70
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,375
my Phantom.

71
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,833
Oh, good!
He's home!

72
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,791
I hope you had a good day.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,458
Like any other.

74
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,875
Wait just a sec,

75
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,958
I'll run into the kitchen
and reheat you some soup.

76
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Hey, Cal!

77
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,250
I found this when I was
cleaning up the place.

78
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,500
Did you disassemble it?

79
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,333
Yeah.
Sorry.

80
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,625
I'll fix it.

81
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,208
So tell me...

82
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,083
you good with machines
and stuff?

83
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,166
I've always kinda liked
taking stuff apart

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,958
and putting it back together.

85
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,125
I guess I just want to know

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,000
how everything works
or somethin'.

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,416
Okay.
It's ready.

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,666
Good.

89
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Now put it back
where you found it.

90
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:44,791
Got it.

91
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,125
Is that work?

92
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,375
It is.

93
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,333
Do you wanna sit down
and help me figure out

94
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,583
what I should do?

95
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,125
Oh yeah, totally!

96
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,041
What is it?

97
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,458
Look here.

98
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,833
The target'll be on the fifth
floor of this building.

99
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,416
So I gotta assume
the sniper will be shooting

100
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,291
from this side.

101
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,083
Are you the sniper?

102
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,083
No, I'm not.

103
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,333
Someone else.

104
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,333
And I don't know who yet.

105
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,541
Our job is to try and figure
out where this guy is gonna be.

106
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,000
Gotcha.

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,791
But he can't do it
from just anywhere.

108
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,875
He'll choose the place

109
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,208
that best meets
the criteria of the hit.

110
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,291
Whaddaya mean?

111
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,833
Well, the place will need to be
high enough to see the target,

112
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,750
but still keep the shooter
out of the line of sight.

113
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,458
Like maybe a roof top
or somethin'?

114
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,541
I don't see why not.

115
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
Well then, what about here?

116
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,750
I don't know,
it seems too close.

117
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,291
If the target can
catch a glimpse of the shooter,

118
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,791
then the jig's up.

119
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,083
The guy's gonna
have to settle down

120
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
at least 400 yards away.

121
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,833
Four hundred yards!

122
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,708
He can still hit the target
from there?

123
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,000
Depending on equipment
and skills,

124
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,916
he could get a good shot off
from up to 800 yards away.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,708
Whoa!

126
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,791
So like, he could
basically be anywhere.

127
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,291
How are we gonna
narrow it down?

128
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,750
I don't know,

129
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,541
but there are a whole
lotta places to choose from.

130
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,166
It's your homework
before bedtime.

131
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,416
Now let's eat dinner.

132
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,333
You figure out the situation?

133
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,791
I did.
It's all good.

134
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,458
Don't you worry.

135
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't screw this up.

136
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,250
You do, I'll cut off your balls
and feed 'em to my dogs.

137
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,791
I understand, sir.

138
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,833
What's the matter?

139
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,666
I was wondering...

140
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,541
Is it hard to aim
from a really high place?

141
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,416
Or like uncomfortable?

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,625
What makes you say that?

143
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,208
The way you hold the gun,
when you point it so far down,

144
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,166
it seems hard,
a little unnatural.

145
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,583
What is it?
Does that sound stupid?

146
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,000
Not at all.

147
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,625
You gotta good point.

148
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,291
It is pretty hard to shoot
with your body posed that way.

149
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,083
It seems like it to me.

150
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,708
So maybe we can forget about
looking for him

151
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,583
in really high places.

152
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,083
He'll probably wanna be
on the same level as the target.

153
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,916
Somewhere that's gonna be
easy for him to see it.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,625
So if we think of it that way,

155
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
we cut down the number
of places he could be.

156
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,208
I think you're
on to something.

157
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,541
So I'm right?

158
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,416
You're doing pretty good so far.

159
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,166
That's awesome!

160
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,791
We'll do the rest of the work
when we get to the site.

161
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,375
Hope you don't mind
coming with me.

162
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,166
Omigod, really?

163
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm going somewhere with you!

164
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,666
Don't forget,
this is still work.

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,833
Yes!

166
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,708
Sorry to bother you.

167
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,083
I thought you should know
Muroto's body

168
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,666
went back to Japan
earlier today.

169
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,375
Kakinuma and Tsuzuki
are flying in

170
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,041
on the redeye tonight,

171
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
and are bringing
all of their men with them.

172
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,500
Any word on guns?

173
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,875
I had Giuseppe get them.

174
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,375
They'll be in hand
by tomorrow afternoon.

175
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,375
Well, he'd better
come through for us.

176
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,833
Goodbye drink to Muroto?

177
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,875
Yeah.

178
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,416
You should really join me
on this one.

179
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,666
May he rest in peace.

180
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,833
Sonofabitch Muroto.

181
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,791
Died without
finishing the bottle.

182
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,458
He's not the only one.

183
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,875
Homura and Shinjou
got taken outta the game too.

184
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,625
I've gotten
five of my men killed

185
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,708
in this foreign shithole
since we got here.

186
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,875
Millions of dollars
are at stake.

187
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,916
It's natural
for it to turn into a war.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,333
I'm sure that every one of them
understood that.

189
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,833
Yes, it's war.

190
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,000
That's why
I'm pissed at myself

191
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,916
for letting Muroto
go out without a gun.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,541
What the hell
was I thinking?

193
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,750
I should've known better.

194
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,625
Goddammit, I know
Inferno's behind all this,

195
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,458
and they're gonna pay for it.

196
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,000
They owe us bodies.

197
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,500
Speaking of Inferno...

198
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,750
listen.

199
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,125
I've got some
fairly deep suspicions

200
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,541
of that Claudia woman.

201
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,083
Well, let me hear 'em.

202
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,750
Our involvement
in her little caper last year

203
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,958
puts the two of us
directly in the crosshairs.

204
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,958
If push comes to shove
on this matter,

205
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,291
I suspect she'll find a way
to take us out of the equation.

206
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,208
Listen, Shiga.

207
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,416
In this case,
I gotta tell ya,

208
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Claudia's an innocent woman.

209
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,041
You have any proof to that?

210
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,541
Proof?

211
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,000
Shiga...

212
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,875
You know
what the tattoo on my back is.

213
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,208
Five colored spheres
and a rising dragon.

214
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,500
The dragon on my back,
he feels it.

215
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,125
That woman...

216
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,250
she carries
the same dragon on her back.

217
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,916
The two of us share
the same kind of spirit,

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,958
a dragon,
that gains control of heaven

219
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,416
by first conquering
the spheres.

220
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,916
So, I think I should leave
the matter in her hands for now.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,833
It's hard to explain.

222
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,333
This probably
sounds crazy to you.

223
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,583
You've always been
the rational one.

224
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,583
That said,

225
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,291
I'm counting on your wisdom
to pull me through this.

226
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,875
You need to trust me.

227
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,208
But more importantly,
you need to trust my spirit.

228
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,041
If you insist that much of me,

229
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,916
I suppose.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,041
But I can't help
but to keep one eye open.

231
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,875
Thanks for coming.

232
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,166
Wonder what Inferno's
gonna think about this.

233
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,583
Can't wait to find out.

234
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,500
Come on, Cal!

235
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,250
Yeah, I'll be right there!

236
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,291
Since we're going out,
I wanted to look cute.

237
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,500
Shall we?

238
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,625
Let's!

239
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
Okay,
that's the target building.

240
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,541
First we need to
narrow down the places

241
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,625
that meet the criteria
we talked about,

242
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,875
then we walk the streets

243
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,083
and identify
the most viable location.

244
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,291
How do we do that?

245
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,916
Look for a weather vane.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,958
How come?

247
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,458
Part of the preparation.

248
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,791
Without it,
even the most skilled pros

249
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,458
couldn't pull off
a difficult sniping.

250
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,875
Look around,

251
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,500
there are tall buildings
everywhere.

252
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,541
It's windy.

253
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,083
That's right.

254
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,875
A strong wind can screw up
what should be a clear shot.

255
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,208
You don't wanna miss.

256
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,083
So you have to make sure
that you can see the wind.

257
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,041
Yeah, but you can't
see the wind.

258
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,000
So, you use that.

259
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,333
Yeah, like a lotta snipers
will put up something like this

260
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,000
that'll catch the wind
and tell us what it's doing.

261
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
Cool, we gonna walk around

262
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,791
and look for something
hanging like that?

263
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,333
Maybe in a place
where it sticks out?

264
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,708
That's how we roll.

265
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:58,750
Hey, Cal.

266
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,500
Hey!
Oh, sorry.

267
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,291
I didn't find anything yet.

268
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,416
Yeah, me, neither.

269
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,416
Well, on we go.

270
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,500
Alright,
that's it for today.

271
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,625
Hey, hold on.

272
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,000
Look!

273
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,791
This place seems
a little weird.

274
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,958
How so?

275
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:28,750
Check it out.

276
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,166
Good catch!
Nice one.

277
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,208
I got it?

278
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,041
You did.

279
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,375
Yeah, this is it alright.

280
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,916
Our sniper's gonna be
right there.

281
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,125
Okay.

282
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,666
So I guess you're gonna
wanna be here

283
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,041
to get a good shot at him.

284
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,250
Yeah.

285
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,166
Is he the one?

286
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,333
You think he's the one
who killed Judy?

287
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,458
I don't know.

288
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,500
Probably.

289
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,916
I'd at least
be willing to bet

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,625
he's
one of the people responsible.

291
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,750
I wanna be with you
when it happens.

292
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,625
Please let me see it.

293
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,041
I want to see you shoot
this guy in the head!

294
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,208
You shouldn't
want to see that, Cal,

295
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,375
no one should.

296
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,791
I saw Judy.

297
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
It happened
right in front of me.

298
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,625
Nobody asked me
if I wanted to see it,

299
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,541
but I had to watch her die.

300
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,125
Sometimes, a sniping mission
will be assigned to two people

301
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,333
that are working together.

302
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,791
Like a team.

303
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,916
Some say a sniper
needs an assistant.

304
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,000
The assistant will spot,

305
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
their job is to keep an eye
on the target

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
and the surroundings.

307
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,791
It helps the sniper
stay focused.

308
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,125
They're like an observer.

309
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
They watch,
but they don't shoot.

310
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,125
Can you do that?

311
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,166
Yes!

312
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,791
All right,
give me your hand.

313
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,250
What for?

314
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,916
Your payment for today.

315
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,625
Oh, wow!

316
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,916
Ohmigod, thank you!

317
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,666
I'll take good care of it.

318
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,916
I promise I will, always.

319
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,083
That's where he's gonna be,
the sun'll be behind us.

320
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,750
So he shouldn't
be able to see us.

321
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,375
That's the plan at least.

322
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,208
It's time.

323
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,083
Isaac and his guys
just got here.

324
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,708
Good.

325
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,333
Funny thing is,
Randy Weber's M.I.A.

326
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,333
Seems a little
suspicious to me.

327
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,500
This is a pretty big deal,

328
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,833
so why wouldn't he bring
his right hand man

329
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,791
along with him?

330
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,541
You think they're gonna
try to pull something?

331
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,541
Today's the big day.

332
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,916
I can't wait to see

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,333
what that woman
is gonna pull out of her ass.

334
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,916
How do I look, boys?

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,958
A stunning white suit
and a loaded gun.

336
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,916
Seems appropriate
for jumping into hell.

337
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,500
Let's go, Shiga.

338
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,041
Yes, sir.

339
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,833
Wherever you go, you can
count on me to follow you there.

340
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,708
I don't see anyone
over there, Reiji.

341
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,291
Do you think he could maybe
be hiding someplace else?

342
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,625
Just relax, it's early.

343
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,333
Welcome, sirs, to Inferno.

344
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,541
It's him!

345
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,166
He's behind the water tower!

346
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,500
I see him.

347
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,916
What about a face?

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,541
Can you see his face?

349
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,875
All I see is the gun.

350
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,958
I can't even tell
if it's a man or a woman.

351
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,541
This is bad, Reiji!

352
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,333
He's about to fire!
Hurry!

353
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,541
No way!

354
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,666
It can't be her.

355
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,875
What's wrong?

356
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,708
I know what I did.

357
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,791
She's dead!

358
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,416
She's dead!

359
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,750
I killed her!

360
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,500
Eren!

361
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,583
Come on! Shoot him!

362
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,916
Show yourself!

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,083
Reiji?

364
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,750
Show me your face!

365
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:46,791
Get him!

366
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,458
No!

367
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,416
Ohmigod, Reiji,
are you okay?

368
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Did he get you?

369
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
I'm fine!

370
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,583
It's just a scratch.

371
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,291
You're so stupid.

372
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,833
Why would you
do something so stupid?

373
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,875
Couldn't help it.

374
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,250
Chalk it up to some kinda
morbid curiosity.

375
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,041
You did a good job today.

376
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,833
I'm proud of you.

377
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,666
Come on, Cal,
you got revenge for Judy.

378
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,500
That's a big deal.

379
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,541
Yeah.

380
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,333
Listen...

381
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,166
we know who's been pulling
the strings this whole time.

382
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,416
It's over.

383
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
I can't believe
you bastards!

384
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,583
What the heck just happened?

385
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,041
The one we got wasn't alone.

386
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:22,958
What?

387
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,916
Can't be!

388
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,583
No way.

389
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,333
Mission accomplished.

390
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,541
No way!

391
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,541
Yes...

392
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,625
Master.

393
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,458
[Music]

394
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,833
I can't live without him.

395
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,875
I wanna be with him forever.

396
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,458
I'll try so hard.

397
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,791
I'll do whatever I have to

398
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,333
to make him feel
the same way about me.
