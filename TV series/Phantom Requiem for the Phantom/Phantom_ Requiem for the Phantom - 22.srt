[Music]

2
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,958
It's a pleasure
to meet you, really.

3
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,833
So you're her...

4
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,625
the very first person
to be called Phantom.

5
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,708
But...

6
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,375
you're not Phantom anymore.

7
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:11,583
That name
belongs to me now.

8
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:20,041
Actually,
Scythe calls me Drei.

9
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,625
Ein, Zwei, Drei...

10
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,666
Pretty predictable, huh?

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,208
You sure like to talk more
than we did.

12
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,083
Does Phantom kill by talking you
to death these days?

13
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,833
If all I wanted to do
was kill you,

14
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,958
you'd already be dead.

15
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,833
Come on, sounds like
pretty boring work to me.

16
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,666
Finding you,
cornering you,

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,166
and then finally
killing you.

18
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,958
It's been my dream
for what seems like forever.

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:52,083
It's even worth working
for those assholes at Inferno.

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,083
I think I should have
as much fun as possible.

21
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,666
Watching you run,
and watching you die.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,041
Really!

23
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,125
Will that satisfy you?

24
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,500
Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,833
Ohmigod, you should have seen
the look on Reiji's face

26
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,875
when he saw me
roll up on 'im!

27
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,875
He turned all pale and white
like he saw a freakin' ghost.

28
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,458
What'll top that?

29
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me think.

30
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,208
I guess I should kill you
in front of him.

31
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,375
That should definitely
do the trick.

32
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,375
That'd be awesome.

33
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,750
What do you think
he'll do then?

34
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,333
You'll never know.

35
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,750
Unfortunately you ran into me
here instead of him.

36
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
So you'll never know...

37
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,791
what he'd do,
you'll be dead.

38
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,666
Ooh! So you came strapped.

39
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,708
All this to protect
Prince Reiji.

40
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,416
Is he really that important?

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Obviously he is,
at least you think so.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,041
What?

43
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,333
Ever since
he abandoned you,

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,458
you can't seem to get him
out of your mind.

45
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,250
You can't stop wondering
how he feels.

46
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,083
You hope
it's tearing him apart.

47
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,791
It's not,
Reiji's changed.

48
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,375
He's learned a lot
since then.

49
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,500
The past is behind him,
where it should be.

50
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,041
So what?

51
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:29,291
It means, he's put you
behind him as well.

52
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
And if you stand
in his way...

53
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,625
I know.

54
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,708
...he will shoot you down.

55
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,708
What are you,
his goddamn shrink?

56
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,625
I just know him
better than you.

57
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,791
I know his true strength.

58
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,416
Well, speak of
the freakin' devil.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,083
Please, stop this.

60
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,000
Nobody here
has gotta die today.

61
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,250
Awww!
Did you hear what I heard?

62
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,625
So, I guess that means
you don't know him

63
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,500
as well as you think you do.

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,041
The players
are not all assembled.

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,875
There are still some
waiting in the wings.

66
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,333
Keep moving.

67
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,291
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,583
Do it!

69
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,458
Shoot.

70
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
I said stop it.

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,291
Right now.

72
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,416
Reiji, in your mind,
I was already dead.

73
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,583
Just make it official,
you'll feel better.

74
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,041
No way.

75
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,041
Come on, man up.

76
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,750
Send me to hell
where you want me.

77
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,291
I'll just take her along
for some company.

78
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,250
What is this
kindergarten shit?

79
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,833
Dammit! I knew
this would happen.

80
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,833
Why you gotta
keep acting a fool?

81
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,875
This is none
of your business.

82
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,041
We are in Japan!

83
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,208
There is no way in hell
people are not gonna notice

84
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,458
you firin' off a gun
in the middle of the day!

85
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,875
Who gives a crap?

86
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,166
Alright.

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,708
Go on ahead, fire then.

88
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,333
But right after that,

89
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,583
I'm gonna start firin'
till I empty this whole clip

90
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,958
in all three of your asses.

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,750
Now...

92
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,958
Listen to me, girl,
calm down.

93
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,041
Put down your gun
and walk outta here.

94
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,208
I've got a clear shot
on both of them.

95
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,791
Pow!

96
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,500
This sucks.

97
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,708
You guys are no fun.

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Go home.

99
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:09,083
Inferno made her
the next one, that child.

100
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,375
And, I guess
I'm her new babysitter.

101
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,666
I think that I'd rather be
deep in the ground somewhere.

102
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,125
I'm glad it's you.

103
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,875
Someone has to.
And I hate to break it to you,

104
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,208
but your little
back-to-school special is over.

105
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Inferno knows where you are.

106
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,583
So you need to go ahead
and get the hell outta dodge.

107
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,500
And I mean right now.

108
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,708
Also, Blondie's gone
kinda nuts.

109
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,583
I can't promise that I can
rein her in for much longer.

110
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,958
Alright, we'll run.

111
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,541
Hold on.

112
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,541
Lizzie, listen...

113
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,333
Enjoy life
while you got it, okay.

114
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,583
Don't make the same mistake
that Clo did.

115
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,375
Would you have shot her?

116
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,333
How about you, could you?

117
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,166
Eren!

118
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,250
If it'd gone further,
what would you have done

119
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:12,791
if you really had to
make a decision?

120
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,833
That won't happen.

121
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,250
We don't have much time.

122
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,541
We need to look
for an escape route,

123
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,875
I can handle that.

124
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,125
Also we need to get Inferno
to put a leash on Drei

125
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,083
at least until we get out.

126
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,208
It's time to play
our trump card.

127
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,625
Hurry up, Mio!

128
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,291
We'll leave you here.

129
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,458
Oh, sorry!

130
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,708
What is it?

131
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,208
Excuse me, sir.

132
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,625
There's a call for you.

133
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,041
Who is it?

134
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,791
Well, sir,
he won't give his name,

135
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,958
but he says
he's Claudia's right hand man.

136
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,458
What's this about?

137
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,458
It's been awhile, Shiga.

138
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
Two years.

139
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,708
Who is this?

140
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,750
I told you who I was.

141
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,166
Claudia's right hand man.

142
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,416
That kid that was
always by her side.

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,166
He was an assassin.

144
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,625
Phantom.

145
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,375
So you remember.

146
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,500
Last I heard, Inferno
was asking for your head.

147
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,083
Are you looking for mercy?

148
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,291
You're familiar
with Shinokura Academy?

149
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,875
Oh, my god!

150
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,041
So you must know

151
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,541
that Kaiten Godo's
illegitimate daughter

152
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,833
goes to that high school.

153
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,916
But she goes by Mio Fujieda.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,416
Let me make this
perfectly clear;

155
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,958
she is off limits!

156
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,625
She has nothing
to do with this!

157
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,291
Don't worry.

158
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,125
As long as we're safe,
she's safe.

159
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,416
So you better help us
stay safe.

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,958
What do you mean?

161
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,125
Inferno has sent an assassin
to take me down.

162
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,291
I need you to throw
your weight around a bit.

163
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,500
Put a collar
on Inferno's dog.

164
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,583
This is your turf, after all.

165
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,875
How dare you?

166
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,666
Do it, or not.

167
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,541
It's up to you.

168
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,208
This has nothing
to do with her!

169
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,291
Make sure
it stays that way.

170
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,291
Dammit.

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,125
Your acting's gotten better.

172
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
Nice work.

173
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,250
Still not as good as you.

174
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,708
Hopefully, this play will
buy us a little more time.

175
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,083
Shiga understands,
he's smart.

176
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,416
I'm sure he'll decide
to play along.

177
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,791
But what if he doesn't?

178
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,791
In that case, we'll think
of something else.

179
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,875
I don't want to put Mio
in any real danger.

180
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:05,208
Reiji, are you happy
that Cal's alive?

181
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,166
Yeah.

182
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,375
I thought that I was poisonous,
everything I touched,

183
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,291
all I cared about
withered and died.

184
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:21,791
But she's still alive,
broken but still living.

185
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:26,125
Tomorrow, I'll head north
at daybreak.

186
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,041
I know of a smuggler
that runs a cargo boat,

187
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
I'll go talk to him
in person.

188
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,916
All by yourself?

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,083
Yes.

190
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,583
You need to stay with Mio.

191
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,666
I guess we should head home!

192
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,750
It's gotten kinda late,

193
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,708
I still need to
make us dinner!

194
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,625
Hey, Phantom!

195
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,500
The higher ups
called me earlier.

196
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,750
This is bullshit!

197
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,541
Well, I guess
she already heard.

198
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,250
And isn't too happy.

199
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,583
Kaiten Godo's progeny,

200
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,291
whose existence
has been kept hidden.

201
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,041
Seems like Ein and Zwei knew
exactly what they were doing.

202
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,291
Their choice of disguise has
proven to be quite brilliant.

203
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,458
I don't give a crap about
the damn Japanese Mafia!

204
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,916
I know you don't,
but look,

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,458
the Godo Family is a major
player in Inferno,

206
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,208
so we gotta do what they say.

207
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,791
Correct.

208
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,791
Your hands are tied
until the Godos

209
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,750
confirm the girl's
lasting safety.

210
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,708
Zwei has outsmarted you.

211
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,916
I'm sure another chance
will come.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,166
But we will have to wait
'til then.

213
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
Goddammit!

214
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,458
You want us to watch
a high school girl?

215
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,791
That's correct.

216
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,833
Who is she, sir?

217
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,333
All you need to know

218
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,791
is that she is of high value
to the Godo Family,

219
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,833
as well as me personally.

220
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,291
And, uh, you need all of us
to tail her?

221
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,583
Yes, I do.

222
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,750
Protect this girl
with your very lives.

223
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,791
Got it?

224
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,125
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,541
So you really hate Reiji,
don't ya?

226
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,958
Yes.

227
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,208
That's what's kept me going.

228
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,833
And it's the only reason
why I've been putting up

229
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,083
with all this crap from this
goddamn operation for so long.

230
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,375
I've been waiting for the chance
to kill him all this time.

231
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,125
And now, I am so close.

232
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,291
To be honest with you,
I think putting the brakes on

233
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,000
is a good thing.

234
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,541
Yeah?

235
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,458
I don't wanna see you two
kill each other, Cal.

236
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,958
It's just a waste of life,
so yeah.

237
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
So in your mind,
we'd both go down.

238
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,500
You don't think
that I could win?

239
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,125
It's not that.

240
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,916
Reiji did pull a bunch of crap
a few years ago

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,583
and told a lotta lies
to Inferno.

242
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,958
I even felt a little burned.

243
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
Because he's a damn
con artist.

244
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,958
But in your case,

245
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,708
he was only lying
to protect you.

246
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,500
It was really
for your own good.

247
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,041
Don't give me that crap!

248
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,666
He lied from the moment
he met me.

249
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,833
He kept me in the dark

250
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,833
and told me
whatever the hell he wanted.

251
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,666
He was scared
out of his mind.

252
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,250
He knew he couldn't
keep the act up forever.

253
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,125
I'd see right through it.

254
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,458
He wanted to keep you
outta all that violence,

255
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,541
He lied so you wouldn't
get dragged into it.

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,500
Oh, please!

257
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,833
The only person that bastard
ever cared about was himself.

258
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,291
He abandoned me.

259
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,833
And as soon as he got himself
in over his head with me,

260
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,500
he split with that girl.

261
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,291
Even if that was the case,

262
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,833
that's still no reason
to follow in his footsteps

263
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,291
and start killing too.

264
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,333
Is this really what you wanted
to do with your life?

265
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,291
It's exactly what I wanted.

266
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,166
I was pitiful and weak,

267
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,666
but now, I can scare
a crying child into silence.

268
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,041
All those big shots

269
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,666
that used to do
whatever the hell they wanted,

270
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,375
tremble at my name.

271
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,458
It's really
a dream come true.

272
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,000
Kicking those assholes around,
listening to them beg,

273
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,958
and putting them
outta their misery...

274
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:19,250
sounds like
a great life to me.

275
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,541
Reiji saw this in me,
and it terrified him.

276
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,750
He was afraid of me.

277
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,375
He knew I was gonna be
stronger than him.

278
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,833
So he tried to throw me away
before that happened.

279
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,791
Now he's gonna pay for that.

280
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,333
Cal...

281
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,333
all that rage...

282
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,166
It's gonna burn you out.

283
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,000
Did Eren really not come
to school today?

284
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,708
Yeah, she started
having a fever last night.

285
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,625
I'm sure it's just
a little cold.

286
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,916
I can totally
help out with that.

287
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sure I can figure out
some way to take it from her.

288
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,333
Hey! You know,
seeing you two chatting here

289
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,666
makes me think
that some villages

290
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,833
are missing their idiots.

291
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,833
Shut up.

292
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,166
So listen, we're gonna
see a movie later,

293
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,416
and if you want,
I'll let you guys tag along.

294
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,958
I guess that's an invitation?

295
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,750
Mio will be there.

296
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,125
Wow! I am in high demand today!

297
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,833
Can't do it though,
I already got plans.

298
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,625
You got a date or something?

299
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,208
That... could... be... it.

300
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,250
Well, I guess it's just
the two of us.

301
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,208
I guess so.

302
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,541
It's not like her.

303
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,333
Normally,
she just orders me around.

304
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,750
This is sneakier than usual.

305
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,250
Yeah.

306
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,875
Poor Eren.

307
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,250
I hope she starts
feeling better soon.

308
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, let's go get our tickets.

309
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,583
I need to stay out
for a while anyway

310
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,458
so Eren can get some rest.

311
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,541
Cool!

312
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,708
This is perfect.

313
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,000
If I start hanging around Mio,

314
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,541
Shiga will think
I mean business.

315
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,583
I guess I got
a little carried away.

316
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,291
How embarrassing.

317
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,416
It's fine.

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,375
What did you think
of the movie?

319
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
I'm kinda glad
Sanae picked it out for us.

320
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:48,083
You know, Reiji,

321
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,375
I think you're
a really mysterious guy.

322
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,041
What?

323
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,375
It's not bad,
you're just different.

324
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,500
It's like you see the world
in your own special way.

325
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,166
What do you mean?

326
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,875
I don't know.

327
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:06,125
It's like most people
seem to take life for granted.

328
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
But not you.

329
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,208
You seem to really appreciate
things more than most folks.

330
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,750
Just being with you makes me
enjoy things a lot more...

331
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,583
it makes me happy.

332
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,291
It makes me remember

333
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,916
that even when things
aren't that exciting,

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,375
they still have meaning
if you look.

335
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,916
I think most people
have forgotten that these days.

336
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,791
Am I interrupting?

337
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,000
Who is that?

338
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,250
Okay.

339
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,375
So that chick
is the Yakuza princess.

340
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,250
First Ein,

341
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,666
then me,

342
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,666
then old man Godo's daughter,

343
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,041
You've got a real talent for
picking out the girls you use,

344
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,875
doncha?

345
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,500
I know you're not really
gonna do crap to her.

346
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,916
You don't have
the balls for it.

347
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,125
Listen.

348
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,166
Now, back to the game.

349
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,541
We gotta settle
who the real Phantom is,

350
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,583
who deserves that title.

351
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,416
Looks to me like it's you.

352
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,416
I'm, I'm just an average
ordinary person now.

353
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,458
Oh, please!

354
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,541
Don't give me that crap, Reiji.

355
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,625
I know you better than that.

356
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,916
If you want my head, Cal,
you got it.

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,750
Is that so?

358
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,916
You've been running
for way too long

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,375
to just give up.

360
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,041
I don't believe you.

361
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,333
You don't wanna die now.

362
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,541
You're just lying to me.

363
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,958
If you were to kill me,

364
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,750
it'd be what I deserve.

365
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,625
It'd just be karma
finally coming back

366
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,583
to bite me in the ass.

367
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,708
One thing,
you can kill me,

368
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,791
and Eren does not get hurt.

369
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,375
Right?

370
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll trade my life for hers.

371
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,000
So you're willing
to sacrifice yourself

372
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,041
for that bitch?

373
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,500
She's not gonna
cause any problems

374
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,625
for Scythe or Inferno.

375
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,208
I know she won't.

376
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,416
You're too goddamned selfish
for me to believe you.

377
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,958
You abandoned me,

378
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,458
and left me for dead
just to save your ass.

379
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,541
Now you're telling me

380
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,833
you'd give up your own life
for hers?

381
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,666
You gotta understand,
I thought you were dead, Cal.

382
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,125
You'll get your wish.

383
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,250
I promise I'll kill you
eventually.

384
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,833
But first,
I'm gonna make you suffer.

385
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,041
You understand?

386
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,375
Then I'll kill you.

387
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,875
Reiji!

388
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:12,541
We are ghosts
that have no place to haunt.

389
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,375
Non-existent phantoms.

390
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,166
[Music]

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,666
If you can't pull
the trigger by then,

392
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,958
My guess,
you're just too soft.

393
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:50,250
It's gotta be kill or be killed
in this business, right?
