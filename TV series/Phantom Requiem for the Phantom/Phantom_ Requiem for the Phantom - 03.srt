2
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,250
Romero.

3
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,916
I wonder,

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,625
if you had his life,

5
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,416
would you have that same
calm expression he does?

6
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,500
I thought surely
you'd be gone by now.

7
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,083
Shouldn't you be
headed to Mexico?

8
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,041
Yes, but before I say adios,
I wanted to remind you

9
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,375
you better be
on your best behavior

10
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,500
while I'm not around
to look after you.

11
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,416
So, what's up
with this passport?

12
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,958
He's kind of a handsome
little guy, don't you think?

13
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,208
You're asking
the wrong girl about that.

14
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,250
I can't tell the difference

15
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,416
between any of
those Asian dudes.

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,791
All I can say is
he looks like

17
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,125
he doesn't have a single care
in the world to me.

18
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,916
Well, you think
he could be a killer?

19
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,666
Honey, he doesn't look like
he'd hurt a fly.

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
Good.

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,375
That's exactly what
we're looking for.

22
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,708
One thing you must remember.

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,708
A knife can be used as
both a weapon and as a shield.

24
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,208
Now then.

25
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,541
But you must also
remember this, Zwei.

26
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,583
While deflecting your enemy's
attacks with the knife,

27
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,750
you have one hand open
to attack with as well.

28
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,833
That first time,
you were goin' easy on me.

29
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,958
Don't rely on
submission holds,

30
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,750
never forget
there is a knife.

31
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,125
The body
of Special Agent Theodore Brice

32
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,625
was discovered in Tijuana
this afternoon.

33
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,875
When learning languages,

34
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,625
you must use
your ears and your eyes.

35
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,250
...with a suspected
terror group at the center.

36
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,625
Brice was allegedly looking
into the activities

37
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,666
of Noche de Songre--

38
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,125
- Sure.
- ...a drug gang with ties

39
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,166
to many terrorist attacks

40
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
in both Central
and South America.

41
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,875
Officials have declined
further comment,

42
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,250
but it is widely believed

43
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,333
that this group may have
had a hand in the murder.

44
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,541
She's gonna kill someone else.

45
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,333
[Music]

46
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,833
And how is our friend Zwei?

47
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,166
Skill-wise, he is very close
to being completed.

48
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,000
Excellent.

49
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,250
Impeccable timing.

50
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,958
Disrobe please, Ein.

51
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,750
Yes.

52
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,166
Absolute perfection!

53
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,500
Who would suspect

54
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,000
that beneath this
beautiful, flawless exterior,

55
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,958
beats the heart
of a hardened killer.

56
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,083
Take it.

57
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,291
My Ein.

58
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,291
Unadorned clay,

59
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:04,041
molded by the master's hand
into something truly divine.

60
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,625
Could this perfection
beget perfection?

61
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,291
Could what you sculpt with Zwei,
dare match what we've created?

62
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,291
Yes.

63
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,208
Your glory will be crowned

64
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,291
with what you engender
in your protege.

65
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,458
Plant the
seed of perfection within him.

66
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,041
Yes, Master.

67
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,541
So Ein, you were gone
for a while.

68
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,666
Come on.

69
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,916
You have to get ready.

70
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,000
So how long I gotta wait here?

71
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,375
I'm not just some kinda freakin'
everyday jerkoff, you know?

72
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,500
I've risked my ass
for you guys.

73
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,708
It's because of
my dedicated service

74
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,791
that I can get you people
all those beautiful guns.

75
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,083
Your dedication

76
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,208
has not gone
unnoticed, Lieutenant Wallace.

77
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,916
I assure you that.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,791
But we were unprepared
for so sudden a visit.

79
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,708
It's my crappy luck, pal.

80
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,500
My only goddamn vacation,
and I walk into a crime scene.

81
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,291
Yes, quite unfortunate.

82
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:34,625
Compounded further by the
victim's position in the FBI.

83
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,208
You knew him perchance?

84
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,708
No, I didn't.

85
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,750
And I have no idea why
in the hell they fingered me.

86
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,750
Nor do I.

87
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,208
I'm sure they would
want to investigate

88
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,458
any unsavory associations
I may have.

89
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,541
It might be in Inferno's
best interest

90
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,541
to throw me a line here.

91
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,291
I understand.

92
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,250
I hear the Caribbean
is lovely

93
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,041
this time of year,
Lieutenant.

94
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,583
I'll send you a postcard.

95
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Now take one.

96
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,500
Chose whatever firearm you feel
the most comfortable with.

97
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,458
So more training?

98
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,333
No, not exactly!

99
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,250
A test.

100
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,458
I see.

101
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,875
Come with me.

102
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,791
What the hell?

103
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,708
This doesn't look like
the goddamn airport to me!

104
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,000
What's the score here?

105
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,083
The esteemed Mr. McGuire,

106
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,541
meet one
of the U.S. Navy's elite seals,

107
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,916
Lieutenant Wallace.

108
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,833
Another Inferno member?

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Semi automatic.

110
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,125
She a bodyguard?

111
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,416
So what the hell is goin' on?

112
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,375
Something's up.

113
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,083
You've
been a very bad boy, Lieutenant.

114
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,333
If only you'd been
a bit more...

115
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
monogamous.

116
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,958
However, your insatiable
appetite

117
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,833
has led you to the trough
of terrorists.

118
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:08,208
And now the FBI
is smelling a rat.

119
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Discretion is paramount to
the existence of Inferno.

120
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,208
WALLACE:
So you gonna do me like that?

121
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,333
You agree?

122
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,833
Lieutenant Wallace,

123
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,250
Inferno
is prepared to offer you

124
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,375
somewhat of
a bailout measure.

125
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,625
You can run.

126
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,250
What?

127
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,083
We will delay our search
ten minutes.

128
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,833
After that time has passed,

129
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,666
we will send someone
to intercept.

130
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,541
Escape,
and you may live.

131
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,125
Do you find this bargain
acceptable?

132
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,125
Yes.

133
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,208
Inside this building,

134
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,125
you will find
a well-stocked armory.

135
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,458
Take whatever you wish.

136
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,458
What the hell is this?

137
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,833
An opportunity to win your
life by sheer force of will.

138
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,583
It will also serve
as a test of skills.

139
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,750
All things considered,

140
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,916
this offer
is more than fair, Lieutenant.

141
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,666
I stuck my goddamn neck
out for you people.

142
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,000
And I get this?

143
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,000
Your time is far too valuable
to waste.

144
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,291
Dammit!

145
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,583
The situation is just
as you've heard.

146
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,500
This is your test
as well, Zwei.

147
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,041
You will kill that man.

148
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,291
How does not concern me.

149
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,083
Just complete the task.

150
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,916
But, I'm not ready.

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
My training?

152
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,666
Your training is done.

153
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,500
You performed very well.

154
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,125
Amazingly well.

155
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,833
I believe you're ready
for an actual mission.

156
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,541
Quite impressive.

157
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,125
To garner such accolades from
the Phantom of Inferno herself.

158
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,375
Let her praise
bring you confidence.

159
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,708
Confidence?

160
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,458
You're talking about murder.

161
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,500
Time to begin.

162
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,833
Find him.

163
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,333
I can't.

164
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,291
I can't kill him.

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,291
You only have two options
to choose from, Zwei.

166
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,541
You can either accept
the terms of your new life,

167
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,583
or you can reject them
and die right here.

168
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,375
[Music]

169
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,083
You believe he will succeed?

170
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,708
A Navy Seal
would be difficult quarry.

171
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,833
I wholeheartedly believe

172
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,500
you were invited here
to bear witness firsthand

173
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,166
to his abilities.

174
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,000
I have the utmost confidence

175
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,458
that you will
not be disappointed.

176
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,833
Which weapon did he choose?

177
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,291
Anytime you are
pursuing a target,

178
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,625
try to think from the
perspective of the one running.

179
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,666
But, your enemy
can do this as well

180
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,000
and anticipate your moves.

181
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,375
Phantom, what are your thoughts?

182
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,875
Lieutenant Wallace
is a highly skilled

183
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,000
and well-trained adversary.

184
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,125
He also possesses much more
actual combat experience.

185
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,291
True.

186
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,458
But Zwei's instincts
are extremely sharp.

187
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,083
If he can maintain his focus,

188
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,375
they may be enough
to give him the advantage.

189
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,541
And his odds of survival?

190
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,500
Fifty-fifty chance.

191
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,708
But this exercise will
definitely enable us

192
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,625
to get a measure on his
true potential as an assassin.

193
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,250
You think Zwei can win?

194
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,541
It's difficult to say

195
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,541
without knowing the extent
of Wallace's skills.

196
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,833
Wait! Don't shoot!

197
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,583
So now I'm unarmed.

198
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,000
Please listen to me.

199
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,208
I don't know why
they're making a guy your age

200
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,625
do something like this.

201
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,958
But just think for a second.

202
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,625
There's absolutely no reason
for us to kill each other.

203
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,375
Hey, kid.

204
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,166
You got family, right?

205
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
You actually remind me
of my little brother,

206
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,666
he's about your age.

207
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,750
All I ever wanted to do

208
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,000
was make sure
he was taken care of.

209
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,833
If you see one rat,
there are 30 more.

210
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,000
Just as if
someone tells one lie,

211
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,875
they will tell others.

212
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,625
I know there are more
honest ways to make a living,

213
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,250
but I was finally able
to send him to college.

214
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,625
I wanna be there
when he graduates.

215
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,375
The craftsman has
more than one tool.

216
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
An assassin
should be no different.

217
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,666
They're using us, you know.

218
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Inferno doesn't give
a rat's ass about us.

219
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,583
We should go after them,
doncha think?

220
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,166
Two shots have been fired.

221
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,208
Perhaps the final outcome
has been determined.

222
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,458
What if the result
is not to our favor?

223
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,458
What if Zwei fails?

224
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,625
I assure you we have
a contingency plan

225
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,583
in the unlikely event
of failure.

226
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,916
Nonetheless, I still think

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,791
we should exercise
some degree of caution

228
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,791
and wait in the car.

229
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,250
Agreed.

230
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,125
[Music]

231
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,875
Game over,
you little prick.

232
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't tell you
how many assholes like you

233
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,000
I've seen in my lifetime,

234
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,708
too afraid to close the deal,
and pull the fucking trigger.

235
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,791
Now, pay close attention.

236
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,541
I'll show you
how you kill someone.

237
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
Get that, bitch?

238
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,250
Killing ain't something
anyone can do.

239
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,750
And it ain't something
you can take lightly.

240
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,875
Now keep watching.

241
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,375
This lesson
ain't quite over yet.

242
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,541
That's it.

243
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,541
You did very well
for your first time.

244
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,166
Why?

245
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,666
This is all
just a dream, right?

246
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,375
I told you

247
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,916
that this would be
a very long dream.

248
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,750
It may just be
the beginning.

249
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,833
And unless you either die
or lose your sanity...

250
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,166
you will never
wake up from it.

251
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,791
You can end it if you want.

252
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,000
It is your choice.

253
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,416
These things
that are yours,

254
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,541

See through Zwei's eyes,
hear through his ears.

You will lose all your fear.

00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,041
You will be free.

262
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,500
No.

263
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,125
I can't.

264
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,958
I'm not Zwei.

265

Yes.

You are absolutely right.

268
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,541
I can help you do it.

269
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,375
End it for you.

270
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,500
Please!
I'm ready to wake up.

271
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,541
It's over now.

272

You don't exist anymore.

Alright, Zwei.

274
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,333
Stand up.

275
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,916
Zwei...

276
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,041
Tell me how you discovered
that boy, Claudia?

277
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,125
A source.

278
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,458
A contact in Japan
recommended him.

279
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,875
I see.

280
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,333
He has quite a bit of
that country's character.

281
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,583
He found power
in a hopeless situation.

Yes.
