00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,958
Reiji.

3
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,333
It's okay, Mio,
you'll be safe now.

4
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,333
You're...

5
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,708
Uncle Daisuke's...

[Music]

7
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,583
Hey, mom, can we talk?

8
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,208
It's about your father.

9
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,500
People were saying
a lot of things

10
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,916
about my father
and Uncle Daisuke.

11
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,000
I wasn't planning on
keeping this from you forever.

12
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,500
I just thought
that I had more time.

13
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,791
I had always told you
your father passed away.

14
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,791
The truth is,
he's still alive.

15
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,833
He lives in a world filled with
violence and cruelty.

16
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,333
A world not for you or I.

17
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,500
Did you know?

18
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,125
Were you a part of it?

19
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,541
At first I thought
I could survive

20
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,291
in that world with him.

21
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,750
I was ready to risk my life
if I had to.

22
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,125
But now,

23
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:51,041
I know everything that happened
was for the best.

24
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,750
He wanted to lock away
the memories we had together.

25
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,583
So he and I separated.

26
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,833
He felt by doing that...

27
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:04,333
the time we had spent
would be safe, and untarnished.

28
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,208
He kept me in a place
he wanted to be,

29
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,041
but could never truly reach.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,916
He could always think
to the past

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,791
and be there again.

32
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,666
Or maybe visit in his dreams.

33
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,208
Nothing could ever change it.

34
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,916
He wouldn't have that now

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,916
if I had resisted
and refused to go.

36
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,666
It's like
I get to live the life

37
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,750
that your father
only dreams of having.

38
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:38,083
There's more to being in love
than being together.

39
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
You mean that?

40
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,500
Daisuke was your father's son
from an earlier marriage,

41
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,375
he chose to follow
in his father's footsteps.

42
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,958
But he told me
that he was happy

43
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,125
just knowing
that his little sister

44
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,083
got to experience
what he couldn't have,

45
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,458
a normal life.

46
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,041
Mom!

47
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,250
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,083
But there's someone I really
need to talk to right now.

49
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,833
She's a lot like me,
trusting and sentimental.

50
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,375
Dammit!

51
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,625
I can't find them

52
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,458
if I don't know
where the hell to look.

53
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,666
Mio, is that you?

54
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,208
Yeah.

55
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,333
Eren rescued me.

56
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,875
I'm already back home
safe and sound.

57
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,416
Oh, thank god.

58
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Listen, Reiji,

59
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,166
Eren and Cal are gonna have
some kind of duel.

60
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,625
I overheard them
talking about it on the phone.

61
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,833
It seems like they're planning
on meeting up someplace

62
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,875
that both of
them knew about,

63
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,000
at three o'clock
in the morning.

64
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,291
That they both knew about?

65
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,708
Poor Cal, even though
what she did is wrong,

66
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,958
I know she's really
suffering inside,

67
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,166
she has no one to help her.

68
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,083
Please, Reiji,
you have to do something.

69
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,291
I will. Okay?

70
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
I promise I'll do my best.

71
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
Hey, Mio!

72
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,041
Look.

73
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,708
I'm sorry you got
dragged into all this.

74
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,708
It's all my fault.

75
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,125
It's not.

76
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,125
You didn't know
this was gonna happen.

77
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,125
I want you to know that I don't
hold it against you, Reiji.

78
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,458
Okay?

79
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,541
You can come back anytime,

80
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,708
and I will still be here
waiting for you.

81
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,541
You can really smile here,

82
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,250
I've seen it.

83
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,166
I know that this place
can make you truly happy.

84
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,041
And I know that someday
it will be okay for you

85
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,541
to make this place
your home for good.

86
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,416
Thank you, Mio.

87
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,916
That means a lot to me.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,291
I have to go now.

89
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,291
Goodbye.

90
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,708
No.

91
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,625
Listen, Reiji, I mean it
when I say I'll wait for you.

92
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,875
When you've finished
what you've started,

93
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,750
and gotten your problems
behind you,

94
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,541
I will be here for you,

95
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,541
I promise.

96
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,958
Reiji?

97
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,083
It's not really goodbye
this time.

98
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,541
It's see you later.

99
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,708
'Kay?

100
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:23,541
Yeah, I'll see you later.

101
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,958
Remember,
these aren't ordinary kids,

102
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,500
so do whatever
you need to do.

103
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,583
So does that mean,
you're going to kill them?

104
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,833
I'll be there shortly.

105
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,041
Ms. Fujieda,
I'm simply trying to assure

106
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,166
Mio's absolute safety
from here on out.

107
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,750
Do you really think she cares
all that much about that?

108
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,833
That's beside the point.

109
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,958
I promised Daisuke
I would look out for her.

110
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,791
You made a promise to him?

111
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,333
All of you men
are so damn selfish.

112
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,583
Shiga.

113
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,041
Who really shot Daisuke?

114
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,125
What're you doing?

115
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,625
What the hell is the point?

116
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,291
There doesn't
have to be a point.

117
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,041
I'm just doing what I want.

118
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,666
End of story.

119
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,416
What happens
after all this?

120
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,750
What'll be left then?

121
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,791
He'll be dead
and I'll be done.

122
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,375
Nothing more than that.

123
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,250
It'll just be over with.

124
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,500
That's all I want.

125
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,458
I just want it to end.

126
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,666
That's all?

127
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,000
Is that really
all you want Cal?

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,000
Damn right!

129
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,583
What the hell else
could I want?

130
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,166
You wanna tell me what the hell
you ever did with your lives?

131
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,458
Can you name
one positive thing

132
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,041
that either of you
left behind?

133
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
Not a goddamn thing!

134
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,791
You didn't accomplish jack shit
while you were here!

135
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,250
You're just trash!

136
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,833
We're all just trash
and when we die,

137
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,583
we finally get thrown away!

138
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,041
Very good.

139
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,208
Definitely something
you'll live up to.

140
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,833
You won't leave
anything of value behind.

141
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,458
No proof that you mattered.
Or even lived.

142
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,791
So you're just gonna lump me in
with all you people?

143
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,208
I'm the Phantom, goddammit!

144
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,458
I found
what makes me special.

145
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,708
Something I can do better
than anyone else.

146
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,291
It's made me so strong,

147
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:01,125
no one would step on me
or laugh at me.

148
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,958
It's who I am,
it's my purpose in life.

149
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,333
I take away happiness.

150
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,500
I exist to destroy
people's lives.

151
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:16,916
I can never be like I was,
I can never be weak again.

152
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,458
I knew I'd find you here.

153
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,625
Do you really believe
this is our only option?

154
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,208
There's no other way?

155
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,750
Yes.

156
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
I know you can't kill her.

157
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,083
You're wrong,
I'm the only one who can.

158
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,541
I'm responsible
for how she is now.

159
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,708
I can take on her burden.

160
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,583
I owe it to her.

161
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,291
And when she dies,
I'll be able to mourn for her.

162
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,583
I can respect her
and remember who she once was.

163
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,333
Eren, it has to be me.

164
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,708
No.

165
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,583
I'm not convinced
that you can pull the trigger

166
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,458
when the time comes.

167
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,333
I can't risk losing you!

168
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,291
Eren.

169
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,833
I just don't think
you have it in you, Reiji.

170
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,708
You're too understanding,
too kind.

171
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,958
I know you'll hesitate.

172
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,416
If I handle this part,

173
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,958
if we work together,
I know we can make it.

174
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,041
I told you,
I have to do this.

175
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,458
If I don't do this myself,

176
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,500
I know I'll be stuck in the past
for the rest of my life.

177
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,083
This is the only thing
that can set me free.

178
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,083
Eren.

179
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,583
Let me do it alone.

180
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,416
I'll find you
when it's all over.

181
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,291
Where will I go
if I don't have you with me?

182
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,500
I don't have any clue
where I came from,

183
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,750
I don't even
have any memories.

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,541
What do I have to do
that will set me free?

185
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,791
What does freedom even mean

186
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,291
when you have to
kill people for it?

187
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,583
Please tell me!

188
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,416
Help me.

189
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,166
I don't know,

191
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,125
but we'll figure it out.

192
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,000
We'll find the answer
together.

193
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,583
Reiji.

194
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,333
She's not here.
Just me.

195
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,416
But why?
Why'd you come?

196
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,208
It's my responsibility.

197
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,125
I think you mean
you gotta save her ass, right?

198
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,583
No. That's not it.

199
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,958
My responsibility
to kill you, Cal.

200
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,416
I've been a destroyer
all this time, a user.

201
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,250
I've openly lied
to people I cared about,

202
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,416
and I've killed
countless others.

203
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,083
I've done all this
just so I could live.

204
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,791
Jesus freakin' Christ,
Reiji,

205
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,208
you think
I don't know all that?

206
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,666
I know that you do.

207
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,916
What's more,

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,291
you have every right
to feel this way.

209
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,916
You're trying to find
some justice for yourself.

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,791
So use your gun
to make things right.

211
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,583
I wish it wasn't the case,
but it's the only way.

212
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,583
If you're truly
superior to me, Cal,

213
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,625
so be it.

214
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,916
I'll accept my punishment.

215
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,000
You bet you will.

216
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,125
Stay out, I'm serious.

217
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
Shoot her!

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,916
If you're really
lookin' for a way

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,291
to settle this between us,

220
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,750
I have the absolute
perfect thing.

221
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,916
The watch.

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,083
Wow! So you remember this.

223
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,166
I guess it's some
hardcore fate, huh?

224
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,291
This gift of yours has
actually helped me quite a bit.

225
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,625
It tells me exactly when
it's the perfect time to kill.

226
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,083
It's never wrong.

227
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,458
One final game.

228
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,375
When the song ends,
draw your weapon.

229
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,958
Cool?

230
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,833
You know,
you're the only person

231
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,833
who's heard this song
and lived.

232
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,166
Hope you like it.

233
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,166
It'll be the last thing
you hear.

234
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,666
Okay?

235
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Did you fall asleep
or somethin'?

236
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,333
Yeah.

237
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,500
I was having this dream
about when we were in L.A.

238
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, let's hear it.

239
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,500
It was like,

240
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,625
like what would have happened,

241
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,916
if we hadn't found each other

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,208
after the apartment
got blown up.

243
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,000
That's silly.

244
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,541
There's no way you would
have been that careless

245
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,750
and just lost me
after all a that.

246
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,916
It just wouldn't happen, Reiji.

247
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,333
You and me
will always be together.

248
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,833
And if we ever
did get separated somehow,

249
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,708
I'd still find you,
for sure.

250
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Even if I had to go
all the way to the North Pole.

251
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,541
Right?

252
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,583
No way it would happen, huh?

253
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,916
I feel like
such an idiot sometimes.

254
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,625
I've gone through all of this,
and still...

255
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,541
Don't worry, Reiji,
everything is okay.

256
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,083
Please, tell me.

257
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,291
If I can never have
happiness in real life,

258
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,875
can't I at least get to
dream about it sometimes?

259
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,958
I'm looking for where
Miss Judy Devens died,

260
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,791
Is this it?

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,875
How can you
still be so strong?

262
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,750
It was the only way.

263
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,125
The only way
I could still be here for you.

264
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
Yeah.

265
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,916
Okay.

266
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,000
Well, at least
we finally have this,

267
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,666
some time where it's just
you and me alone together.

268
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,833
It's still worth it to me.

269
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,000
This is all that I need now.

270
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,958
You didn't have to
give up your life,

271
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,250
you didn't have to die
just for this.

272
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,958
I don't mind giving up
my life for this moment.

273
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,000
It's honestly
all I've ever wanted.

274
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:25,666
Reiji, do you think it could
have been different for us?

275
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
If we had done things
differently,

276
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,208
maybe we could have
gotten away together.

277
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,958
Yeah,
we just screwed up.

278
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,041
We just accidentally made
a little mistake somewhere.

279
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,541
That's all.

280
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,583
I'm glad I met you,
I really am.

281
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,208
The time we spent,

282
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:55,833
made me happy,
really happy.

283
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,666
No, Cal.

284
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,666
Cal!

285
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,166
Cal!

286
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,500
You're a monster!

287
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,875
A freak of nature.

288
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,541
I must say this is
a very disappointing

289
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,125
turn of events, Mr. Shiga.

290
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,208
I had the impression

291
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,500
that you were
a more intelligent man.

292
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,250
If that were the case,

293
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,458
you would have known
to let us handle it.

294
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,125
Bastard!

295
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,041
You've just been
watching this whole time.

296
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,208
My magnum opus
is entering its final act.

297
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,708
Now is not the time
to litter the stage

298
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,125
with unnecessary players.

299
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,541
But, if you like,
I will allow you

300
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,708
to remain in the wings
to take in the performance.

301
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,416
To attend
is an honor in itself.

302
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,166
I hope you'll stay.

303
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,416
This performance will
surely be a tour de force.

304
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,166
A capriccio masterfully played
by my haunted figures.

305
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,625
But, who will survive
the night to the final call?

306
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,083
I kill...

307
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,000
in order to live.

308
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,958
I kill.

309
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,750
We are ghosts
that have no place to haunt.

310
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,041
Non-existent phantoms.

311
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,000
[Music]

312
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,041
I lived a life,
leaving nothing behind

313
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:46,000
but shattered dreams
and broken promises.

314
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:50,208
But, there is one promise
I cannot break.
