1
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,625
I thought I made myself
clear to you, Sam.

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,708
I don't want any drugs
in Melanie Square.

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,458
Wait, please.
I didn't have a choice.

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,250
You gotta believe me, Tony.

5
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,958
Ben told me
that I had to sell them here,

6
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,708
no matter what.

7
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,625
I don't remember asking you
why you did it.

8
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,541
This here is my turf,
the Stone Family's turf.

9
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,583
And I'm not known
for showing compassion.

10
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,500
Everyone follows my rules.

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,041
I don't care
who they are, got it?

12
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,916
Okay, Tony, that's enough.

13
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,416
If it ain't old man Gant.

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,458
I can take over from here.

15
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,583
Thanks for the help though.

16
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,416
He's all yours.

17
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,000
Tony the Stone,
you're as stubborn as ever.

18
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,125
I don't know of any other
Mafia family around

19
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,541
who doesn't allow hard drugs,
at least not in LA.

20
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,833
All I want is for Melanie Square
to be a decent place to play.

21
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,791
We have plenty of ways
to make money

22
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,250
that won't force us
to "bend our principles."

23
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
What the hell do you know
about principles?

24
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,583
After all,
you don't even live

25
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,166
by the sweat
of your own brow, do ya?

26
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,916
It's called
chain of command, pal.

27
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,250
And that's why
he's Tony the Stone.

28
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,125
Daddy!

29
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,833
Hey, champ.
When'd you get here?

30
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,208
He couldn't wait another
second before seeing Daddy.

31
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,291
Darling.

32
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,750
We were out seeing a movie
in the Square,

33
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
so we thought we'd say hi.

34
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,375
Daddy, you didn't forget,
did you?

35
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,875
In two days, we're gonna go
to an amusement park!

36
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,250
Now, how could I have
forgotten that?

37
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,625
It's gonna be so much fun,

38
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,041
I can hardly think
about anything else.

39
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,541
Tony, got a sec?

40
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,208
The bastard's persistent.

41
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,083
I want this thing settled.

42
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,833
If he tries to say no again,
you may teach him a lesson.

43
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,500
Right.

44
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,500
Ms. McCunnen,
it's Richard Harrington.

45
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,666
I was hoping we could get
this matter solved this evening.

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,458
We're offering you
the best deal we can.

47
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,375
I know, and it's not
a bad deal.

48
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,416
However,
I think I'll pass on it.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Why's that?

50
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,375
My reason's the same.

51
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,958
Melanie Square
belongs to my family.

52
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,583
And everyone in the Square,

53
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,625
whether they live here
or work here,

54
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,791
is like a member
of that family.

55
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,375
I don't care
what the hell you offer,

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,208
I will not betray them.

57
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,541
All right,
you have your answer,

58
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,583
so why don't you
get out of here

59
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,541
and go report back
to your boss?

60
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,916
Otherwise,
I'm sure we can just

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,458
deliver the message to him
with your body.

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,458
Apparently, this family
has yet to fully comprehend

63
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,166
the true power of Inferno.

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,875
The hell?

65
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,666
We'll give you three more days.

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,208
This is your last chance,
Tony Stone.

67
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
I trust
you'll change your mind.

68
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,833
We'll be in touch soon.

69
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,083
Man, that guy's a real prick.

70
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,458
So what do you think?

71
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
It might've been a bluff.

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,208
but either way we're gonna
need to check it out.

73
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,125
Lutz, Rob...

74
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,875
I want you to find out
exactly who's behind Inferno.

75
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,666
Because, my gut's telling me
they've been around for awhile.

76
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,791
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,583
[Music]

78
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,333
Are you ready, Zwei?

79
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,666
Anytime.

80
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,625
Just because
you blocked me once,

81
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,583
doesn't mean
the fight will end.

82
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,166
Yeah.

83
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,583
Very nicely done!

84
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,333
When you got here,
you were barely able to survive.

85
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,208
But now you're
quite skilled at combat.

86
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,625
I've got a good teacher.

87
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,083
I have two important missions

88
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,583
I'd like for you
to handle, Zwei.

89
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,041
Will you accept them?

90
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,333
What are they?

91
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,500
Come with me to my place...

92
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,083
I'll explain there.

93
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,583
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,083
So, this house belongs to you,
Ms. McCunnen?

95
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,250
That's right.

96
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,791
Although it can feel
a little big

97
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,708
for a single person
with no family.

98
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,208
Lizzie's got her hands full

99
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,083
working on a different case
tonight.

100
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,333
So um, what were those
missions you were talking about?

101
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,041
About the missions.

102
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,666
First of all, I want you
to be my guard this evening.

103
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,625
I'd like for you
to keep me company.

104
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,916
Just for tonight.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,791
I told you Lizzie's out.

106
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,166
And although the security here
is flawless,

107
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,041
I would still prefer someone
to stay and keep an eye on me.

108
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,000
But ma'am,
you're a senior member.

109
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,833
Why do you only have
one bodyguard?

110
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,333
Do I need anyone else?

111
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,083
All right.

112
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,791
For your second mission,

113
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,375
I want you to monitor
a mother and child.

114
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,750
Sure, if that's your order.

115
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,291
So obedient.

116
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,333
You're not a doll, you know.

117
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,958
You can ask why
you have to monitor them.

118
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,500
You can ask
what is so important.

119
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,875
That is allowed. Okay?

120
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,875
What do you mean, you
couldn't find any information?

121
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,375
We couldn't.

122
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,333
We went around and hit up
every reliable source in town

123
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,916
that we could think of,

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,916
but all of them told us
somethin' completely different.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,041
One of 'em would say

126
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,083
that the Verrocchio Family's
involved,

127
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,375
and then we'd talk
to someone else

128
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,541
and they'd turn around
and say Cervantes.

129
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,541
Of course the Bloodies' name
came up a couple 'a times.

130
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,500
but we ended up with nothin'.

131
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,250
What the hell is your problem?

132
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,666
Now, I want an answer

133
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,166
and it better not be
"we got nuthin'".

134
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,416
I'm sorry, sir.

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,875
Let him go, Anton.

136
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,125
They did what I asked them
to do.

137
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,458
What do you mean?

138
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,083
The way they
extended their power

139
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,375
in such a short time.

140
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
Their various techniques.

141
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,625
Senior members who never show.

142
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,875
Add on the information
they just got.

143
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,375
And there we
have our answer about Inferno.

144
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,041
They're some kinda organization
that seems to have deep roots

145
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,666
in all the West Coast
Mafia families.

146
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,125
Think so?

147
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,625
Where else do you think that
schmuck's confidence comes from?

148
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
They've got us
over a barrel on this

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,541
and the only way we can survive
is by giving in to them.

150
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
The little bastard
knew it too.

151
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,333
Boss, if that happens,

152
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,333
what about Melanie Square?

153
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,375
It's not gonna happen.

154
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,708
No matter who we're facing,

155
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,708
I won't betray
the people of the Square.

156
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,166
Anton, set up a meeting
with Inferno immediately.

157
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,125
But tell them this.

158
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
I will meet with them
under one condition.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,625
They have to bring
their boss this time.

160
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,416
Tony, don't tell me...

161
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,625
I can play ball with them,
at least I'll try.

162
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,958
My guess is the real boss
won't show.

163
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,625
That's not how
their organization is set up.

164
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,333
But, believe me,
I'm willing to bet

165
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,291
I'll still be able
to pick a fight.

166
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,541
If you do that,

167
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,125
there's no way
they won't retaliate against us!

168
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,666
Anton's right.

169
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,333
It's not just the Square,
your family will be in danger.

170
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,291
I'm well aware
of that possibility.

171
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,208
We'll keep them guarded.

172
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,708
We're
more than Inferno bargained for.

173
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,250
They've no idea.

174
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,166
Then, depending on
how they react,

175
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,750
the mother and child?

176
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,083
Yes, and if so...

177
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,791
can you?

178
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,458
Tell me.

179
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,958
I don't want you
to just take orders.

180
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,833
Tell me your answer, Zwei.

181

[Music]

182
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,208
C'mon already!

183
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,041
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,833
Oh, thank you.

185
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,833
Sure.

186
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,500
Looks like you're
getting used to it.

187
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,666
If you wanna blend in
with a flock of sheep,

188
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,541
you've gotta wear
their clothing.

189
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,708
What did the fifth person
we passed look like?

190
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,291
A Caucasian male
in his mid 20s.

191
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,833
He was wearing a
Dodgers' cap and a black shirt.

192
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,750
Based on his cell phone
conversation,

193
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,375
he got separated from his
friend and is trying to find out

194
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,125
where they're supposed
to meet up.

195
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,083
Correct. Yes.

196
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,708
Even when wearing sheepskin,

197
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,625
a wolf should not forget
his sense of smell.

198
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,375
That's also something
you taught me.

199
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,375
Hey now, hold on.

200
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,125
Can I have a balloon, please?

201
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,458
Sure, why not.

202
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,083
Now be a good boy, Duke, bye.

203
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,166
Bye, Daddy!

204
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,166
Thanks, Tony.

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,583
Bye. Love you.

206
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,833
I just heard from Anton.

207
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,583
He said everything is ready
when you are.

208
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,166
Let's go.

209
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,875
Well, looky here.

210
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,875
Where are you fine gentlemen
headed dressed up like that?

211
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,583
Old Man Gant,

212
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,708
it's not really
any of your business, is it?

213
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,750
Listen, just don't do anything

214
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,791
that will hurt good people,
you got that?

215
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,458
'Cause if you do...

216
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,416
Yeah, I know.

217
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,208
Abel and Bark are headin' up
the security detail

218
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,625
at your place tonight,

219
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,125
watchin' over the missus
and the kid.

220
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,291
So don't worry,

221
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,625
that place is practically
a damn fortress.

222
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,375
And Inferno?

223
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,791
They're gonna be here real soon.

224
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,166
You feel confident
in handling this matter?

225
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,416
Yes.

226
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,083
We have to think
about our future.

227
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,166
So I'll be happy
to serve as a liaison.

228
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,583
Again, I thank you.

229
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,291
Although,
as head of this district,

230
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,625
my feelings are mixed.

231
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,666
We'd like to make
Melanie Square ours

232
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,791
without turning it
into a battlefield.

233
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,125
So I'm counting on
your persuasive skills.

234
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,666
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

235
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,833
Don't forget
we're holding two trump cards.

236
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,041
Even Tony the Stone
wouldn't call our bluff.

237
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,750
[Music]

238
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,833
Uh, Ma'am,

239
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,708
I just now
got off the phone with Rob.

240
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,333
He said they've already
started the meeting.

241
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,833
I see.

242
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,458
Now things have been
pretty quiet outside,

243
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,125
and we've got the place covered.

244
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,666
So, there's no need
for you to worry.

245
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,208
As
long as nothing happens tonight,

246
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,791
the game should be ours.

247
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,625
I hope so.

248
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,750
To be perfectly honest,

249
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,250
I never expected
a senior member of Inferno

250
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,625
to be so lovely.

251
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
Most people make that mistake.

252
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,083
Yeah, I'm sure they do,

253
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,375
but we didn't ask to speak
with a hot piece of tail,

254
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,875
we wanted your boss.

255
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,041
Well, I certainly won't pretend

256
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,125
that I'm the number one, but,

257
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,625
I've been given full authority
with regard to this transaction.

258
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:37,458
And so, his attitude
is less than respectful.

259
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,250
Back off Melanie Square,

260
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,750
it's mine.

261
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,125
Do you honestly believe
we'll just leave it at that?

262
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,041
We'll pay the debt later on.

263
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,833
You realize that even the Mafia
has its code of ethics.

264
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,083
You don't have to
pay us the debt.

265
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,875
All we want,

266
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,875
is for you
to give us the Square.

267
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,750
These people here may live
on society's underbelly.

268
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,541
They may be part of the seedy
side of life.

269
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,250
But Melanie Square is their home
and their livelihood,

270
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,541
and they are very loyal to me.

271
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,166
So, you understand
that I will be loyal to them.

272
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,458
I view them as family.

273
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,916
And I will not betray them.

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That would go against
everything I stand for.

275
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,333
Right, you're Tony the Stone.

276
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,041
Your tough reputation
proceeds you.

277
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,625
I wonder
if you'd be so stubborn

278
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,000
if your real family
was in danger.

279
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,666
What's the story there, Stone?

280
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,458
If you did what I assume
you're threatening,

281
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,083
you'd lose everything.

282
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,291
Is that what you really want?

283
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,250
I told you what we wanted.

284
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,583
Now, are you gonna play ball

285
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,916
and hand control
of Melanie Square

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,375
over to Inferno or not?

287
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,875
No.

288
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,125
Thanks, Phantom.
