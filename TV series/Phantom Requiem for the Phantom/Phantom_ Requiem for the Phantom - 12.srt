1
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,250
Ya think everything's okay
down there?

2
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,500
Now don't you mind her, Cal.

3
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,208
She probably
just ran outta booze.

4
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,791
I'm out.

5
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,500
And unless I meet Mr. Right,
I'll be back in the morning.

6
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,500
Bye.

7
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,250
See ya!

8
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,125
This way!

9
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,666
Holy shit!

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,541
That must be The Phantom.

11
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,958
[Music]

12
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,916
This is just the latest
in a series of 20 murders

13
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,041
of high-ranking Mafia figures
in this last year alone.

14
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,458
These killings have been dubbed

15
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,083
the "Phantom Assassinations,"
and have sent shockwaves

16
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,416
through the entire
American crime underground,

17
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,250
leaving not only bodies--

18
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,250
If there's one thing

19
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,041
that Claudia's crew
is good at,

20
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,791
it's getting their work
on the evening news.

21
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,666
It's no laughing matter,
Daisuke.

22
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,083
We may well be
the next headline.

23
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,416
It seems the Gambino Family's
number two,

24
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,125
Deluca Rezzo,
has taken in his last aria.

25
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,666
We've taken out
their biggest muscle, huh?

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,583
The East is now ours.

27
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,000
We have our beloved Phantom
to thank for this bounty.

28
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,083
I was quite impressed

29
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,500
by the previous holder
of that title,

30
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,416
but this young man has more
than cleared the bar she set.

31
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,916
The speed at which
he's advanced is...

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,416
Well, it's a bit unnerving.

33
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,250
Kudos on being able
to tame him so thoroughly.

34
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,791
My intuition
simply paid off.

35
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,416
I suspected were we
to give him the choice,

36
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,416
he would choose
to remain loyal.

37
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,958
Ohh, really?

38
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,750
'Cuz I thought
our man was breaking a sweat

39
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,791
just so he could suck on
those big ol' titties of yours.

40
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,208
By the way, Mr. McGuire...

41
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,625
Regarding the Godo Family,

42
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,291
I have some more info.

43
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,750
The Japanese organization

44
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,708
that is looking
to join forces.

45
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,833
They have been able

46
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,833
to cultivate quite a large
demand in Japan

47
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,458
and have turned
a considerable profit.

48
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,500
However,
their Southeast Asian supplier

49
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,166
was recently struck
a devastating blow

50
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,625
and the family
has not been able to re-up.

51
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,083
They currently have
no viable product in stock

52
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,166
and no functioning supplier
for more.

53
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,791
I'm certain that if
we were able to establish

54
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,500
a working relationship
with them now,

55
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,166
we could easily
put ourselves in position

56
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,541
to be the top supplier

57
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,541
for the entire country
of Japan in no time.

58
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,958
Oh?

59
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,041
To that end,

60
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,500
I've arranged the sale of
five million worth of product

61
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,916
to Daisuke Godo who oversees
the family's operations.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,291
I'm sure it'll be a healthy
start to our friendship.

63
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,875
Now hold on!

64
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,458
You ain't got the kinda
clout to go around

65
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,500
making deals like that!

66
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,291
You gotta know
your goddamn place, woman!

67
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
Enough!

68
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,250
Listen...

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,666
If the negotiations go well

70
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,083
under Ms. McCunnen's
watchful eye,

71
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,000
I see no reason why she
couldn't handle the account.

72
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,666
Well then, I'll see to
the proper arrangements.

73
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,791
How'd it go?

74
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,625
Clo, have you been stepping on
those boys' toes?

75
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,041
Maybe a bit.

76
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,625
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing here.

77
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,791
But remember, if you push
too hard for something,

78
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,500
you're gonna have to deal
with what happens afterward.

79
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,750
It's fine,
I can handle it.

80
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,458
Well, well,
you're back early.

81
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,500
Yeah, I'm back in town.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,833
It's good to see you.

83
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,208
Thanks.

84
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,375
Lizzie briefed me earlier

85
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,916
on your outstanding progress
in New York.

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,041
You performed well.

87
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,250
I always do.

88
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,208
I'll bring your car
around front.

89
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,583
You driving?

90
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,791
You can drive me.

91
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:19,166
You finally got yourself
some game, Phantom.

92
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,708
So, what did you think
of the "Big Apple?"

93
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,208
It was too cold.

94
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,708
Guess what?

95
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,583
Isaac actually
had the balls to say

96
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,416
the only reason you took
this job, was for my body.

97
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,750
It's definitely a nice perk.

98
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,583
So that is the reason after all?

99
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,000
Well...

100
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,666
honestly, I've forgot.

101
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,333
Yeah. Who cares?

102
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,625
It doesn't matter.

103
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,583
You're here solely
of your own free will.

104
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,750
You're here solely
of your own free will.

105
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
Bullshit.

106
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,583
I have no free will.

107
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,833
Right now, I have nothing.

108
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,208
Eventually,
you'll feel nothing,

109
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,375
just the same as me.

110
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,375
A killer doesn't have
a past or a future.

111
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,833
They have nothing.

112
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,625
You were right all along...

113
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,041
Eren.

[Music]

115
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,291
Your steering's
a little rough there.

116
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,291
Well, I guess
this 25-kilo package

117
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,708
is a little distracting.

118
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,291
Is it just us?

119
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,750
We're trying
to establish a relationship

120
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,791
based on trust
with these guys.

121
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,250
If we show up with a gaggle
of goons to back us up,

122
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,500
it may not make
the right impression.

123
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,416
Understood.

124
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,958
So, who are they?

125
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,458
They're some of
your fellow countrymen.

126
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,666
That Yakuza guy.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,375
So this is a real
back alley deal, is it?

128
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,958
Relax, this turf

129
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,375
has been under
the Bloodies' control

130
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,375
for quite a long time.

131
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,291
Isaac's gang runs it?

132
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,041
Yep.

133
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,291
I doubt anyone
would be stupid enough

134
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,750
to cause much trouble

135
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,208
and piss off the West Coast's
biggest gang.

136
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,583
Therefore,
this is the safest place

137
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,750
for Inferno
to carry out our business.

138
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,708
That them?

139
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,208
There's no signal.

140
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,833
That's weird.

141
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,541
What?

142
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,291
Stay here.

143
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,875
A lone attacker.

144
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,041
Looks like he used
a pistol with a silencer.

145
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,125
And a large knife.

146
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,708
Picked them off,
one by one,

147
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,875
while they were panicking
in the dark.

148
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,625
He's definitely got skills.

149
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,041
I told you
to wait in the car!

150
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,083
What's going on?

151
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,916
What happened?

152
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,875
There's no deal tonight.

153
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,958
Someone canceled it.

154
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,125
Who the hell was it?

155
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
I don't know.

156
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,958
But there's not much sense
in sticking around

157
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,166
trying to put together
the pieces.

158
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,583
You should get back home ASAP.

159
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,416
What'll you do?

160
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,875
Clean it up.

161
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
That stunt you pulled
caused a lotta grief

162
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,041
on my property.

163
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,958
My turf!

164
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,916
The cops are all
lookin' for collars.

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,625
And the ho's and my boys
slangin' on the corners

166
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,750
are too scared
to get out and earn.

167
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,583
It's a goddamn mess out there
because of you!

168
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,250
You hear me?

169
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,541
I thought everyone

170
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,416
was supposed
to tend their own garden.

171
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,041
Isn't that how it's done?

172
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,833
Say what?

173
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,833
The security of your turf
is your responsibility.

174
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,416
My guests lost five million
dollars cash,

175
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,375
and four men
in your backyard.

176
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,125
I want you to consider
that carefully,

177
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,375
before you start
assigning blame.

178
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,916
Bitch, who the hell
do you think you are?

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,083
Let's be civil.

180
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
The Godos.

181
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,666
What is their reaction?

182
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,541
They're furious, of course,
but staying calm for now.

183
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,666
Alright, I trust you can
keep them at bay.

184
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,833
Assure them
that we'll look into it.

185
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,791
Of course,
we'll have to deliver

186
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,750
not only the money that was
taken from our guests,

187
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,791
but the bodies
of those who stole it.

188
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,041
You can handle that, Isaac,
that's your job.

189
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,291
Hold on.

190
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,750
You're calling
those Japanese guys our guests?

191
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,416
I never made
any kinda deal with them.

192
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,208
It's called saving face.

193
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,250
Someone came knocking
on Inferno's door

194
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,041
and was attacked.

195
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,791
Whether they are
guest or beggar

196
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,958
has no bearing
on what transpired.

197
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,125
The question now is,

198
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,291
will you allow that sin
to go unpunished?

199
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,166
Right, I'm on it.

200
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,458
Well, any breaking news
from the bosses' office?

201
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,000
So your stiff,
I asked around.

202
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,708
Her name's Judy Devens.

203
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,666
Twenty-six years old.

204
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,125
Been walking those corners
for a while.

205
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,375
Couldn't find
any connections on her.

206
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,583
Seems she was
in business for herself.

207
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,166
No pimp, I mean.

208
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,458
And her place?

209
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,541
We tossed the apartment,
but it was pretty clean.

210
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,958
No weapons anyway.

211
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,000
Looks like she had
someone living with her,

212
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,208
but we haven't
tracked them down yet.

213
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,750
You don't look
too happy about it.

214
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,041
You mind watching things here
for a while?

215
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,708
Huh?

216
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,875
I don't remember saying
that I'd stick around.

217
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,708
Go on ahead.

218
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,333
The cops
and the ambulance chasers

219
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,625
should be
outta there by now.

220
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,750
[Music]

221
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,958
Can you tell me if this
is where Miss Judy Devens died?

222
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,708
Who are you?

223
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,458
What's wrong, you deaf?

224
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,208
Well, what about you?

225
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,666
Were you one of
Judy's friends?

226
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,875
Were the two of you
very close?

227
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,500
Sisters.

228
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,750
What, ya think
we can't be sisters

229
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,791
just because
we're not the same color?

230
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,458
Sorry.

231
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,125
Do you happen to know
who did this to her?

232
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,083
How in the hell
would I know who did it?

233
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
You don't have any idea?

234
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,333
Whatta you mean?

235
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,458
Like Judy was askin' for it
or somethin'?

236
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,791
Guess it was
a stupid question.

237
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,666
Hold on!

238
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
What happens if you find 'em?

239
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,291
Whatta you gonna do
to whoever did this?

240
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,916
When I find them,

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,166
I'll make sure they get
what's coming to them.

242
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,041
Can you really do that?

243
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,250
Seriously?

244
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,833
Yeah.

245
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,750
Well, then you should let me
go with you to find them!

246
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,375
I'll help you
with whatever you need.

247
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,125
Hell, no.

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,916
Hey, listen, I really do know
who killed Judy!

249
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,083
I was there
when she got killed.

250
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,875
I swear I saw it
with my own two eyes!

251
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,791
The whole thing happened
right in front of me!

252
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,541
She had gotten drunk,
I was helping her.

253
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,250
She needed me
to walk her home.

254
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,666
We heard some shots,

255
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,583
and one hit her.

256
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,750
Please, take me with you.

257
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,500
What's your name?

258
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,041
It's Cal, Cal Devens.

259
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,375
What's yours?

260
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:56,541
My name's Reiji Azuma.

261
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,458
Cool. So you're Japanese?

262
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,125
Alright, Reiji!

263
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,083
The two of us are gonna be
partners in justice

264
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,208
from here on out, okay?

265
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,916
Oh, yeah?

266
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,083
Yeah.

267
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,333
You and I are gonna team up

268
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,458
and get back at the person
that killed Judy.

269
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,875
I swear, you won't be sorry.

270
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,875
Alright.

271
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,708
I don't mind being
your partner, little lady.

272
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,500
At least until
we finish this job.

273
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,958
We met by chance,
or possibly fate.

274
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,708
And even with
the best intentions,

275
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,458
I know I will continue
to commit my sins.

276
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:48,791
Once again, my life
is thrown into confusion.

277
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,375
And unfortunately...

278
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,458
I'll be bringing someone down
that dark road with me.

279
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,708
[Music]

280
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,708
I don't know what to do.

281
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:46,166
I don't know where to go.

282
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,708
I'm lost.

283
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,708
What should I do?
