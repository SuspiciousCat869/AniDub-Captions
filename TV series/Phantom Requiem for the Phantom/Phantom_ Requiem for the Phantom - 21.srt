2
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,958
I can't believe
she's still alive!

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,458
It was her.
I know it.

4
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,875
You okay?
What happened?

5
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,083
I saw her, a ghost.

6
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:37,333
I swore I wouldn't leave her...
that I would protect her.

7
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,958
The fact that I wasn't there
when she died

8
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,458
has haunted me
all this time.

9
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,666
And now I find out
I was wrong.

10
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,875
She's still alive?

11
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,333
That shot yesterday...
she fired it.

12
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,125
I see.

13
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,375
Dammit,
they made Cal join them.

14
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
She's their Phantom.

15
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,791
Master Huang,
it is a great honor

16
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,333
to be here with you tonight.

17
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,750
To be accepted
as one of your own

18
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,791
at this special occasion,

19
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,166
your birthday dinner,
I feel very fortunate.

20
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,000
Xu, now don't be so modest.

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,500
Honestly,
I've been much too slow

22
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,666
to offer you praise

23
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,833
for your achievements
in Western Japan.

24
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,208
You've done quite well.

25
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,625
Thank you.

26
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,375
And I assure you, the East
will be under our control

27
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,458
in the very near future.

28
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,500
Very good!

29
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,625
All the more reason
to celebrate!

30
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's have a toast,
to our future!

31
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,541
The Godo Family
is having us put the hit

32
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,875
on this Chinese Mafia guy, Xu.

33
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,000
That's the main target,
isn't it.

34
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,083
Do you have an issue?

35
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,791
Do we really have to rub out
old man Huang along with him?

36
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,250
Given he's in league with
one of Inferno's enemies,

37
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,541
I'd consider it a bonus.

38
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,541
That man took you in
when Inferno had enough

39
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,666
of your underhanded crap,
he saved your ass.

40
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,791
That's true...
but the worm has turned.

41
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,958
Not a lick of honor.

42
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,458
You and I simply
view the world differently.

43
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,875
It's Darwinism,
survival of the fittest.

44
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,000
Gregor here, you copy?

45
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,041
Yeah. I'm here.

46
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,000
We're all set,
awaiting your order...

47
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,250
we can go anytime.

48
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,291
Sit tight for a sec.

49
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,125
Where's Phantom at?

50
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,333
Dunno.

51
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,958
She didn't seem too excited
about this gig

52
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,833
from the get-go...
we'll do it without her.

53
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,333
Okay?

54
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,666
Go on, this task does not seem
suited to her tastes.

55
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,250
She can be quite finicky.

56
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,791
Alright, Gregor,
let's get this thing started.

57
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,041
Parker Unit, I want you
to go through the back

58
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,958
and meet the welcome wagon,
got it?

59
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,208
Got it.

60
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,500
If you were to guess,
what would you say

61
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,500
their execution time
in this operation will run?

62
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,583
Three minutes?

63
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,750
Yeah, what's up?

64
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,791
Nothing.

65
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,041
I suppose that's acceptable.

66
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,708
But Phantom could get in
in less than ten seconds.

67
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,416
Oh yeah?

68
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,125
Damn it!

69
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,458
No way!

70
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey! What the hell was that?

71
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,541
No way.

72
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
Look out!

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,375
Dammit!
What the hell is she doing?

74
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,666
It looks to me like she's
getting the task accomplished

75
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,041
in the most efficient way
possible.

76
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,541
Are you out of your mind?
We are not back home!

77
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,166
Are you saying their lives
have a higher value?

78
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,708
Life is cheap worldwide.

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,750
I think it should be safe
up here for now, sir.

80
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,666
I'm right behind you.

81
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,458
Who in the hell would have
the balls to hit us like that?

82
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,250
Someone I was foolish enough
to trust.

83
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,458
It's you...
Scythe's pet!

84
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,166
I helped that man

85
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,250
when everyone else
treated him like a leper.

86
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,500
This is how
he repays my compassion?

87
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,041
Sorry, pop.

88
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,083
That word ain't
in my vocabulary.

89
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,750
Master Huang!

90
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,833
You think you've got a pair?
Alright then, let's party!

91
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,333
Seriously,
I admire that.

92
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.
How 'bout a game?

93
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,916
The "shoot
when the song's done" game.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,750
How dare you!

95
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,208
If you had any idea who
you were talking to right now,

96
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,000
you wouldn't
insult me like this...

97
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
you'd be pissing your panties.

98
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,541
I think
you got that backwards.

99
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
I'm Phantom.

100
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
Everybody who's anybody
knows my name.

101
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm actually kinda
like a celebrity.

102
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,541
But, you're lucky.

103
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,833
You get to meet me.

104
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,000
If you win this game,
think of how famous you'll be.

105
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,791
It'll be sick.

106
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,750
If you believe
in reincarnation,

107
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,666
try to pick a better life
next time.

108
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,666
Adios, Gringo.

109
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,500
It's my fault.
I brought her down.

110
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,875
I dragged her
right off the streets...

111
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,916
straight into hell,
into murder.

112
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,750
I taught her how to kill
and live with a wounded soul,

113
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,791
and then, I left.

114
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm working on our arrangements
for leaving the country.

115
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,083
Keep up the act till then.

116
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,250
Yeah, I know.

117
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,208
You were away
for a while yesterday.

118
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,791
I was just checking up
on an old flame.

119
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,708
Did you two catch up?
How sweet.

120
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,625
Aw, put a sock in it.

121
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,125
I got plans for him.

122
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,208
Yes, of course.

123
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,458
I have some great plans
for you, Reiji.

124
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,208
[Music]

125
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,625
Reiji.

126
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,458
Hey.

127
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,125
Good morning.

128
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,875
So I guess you went home
kinda early yesterday?

129
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,125
Huh?

130
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,791
Ah, well...

131
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,166
I went to find Sanae
right after school let out...

132
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,666
and you were
already gone by then.

133
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,583
Yeah. I had...
some stuff to do.

134
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,000
I hope I'm not being
too nosy or anything.

135
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,833
I didn't take it
that way at all.

136
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,250
Good.

137
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,625
It's snow.

138
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,333
That's weird.

139
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,666
I didn't hear anything
about it snowing today.

140
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,083
It's beautiful,
doncha think?

141
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,208
Yeah.

142
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,541
Last night's spectacle
did not go unnoticed

143
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,750
by the police.

144
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,916
I may be stating the obvious,

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,583
but anyone who was directly
involved in the attack,

146
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,833
should be out of the country
by tomorrow at the latest.

147
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,250
I apologize
for making a scene.

148
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,583
And most of those involved,
already left.

149
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
I accept your apology.

150
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,291
Actually, I'm quite pleased
you eliminated Xu

151
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,416
without leaving any trace
of our involvement.

152
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,833
It was certainly not our style
of conducting business.

153
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,666
But, in the future,

154
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,500
if you have plans
to operate in our country again,

155
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,041
I'd like to go over
the details with you.

156
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,958
Have a good day.

157
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,833
It shouldn't have gone down
like it did.

158
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,916
If we'd stuck to the plan...

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,791
none of our boys
would be in a bag.

160
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,458
I shoulda known better.

161
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,000
Right then.

162
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,791
Right, when Phantom didn't show
up when she was supposed to,

163
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,333
I shoulda known she was
gonna do something stupid.

164
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,375
You don't have to martyr
yourself like this, Lizzie.

165
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,208
And although it's true
that Drei has her quirks,

166
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,500
you have to be
more understanding.

167
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,416
She just gets impatient.

168
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,208
Eager.

169
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,625
In her mind, she has not
fully taken on the title

170
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,833
of Phantom quite yet,

171
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,666
as she's never
had the chance to contest it

172
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,916
with the previous Phantom.

173
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,125
I believe when that issue
is addressed once and for all,

174
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,750
her behavior
will likely conform

175
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:33,125
to something
more suited to her role.

176
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:37,166
So now, we should let her
resolve this matter promptly,

177
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,041
and decisively.

178
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,708
Yo, man.

179
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,625
You didn't bring
your lunch today, huh?

180
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,000
No, I didn't.

181
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,750
You worried about me starving?

182
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,166
Nah. But you wanna
hit the cafeteria?

183
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,500
Alright.

184
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,791
Guess you didn't
bring yours either?

185
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,958
Yeah, but I ate it already.

186
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,708
In recognition for your
bringing a welcome guest,

187
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,958
I will allow you
to sit here today.

188
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,333
Thanks.
I aim to please.

189
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,333
Hey, do you remember me?

190
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,458
Of course.

191
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,625
You're that unpopular kid,
Motegi.

192
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,791
My brother told me
all about you.

193
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,625
What'd you tell her, man?

194
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,541
I didn't tell her
anything that wasn't true.

195
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,041
Aw, come on.

196
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,541
I don't see why you should
get all the happiness

197
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,208
all the time,
it's not fair!

198
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,916
You're that desperate?

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,833
Take it easy on him, Reiji,

200
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,208
he doesn't seem
like such a bad guy.

201
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,083
Really?

202
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,916
Wow, I have the exact same
opinion on that very thing.

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Maybe we can find
more stuff we agree on, huh?

204
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,625
I'm sure we'll be safe
as long as we stay

205
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,208
in public places like this.

206
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,791
At least I hope so.

207
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,916
Hey, Mio.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,750
Can you save this seat for me?
I'm gonna grab some lunch.

209
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, sure.

210
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,375
Get me something, will ya?

211
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,333
Get it yourself!

212
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,291
Wait.

213
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,958
So he left poor Mio
all by herself

214
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,625
because you called him away?

215
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,208
Something came up at home
all of a sudden

216
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
that I really needed him
to help me with.

217
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,750
Sorry.

218
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,708
I didn't mean to interrupt
you two's date, Mio.

219
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,791
Uh. It wasn't really a date.

220
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,750
Oh, yeah?

221
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,458
So all that work
I did for you guys

222
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,083
was just so
you could hang out?

223
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,750
Well, it's just...
it's a little embarrassing.

224
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,250
You don't know the first thing
about girls, do you?

225
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,458
He should lose some food
as punishment.

226
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,833
You wanna tell me
why you should eat it instead?

227
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,958
You don't deserve to have
all the happiness, man!

228
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Say what?

229
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, my god!

230
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,708
You really don't
get it, do you?

231
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,750
There are so many people
out there

232
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,083
starving for happiness!

233
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,083
That's right!

234
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,083
Like Motegi here.

235
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,291
Hey, what?

236
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,250
Hey Eren, I'm supposed to
give this to you.

237
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,750
Alright, thanks.

238
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,666
Hey, guys, I gotta run.

239
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,666
Why?

240
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,291
Yeah, why?

241
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,625
What's up?

242
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,333
Gotta do someone
a quick favor.

243
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,958
There goes my only shot
at happiness.

244
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,458
Don't be so dramatic, man.

245
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,041
Excuse me.

246
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,708
Wait, you're leaving too?

247
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,083
I just gotta keep an eye
on my kid sister.

248
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,166
Relax, just because
she's a hit with the guys

249
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,125
doesn't mean
she's doing anything wrong.

250
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Don't get weird!

251
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,791
Yeah.

252
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,125
You should go on, Reiji.

253
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,333
It's okay to be
a little protective

254
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,250
of your only sister.

255
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,291
Sorry.

256
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,750
I swear
we'll get to hang out soon.

257
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,333
But what about my needs?

258
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,000
Shut up.

[Music]

260

Eren.

261
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,583
Looking for someone?

262
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,083
You'd love to kill me
here and now.

263
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,708
You're certainly capable
of killing me

264
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,666
with your bare hands.

265
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Not because you were trapped
or mindlessly following orders.

266
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
But because you want to.

267
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,166
That personality trait

268
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,750
makes you a very special
boy indeed, Zwei.

269
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,708
That intent to kill
set you apart from Ein.

270
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,583
She was simply
a brainwashed agent

271
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,666
carrying out
whatever order she was given.

272
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,833
But to me,
you represent a failure,

273
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,708
although our experience
has led me in a new direction

274
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,916
on future projects.

275
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,375
New themes.

276
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,541
Hatred was my muse
on my next endeavor.

277
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,375
You've seen her, right?
My third work in the series.

278
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,041
My Drei.

279
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,541
Tell me.
What'd you do?

280
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,416
In artistic terms,
it was minimalism.

281
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,541
Very clean, very pure.

282
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,708
I even let her keep
her childhood memories.

283
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:03,208
For her, I refined her hatred.

284
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:08,250
She had quite a surprising
abundance of... hate.

285
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,916
I have nothing but
the deepest gratitude for you

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,625
for leaving me
such an intriguing subject.

287
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,125
She was quite a gift.

288
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,125
Bastard.
I can't wait.

289
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,541
Can't wait to kill me?
Yes, I know.

290
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,083
But you can't
do it here, my boy.

291
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,208
People would see what you are.

292
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,708
Such marvelous restraint.

293
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
You still can counter
the murderous rage

294
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,000
welling up inside you with
discipline and self control.

295
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,250
A beautiful balance.

296
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,250
That is my one true
complaint with Drei.

297
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,916
She lacks that control.

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,125
But...

299
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,250
she does at least
have the good sense

300
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,083
to avoid large crowds.

301
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,125
No way.

you should hurry.

You can just come out
and face me.

to meet you, really.

So you're her.

The very first person
to be called Phantom.
