[Music]

2
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,458
Eren...

3
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,458
What is it?

4
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,666
Nothing.

5
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,166
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

6
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,041
when I called you that.

7
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,250
I wanted to see
how you'd respond.

8
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,791
You found him, didn't you?

9
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,000
Where's Scythe?

10
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,041
Tell me.

11
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,875
Thank you,
I appreciate the favor,

12
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,833
Colonel Roshenko.

13
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,375
I am honored that you feel

14
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,291
you can call
on your old comrade

15
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,666
in your time of need,
Dr. Giuseppe.

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,833
That name
evokes many memories.

17
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,166
It brings to mind
my time in Moscow.

18
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,625
This is quite unexpected

19
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,666
from a person
with your intellect.

20
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,333
I never pictured you
as a man on the run.

21
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,333
I take it you found fieldwork
more challenging than lab work?

22
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,750
As the Bard has said,

23
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,125
there is a tide
in the affairs of men.

24
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,500
What?

25
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,791
A quote from Shakespeare.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,541
Their tide is mine as well.

27
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,208
The seeds of perfection
which I've sown...

28
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
have ripened on the vine.

29
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,958
Listen up,
there's something funny going on

30
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,500
with some small-time
arms dealer named Roshenko.

31
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,416
Apparently, he's tight
with our man Scythe.

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,541
There's also a rumor
that's he's been hangin' around

33
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,958
the San Francisco Bay Area
as of late.

34
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,416
We've heard
that Scythe was spotted

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,083
headed this way as well.

36
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,458
That bastard is gonna try to
ship his ass outta the harbor,

37
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,708
and we're gonna stop him.

38
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,125
Clo's here?

39
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,958
What in the hell?

40
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,708
You have got to come
to your senses, girl!

41
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,583
That punk ass kid
is the reason Phantom escaped

42
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,000
in the first place!

43
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,833
And you expect me
to drag his two-timing ass

44
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,666
along on a job like this?

45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,916
I do, and you will.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,958
Damn!
You're a hard-headed bitch.

47
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,291
The same goes for you.

48
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,500
He can tag along with us

49
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,833
but I'm the one
calling the shots, you hear?

50
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,541
Scythe was spotted
in the area tonight.

51
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,000
He's heading toward
the Oakland Wharf

52
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,750
in the East Bay.

53
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
I also heard
that a bunch of Roshenko's men

54
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,375
have been hanging around there.

55
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,541
Check it out for me.

56
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,166
Got it.

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,250
Let's roll!

58
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,708
Make sure the bastard's dead.

59
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,708
Don't fail me.

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,750
Yes, Ein.

61
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,958
I too feel it's a shame

62
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,291
that Zwei could not
be secured as well.

63
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,583
Impossible,
given the current straits

64
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,833
in which we find ourselves.

65
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,458
I'll let that vixen
lay her claim to him.

66
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,666
Sorry, but I am
a little bit confused.

67
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,708
Master?

68
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,958
I don't recall telling you

69
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,833
that you were at liberty
to ask questions.

70
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,500
Sorry, Master, forgive me.

71
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,333
Colonel Roshenko,
is there a problem?

72
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:26,916
Oh!

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,125
They've learned our plans.

74
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,583
No, we'll be fine.

75
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,750
I'll have my assistant
aid in entertaining

76
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,791
whoever drops by
to wish us farewell.

77
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,708
Oh, and you will help as well.

78
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,500
My deepest gratitude, Colonel.

79
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,791
I will see you shortly.

80
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,458
I suspect my old comrade
is attempting

81
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,625
to buy my fealty
with a few men.

82
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,958
Ein...

83
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,208
I have to wonder,

84
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,375
can you still fulfill
my expectations?

85
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,000
Take this, please.

86
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,458
It should more than
serve as an adequate prop

87
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,458
for tonight's performance.

88
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,125
There are two additional
magazines as well.

89
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,625
I'm sure you recall
the delicate touch

90
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,958
that this weapon requires.

91
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,500
Avoid successive shots
as much as possible.

92
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,666
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,250
We must make this count,

94
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,083
as it will serve
as your final curtain call.

95
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:34,875
Yes.

96
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,708
Ms. Garland will be arriving
at the Wharf very soon.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,375
She'll do fine, I'm sure.

98
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,500
I hear you've also sent in Zwei.

99
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,916
- Yes.
- That young man

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,208
has shown disloyalty
to Inferno in the past.

101
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,250
If he compromises the integrity
of our organization,

102
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,250
I'll accept full responsibility
for the results.

103
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,791
I see your faith
in our prodigal son

104
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,833
remains unwavering.

105
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,000
What I have faith in

106
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,666
is quite another thing entirely,
free will.

107
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,833
The free will to kill someone
on his own terms.

108
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,791
I imagine the novelty
of that control

109
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,791
after taking lives
at our behest,

110
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,625
would be irresistible.

111
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,458
Listen up, punk.

112
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,666
I think you being here
is a bad idea.

113
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,250
And you running around
with that toaster in your hand

114
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,916
is ten times worse.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,375
Of course you do,
one bullet in the chamber,

116
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,416
15 more in the magazine.

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
I could kill everyone here

118
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,000
and still have a few left over
for target practice.

119
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,166
The hell?

120
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,916
Have you lost your damn mind?

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,958
The way I see it,

122
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,125
one bullet
may not be enough

123
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,250
for me to shoot my way
outta here.

124
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,708
But, that is definitely enough
to kill that bastard Scythe.

125
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,750
You talk a lotta smack, doncha?

126
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,041
At least
I don't have to worry

127
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,666
about being shot
in the back.

128
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,750
Look up!

129
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,291
That punk ass.

130
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,541
Now hold on!

131
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
Scythe!

132
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,333
Where are you?

133
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,500
Alright, you brainwashed,

134
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,416
back stabbing little
freak of nature.

135
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,250
I don't care if you're
number one or number two.

136
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,291
But because of this crap
you were trying to pull

137
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,041
with that other one,

138
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,833
my older brother ain't gonna see
his next birthday.

139
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,666
And unlike that bitch
that got you back in Inferno,

140
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,041
I don't forgive.

141
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,333
Now hold still.

142
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,416
Hey, Eren.

143
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,583
Let's go back.

144
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,958
It's not too late for that.

145
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,708
Please, Eren.

146
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,750
Let's go.

147
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,000
Scythe!

148
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,458
Now, Ein.

149
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,750
I understand.

150
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,666
Very nicely done, my boy.

151
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,583
I knew you would eventually
surpass Ein's level.

152
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,250
It's of little wonder
why Claudia so fixates on you.

153
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,500
Not only did your perfection
bloom at an amazing speed,

154
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,833
but you used Ein as a trellis
upon which to climb.

155
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,291
What do you mean?

156
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,541
Zwei, you know exactly
what I mean.

157
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,375
Stop.

158
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,625
Please, don't do it.

159
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,416
It's for your own good.

160
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,875
If you let me kill him,

161
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,083
Inferno will forgive you
for leaving, I'm sure of it.

162
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,666
Please, just come with me.

163
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:37,875
Eren.

164
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,625
Ein, dispose of him for me.

165
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,791
Do that, and show your true
allegiance to your Master.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,291
Now run, Ein!

167
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,000
You dumb ass.

168
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,666
You run off like some kinda hero
and I find you here?

169
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,875
Thanks.

170
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,916
So how'd you guys do?

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
We took care of most of them.

172
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,416
Although we did take
a few hits,

173
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,458
but lucky for you, I'm fine.

174
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,750
Now get up.

175
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,083
He's still not dead.

176
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,000
So the plan is to meet up
with our crew

177
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,375
at Pier Number Five.

178
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,833
The northeastern edge.

179
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,625
Sir.

180
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,500
Hold it right there!

181
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,166
Oh yeah, you better run, bitch!

182
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,583
I'm coming for your ass!

183
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,291
Keep her at bay,
I'll go ahead.

184
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,666
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,958
Oh, my dear god.

186
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,250
Master.

187
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,333
Scythe!

188
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,958
Reiji.

189
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,708
What an interesting outcome.

190
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,833
A twist suitable
for the finale.

191
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,291
Eren.

192
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,416
What is it?

193
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,375
Nothing.

194
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,833
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

195
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,750
when I called you that.

196
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,416
I wanted to see
how you'd respond.

197
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,208
I guess a normal person
might smile

198
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,791
in this situation.

199
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,208
I'm sorry.

200
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,375
Don't worry.

201
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,833
I'll make you smile someday.

202
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,166
I promise I will.

203
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
Someday you'll smile
when you're happy,

204
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,916
and you'll cry
when you get sad.

205
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You'll be just
a regular girl someday.

206
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,166
You think so?

207
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
I do.

208
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,916
Just stay alive
until that day.

209
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
Okay?

210
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,250
I promise,
I'll protect you until then.

211
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
Eren.

212
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,916
I won't forget
the promise I made you.

213
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,625
I promise,
you'll smile again.

214
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,625
[Music]

215
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,625
I lost everything.

216
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:48,916
The only comfort I have now
is the name of a killer,

217
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,291
Phantom.
