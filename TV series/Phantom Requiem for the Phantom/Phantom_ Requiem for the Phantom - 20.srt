00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,208
Hey!

3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,541
Wake up, sleepyhead,
school's over, you know.

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,625
Sorry, but I don't
think I deserve

5
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,416
to get punched in the head
for taking a nap.

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,875
Whaddaya want?

7
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:52,083
A favor.
You need to come with me.

8
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,291
You know, that sounds
a lot like an order to me.

9
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,708
Because it is one.

10
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,208
And it's all gonna
work out in your favor

11
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,166
if you shut up
and do as I say.

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,750
Come on, what's with
the skepticism, Reiji?

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,708
What's with all the secrecy?

14
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,916
You'll understand everything

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
when you come
up to the roof with me.

16

[Music]

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,916
You gonna tell me
why you're draggin' me

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
all the way up here?

19
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,916
Well, what's this about?

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,791
You'll see.

21
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,000
I know you, don't I?

22
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,791
Aren't you from the class
next door?

23
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,833
Well, thanks a lot, Sanae,
do you mind if we...

24
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,500
Yeah! Go on, girl,
I can't hear a thing!

25
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, have fun!

26
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,958
So, you're friends
with my sister, aren't you?

27
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,000
Your name's Fujiwara,
isn't it?

28
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,791
No, it's Fujieda,
actually it's Mio Fujieda.

29
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,625
And I guess you're friends
with Sanae, too.

30
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,208
Oh yes, we were...

31
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,416
I was in the same class
as her our first year.

32
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,833
Cool, so...

33
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,458
is there something
that you wanted?

34
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,125
Um, well, I want to
ask you a question.

35
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,083
Lemme guess, you wanna know
something about Eren.

36
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:51,291
No, but you're close,
um, it's more about...

37
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,833
Actually, it's about you.

38
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,333
I wanna know, do you...

39
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,083
Is there someone you like?

40
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,500
But, you probably
don't wanna go out with me.

41
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,125
No, I mean, uh...
yeah, I guess if uh--

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,375
Mio?

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,666
Eren!

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,166
Brother, what's going on?

45
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,166
Why're you on the roof?

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,750
I thought I heard you
talking to someone up here.

47
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,041
How do you know each other?

48
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,791
We, uh...

49
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,708
Well, what're you
doing up here?

50
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,291
I was looking for Mio.

51
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,916
I got a wicked craving
for Kanekoya's Waffles.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,875
Thought maybe
she'd like tag along.

53
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,750
So, do you wanna go?

54
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,458
I can't, I have
a lot of errands to run.

55
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,458
See ya.

56
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,541
Later.

57
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,208
Did I interrupt?

58
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,416
What'd she tell you?

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,583
That she likes me.

61
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,666
What?

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,250
Fujiwara likes me.

63
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,708
Fujieda,
but I'm messin' with ya.

64
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,416
Seriously,
she said she likes you?

65
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,791
She did, kinda.

66
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,625
She does have
pretty weird tastes.

67
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,958
Whattaya mean by that?

68
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,541
Nothing.
So what did you say to her?

69
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,750
You busted in before
I had a chance to say anything.

70
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, go get her!

71
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,166
What?

72
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,375
That girl just put her heart
on the line

73
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,125
and got nothin' back from you.

74
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,000
I mean, sure, I know I'm the one
who interrupted you two,

75
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,458
but it's cruel to just
leave her hangin' like that!

76
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,833
'Kay, fine.

77
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,291
What the heck do you
want me to say to her?

78
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,083
Whatever you want to, dummy!

79
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,291
Great advice.

80
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,041
Just go!

81
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,458
And after all the trouble
I went through

82
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,875
to arrange this thing?

83
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,500
Could you be any more clueless
when it comes to guys?

84
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,125
Sorry.

85
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,416
Why couldn't you have done it
the way that I told you to?

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,708
You just say,

87
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,000
"Reiji, I like you,
you're my boyfriend now."

88
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,333
Then you gotta get him
to nod his head

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,250
even if it means
you have to choke him.

90
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,083
It'll take like five seconds.

91
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,583
Trust me, shock and awe
is the only way to go.

92
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,666
Why are you dragging
your heels on this?

93
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,958
I don't know, it's hard.

94
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:02,875
I'm just so nervous.

95
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,416
Come on and grow a pair!

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,416
This is the last spring
of your high school existence!

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,750
Don't let it pass you by.

98
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,291
Sanae?

99
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,958
Good timing!

100
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,083
I thought I was gonna
have to hunt you down

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
so we could start over again.

102
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,625
I'll spare you the trouble,

103
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,708
I was hoping
I could talk to Mio alone.

104
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,083
So why don't you get outta here?

105
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,041
Oh, sure, I see how it is.

106
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,875
Well, Romeo, I'll let
you two little lovebirds

107
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,625
have some quality time alone.
Good luck!

108
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,541
Where are you going, Sanae?

109
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,416
Same place as you.
Come on.

110
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,291
Fujieda, uh...

111
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,416
Yeah?

112
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,125
About what you were
asking me earlier,

113
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,333
I never got to answer.

114
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,125
Listen, I...

115
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,208
Do you mind?

116
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,166
Like I was saying...

117
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,083
Right.

118
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,166
So...

119
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,208
Yeah?

120
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,958
What did you end up
telling Mio?

121
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,250
That I just wanted to be
friends right now.

122
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
Typical teenage male response.

123
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,541
I totally expected
that from you.

124
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,041
It's not your problem.

125
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,666
Well, have you and your "friend"
made any kinda plans?

126
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
Yeah, we did.

127
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
We're going into town
tomorrow.

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,375
Hold on a sec.

129
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,791
What now?

130
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,875
Mio's a good friend of mine,
you know.

131
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,750
You better treat her nicely
when you're out.

132
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,958
You do something stupid,

133
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,166
you're gonna have to
deal with me.

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
Bang!

135
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,583
You're being kinda creepy.

136
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,375
I'm being serious,
she's a really nice girl.

137
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,708
Yeah.

138
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,958
I got a good feeling
from her when we talked.

139
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,041
Good.

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,208
Now fork over
my emergency allowance.

141
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,000
I believe I already gave you
this month's allowance.

142
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:37,833
What?

143
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,708
Oh, that's exciting news!

144
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,000
He might not be
your boyfriend yet,

145
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,875
but he's promising
to take you out.

146
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,208
That's a pretty big deal
for a late bloomer like you.

147
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,208
Yeah, totally!

148
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,000
What're you ladies
gabbing about?

149
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,333
Oh. Just a little good news,
Ms. Fujieda.

150
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,500
Nice to see you again.

151
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,916
Likewise.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,541
You won't believe what
happened to your daughter,

153
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,666
It's the neatest thing ever!

154
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
What is it?

155
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,458
How should I put this.
Mio...

156
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,291
Shut up, Sanae!

157
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,458
I know, it's a date!

158
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,291
How'd you figure that out?

159
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,791
You remember the food?

160
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,458
Yep, well...

161
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,541
See you later.

162
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,583
Just one more thing.

163
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,000
Now you look presentable.

164
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,166
"Presentable"?

165
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,458
Repeat everything
I told you last night,

166
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,208
and you'll be fine.

167
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,000
I like you, Mio!
I love you, Mio.

168
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,166
Money means nothing to me.

169
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,000
You sound like such a stud.

170
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,541
[Music]

171
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,791
Thanks, Reiji.
The picnic was really nice.

172
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,833
Yeah, it's such a nice day,
it seemed like the thing to do.

173
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,958
So, do you and Eren
really live by yourselves?

174
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,291
Our parents died
in a car accident, so...

175
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

176
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,291
Please, don't apologize.

177
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,916
It happened
when we were really young.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
I've gotten over it now.

179
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,416
You're strong, Reiji.

180
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,583
And I know what it takes.

181
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,041
I live alone with my mom,
but you know,

182
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,208
seeing her tied up
with work constantly,

183
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,375
starts to wear on me
after a while.

184
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,916
Makes me wish that my father
could still be around,

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,791
help take some of the burden
off her.

186
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,208
Just be sure
you can give your mom

187
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,833
all the support you can,

188
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,458
And when you need
a guy's help,

189
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,958
just pick up the phone
and call me.

190
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,000
That's sweet,
I appreciate it.

191
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,416
What's next on the game plan?

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,625
What are you looking at?

193
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,958
That's Sanae's handwriting.

194
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,041
"The place
you don't talk about."

195
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,791
Uh, Reiji,
so, what exactly is

196
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,458
"the place you don't
talk about?"

197
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,250
Just think of me
as the fairy godmother

198
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,500
to your Cinderella.

199
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,791
I'm a dude.

200
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
Follow the list
exactly as it's written

201
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,916
and the date'll be perfect.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,333
Even you couldn't
screw it up, Reiji.

203
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,041
She is so dead.

204
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,166
Check out the lady
on that bike.

205
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,291
It's kinda funny,
it's so big compared to her.

206
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,916
I guess 'cause I grew up poor,

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,958
I've always had a thing
for expensive bikes.

208
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,041
That's weird.
How'd that happen?

209
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,083
Is something wrong?

210
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,833
The sound of
a .9 millimeter Parabellum

211
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,833
fired through a silencer.

212
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,875
That's the sound
that woke me up from this dream.

213
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,041
We traveled
from Mexico to Peru,

214
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,625
and then to the Philippines
through Palau.

215
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,708
It's been six months
since we came to Japan.

216
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,083
We were trying to make
this town our home.

217
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,625
Leave our past behind.

218
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,166
This is the country
that you're from.

219
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,583
And ever since we came here,
you've been different.

220
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,541
You've changed so much.

221
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,333
It's like your heart opened.

222
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,916
For someone who has
a place to call home,

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,166
that must be
a normal thing.

224
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,458
I thought that's what
it'd be like if I had one,

225
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,166
a real home.

226
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,208
But it's over now,
someone's found us.

227
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,750
It's Inferno.

228
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,666
Probably.
It was a silent warning.

229
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,541
I see, it's finally time
to wake up.

230
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,666
I was afraid of this.

231
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,375
I had hoped that you could
stay in this dream

232
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,208
for the rest of your life,
letting the past drift away.

233
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,666
And you?

234
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,083
Penance, I have to be
forgiven for my sins.

235
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,583
Seriously? Who are you
asking for forgiveness?

236
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:58,083
God, I know
I'll see him someday.

237
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,250
Eren...

238
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,208
I didn't expect them this soon,

239
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:06,166
but Inferno's here.
And now everything has changed.

240
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,541
I was hoping to
not have to take advantage

241
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,333
of Mio's feelings.

242
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,000
What the heck
are you talking about?

243
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,791
What are you planning, Eren?
Tell me!

244
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,083
Mio's parents, they separated
right after she was born.

245
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,083
Yeah, she mentioned
something about that to me.

246
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,916
Her father vanished
and he's still M.I.A.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,541
That's what Mio was fed
growing up,

248
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,416
and that's the lie
she still believes.

249
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,541
The lie?

250
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,375
Her father's still around
and has quite a reputation.

251
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,000
You've probably heard of him.

252
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,333
Who is he?

253
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,541
The head of a very large
and powerful crime syndicate,

254
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,583
Kaiten Godo.

255
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,250
You gotta be kidding!

256
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,833
No, "Fujieda"
is her mother's maiden name.

257
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,916
Insane, she's a Godo!

258
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,875
Does she even
have a clue about it?

259
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,000
Not at all.

260
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,291
Even to those inside
the Godo Family,

261
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,041
only a handful
have been told.

262
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,875
It's a very well-kept secret.

263
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,000
Kaiten wanted to keep them safe
from the power struggles

264
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,958
that tend to shake
the family tree,

265
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,000
so they took on a new identity.

266
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,666
Then Mio's actually
related to Daisuke Godo?

267
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,166
Yes, she's his half sister.

268
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,458
Kaiten Godo is in a difficult
situation with Mio.

269
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,375
Although he wants to keep her
away from the violence

270
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,458
of the family business,
he can't openly protect her.

271
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,416
So that means
she's his biggest weakness.

272
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,958
So how did you find out
about all this?

273
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,958
Scythe Master
told me the whole story.

274
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,458
You mean, Scythe knows too?

275
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,333
He learned all of this
quite a long time ago.

276
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,916
After Master was forced
to turn his back on Inferno,

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,041
he came to Japan and
went into hiding for a while,

278
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,458
I told you about
this before, right?

279
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

280
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,458
It was then that Master
made a thorough investigation

281
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,333
of the Godo Family.

282
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
He wanted to be able to take
advantage of their weaknesses

283
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,291
if he found his back
against a wall.

284
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
Weaknesses?
Hold on, Eren!

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,291
You're telling me that you're
gonna use Mio like a pawn?

286
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,416
She could be a powerful
trump card if we need one.

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,875
The senior member who's got
the most pull in the family

288
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,125
is Toru Shiga,
he's in Inferno.

289
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,041
So he can call off their dogs.

290
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,333
So now you know
the whole situation.

291
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,125
It doesn't matter if
the person on the motorcycle

292
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,833
was from Inferno.

293
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,125
We've got Mio,
so our deck is stacked.

294
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,916
Eren, why didn't you tell me?

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,666
I dunno.

296
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,750
I probably should've
told you earlier.

297
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,291
I guess I just didn't think
that the two of you

298
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,250
would start dating.

299
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,125
Maybe I was being naive,

300
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,791
but I hoped that we'd finally
gotten away.

301
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,541
I wanted this life
to last longer,

302
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,291
I had lots of plans.

303
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,125
I know you did, Reiji,
but we have to run now.

304
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,541
You're right,
we have to run.

305
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,500
we're out of options.

306
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,458
It's okay to grieve,
you're leaving something behind.

307
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,000
It's human nature.

308
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,666
But now you have to go back
to who you were

309
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,041
before we came here.

310
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,291
I can't do that,
I gotta face facts.

311
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,500
They're after us, I know
I have to be ready for that.

312
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,250
But I can't go back
to the way I was.

313
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,833
That's good. You were able
to forget what that was like.

314
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,250
You changed, you were happy.

315
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:09,125
I was proud of you,
you'd overcome so much.

316
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,208
Eren...

317
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,416
These last six months,
your smile,

318
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,000
even the way you looked
when you slept,

319
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,625
you finally looked
like a happy person.

320
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
Seeing that was so good.

321
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,958
It made me very happy.

322
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,041
If being home can do this,

323
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,291
then maybe
it's not so much a dream.

324
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,708
That's how I thought of it
for a long time,

325
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,708
but now it could be
real for me.

326
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,000
Maybe I could find my home.

327
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:41,125
Remember, it wasn't long ago
that you promised me.

328
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,000
You said you'd help me
find my real home.

329
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,833
I don't want your happiness
here to be a waste.

330
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,791
There's no reason
that it has to be.

331
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:03,083
This isn't forever,
we can come back.

332
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,750
Everything
will still be here.

333
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
I know the day will come.

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,916
I know we'll make it
back here someday.

335
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,916
We'll find ourselves
back in normal life.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,875
I'm sorry, Reiji,
but that time just isn't now.

337
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,958
What?

338
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,875
Reiji bailed and left you
in the middle of your date?

339
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,875
What a jerk!

340
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,875
Look, it wasn't a date.

341
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,333
We were just hanging out.

342
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,125
Anyway, he said it was
some kind of urgent thingy.

343
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,333
I couldn't really stop him.

344
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,250
There is nothing
in this world more urgent

345
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,291
to a high school girl than love,
why can't he understand that?

346
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,708
Geez, you're being
pretty dramatic.

347
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,708
Yeah, I worked my butt off

348
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,750
to schedule out
that whole date of yours.

349
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,541
Why doesn't she mind
her own business?

350
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,416
'Cause she doesn't have much.

351
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Oh, yeah.

352
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,041
Thanks a lot.

353
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,000
Speak of the devil.

354
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,291
He thinks he can just
leave you hangin', huh?

355
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,166
Take this!

356
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,041
Hey!

357
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,750
Ow! Let go of me!

358
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,041
Uh-huh, sorry about that.

359
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,500
Calm down, Sanae.

360
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,958
Geez! Hey, Reiji.

361
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,916
I had a really nice time
yesterday.

362
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
Cool, sorry I bailed.

363
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,916
Did you get your thing
taken care of?

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,083
Yeah, it's all good.

365
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,291
You may have gotten
the upper hand this time,

366
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,208
but don't let your guard down,
I'll be watching you.

367
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,625
Right.
Look, I gotta go see Eren,

368
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,750
so I gotta run.
Later.

369
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,875
Hey, lover boy, you're leaving
your girlfriend behind.

370
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,791
Oh, am I getting
on your nerves?

371
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,375
Something's different
about him.

372
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:15,583
I don't really know exactly how,
but he's different.

373
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,875
[Music]

374
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,208
Why is she here?

375
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,958
Of all places in the world,
what the hell is she doing here?

376
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:39,083
No, the real question is:
Is that really her?

377
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,291
I can't believe
she's still alive!

378
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,041
Cal!

379
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:12,541
We are Ghosts,
that have no place to haunt.

380
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,208
Non-existent phantoms.

381
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,833
[Music]

382
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,208
How's it going, Ein?

383
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:50,791
Or, should I call you
ex-Phantom?
