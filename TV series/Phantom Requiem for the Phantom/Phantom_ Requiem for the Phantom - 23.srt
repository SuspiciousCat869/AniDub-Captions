2
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,041
Quit daydreaming, Reiji!

3
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,958
You should be cleaning!

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,875
Reiji's kinda weird.

5
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,416
I don't know
what's he's thinking.

6
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,583
But it seems like he's always
just staring off into space.

7
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,791
He is a bit of a space cadet,
doncha think?

8
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright,
it finally stopped raining!

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,666
It's beautiful.

10
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,291
I almost didn't see it.

11
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,041
It's a natural work of art.

12
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,333
Most people
wouldn't even notice it.

13
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,125
The boat leaves
late Monday night.

14
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,500
We need to be sure
to meet our contact in Otaru

15
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,250
in the evening.

16
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,125
Monday, huh?

17
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,083
That means we've still got
five days here.

18
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,583
I hope Inferno will let us
leave without a fight.

19
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,875
I'm not sure of that...

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,166
so we should not
let our guard down.

21
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,125
I want us to get out smoothly.

22
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,875
Leaving no trace,

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,625
just quickly and quietly
roll out of town...

24
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,958
like fog.

25
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,125
Yo, Scythe!

26
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,666
Is there some kind of trouble,
Ms. Garland?

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,166
Where the hell's Phantom?

28
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,916
I swear, the two of you
better not be planning

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,666
on pulling
something stupid.

30
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,541
She's missing?

31
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,500
I was under the impression
she was going to be

32
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,166
in your charge
this afternoon.

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,208
Well, she's not.

34
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,291
Damn.

35
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,416
I took my eye
off her for a second.

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,875
Not to worry...

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,791
she'll return
when night falls.

38
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,291
Weapons are missing,
a lot of them.

39
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,166
Oh dear!
That could be dangerous.

40
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,125
I wonder what is her plan.

41
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,375
Ya know, I think
I have a pretty good idea

42
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,833
where she ran off to.

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,750
You need to go ahead

44
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
and get ahold of
Mr. McGuire and Shiga.

45
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,833
I'm gonna go
and look around for Phantom.

46
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,875
It seems the die is cast,
well...

47
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,666
Are you serious about this?

48
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,250
Come on, she's... a kid.

49
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,416
Zwei began this process,
I am only completing it.

50
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,583
Yeah, but...

51
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,166
Drei?

52
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,750
Yeah.

53
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,250
That's the name
Scythe says I should use.

54
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,500
Lizzie... listen.

55
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,458
I'm counting on you
to help me out.

56
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey!

57
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,833
You're gonna be there
for me, right?

58
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,708
Ah, man!

59
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,250
This babysitting crap
is getting on my last nerve.

60
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,208
Hey!

61
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Sorry you had to see that, Mio.

62
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,875
It's okay.

63
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,958
I'll be honest with you.

64
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,083
Listen...

65
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,041
I... I had...

66
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,916
a little problem
when I went to America.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,416
I never expected
it'd end up like that.

68
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,291
It's funny...

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,291
ya know, I'm actually glad
I got to see her one more time.

70
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,375
I mean, she hit me.

71
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,250
But I think
it's resolved now.

72
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,333
Alright. So that's enough
about that, okay?

73
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,875
Yeah.

74
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,666
I promise we'll have
a real date sometime.

75
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,416
It can't always
be like this.

76
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,958
Anyway...

77
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,958
See ya.

78
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,083
Bye.

79
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,958
Why's it so quiet?

80
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, yeah.

81
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,875
Mom's not gonna be home tonight.

82
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,583
Hey! You remember me, doncha?

83
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,208
Don't look so scared, okay?

84
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,875
Well, what're you doing here?

85
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,791
Tell me, you're
Godo's little princess, right?

86
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,041
What? Godo?

87
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,875
Are you talking about
my - uncle?

88
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:14,166
You think he's your uncle.
Whatever.

89
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,375
I'll let you in on the whole
story in a little while.

90
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,708
Hold on!

91
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,875
I know you people don't see
a lot of guns in your country,

92
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,666
but trust me, it's real.

93
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:32,000
Hop on.
I'll tell you a story.

94
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,750
It gets a little twisted
and seedy though.

95
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,750
It's about Reiji after all.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,958
[Music]

97
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,708
I've been waiting on you
to show up.

98
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,458
'Bout time.

99
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
Wait there.

100
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,291
Hey, Lizzie!

101
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,250
I was thinking about this game
that we're playing now.

102
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,416
Yeah?

103
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,208
The rules are pretty simple.

104
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,500
As long as she's alive,
we can't touch those two.

105
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,833
So we need to change things up
a little bit.

106
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,333
Killing the princess
should do the trick just fine.

107
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,750
Everyone better stay
the hell outta my way.

108
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,250
And no one better touch
my target.

109
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,250
How long are you gonna
carry on like this?

110
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,541
What?

111
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,125
Do you really
hate that boy that much?

112
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,416
Are you seriously
asking me that question?

113
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,250
There's two kinds of people
I can't tolerate.

114
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,291
Back stabbers and people
that'll hurt a civilian.

115
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,708
I can't abide
by this behavior!

116
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,541
There's a line
that you just can't cross.

117
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,958
Be careful, girl.

118
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
You're walking
right on the edge.

119
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
And you're
about to fall over it.

120
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey! There's something
I've always wondered about you.

121
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,500
Why?

122
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,291
Why have you always thought
you could treat me

123
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,625
like I'm your little sister?

124
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,541
We didn't ever want you
to walk down this road.

125
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,416
To become the next Phantom.

126
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
Me and Zwei both.

127
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,958
Everyone had their own plans
for me, that it?

128
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,208
Too bad.

129
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,916
I'm Phantom now,
and if you don't like it,

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,583
you can make it stop
right here, tonight.

131
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,833
I'll pull out my gun
when the song's over.

132
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,000
If you can't pull
the trigger by then,

133
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:26,416
I guess,
you're just too soft.

134
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,041
It's gotta be kill or be killed
in this business, right?

135
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
Cal!

136
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,333
What?

137
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,583
Listen to me,
I don't wanna shoot you.

138
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,916
Cal!

139
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,541
I gave you a chance
but you just couldn't do it.

140
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,166
Sorry.

141
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:40,166
I just didn't
have the strength.

142
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,208
Are you sure
you want one so heavy?

143
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,083
Yeah.

144
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,833
I don't want it to be
too easy to pull it out.

145
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,250
This gun...

146
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,625
it got...

147
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,833
heavy...

148
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,458
so...

149
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:06,375
so goddamn heavy
for me to lift.

150
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:11,166
I can't raise it anymore.

151
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,000
Clo...

152
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,541
We're gonna be here
for a couple of days at least,

153
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,666
so don't eat too fast.

154
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,208
Why?

155
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,875
Please!

156
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,500
Why are you
doing all of this?

157
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,041
Why'd you -
why'd you kill her?

158
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,250
My phone!

159
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,958
Okay, so let's just see

160
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,833
who was the last person
you talked to.

161
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
These little squiggles...

162
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,833
they say Reiji, don't they?

163
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,541
Tell me, how do you know him?

164
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,041
I was his student,

165
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,291
and... his lover.

166
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,208
Liar.

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
How the hell
would you know?

168
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,666
What makes you think
you know anything

169
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,875
about that lying snake?

170
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,916
Wanna know a secret?

171
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,875
I learned to use this,
from your sweet prince.

172
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,791
I guess you don't know
what he was doing in America?

173
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,458
Killing people!

174
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh yeah, he was real good.

175
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,583
That guy killed
shitloads of people

176
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,875
without thinking twice
about it.

177
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,791
No way.

178
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,000
You've been lied to
your whole life.

179
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,458
Two years ago,
this guy named Daisuke Godo

180
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,666
died while he was in L.A.

181
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,041
Wasn't he supposed to be your...

182
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,125
uncle or something?

183
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,041
How in the world
do you know that?

184
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,750
I know a lot
about the whole situation.

185
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:10,250
And I know that this Godo guy
was some kinda gangster.

186
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,583
And...

187
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,875
get this...

188
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,375
He wasn't your uncle either.

189
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,125
In fact, he was your brother.

190
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,041
That's a lie!

191
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,291
What's wrong?

192
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,708
You think you're too good
to be the daughter

193
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,541
of a big-time mafia boss?

194
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,125
Then you are gonna crap
when you hear this news.

195
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,416
Daisuke Godo's death
was not an accident,

196
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,708
if you know what I mean.

197
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,625
Your dear Reiji
actually had a big part

198
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,041
in the whole thing.

199
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,875
I don't believe
a single word you're saying!

200
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,291
I don't give a damn
if you believe me.

201
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,625
But, listen up, princess.

202
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,000
There's gonna be a war -

203
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,750
and you're
right in the middle.

204
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,875
Like it or not,
that's what's gonna go down.

205
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,375
When that happens...

206
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,916
everything I told you
here tonight,

207
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,833
is gonna make
a whole lot more sense.

208
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,041
What are you trying to do
with all this?

209
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,250
Start a fight...
with Reiji -

210
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,791
a fight to the death.

211
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,000
No way.

212
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,250
Sun's coming up.

213
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,208
We should get this started.

214
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,666
Hi, Mio.

215
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,208
Sorry! This ain't Mio.

216
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,791
What have you done to her?

217
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,083
Aw! Don't worry,
I don't wanna hurt her.

218
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,250
But since you got
your hands full trying to run,

219
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,791
I thought you might be
a little too busy

220
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,583
to take care of a hostage.

221
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,583
So I'm doing that for you.

222
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,041
I thought I was
the only one you were after.

223
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,375
She's got nothing to do
with this, you hear?

224
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,291
You just wanted a normal life,
isn't that right?

225
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, I'll let you have
your boring existence.

226
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,750
And I won't let
Inferno or the Godos

227
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,000
harm a single hair
on your head.

228
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,625
Just be a good boy
and go to school everyday

229
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,875
and you'll be fine.

230
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,625
But, don't even think
about vanishing on me.

231
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,166
If you try to run somewhere
that I can't keep track of you,

232
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,791
there's gonna be
a little reunion going on.

233
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,208
I'll reunite Mio
and her brother in hell.

234
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:33,375
So I'll be watching you
very closely, Reiji.

235
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,083
You hear me?

236
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,500
There's nowhere to run.

237
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,333
Nowhere.

238
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,875
So Cal...

239
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,833
decided to go against Inferno?

240
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,875
She hates me enough
to risk it, I guess.

241
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
We should act independently.

242
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,208
What d'ya mean?

243
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,875
How do you do, sir?

244
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,083
I thought I made it clear

245
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,541
Mio Fujieda wasn't
to be harmed in any way!

246
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,750
I wanna know why you let
Phantom take her like that!

247
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,500
Huh?

248
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,916
I see, news travels quickly.

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,375
God damn you!

250
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,125
I know that you're behind
all this, you smug bastard!

251
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,666
That's absurd.

252
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,125
I swore on my life
I would look out for her!

253
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,458
She isn't some pawn
you can just throw away!

254
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,416
I assure you this is a matter
that I take very seriously.

255
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,125
I will do everything
in my power

256
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,958
to see she is
returned to you safely.

257
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,875
I'm gonna go out and see
if I can locate them.

258
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,583
Do exactly as she said.

259
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,458
Do not raise suspicion.

260
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,041
I'm sure
that I can take out Drei,

261
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,916
and rescue Mio.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
But, Cal is watching us now.

263
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,875
If we do anything
to make her angry,

264
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,083
she'll snap.

265
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,916
No. If I leave,
she still won't hurt Mio.

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,916
I promise.

267
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,291
How can you be so sure?

268
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,166
She doesn't care about me.

269
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,416
You are her only target.

270
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,291
Yeah, but...

271
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,750
She doesn't have us
cornered just yet.

272
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,791
We have to stay in control.

273
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:24,083
Whoever loses their focus...
will die.

274
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,666
There's no need to worry,
Mr. Shiga.

275
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,083
My new assistants will be
arriving very shortly to help.

276
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,875
Soldiers, meticulously
trained by me personally.

277
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,291
Each with a logical mind

278
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,583
that surpasses the bounds
of trivial emotion.

279
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,250
Very effective.

280
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,708
And I know, you will be
extremely satisfied

281
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,083
with the results.

282
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,125
There's absolutely
no chance of failure.

283
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:12,541
We are ghosts
that have no place to haunt -

284
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,125
non-existent phantoms.

285
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,916
[Music]

286
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:47,125
If you live on,
that's the proof -

287
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,000
that I lived.
