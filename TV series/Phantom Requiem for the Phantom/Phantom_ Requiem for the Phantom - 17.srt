00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,791
Romero...

3
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,083
I promise,
I'll take you.

4
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,875
I'll take you where
you always wanted to go.

5
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,875
Where no one
can catch up to us.

6
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,500
We'll go so fast,
the past will fly away.

7
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,541
We'll see the other side,
together.

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,833
I can't believe they're just
gonna call you in right now.

9
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,375
I gotta go when I'm needed,
like it or not.

10
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,500
So, does that mean,
this isn't your thing?

11
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,041
I didn't say that.

12
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,250
I'll probably
be gone a while.

13
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,541
You should go on to bed soon.

14
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,333
Naw, I'll stay up.

15
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,166
I found an old broken VCR
earlier this afternoon.

16
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,416
I think I'm gonna see
if I can get it working.

17
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,833
Just buy a new one.

18
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
That's a waste of money.

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,708
It might still work!

20
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,458
You think it'll work, huh?

21
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,458
Maybe you're right.

22
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,750
Hey, come back soon.

23
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,666
'Kay.

24
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,833
Promise?

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,625
Yeah, I promise.

26
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,416
I don't want to ever
be apart from you.

27
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,750
I want to always be
by your side.

28
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,041
If I can go back,

29
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,833
I should do it, soon.

30
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,041
And if I choose
to run from them,

31
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,666
Inferno
will never let me rest.

32
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,833
You're late, girl.

33
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,791
Hey, Lizzie.

34
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,916
Stay right there, boy!

35
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,541
Shit.

36
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,125
Sorry!

37
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,250
I'm really not trying to be
such a pain in the ass

38
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,500
all the time.

39
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,791
So you're him, huh?

40
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,916
You're the one
they like to call the Phantom,

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,958
aren't you?

42
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,833
You took out
a good friend of mine

43
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,583
at the casino
the other night.

44
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,750
You don't have to
play dumb with me.

45
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,750
I've even got a picture,
a snapshot of you

46
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,875
at the scene of the crime.

47
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,250
See?

48
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,625
I don't understand,
who took it?

49
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,541
It must've been her.

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,083
That's right.

51
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,000
Can't talk your way
outta this one.

52
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,750
It's not what it looks like,
I swear.

53
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
I can explain.

54
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,541
I'm not stupid.

55
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,416
Don't treat me
like an asshole.

56
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,541
Since people like you
only do what you're told,

57
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,791
I know that your boss
put you up to it.

58
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,208
I just wanna make sure

59
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,041
that we get all of the facts
straight.

60
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,708
I have a hunch that all three
attacks on my group

61
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,916
were ordered
by the same person.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,125
Claudia McCunnen...

63
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,291
Your boss.

64
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,958
That's a damn lie.

65
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,583
All she ever wanted to do
was get you guys

66
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,833
a stake in Inferno,

67
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,000
and she worked her ass off
to make it happen.

68
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,250
Listen, it's not like
I don't value loyalty.

69
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
But sometimes you have to
question the person

70
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,458
that you're loyal to.

71
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,125
You have to ask
if they truly deserve it.

72
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,250
She's manipulating all of us.

73
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,541
It's true, I know.

74
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,625
That's bullshit!

75
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,291
Let me ask you something.

76
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,625
Do you remember what happened
the last time we all met here?

77
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,666
Say what?

78
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm surprised.

79
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,791
I myself found it to be
quite a memorable night.

80
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,041
Yeah.

81
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,416
A big night for all of us,
about a year ago.

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,250
A year?

83
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,333
Shit!
Who are those guys?

84
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,333
The truck!

85
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,041
We did it!

86
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,000
It may be too early
to celebrate.

87
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,291
Just step on it.

88
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,875
Right.

89
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,041
So then,
that means you guys...

90
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,833
you guys were working
with Scythe.

91
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,083
Sorry, but I don't know anyone
that goes by that name.

92
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,375
We set up the whole deal
with Claudia.

93
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,833
No way.

94
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,416
We'd run into some issues
with our operations overseas.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,791
Then one day,

96
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,583
Claudia came to us with an offer
we couldn't refuse.

97
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,791
She tipped us off
to 500 kilos of coke

98
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,958
that would be easy to steal.

99
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,375
She'd even see to it
that we had the proper backup

100
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,958
and transportation.

101
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,666
She was a great host,

102
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,083
even sponsoring our
fateful night out at the casino.

103
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,375
So what in the hell
was in it for her?

104
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,000
After the dust settled,
we'd become part of Inferno.

105
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,750
She'd set everything up
as long as we acted

106
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,000
like we didn't know
about the coke deal.

107
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,625
At first, I didn't
understand it either.

108
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,500
But it started to add up
after she told us her situation.

109
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,208
She was completely on her own
inside that organization.

110
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,958
She had no real power,
no backing.

111
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,916
She wanted to
buy herself an army

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,958
for those
500 kilos of powder.

113
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,500
She told the top brass
at Inferno

114
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,041
that we had an issue
with our South Asian supplier.

115
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,541
She made that whole thing up.

116
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,458
The Godo family's
huge drug market

117
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,208
was actually just established
by me in the last year.

118
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,083
I did it by using
all that blow we lifted

119
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,750
outta the truck that night.

120
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,250
So, Claudia
was playing Scythe.

121
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,666
Yeah.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,583
I remember there was
some guy that was set up

123
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,583
to take the fall for that.

124
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,166
I guess that was
this "Scythe" person

125
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,416
you're talking about.

126
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,125
It's me.

127
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,875
We've had a change of plans.

128
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,166
Scythe has betrayed
the organization.

129
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,625
He used Phantom
to attack Inferno's shipment.

130
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,958
The organization is pouring
all its resources

131
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,666
into hunting
both of them down.

132
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,708
And then, you could
prove your innocence,

133
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,333
and maybe get Ein back.

134
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,875
You still remember
how to use this, don't you?

135
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,125
She was behind everything.

136
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,750
She set it up.

137
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,625
Scythe!

138
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,625
Because of her lies,
we suffered.

139
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,041
And I lost Eren.

140
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,833
You look like you're
about to start bawling

141
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,083
so I guess something I said
rang a bell for you.

142
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,625
Is that true?
Phantom?

143
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,333
So, even the legendary Phantom
is no match

144
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,458
for a scheming bitch like her.

145
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,958
Tough break.

146
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,500
But you're not the only one
that she was setting up

147
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,333
to take a hit.

148
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,583
That bitch...

149
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,750
was trying to get the Godo
Family's muscle behind her

150
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,250
and then cut me and Shiga
out of the final deal.

151
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,375
But when her plan
to keep us quiet hit a snag,

152
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,958
she used the opportunity

153
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,125
to take out
her biggest rival.

154
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,833
That woman is capable
of some pretty underhanded shit.

155
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,583
That's how it all went down.

156
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,083
You see now?

157
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,666
That heartless woman
made fools of all of us.

158
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,458
You know, I could give
a rat's ass about Inferno.

159
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,958
But no one is gonna
make a fool out of Daisuke Godo

160
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
and live to tell about it!

161
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,583
It's all a lie!

162
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,541
I don't believe any of it!

163
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,875
How the hell am I

164
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,375
supposed to take trash
like you at your word?

165
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,250
Quiet!

166
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,625
Where are you hiding,
you son of a bitch?

167
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,958
Where are you hiding?

168
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,250
It's her.

169
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,125
Hey! Get in!

170
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,541
You go on!

171
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,666
Hey!

172
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,333
No! Eren!

173
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,000
But, Eren...

174
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,833
I can't believe it.

175
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,041
You're alive!

176
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
But... but how?

177
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,750
Please talk to me, Eren!

178
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,750
Why are you doing this?

179
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,583
I'm not Eren.

180
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,958
That's not my name.

181
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,416
I am Ein.

182
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,958
My name...

183
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,625
Is Ein...

184
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,166
Like always.

185
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,500
You'd be wise to run.

186
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,875
Quickly, because Inferno will be
hunting you down very soon.

187
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,458
And this time,
they won't just talk.

188
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,083
Inferno?

189
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,541
No! Eren, wait!

190
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,875
Eren!

191
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,250
My name... is Ein.

192
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,458
Like always.

193
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,833
It's him.

194
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,958
I know it is.

195
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,125
Scythe!

196
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,583
This is wonderful.

197
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,416
Such magnificent
confusion and distrust

198
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,958
at the highest levels of power.

199
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,625
I must say
you've shown great skill

200
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,000
in playing
your chosen pawns,

201
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,041
leading your enemies
and former allies

202
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,000
down the blood-stained
path of destruction

203
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,500
seemingly
by their own hands.

204
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,916
But wait,
it gets much better.

205
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,000
I sent a liaison to Inferno

206
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,041
to tell the full story
of my foe's betrayal.

207
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,250
Knowing their penchant
for blood,

208
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:12,041
I imagine the action taken
will be swift and decisive.

209
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,958
The traitorous wench
Claudia McCunnen

210
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,041
will be eliminated.

211
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,958
As will her lapdog
they call "Phantom."

212
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,125
Inferno's coming.

213
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,375
We gotta move.

214
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,166
I've gotta save Cal.

215
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,458
Of course you passed
the entrance exams, Mio,

216
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,333
I knew you would.

217
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,916
Good job, kid.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
I came over as soon as
I got the news.

219
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,791
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,000
Is this not
a good time for you?

221
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,583
No, no, I'm glad
you stopped by.

222
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,041
But, your trading business.

223
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,041
Isn't it a lot of work?

224
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,583
Yeah, it is, but, hey,

225
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,375
I'll be out of the country
on a buying trip for a while.

226
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,916
You want me to bring back
anything for you?

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,166
Come on, you do too much.

228
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,208
Besides, if you keep
getting me stuff,

229
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,791
Mom is gonna find out.

230
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,833
Yeah.

231
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,166
I guess you're right.

232
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,833
Well, I'm supposed to meet up
with some friends of mine, so...

233
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,833
Okay, go have some fun.

234
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,375
I'll...
I'll see you later.

235
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,166
See ya.

236
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,833
Her mom may have left
the family,

237
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,500
but Mio's still got the same
Godo blood in her veins.

238
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,666
the same cursed blood as I do.

239
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,916
If someone out there

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,250
wanted to take advantage
of that fact,

241
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,666
she won't know
to protect herself.

242
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,375
she doesn't have any idea
who she really is.

243
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,291
She may have
a different life

244
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,875
and a different last name
than I do,

245
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,291
but she's still my sister,

246
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,041
my kid sister.

247
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,375
Well, it's a big score
this time.

248
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,291
If this is the one that I don't
make it back from alive...

249
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
Shiga...

250
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,291
I'll be there for her,
I promise.

251
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,791
I'll watch over Mio.

252
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,083
I'll take full responsibility
for your sister's safety.

253
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,583
I know you will.

254
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,583
The gut and the shoulder...

255
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,583
Ha!

256
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,291
No prob...

257
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,208
I've taken twice as many bullets
as this pussy put in me

258
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,458
and lived to tell about it.

259
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,041
For me, pain is just...
a fact of life.

260
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey!

261
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,708
So who's left?

262
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,916
No one.

263
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,791
I see.

264
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,041
I guess, it's just
the two of us again, huh?

265
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
Just like...
like old times.

266
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,958
No matter what happened,
you always stuck with me.

267
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,708
We always got by with my guts,
and your brains.

268
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,791
What is it?

269
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,833
Nothing.

270
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,916
So, any news on Claudia?

271
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,333
No, but I'm sure
Inferno will take care of her.

272
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,833
More importantly,
we should direct our thoughts

273
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,000
to the fate
of the Godo Family.

274
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,625
That woman
ran afoul of Inferno

275
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,041
and we were aligned with her.

276
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,500
They won't look
upon that lightly.

277
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,208
They'll take us to war.

278
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,750
To hell with that whole
organization.

279
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,833
They played us for fools.

280
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,083
And I'm gonna make them
pay for that!

281
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,875
We'll get them back
for our guys.

282
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,833
Whattaya say?

283
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,416
Let's kill 'em all ourselves.

284
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't believe
that will be necessary.

285
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,333
What?

286
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,166
The path of least resistance

287
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,458
is one death.

288
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,916
This will end it.

289
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,208
Oh?

290
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,041
Given the current
circumstances,

291
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,833
you may not believe
what I say to you,

292
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,750
but still,
I always admired you.

293
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,958
I loved you like a brother.

294
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,041
Yeah?

295
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,041
Shiga!

296
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,166
Now that this rebel's
been disposed,

297
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,208
trust can once again
be granted to the Godos.

298
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,625
I will speak to Inferno
of the lengths you've gone

299
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,041
to right his wrongs.

300
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,125
I'm positive the Godos' stature
will be restored.

301
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,291
Bastard!

302
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm so tempted to add your body
to tonight's count.

303
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,666
But can you...

304
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,375
Mr. Shiga?

305
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:16,083
I believe that you and I
are men of a similar mind.

306
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,583
The two of us
will get along famously.

307
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,958
I'm sure of it.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,541
Clo...

309
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,416
Are you here?

310
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,666
Clo?

311
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,583
Where are you?

312
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,166
Where the hell are you?

313
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,833
Give me your excuses.

314
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,750
Even if they're lies.

315
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,833
You'd be wise to run.

316
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,375
Quickly because Inferno will be
hunting you down very soon.

317
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:57,958
They're coming.

318
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,208
Cal!

319
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,125
Please be safe.

320
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,541
Not tired of it yet?

321
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,375
Of course not.

322
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,875
I guess you like the music, huh?

323
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,916
I love it.

324
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,500
It reminds me
that someone I care about,

325
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,541
cares about me too.

326
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,208
I used to think
I had nothing.

327
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn't even have
the boring old things

328
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,083
that everybody else
takes for granted.

329
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,541
I thought I'd never get
anything as special as this.

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,000

The only salvation,

339
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,958
the only reason this world

00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,041
is because you're alive.
