[Music]

2
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,250
Then it's kill
or be killed!

3
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,000
So you woke up.

4
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,916
You don't have to be
scared of me.

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,791
I won't attack you anymore.

6
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,166
Who are you?

7
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,208
I no longer have a name.

8
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,041
But you can call me Ein
if you need to.

9
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,708
That is what
I am now known as.

10
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,250
Tell me, Ein.

11
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,791
Why did you attack me?

12
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,750
I was told to
verify your talent.

13
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,708
What talent?

14
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,500
You possess certain abilities
you may not be aware of.

15
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
You have the talent to kill,

16
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,166
and the talent to survive.

17
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,083
These are both skills
of an assassin.

18
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,166
No way!

19
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,875
But this doesn't
make any sense!

20
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,625
What the hell
makes you think that anyway?

21
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,166
Because you tried very hard
to kill me.

22
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,541
In your situation,

23
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,875
an ordinary person
would have panicked.

24
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,500
They would have frozen up.

25
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,875
And they would have
been killed.

26
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,750
But you were different.

27
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,166
You acted on your instincts,

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,416
before you even fully
understood the situation.

29
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,666
And you survived.

30
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,333
Zwei.

31
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,708
Zwei?

32
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,541
That is your new name.

33
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,708
No, it's not.

34
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,916
You can't just call me
whatever you want.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
Why don't you call me
by my real name?

36
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,750
It's...

37
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,125
My name is...

38
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,083
You're wasting your time.

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,333
You no longer have that name.

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
What do you mean?

41
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,583
All your memories
were erased.

42
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,833
By a group called Inferno.

43
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,458
Just wonderful.

44
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,833
After the shooting death...

45
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,000
Your little Phantom

46
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,625
is the best in the field,
Scythe Master.

47
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,250
I'm honored.
Thank you, Mr. McGuire.

48
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,458
I'll be damned!

49
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,250
Can't believe a kid
pulled a job like that.

50
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,375
Yet, it makes sense.

51
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,333
Why else would we bestow
the moniker of "Phantom"

52
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,458
on the little thing?

53
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,916
It is quite the feat.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,958
The creation of a ghost
living among us

55
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,833
but not entirely
of this world.

56
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:52,375
We owe many thanks
to the backing of Ms. McCunnen.

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,958
You have
a good subordinate, Claudia.

58
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,791
By the way,
I heard there was a slight issue

59
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,291
getting rid
of that journalist.

60
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,250
Was he too much to handle?

61
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,291
No! No trouble at all.

62
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,583
I also heard

63
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,250
that the execution
was witnessed by a tourist.

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,916
Is that true?

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,625
I don't know where
you got that information,

66
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,583
but we took care
of all witnesses,

67
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,166
and the target's body.

68
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,166
The scene
was totally cleaned.

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,916
Good.
That makes me happy.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250
You used Phantom
for all of that?

71
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,291
Yes.

72
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,416
You were supposed
to be killed,

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,833
so all evidence
could be eliminated.

74
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,041
But, Master
noticed your talent,

75
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,291
and he thought it'd be
a waste if you died.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,291
"Master"?

77
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
Scythe Master.

78
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,166
He's my boss.

79
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,625
He decided that it would be
best to erase your memory,

80
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,541
to use the talents
that he saw in you...

81
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,750
and prepare you
for another life.

82
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,625
One as a member
of Inferno.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,916
In this new life,
you'll be an assassin.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,708
An assassin?
But why?

85
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,333
We're bringing you on board
as my second.

86
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,250
We need your talent, Zwei.

87
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,375
That's crazy!

88
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,958
Why the hell would I do that?

89
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm not a killer!

90
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,583
You are absolutely free
to refuse our offer.

91
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,166
But know that if you do...

92
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,416
things will continue
as we originally planned

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,625
right here, right now.

94
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,083
And I will kill you.

95
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,000
You have to be reborn
if you want to live.

96
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,416
From this point on,
you exist solely

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,833
for the purpose of
killing other people.

98
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,625
But I...

99
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't wanna die.

100
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,625
A dream.

101
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,708
That's all.

102
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,791
Just a bad dream
I can wake up from.

103
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,250
Believe that
if it comforts you.

104
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,333
Just keep thinking
that everything is a dream.

105
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,958
But, it's going to be
a very long one.

106
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,208
Put those on.

107
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,583
From this point forward,
you'll be with me at all times.

108
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,083
Follow every direction
I give you.

109
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,125
You got that?

110
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,166
Let's get started.

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,833
Zwei is progressing
through training as planned.

112
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,041
He hasn't made
a single fuss.

113
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,375
The boy is obedient.

114
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,458
If one trains
that hard every day,

115
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,250
I would imagine
forming any kind of thought

116
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,625
would be difficult.

117
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,583
That's precisely
how you tame someone.

118
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,166
You won't be disappointed
in the results, Ms. McCunnen,

119
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,375
I promise you that.

120
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,458
Do I seem too eager?

121
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,583
My pawn is your pawn
is my pawn, madam.

122
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,083
But we both know that everything
is an offering to Inferno.

123
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,458
Don't put your finger
on the trigger

124
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,458
until you're ready to fire.

125
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,125
And don't focus on
your shoulders or your arms.

126
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,375
Focus on the fingers
that hold the gun.

127
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,291
This is the front sight.

128
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,041
You aim by looking
at the front sight

129
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,041
through the notch
in the rear sight.

130
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,083
When you have the gun ready,
stabilize like this...

131
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,000
stretch your right arm out...

132
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,458
and then pull
with your left arm.

133
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,333
And even then, focus on
your hands, not your arms.

134
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,083
When you fire the gun,
don't rush.

135
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,416
Stay calm
and squeeze the trigger.

136
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,083
Now, fire.

137
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,666
Fire
the remaining five continuously.

138
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,250
At this distance,
you shouldn't miss a shot.

139
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,833
Once you can do that,
we'll work on your speed.

140
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,833
Your goal is six shots
in four seconds.

141
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,500
Focus on hitting those targets
every time.

142
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,708
You're still too slow.

143
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,916
Even though you can
hit them all now,

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,250
you'll be dead before
you empty the chamber.

145
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,916
Do it again.

146
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,750
Do it again.

147
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,458
All I do...

148
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,750
is exactly
what I'm told to do.

149
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,750
As long as
I keep doing this,

150
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,791
as long as I stay focused,

151
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,583
I won't have to think
about anything.

152
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,625
As long as I do this...

153
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,291
I feel relief.

154
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,333
I even forget
all the questions I have.

155
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,791
And then the day...

156
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,750
...just disappears.

157
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,166
I'm going out.

158
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,416
Keep up with the same
training routine.

159
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,458
Where're you going?

160
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,291
I have work to do.

161
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,333
Let's go, Phantom.

162
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,791
Yes, Master.

163
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,833
Master?

164
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,250
That man...
he must be Scythe Master.

165
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,000
This is your first sniping
assignment in a while.

166
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,208
But I'm sure it will be
a piece of cake for you.

167
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,125
700 yards to the target.

168
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,166
I have a .308 caliber
Remington waiting for you.

169
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,958
The weather at the location
is cloudy with a slight breeze

170
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,000
and should remain that way
until tomorrow morning.

171
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,416
Details are in the envelope.

172
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,625
Do you have any questions?

173
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,958
No, sir.

174
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,375
Good.

175
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,958
By the way,
how is Zwei doing?

176
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,916
The initial training phase
has been completed.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,375
He'll be starting
a new regimen tomorrow.

178
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,875
I'm thinking
it's almost time for me

179
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,125
to prepare
a skills test for him.

180
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,208
Don't mind me.

181
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,500
Continue what you're doing.

182
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,041
I should start off
with "hello."

183
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,666
My name is Claudia McCunnen.

184
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,166
Are you curious to know
more than just my name?

185
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,958
No.

186
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,416
You've got to have
some questions

187
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,666
about the organization
that took you in.

188
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,958
Inferno?

189
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,458
I'm taking your lack of reply
as an affirmative.

190
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,375
Inferno is...

191
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,458
Well...

192
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,291
In a world of no legal order,

193
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,250
it is a group
that aspires to the creation

194
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,166
of a different kind of order.

195
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,208
Try this.

196
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,625
If we were to compare gangs
and mafia families to countries,

197
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,958
then Inferno is somewhat like
the United Nations.

198
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,250
Its goal is to unify
the underground world.

199
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,958
Such an idealistic goal
would have been laughable

200
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,875
if not condemnable
just a few years ago.

201
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,958
But we now have something

202
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
that will make
all of this possible.

203
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,500
I mean Phantom.

204
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,333
Yes.
That's your instructor.

205
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,416
The power of Phantom is...

206
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,708
absolute.

207
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,500
She eliminates the target
without fail.

208
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,750
Her existence gives Inferno
every confidence.

209
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,125
It's the fear,

210
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,791
the tremendous fear
organizations have of her

211
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,333
that keeps them
from defying Inferno.

212
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:16,375
She is truly the most powerful
assassin in the world.

213
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,541
Hold on.

214
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,000
She's just someone like me

215
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,708
that's being used
by your people.

216
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,250
That means Phantom and I

217
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,583
have no other choice
but to live like slaves.

218
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,125
It's true that we're
forcing both of you

219
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
to live this way.

220
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,458
But, you are not slaves.

221
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,875
You have freedoms
of which you're not aware.

222
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,458
Like speed.

223
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,333
How so?

224
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,625
Though your path may be set,

225
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,625
you can gain as much speed
down that path

226
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,583
as you would like.

227
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,083
You just need
the desire to progress.

228
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,500
And if you're fast enough,

229
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,916
you may even be able
to reach the top.

230
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,958
How you choose
to get there, that's up to you.

231
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,416
Now, don't ever think of
yourself as a slave again, okay?

232
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,416
Remember that the way
you present yourself

233
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,750
colors how others view you.

234
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,958
Act like a slave,
and you'll be treated like one.

235
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,583
CLAUDIA: I'd love to stay
and chat longer,

236
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,291
but there's some business
that needs my attention.

237
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,958
Alright, Zwei.

238
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,541
Bye.

239
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,291
You know, cars are meant
to be driven by people.

240
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,708
They're not driven by puppets.

241
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,125
Though your path may be set,

242
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,083
you can gain as much speed
down that path

243
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,958
as you would like.

244
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,166
You just need the desire
to progress.

245
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,958
Desire...

246
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,000
Freedom...

247
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,666
I'd forgotten those words
this whole time.

248
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,666
Ein...

249
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,708
Yes?

250
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,833
On your job, did you...
kill someone?

251
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,000
Hmm.

252
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,458
How'd you get this way?

253
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,291
Why do you do it?

254
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
I don't know.

255
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,625
They never told me
about my life before this.

256
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,666
Like me.

257
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,625
That's right.
I'm just like you.

258
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,916
They erased
all of my memories.

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,375
Made me a killer.

260
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,625
But, who cares?

261
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,791
The most important thing

262
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,708
is surviving one moment
to the next.

263
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,000
Because a killer...

264
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,708
doesn't have a past
and doesn't have a future.

265
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,500
They have nothing.

266
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,625
But...

267
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,583
This woman named Claudia,
she said...

268
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,000
You met her?

269
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,125
She came by here
when you were gone.

270
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,333
She said you and I
aren't slaves for Inferno,

271
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,541
she said we're free.

272
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,000
If you want to believe that,
then go ahead.

273
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,791
But, eventually
you'll feel nothing,

274
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,875
just the same as me.

275
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,416
It's the only way
to bear the burden...

276
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,833
just turn off.

277
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,000
Some day,
you'll feel just like me.

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
You'll understand
once you start killing people.

279
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,958
Out here, alone,

280
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,083
it's easy
to pull the trigger...

281
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,083
the target
is just a brick.

282
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,750
But, if it's something else...

283
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,750
Fire.

284
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,333
Now, Zwei! Do it.

285
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,166
Zwei!

286
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,541
[Music]

287
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,041
This is the continuation
of the dream...

288
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,333
the dream from which
you will never awake...

289
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,041
until you die.
