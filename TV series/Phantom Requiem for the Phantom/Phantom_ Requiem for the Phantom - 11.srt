[Music]

2
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,500
Where should I go

3
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,833
when I don't even know
where I came from?

4
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,041
When I don't even have
memories?

5
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,541
What do I have to do
to become free?

6
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
What is freedom when you have to
kill people for it?

7
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,875
Tell me, please.

8
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,125
Smile, Eren.

9
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,083
Please smile.

10
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,750
I want you
to give it to the police.

11
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,208
That's all you have to do.

12
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,750
Now hurry.

13
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,083
Wait! Hold on!

14
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,916
I have to run or I'm dead.

15
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't escape
from those cold black eyes.

16
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,583
If you don't want to die...

17
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,000
then come at me
with everything you've got.

18
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,125
You possess certain abilities
you may not be aware of.

19
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,791
You have the talent to kill,

20
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,041
and the talent to survive.

21
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,500
These are both skills
of an assassin.

22
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,250
You have to be reborn
if you want to live.

23
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,875
From this point on,

24
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,833
you exist solely for the purpose
of killing other people.

25
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,750
What is our way of existing?

26
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,375
Do you know?

27
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,000
Be a tool.

28
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,291
Be an instrument.

29
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,083
All we need to do
is just function.

30
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,666
Don't think
about unnecessary things.

31
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,166
Stealing the memories
of a boy from a far away place,

32
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,500
and training him
to be an assassin.

33
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,875
It was all Scythe's idea,
and I went along with it,

34
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,916
which some might consider
reckless.

35
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,125
But I needed it.

36
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,666
At any cost.

37
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,083
I needed Phantom's power.

38
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,125
Phantom,

39
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,750
the strongest assassin
in all of Inferno.

40
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,916
And the title given to the top
sniper in the organization.

41
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,375
My greatest masterpiece.

42
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,583
And now, he is another.

43
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,291
Hold on.

44
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,541
She's just someone like me

45
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,916
that's being used
by your people.

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,875
That means Phantom and I

47
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,125
have no other choice
but to live like slaves.

48
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,583
It's true that we're forcing
both of you to live this way.

49
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,541
But, you are not slaves.

50
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,041
You have freedoms
of which you're not aware.

51
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,750
Like speed.

52
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,666
How so?

53
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,833
Though your path may be set,

54
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,875
you can gain as much speed
down that path

55
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,000
as you would like.

56
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,625
You just need
the desire to progress.

57
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,166
And if you're fast enough,

58
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,875
you may even be able
to reach the top.

59
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,583
How you choose to get there,

60
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,916
that's up to you.

61
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,166
Lizzie...

62
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,875
Question?

63
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,166
Is there anything
you wouldn't do

64
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,083
if you were ordered?

65
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,708
I don't think
I'd have lasted this long

66
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,875
in the game
if that were the case.

67
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,458
Sounds like something you'd say.

68
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,625
Hey, Clo.

69
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,166
Listen.

70
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,833
Yes?

71
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,541
I've been really wanting
to apologize to you

72
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,916
for a while now.

73
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,416
Four years ago,

74
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,750
because I was stuck up
in the pen,

75
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,166
I couldn't get your back.

76
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,958
With me gone,
Isaac started wildin',

77
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,708
messing up everything
you had built up.

78
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,916
'Course, Romero
did his part, too.

79
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,333
If only I had been around...

80
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,958
That's all in the past.

81
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,000
The weak will always
be overcome by the strong.

82
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,708
That's just
the way of the world.

83
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,625
It's a natural thing.

84
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,958
It's a motivator.

85
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,875
Why else do you think
I became a member of Inferno?

86
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
But Clo...

87
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,750
That which I lost...

88
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,833
that which was
taken from me...

89
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,000
I can take it all back
someday.

90
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,916
There is one more thing.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,041
I have another task
for you in LA.

92
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,750
So your superiors
will owe you one,

93
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,000
you want to make
an unexpected contribution.

94
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,250
Yes.

95
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,333
So what do you think
about making this one

96
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,000
a bit more clandestine?

97
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,791
I must confess to you,

98
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,125
I enjoy doing things sub-rosa.

99
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,416
This is a man
I no longer need.

100
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,208
I'll take Zwei.

101
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,583
I'll take Phantom.

102
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,333
You're kidding.

103
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,875
Here.

104
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,541
I thought you might
want your passport.

105
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,750
Your identity..

106
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,791
your name...

107
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,958
and your past.

108
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,791
Read the name out loud.

109
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,500
Azuma...

110
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,375
Reiji...

111
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,916
That's right, I do.

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,333
I was traveling...

113
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,375
And then...

114
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,083
Hello,
this is the Azuma residence.

115
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,000
Hello? Is anyone there?

116
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,583
Hello?

117
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,750
Hello?

118
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,625
I can never go back.

119
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,375
Never.

120
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Shit! Who are those guys?

121
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,625
Phantom?

122
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,916
Goddamn Scythe!

123
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,958
Are you crazy?

124
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,125
You're shooting
your own people?

125
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,166
I don't care

126
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,708
if Scythe ordered you
to do this.

127
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,875
Stop being his goddamn puppet!

128
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,208
You can't escape from here!

129
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,291
Think about it!

130
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,458
Ein!

131
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,041
Okay.

132
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,458
Ein, I will protect you now.

133
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,541
I promise I will.

134
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,875
And I'll never
let the organization take you.

135
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,708
Let's go, together,

136
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,791
leave here,
leave Inferno.

137
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,541
Reiji...

138
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,708
you shouldn't
concern yourself with me.

139
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,333
You have nothing
to gain from it.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,833
I don't wanna gain from it.

141
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,833
I just don't wanna
see you die.

142
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,250
I have to try and help you.

143
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,208
It's part of
what makes me who I am.

144
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,416
We need to give you
a real name.

145
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,708
Real name?

146
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,666
Not some number, not Phantom.

147
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,000
Your name.

148
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,416
A new name for your life
ahead of you.

149
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,416
Eren, it's Eren.

150
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,541
That's your name.

151
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,375
You're Eren from now on.

152
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,250
But why, why is it Eren?

153
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,791
It doesn't matter.

154
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,833
It's just what it is now.

155
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,458
It's a name that you'll start
your new life with.

156
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,333
A life where you're not
a killer or a puppet.

157
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,666
Eren.

158
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,708
Eren.

159
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,666
It feels so strange.

160
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,666
Eren.

161
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,708
Come on.

162
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,541
Let's find your past together.

163
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,916
You don't seem yourself
today, Ein.

164
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,458
Come on.

165
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,250
Overcome the pain
with your inner strength.

166
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,375
You came for me.

167
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,916
So you were taken in
by Scythe's toy?

168
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,708
No. You're lying.

169
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,041
You're such an idiot.

170
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't you realize
you were helping a traitor?

171
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,125
That doesn't
look good for you.

172
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,375
Not getting back to Japan

173
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,833
should be the very least
of your worries.

174
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,541
But still, there is one way

175
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,750
you could get out
of this predicament

176
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,541
if you really wanted to.

177
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,791
You could prove your innocence

178
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,416
and maybe get Ein back.

179
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,125
How?

180
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,250
Tell me.

181
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,416
You still remember
how to use this, don't you?

182
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,458
Of course I do.

183
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,500
And I will kill him with it.

184
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,250
Scythe!

185
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,041
Reiji.

186
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,958
What an interesting outcome.

187
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,500
A twist suitable
for the finale.

188
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,125
There are two major
organizations,

189
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
each of which maintains
a controlling interest

190
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,208
on the East Coast.

191
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,541
Over the past three months,

192
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,875
we've contacted both
the Renato Family in Boston

193
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,458
and the Baldino Family
in Philadelphia.

194
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,416
We've already begun negotiations
with their seconds-in-command

195
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,125
on their conditions
for joining us.

196
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,000
And of course, our policy
remains the same as always.

197
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,083
We will bring prosperity
to those who show allegiance.

198
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,208
And we will bring death
to those who defy us.

199
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,625
Destruction and creation.

200
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,833
Soon, everything
in this country will change.

201
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,791
It will be our era.

202
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,833
Inferno's era.

203
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,416
You really think
it's a wise choice

204
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,875
to let that woman
run everything?

205
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,208
She's unrivaled
in what she does.

206
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,916
And seeing
that Inferno is growing

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,750
at a shocking rate
these days,

208
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,416
I'd say her presence
as a coordinator

209
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,333
seems to be essential,

210
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,375
for now.

211
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,833
You have your little entourage,
the Bloodies.

212
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,708
And of course,
I have my own.

213
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,041
However, she doesn't have
backing like we do,

214
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,708
that's how
she can remain neutral

215
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,250
to the various interests
within the organization.

216
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,875
She's got Phantom, doesn't she?

217
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,875
It's true
that Phantom is formidable.

218
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,208
But think,

219
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,583
Phantom alone would not
be enough for her

220
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,625
to take on Inferno.

221
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,416
Ask Scythe Master.

222
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,833
He learned that lesson
three months ago.

223
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,916
That's true.

224
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,125
He's such a fool,
now that he's lost Phantom.

225
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,541
Worthless.

226
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,833
Dr. Giuseppe!

227
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,958
I appreciate your patience.

228
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,333
If Claudia's head
ever swells too big,

229
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,666
and she pulls
a stunt like that...

230
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,416
then we'll just eliminate her.

231
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,458
Take her out for a spin.

232
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,166
Get to know her
a little better.

233
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,583
Just be back
within the hour.

234
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,250
Does something
not sit right with you?

235
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,916
I'm not sure I see
the benefit, Ms. McCunnen.

236
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,291
I'd like to know
what you're going to gain

237
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,416
by offering
such good terms to us,

238
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,666
if you don't mind.

239
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,416
I'm just trying to do
the Godo Family a favor.

240
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
And knowing your family's
reputation for loyalty,

241
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,875
I'm trying to get you
to owe me one.

242
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,750
Yeah?

243
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,041
So you're looking
for backing, huh?

244
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes.

245
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,416
I'll give you 200 million.

246
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,541
But in the end,
I'll gain something

247
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,125
that's worth
so much more to me than money.

248
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,250
I see, sounds like
a fair deal to me.

249
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,625
So, each time
we turn a profit,

250
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,541
we write up a report
and give it to you.

251
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,750
Sounds like we're gonna make
a killing on this deal.

252
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,250
Although, I get the feeling

253
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,291
that we may be in your debt
for quite awhile.

254
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,041
This is just the beginning.

255
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,000
Isn't that right, Romero?

256
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,333
Can't be.

257
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,541
He killed this many men
by himself?

258
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,708
Who the hell...

259
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,750
Who is he?

260
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,041
Now, Zwei!

261
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,250
In acknowledgment
of your loyalty

262
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,125
and contribution to Inferno,

263
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,916
we bestow
this glorious title upon you.

264
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,708
We approve your succession.

265
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,875
From this point on,
you shall stand on high,

266
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,208
and allow your name
to resound.

267
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,791
It will resound
in the underworld, with fear.

268
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,958
Phantom!

269
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,416
From this moment on,

270
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,875
that is how you are known,

271
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,916
you are the Phantom
of Inferno.

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,208
I will get everything I want.

273
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,541
But to do that,
I'm going to need you, Reiji.

274
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,625
I need a Phantom of my own.

275
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,833
[Music]

276
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,375
Okay, Reiji!

277
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,666
You might not like it,

278
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,458
but from now on,
you and I are partners!
