2
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,791
You're finally awake.

3
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,416
Let me out.

4
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,583
Why should I?

5
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,791
Master, I have to find him.

6
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,333
Scythe betrayed Inferno
and ran like a coward.

7
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,583
And he also left you behind,
remember?

8
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,291
I know what happened.

9
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,166
I will try to find
Master regardless,

10
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,250
and if I cannot go with him,
I will still help him escape.

11
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,000
I can stir things up.

12
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,333
I can dispose of whoever
is following him.

13
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,916
Stop the car.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,416
No way.

15
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,458
If you wanna continue
your mission,

16
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,708
you'd be better off
staying with me.

17
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,166
Although you may not be
with Scythe right now,

18
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,250
you're still protecting him.

19
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,750
Phantom's powerful reputation
and the way he controls it

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,166
is always
hanging over him, guarding him.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,333
I guarantee the organization
will be very careful.

22
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,375
So if you were
to get picked up now,

23
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,291
he would lose
that kind of protection.

24
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,750
You're a different
person now, you've changed.

25
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,000
Have I?

26
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,416
You have.

27
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Everything about you
has changed.

28
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,708
Because, you are no longer
just a number.

29
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,166
You're Reiji Azuma.

30
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,958
So you were listening.

31
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,500
You have a home
to go back to now,

32
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,583
you have your own identity.

33
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:53,666
Not me, I have no home,
and no name.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,916
All I have is the number
Master gave me, Ein.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And the only place I can go
is back to my Master's side.

36
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,166
That's not true.

37
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,416
Nothing belongs to me.

38
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,083
I belong to Master.

39
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,875
I am his possession.

40
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,166
Ein!

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,458
I am not a person,

42
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,625
I am a shadow,

43
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,875
just Phantom.

44
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,458
You're more than that.

45
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:37,916
Thanks a lot, sir.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,875
My pleasure.

47
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,250
That should help a little.

48
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,708
Did you know I'd still
be here when you came back?

49
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,041
You may be reckless,
but not stupid.

50
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,958
They've recovered
the hijacked truck.

51
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,708
Empty as a scoundrel's promise.

52
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,500
Bastard took our product
and got the hell away clean.

53
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,250
Your dog done pissed
on the wrong leg,

54
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,333
time to take him
to the woodshed.

55
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll see that it's done.

[Music]

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,125
You know this song?

58
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,500
Oh, sorry, is it too loud?

59
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,333
You know what it's called?

60
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,916
Uh, I can't remember the name.

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
But I heard it a lot
back home.

62
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,333
It was pretty popular
for awhile.

63
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,708
It was popular?

64
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,833
So everyone there
likes songs like this?

65
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,541
Japan's just the same
as anywhere else in the world.

66
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,333
Everybody has
different tastes in music.

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,041
Tell me something else
about Japan.

68
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,000
You got your memories back,
right?

69
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,458
So you remember things
about your life

70
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,291
back home in Japan,
don't you?

71
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,666
Yeah, I do.

I hope it's to your liking.

Are you kidding me?

Everything's perfect.
I couldn't ask for more.

78
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,291
I must say
it's been a real pleasure

79
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,416
doing business with you,
Ms. McCunnen.

I'll contact you
as soon as we've settled in.

to hearing from you.

Bye.

83
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,666
I wouldn't put much stock
in that woman.

84
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,125
For the sake of the Family,

85
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,291
we should view her as a fox
in well-tailored clothes.

86
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,666
I'm well aware of that.

87
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,916
She's in a unique position

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to extend our
influence overseas, that's all.

89
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
It's risky still.

Come on, don't get cold feet
on me now, Shiga.

always do.

Please, leave me behind, Reiji.

94
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,208
You should go back home.

95

Go home?

That's right.

00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,500
How the hell
can I go back home now?

98
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,083
You know all the horrible
things I've done

99

these past six months,
don't you?

100
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,375
I can never go back
to a normal life.

101
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,791
You can, you have a past
and a real name,

102
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,958
you're Reiji Azuma,

103
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,250
and you really exist
in this world.

104
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,833
You really exist too.

105
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,666
You can find out who you are.

106
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,833
It's not the same.

107
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,833
You have something
that I will never have,

108
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,125
you have something
that will prove who you are.

109
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,916
Is this thing here what makes
you and I so damn different?

110
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,791
It is.

111
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,375
That passport gives you
proof of your identity.

112
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,083
I don't have that proof.

113
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,208
Why are you doing that?

114
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,708
But why?

115
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,166
Do you have any idea
what you've thrown away?

116
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,541
That proves who you are!

117
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,458
That was just paper.

118
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,708
And that does not contain
all that I am.

119
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
I have memories.

120
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,125
So do you,
somewhere inside you.

121
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,125
You told me before
about your dreams,

122
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,333
those are memories,

123
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,375
memories of somewhere.

124
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,125
A place full of sunlight
and strong winds.

125
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,541
Maybe they're memories of home.

126
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,000
Those are just illusions.

127
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,125
There's no reason to think
they're memories from home.

128
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,166
They didn't just come
from nowhere.

129
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,375
The fact is,
you have a real past.

130
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,375
And you have
your own real name.

131
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,500
Not just some number like Ein.

132
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,833
Reiji...

133
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,041
You shouldn't concern yourself
with me.

134
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,166
You have nothing
to gain from it.

135
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,041
I don't wanna gain from it.

136
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,875
I just don't wanna
see you die.

137
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,583
I have to try and help you.

138
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,000
It's part of what makes me
who I am.

139
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,000
This is my true identity.

140
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,833
I have to stay faithful to it.

141
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,708
It's a lot more real to me
than some damn piece of paper.

142
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,125
It is me.

143
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,041
License, please.

144
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,125
Where ya comin' from?

145
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,166
From L.A.

146
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,708
Driving out to see
an old friend.

147
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,000
Mr. Wallace Yang, age 20.

148
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,791
You sure don't look 20.

149
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,750
Tell me about it.

150
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,166
Who's she?

151
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
That's my kid sister.

152
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,916
Is she alright?

153
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,625
Cars make her a little
queasy, but she'll be okay.

154
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,833
Alright.
You're free to go.

155
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,500
You've gotten much better.

156
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,625
You mean my acting?

157
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,083
Well, I had a good coach.

158
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,791
You taught me
everything I know.

159
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,958
So what are you planning
to do next?

160
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,916
We need to keep moving,

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,250
stopping to let you rest
along the way.

162
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,291
And when you're all healed up,
we'll go somewhere far away.

163
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,625
Far away?

164
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
Like where?

165
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,083
As far as we can.

166
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,000
Impossible.

167
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,041
We have to.

168
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,083
I've already made up my mind
about it.

169
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,875
I'm gonna go grab us
something to eat.

170
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,125
Hey! Open up!

171
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,166
Yesterday was the first time
I really felt afraid.

172
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,125
I'm scared.

173
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,583
But I can't pull the trigger.

174
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,583
Reiji, please help me.

175
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,875
End this nightmare.

176
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,375
I can never do that, Ein.

177
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't give up on you.

178
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,083
You've changed.

179
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,416
You've always been
so much stronger

180
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,666
than I ever was.

181
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,666
No, that's not true.

182
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,708
I was just living for Master.

183
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,333
It was all for him.

184
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,916
Even if it went
against Inferno,

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I followed Master's orders.

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,041
But now, I have no purpose.

187
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,666
I have no reason to live.

188
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,875
Inferno is chasing me,
but I just run.

189
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,708
I'm not even strong enough
to pull the trigger.

190
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,875
It's like,
if I'd died yesterday,

191
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
at least
I would have died as Ein,

192
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,166
not as nobody at all.

193
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,791
Stop it.

194
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,125
Please don't say that.

195
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,166
Did we live this long
just to give up now?

196
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,750
Listen, we did what we did
in order to live.

197
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,083
I don't want you to give up,
after we've made it this far.

198
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,208
I want you to live.

199
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,583
It's really just that simple.

200
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,916
I know Inferno is after me.

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,875
When they finally
catch up to us...

202
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,708
will you take a stand
against them,

203
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,416
or will you
point your gun at me?

204
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,833
No way.

205
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,458
I'm on your side.

206
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,833
And I'll kill
whoever they send here

207
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,375
of my own free will.

208
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,750
I don't understand.

209
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,208
I don't have the same
kind of will to survive

210
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,291
that you do, Reiji.

211
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,125
I can't live like that.

212
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,208
I guess I just
don't have it in me.

213
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,000
You just gotta keep living.

214
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,500
I don't.

215
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,958
I have nothing to offer.

216
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,291
I'm nobody.

217
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,666
I have no reason to live,
no function.

218
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,708
Ein, I...

219
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,416
No, not Ein anymore.

220
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,416
Ein is just a goddamn number.

221
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,875
It's not a name.

222
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,375
We need to give you
a real name.

223
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,625
Real name?

224
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,750
Not some number, not Phantom.

225
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,041
<i>Your</i> name...

226
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
A new name for your life
ahead of you.

227
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,291
Eren.

228
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,666
It's Eren.

229
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,458
That's your name.
You're Eren from now on.

230
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,000
But why, why is it Eren?

231
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,375
It doesn't matter,
it's just what it is now.

232
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,916
It's a name that you'll start
your new life with.

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,291
A life where you're
not a killer or a puppet.

234
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,333
Eren...

235
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,625
Eren.

236
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,708
It feels so strange.

237
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,625
That'll change.

238
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,833
Eren, come on.

239
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,791
Let's find your past together.

240
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,250
Eren.

241
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,625
Take that name as your own,

242
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,666
and find your reason
to live again.

243
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,125
You're strong.

244
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,541
You'll do whatever you can
to keep going <i>.</i>

245
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
It may still be tough
right now,

246
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,541
but
I know we can do it, together.

247
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,541
This little boy toy of yours,

248
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,708
what'cha gonna do
if he hooks back up

249
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,125
with that creep
in the white coat?

250
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,166
Spank him?

251
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,208
Kill him.

252
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,541
I'm gonna go get us
some money and a different car.

253
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,791
I should be back in an hour.

254
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,000
You okay?

255
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,666
I'll be fine
as long as I don't push myself.

256
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,541
Stay safe, Eren.

257
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,125
I will, Reiji.

258
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:30,083
Eren, the new name
that Reiji gave me.

259
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,833
And with this name,
I'll start over.

260
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,750
You
don't seem yourself today, Ein.

261
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,583
Come on, overcome the pain
with your inner strength.

262
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,791
You came for me.

263
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,125
This is it, lover boy.

264
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,875
Your little teenage honeymoon
is over now.

265
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,916
Lizzie...

266
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,416
So you were taken in
by Scythe's toy.

267
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,958
This has nothing to do with him.

268
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,375
Bullshit!

269
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,375
We'll talk about all that
at a later time.

270
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,583
I just got
some interesting news.

271
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,125
The gentleman I had
trailing Phantom

272
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,083
was just found murdered.

273
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,583
And your little girlfriend
went back to her daddy.

274
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,041
No. You're lying.

275
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,208
Eren.

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,083
Just make it easy
on yourself, kid.

277
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,916
Tell me where they went!

278
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,041
I don't know.

279
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,083
We were just...

280
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,333
Alright,

281
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,875
I guess he's just as ignorant
as we thought he was.

282
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,208
You can go ahead
and leave now.

283
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,625
I'll handle it from here.

284
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,250
You're definitely
a stubborn son of a bitch,

285
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,166
I'll give you that.

286
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,416
There's no one
listening to us.

287
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,291
You can tell me
whatever you want to now.

288
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,125
Taking Ein and trying
to run away together,

289
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,333
was that entirely
your own decision?

290
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
You're such an idiot.

291
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't you realize
you were helping a traitor?

292
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,208
That doesn't
look good for you.

293
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,500
Not getting back to Japan

294
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,583
should be the very least
of your worries.

295
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,958
But still...

296
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,958
there is one way you could
get out of this predicament

297
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,583
if you really wanted to.

298
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:18,416
You could prove your innocence,
and maybe get Ein back.

299
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,875
How?

300
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,916
Tell me.

301
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,958
[Music]

302
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,541
You still remember
how to use this, don't you?

303
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,708
Of course I do,
and I will kill him with it.

304
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,458
[Music]

305
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,125
Eren, I promise someday...

306
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,708
Someday I'll make you smile...

307
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,083
A real smile.
