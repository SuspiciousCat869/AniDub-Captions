[Music]

2
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,541
I can't believe you bastards.

3
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,625
What the heck just happened?

4
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,125
The one we got...
wasn't alone.

5
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,833
What?

6
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,375
Where was that?

7
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,166
Where did it come from?

8
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,458
No way!

9
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,041
Mission accomplished.

10
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,291
Good job!

11
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,500
Leave your position
via route C,

12
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,583
wait for your next order.

13
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,125
Yes, Master.

14
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,250
A sniper's stray bullet.

15
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,041
Hitting no one, but creating
a landscape of suspicion.

16
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,375
I wonder how our little heroine
will choose to navigate.

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,666
So all your hospitality
was a plot to set me up.

18
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,666
Well, I'm still here!

19
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,500
You could at least
have the goddamn balls

20
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,125
to confess to my face.

21
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,791
Out with it!

22
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,416
What are you talking about!

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,208
I figured the shooter
was one of your guys!

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,833
Really?

25
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,375
Well then,

26
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,916
you're all dead.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,583
Mr. Godo,
don't do anything yet.

28
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,750
Why?

29
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,458
Wait! What just happened?

30
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,458
Ray,

31
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,250
it was for you.

32
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,708
Ray, I got your back.

33
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,916
A second sniper, but who?

34
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,541
Reiji...

35
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,875
Reiji, what's wrong with you?

36
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,333
Are you okay?

37
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,541
Yeah.

38
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,583
We should get outta here.

39
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,166
Good.

40
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,875
Excellent work.

41
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,708
The subordinate
I had positioned outside

42
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,500
has eliminated the threat.

43
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,583
I guarantee there will be
no more shooting today.

44
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,500
What kind of game
are you playing, lady? Huh?

45
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,041
Mr. Godo,
I'd like to present to you

46
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,541
the late Isaac Wisemel,
the ringleader of the plot

47
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,750
that's been set
on putting your life

48
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,333
in the crosshairs repeatedly.

49
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,833
What the hell?

50
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,041
I took care of the traitor

51
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,458
who's mislead us
with his own devious plans,

52
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,833
and I did it
of my own volition.

53
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,708
That dead guy's a traitor?

54
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,791
I hope you have
an explanation ready.

55
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,291
You killed one of our own,
tell me why.

56
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,875
The simplest explanation

57
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,208
is that Wisemel was responsible
for what happened here.

58
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,541
Just check the body
of the sniper

59
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,791
that my subordinate took out.

60
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,791
I'd think that would be enough
hard evidence for you.

61
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,958
You're always ready for
anything, aren't you, Claudia?

62
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,083
Inferno simply knows
how to act decisively.

63
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,875
The bullet that hit the statue
was fired after I killed Randy.

64
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm almost positive
Isaac had nothing to do with it.

65
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,208
It was someone else,
but I don't know who.

66
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,458
Maybe he had another
one of his boys

67
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,083
on another roof somewhere.

68
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,250
Like some kind of back-up plan
if shit went wrong.

69
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Then why did the second guy
stop after one shot?

70
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,541
They wanted him dead, right?

71
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,833
That was the whole point.

72
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
No sniper would hit
that close to his target,

73
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,708
then cut and run.

74
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,708
So now you're trying to tell me

75
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,208
there's some kinda
big conspiracy

76
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,416
going on behind the scenes?

77
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,916
Maybe killing Godo
wasn't the point.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,333
I don't know, maybe...

79
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,750
Maybe the point was something
way more subtle.

80
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,666
By just firing that shot
into the room,

81
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,583
the sniper put
everyone on edge.

82
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,166
They became suspicious
of each other.

83
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,166
If he really
knew the situation,

84
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,375
maybe he even figured on
Claudia killing Wisemel.

85
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,583
Alright, that's enough.

86
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,541
I've got no reason to think
that this was anyone's idea

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,625
but Isaac's from the get-go.

88
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,750
Clo knew
that he was behind it

89
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,583
and decided
to take care of business.

90
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,583
You need to stop
filling your head

91
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,958
with this crazy shit.

92
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,208
Don't forget
we're pawns in the game.

93
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,541
You're looking way too deep
for answers

94
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,708
that are on the surface.

95
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,208
Lizzie's right.

96
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,333
We don't need to know
why any of this happened.

97
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,041
It won't help us.

98
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,541
If Isaac's gonna take the rap
for the whole deal,

99
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,833
we should tie up
all the loose ends we can.

100
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,166
Including the five million.

101
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,833
Now, the Godo Family's
stolen money

102
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,833
will be found
in Isaac's vacation home.

103
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,291
And just like that,

104
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,333
this whole thing
will be settled.

105
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,000
Who killed the Yakuza guys,

106
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,583
Judy's revenge, and...

107
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,791
This stupid idea
I can't get outta my head.

108
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,625
No!

109
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,416
It's over.

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,333
There's no chance in hell.

111
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,291
She's dead.

112
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,458
Hey! When I went out
to pick up groceries,

113
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,250
I heard someone saying
Isaac from the Bloodies died.

114
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,875
It's true.

115
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,750
Well, wasn't the guy
you killed up on the roof

116
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,541
one of Isaac's henchmen?

117
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,083
That probably means
he was the one who killed Judy.

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,625
So then, it's over, huh?

120
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,666
We got revenge.

121
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,583
That's it.

122
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,625
Well, how was my assassin
training?

123
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,083
Was I on my way
to getting any good?

124
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,166
If you wanted me to,

125
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,666
I suppose I could stick around
and help you on your missions.

126
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,500
You need to forget
about being a killer.

127
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,916
Why?

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,791
Just forget about it, okay.

129
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,791
Okay.

130
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,958
I guess you don't
need me anymore.

131
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,625
Do you?

132
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,791
Now, I didn't say that.

133
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,500
I'd probably starve
if you weren't around to cook.

134
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,500
You can cook
and clean and stuff.

135
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,750
That's great!

136
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,041
Oh, I'll totally be your maid!

137
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,333
I always loved that outfit!

138
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,541
And I can wear it
around the house

139
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,625
while I'm doing
my cleaning and stuff.

140
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,500
You can wear
normal clothes.

141
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,541
What!

142
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
No uniform?

143
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,791
No.

144
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,833
That's fine by me,

145
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,166
as long as you let me
stay with you.

146
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,833
Excellent report.

147
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,250
You've quite thoroughly proven

148
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,375
that this whole series
of incidents was Isaac's scheme.

149
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,625
With this information,

150
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,208
the Godo Family
won't have much of a choice

151
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,750
but to accept the facts.

152
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,833
To think that you pieced
this jigsaw together

153
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,125
in the midst of
such utter chaos.

154
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,041
You're quite brilliant.

155
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,791
With Isaac
now having departed us,

156
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,250
I'm going to have you
take his place.

157
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,083
Well!

158
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,291
You haven't done
so thus far, Claudia,

159
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,750
but don't disappoint me.

160
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,958
I promise I won't.

161
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,750
Do tell.

162
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,916
Well, sir, she seems to possess
some rare qualities,

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,166
they may even be called
talents.

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,041
Is that so?

165
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,875
I seem to recall hearing
similar things in the past.

166
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,000
I see.

167
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,208
You'd like to
take this girl in

168
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,916
and train her
in the ways of an assassin?

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Yes.

170
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,916
I will allow it for now.

171
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,916
Don't fail me.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,625
Sir.

173
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,666
Phantom,
I eagerly await your report.

174
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
I can't put her
in any more danger.

175
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,958
I'll just have to
make up some excuses

176
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,125
why I'm not pulling her in.

177
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,666
I don't know how,

178
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,666
but there's gotta be some way
I can make this last.

179
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,208
So I'm supposed to
let this simmer for...

180
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,291
Hey! I'm leaving.

181
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,833
I might not be back
until the day after tomorrow.

182
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,333
What?

183
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,625
I probably should have
told you earlier.

184
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,458
No, no worries.

185
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
See you when you get back.

186
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,916
Just be careful.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,833
Yeah, you too.

188
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,875
[Music]

189
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,916
This administrative crap

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,250
has become second nature
to you, hasn't it?

191
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,166
It's driving me crazy.

192
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,791
Why don't you just stop
where you are right now

193
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,375
and call it done?

194
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,958
You're a senior member, Clo.

195
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,041
You can stop
pushing yourself so much.

196
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,583
But I'm not done yet.

197
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,916
I'm finally getting started.

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,916
Get real, girl.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,583
How much more of this
you need?

200
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,750
Let that greed take over,
and it'll ruin you.

201
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,750
'Course,

202
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,958
I say that knowing
there's no way you'd stop,

203
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,750
no matter what spills
outta my mouth.

204
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,833
For real, just make sure
that you watch where you step.

205
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,708
I don't look like
that blind of an idiot, do I?

206
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,916
I'm just giving you
some advice, Clo.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,333
I know you're too hardheaded
to listen.

208
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,416
Hey, I wasn't sure,

209
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,958
but is this
the fermented tofu stuff

210
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,000
you wanted me to pick up?

211
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,875
Cal?

212
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,375
Hey! You're back!

213
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,208
That didn't take too long.

214
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,416
There you are.
Where'd you run off to?

215
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,833
Wow!

216
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,791
You actually remembered
to buy this stuff!

217
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,500
Chicken is really, really good
when you marinate it in this.

218
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,875
How much longer
can we keep this up?

219
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,750
This little happy family game
we're playing.

220
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,083
Reiji!

221
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,416
What's up?

222
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,666
I, uh...

223
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,916
I want you to know

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,458
that I still want to be
your assistant.

225
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,458
Come on!
That's over.

226
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,541
Yeah, I know, but I've been
thinking about it a lot

227
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,833
and there's a bunch of stuff
I wanted to say.

228
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,041
Maybe if I told you
more about myself,

229
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,375
you'd understand why.

230
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,000
I've always tried so hard
not be a burden to anybody.

231
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,208
I have, I try to help.

232
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,166
Since I've always been
so small and weak, it's tough.

233
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,333
I just don't wanna
live like that

234
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,000
for the rest of my life.

235
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,500
Listen.

236
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,958
You're one of the smartest,
most capable people I know.

237
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
You could do
anything you want.

238
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,125
So why in the hell do you wanna
just throw it all away?

239
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,166
You don't like what you do?

240
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,791
No.

241
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,416
So, you don't like yourself,
do you?

242
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,208
No, I don't.

243
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,458
Do you think
I wanted to spend my life

244
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,208
as a goddamn killer?

245
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,916
I hate myself.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,291
I'm worthless.

247
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
No, you're not.

248
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,583
I'm too young
to be this broken.

249
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,416
And if you follow me,
you're gonna be fucked up too.

250
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,333
I'm sorry, Reiji.

251
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,750
Sorry!

252
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,125
Cal, I was being a jerk.

253
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,125
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,083
I don't want
this life for you.

255
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,250
So many people have died
because of what I am now.

256
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,666
If it wasn't for me,
they'd still be alive.

257
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,958
They could've gone back home

258
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,250
to the people
who meant something to them.

259
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,333
It was never your fault.

260
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,916
It's your job, Reiji.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,125
And if you didn't do it,
someone else would.

262
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,958
That's just an excuse.

263
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,291
Oh, fine.

264
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,416
Then tell me, did you
want to kill those people?

265
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,666
Did you shoot them because
you thought it'd be a good time?

266
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,666
You like it?
Is it fun for you?

267
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,750
It's not, is it?

268
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,791
I can tell
that it's hard on you,

269
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,000
it makes you sad.

270
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,666
You can't forgive yourself
for what you've done.

271
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,875
So you're trying
to kill yourself inside.

272
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,416
You're not the kind of idiot
who just fires away

273
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,916
into the air like the ones
who killed Judy.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,791
You live and breathe the pain
of what you've done

275
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,708
every second of the day.

276
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,666
So you don't make mistakes.

277
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,583
You don't kill for nothing.

278
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,250
If it were you in the alley
that night,

279
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,166
Judy wouldn't have died.

280
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,583
I know that's true, Reiji.

281
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,291
You gotta understand,

282
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,500
once you kill somebody,
the whole damn world changes.

283
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,208
Right then.

284
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,875
It's hard to describe, but...

285
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,250
it's like
everything else dies too...

286
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,541
the world starts to turn gray.

287
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,125
You still have a kind heart.

288
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,958
And you can accept people
for who they are,

289
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,083
it doesn't matter to you.

290
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,333
I just don't want you
to lose that.

291
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,875
This place I'm in now,
I can't bring you into it.

292
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,875
I care too much about you.

293
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,791
What am I supposed to do?

294
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:22,208
That world is where you're
always gonna be, isn't it?

295
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:26,500
I have to go there if I want to
be with you forever, right?

296
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333
You can't.

297
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want to ever
be apart from you.

298
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,666
I want to always be
by your side.

299
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,541
Forever.

300
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,250
I want to be...

301
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,291
with you.

302
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,916
I think I get it now, finally.

303
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,791
I wanna be
who I was before this.

304
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,875
I thought somehow
I could be that person again

305
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,458
if I was with you.

306
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,916
Like you're the key.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,666
I can be that for you.

308
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,666
I know I can.

309
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,875
I can learn to live
in your world.

310
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,208
No, let me do it.

311
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,458
I need to go back.

312
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,125
I need to get back
into the world you live in

313
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,083
and out of mine.

314
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,833
Before I met you,
it's like I was a dead man,

315
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,666
walking in the skin
of the living.

316
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,125
If I ever lost you,

317
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,208
I would go right back
to being a ghost.

318
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,708
You taught me so much.

319
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,458
You made me remember
what it was like to be alive.

320
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,625
Can't be.

321
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,875
This is him!

322
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,208
So you know the man
in the picture.

323
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,250
Absolutely!

324
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,041
That woman's bodyguard!

325
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,375
You're not the only one
who's surprised.

326
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,000
I was under the impression
that Ms. McCunnen

327
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,625
was moving heaven and earth

328
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,041
to get your group
to join Inferno.

329
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,958
I wonder at what point
she decided to alter her plan.

330
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,458
We'll certainly find out!

331
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,458
Somebody get Mr. Godo
on the phone.

332
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,916
Immediately!

333
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,458
Yes, sir.

334
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,458
Your time in the spotlight

335
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,000
will soon be over,
dear Ms. McCunnen.

336
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,208
I'll be sure to send
an appropriate bouquet

337
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,458
for your finale.

338
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,708
Yeah, what?

339
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,958
Phantom.

340
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,666
Listen, I need you
to take a job right now.

341
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,833
Sure, Lizzie,
what's the deal?

342
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,708
We got some leftovers
of the Bloodies

343
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,791
who're starting to act
a little bit restless.

344
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,583
I just wanna take care of them
without a lotta fuss.

345
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,250
Think you can help me out?

346
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,125
Yeah, sure.
Where do you need me?

347
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,958
Meet me
at the old switchyard.

348
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,333
Eight o'clock.

349
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,875
See ya then.

350
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,458
A job?

351
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,791
Yeah.

352
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,833
I was hoping to make dinner

353
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,208
and hang out tonight
but whatever.

354
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,708
What're you talking about?

355
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,541
We're gonna be together
from now on.

356
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,333
That's the deal.

357
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,708
We have a lot of time, Cal.

358
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,875
I'm gonna get
my old self back...

359
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,666
for Cal...

360
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,833
and, for Eren.

361
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,666
[Music]

362
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,833
I'm not Eren.

363
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,416
That's not my name.

364
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,625
My name is Ein.

365
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,666
Like always.
