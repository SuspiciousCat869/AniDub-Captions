[Music]

2
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,750
I kill.

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,083
In order to live,

4
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,750
I kill.

5
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,250
You okay?

6
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,291
Let's go.

7
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,708
It's begun, Mr. Shiga.

8
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,625
It's playing out
exactly as I've dreamed.

9
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,750
I wouldn't start gloating
just yet.

10
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,708
This scenario you've created
seems very open-ended.

11
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,333
It could prove to be
disastrous.

12
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,833
Not in your favor.

13
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,208
No matter.

14
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,166
I always intended for chance
to play a major role.

15
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,583
Now!

16
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,875
It's time to sing and dance.

17
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,750
My dear players,
let us take our places...

18
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,625
our fated roles
in this bacchanal of blood

19
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,000
and madness and death!

20
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,250
So who are they?

21
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,541
More victims of
Scythe Master's experiments,

22
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,458
poor mindless killers.

23
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,208
Just like we were.

24
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,958
There's at least
two more of them,

25
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,333
I'm sure of it.

26
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,041
Bad odds for us.

27
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,333
That may not be the case.

28
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
I have a feeling

29
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,958
that Inferno isn't intending
to send any more after them.

30
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Why not?

31
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,166
In his mind,
Scythe would see it

32
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,291
as having too many players
on stage.

33
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,333
So this is his big finale?

34
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,708
It is...

35
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,750
and our last battle as well.

36
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,916
It seems our veterans are
putting on quite the show, eh?

37
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,458
Neun and Funf
have taken their bows.

38
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,916
This is a beautiful scenario.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,958
Yes.

40
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,083
A fitting twist
for my grand finale.

41
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,791
Keep moving.

42
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,875
I'll distract them.

43
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,875
While I'm doing that,
you go and track down Scythe.

44
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,083
If he's the one
giving the orders,

45
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,458
we have to take him out.

46
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,708
You were with him
for a long time,

47
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,375
you know how he thinks.

48
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,541
Be careful.

49
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,083
Yeah, you too.

50
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,916
Two on one.

51
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:08,833
Well, well.

52
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,291
You're here.

53
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,333
Welcome.

54
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,625
Finally!
You've come to take the stage.

55
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,250
No, Scythe, I didn't come
to perform in your play.

56
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,458
If there are only two here,
the rest...

57
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,625
are with Eren.

58
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,875
What now?

59
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,000
I know you don't plan
on surrendering.

60
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,333
You're right.

61
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:21,333
I plan on killing you
with my own hands, Master.

62
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,250
Kill me?
Is that so?

63
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,500
How fascinating.

64
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,208
That is not a part
of the narrative, my dear,

65
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,541
so I'm sorry to say,
the odds are not in your favor.

66
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,666
What's also not in your story,

67
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,041
is the kind of ending scene

68
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,833
where I am just simply
shot to death.

69
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,250
Surely you came up
with something

70
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,708
better than that, right?

71
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,083
I must say I'm pleased
by your appreciation

72
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,166
for a more satisfying
conclusion.

73
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,875
The reason I came here.

74
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,791
My entire motivation
for coming back

75
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,416
to this island nation,

76
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
was to see
my beloved daughter's

77
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083
first and possibly
final performance.

78
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,458
These girls...

79
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,750
these lovely girls...

80
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,000
are Sechs and Sieben.

81
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,041
They are the little sisters
whom you never knew.

82
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,833
Ein.

83
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,875
Girls, meet Ein,

84
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,833
the prototype in whose image
you were created.

85
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,708
You should play with her
for a while,

86
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,583
and once you've exhausted her,

87
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,583
you are free
to cut her to ribbons.

88
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,583
What's wrong?

89
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't seem
your old self, Ein.

90
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,291
They are holding back,

91
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,333
but still seem to have
the advantage over you.

92
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,000
Disappointing.

93
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,791
Their reactions,
their movements, their thoughts.

94
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,166
They are programmed
to behave exactly like me.

95
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,166
So, that means,
since the time you created me...

96
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,041
you're stuck.

97
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,333
You haven't grown.

98
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,083
I'm sorry
to use you like that.

99
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,125
It's all I could do.

100
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,083
Thank you.

101
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,750
Unbelievable!

102
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,500
This is quite unexpected,
indeed.

103
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,666
I had no idea that you still
could wield that kind of power.

104
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,916
I told you.
Didn't I?

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,625
I came here to kill you.

106
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,041
That is simply not possible.

107
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,958
Why?

108
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,333
Because
I'm going to surrender.

109
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,208
But why?

110
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,041
Because it means
that I no longer pose

111
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,791
an imminent threat
to your survival.

112
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,125
Yes, Ein,

113
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,583
you can't kill me
now that I'm unarmed.

114
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,666
Can you?

115
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,583
This illustrates the difference
between you and Zwei.

116
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,000
Whereas he possesses
a strong free will,

117
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,333
you can only act

118
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,291
out of mindless obedience
or self preservation.

119
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,875
Anything else would weigh
too heavy on your heart.

120
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,666
Your acts of cold-blooded murder

121
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,500
reverberating
through your fragile mind,

122
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
the guilt would be too much.

123
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,458
Your complete
lack of willpower

124
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,958
means your mind
is exceptionally weak,

125
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,291
much weaker
than your average person.

126
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,208
You have no original
thoughts,

127
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,041
no ego,

128
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,833
no discernable personality
of your own.

129
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,583
You have nothing.

130
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,083
That's why you need me.

131
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,333
This has been
a very delightful evening.

132
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,500
Eren.

133
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,583
You're a fool,
an old delusional fool.

134
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,083
You think you can see
into someone's mind?

135
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,333
You really believe
that's true?

136
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,541
As clear as day.

137
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,333
I will kill you
of my own will.

138
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Because, I despise you.

139
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,708
Because, I will never forgive
what you've done,

140
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,875
how much you've hurt him.

141
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,500
But what will you
gain from this?

142
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,500
It won't bring you peace...

143
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,583
or your lost memory.

144
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,000
You'll continue
an endless pursuit

145
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,000
of something
you can't catch.

146
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,541
It may not change that fact,

147
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,916
but at least you won't be
in this world anymore,

148
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,958
you'll be dead.

149
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,291
Wonderful!

150
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,791
How wonderful!

151
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,958
My Ein!

152
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,666
Don't call me Ein.

153
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,708
My name is Eren.

154
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,875
I was given that name.

155
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,708
It's who I am.

156
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,750
Eren.

157
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,000
Mischief caused by the Muses.

158
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sure I'll see you
again in hell.

159
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,291
But now...

160
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,458
I'll stay.

161
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,541
I'll stay here with him.

162
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,875
Come on, Eren.
Let's go.

163
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,416
I see.

164
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,958
Scythe Master
and his familiar both.

165
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,875
How would you
like to handle it, sir?

166
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,500
New blood can restore
the ardor of an infirm body,

167
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,625
if only temporarily.

168
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,625
Flowers are certain to wilt.

169
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,416
The unborn will end
their lives as ghosts.

170
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,125
Time and tide
wait for no man,

171
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,166
but still, we press on.

172
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,125
What the heck is everybody
starin' at over here?

173
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,250
I heard it was some kinda
big shootout or something.

174
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,333
Ooh! Freaky.

175
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,875
See you later,

176
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,041
I promise.

177
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,791
Helmut Von Giuseppe,

178
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,833
supposedly
he came from Berlin.

179
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,666
Earned a PHD in both
psychology and neuroscience

180
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,791
at the University there,
and went on to work

181
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,041
in interrogations
and mind control.

182
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,500
He applied this knowledge
in the underworld,

183
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,000
and made a name for himself
as a kind of assassin broker.

184
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,875
It was then he took on
the name - Scythe Master.

185
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,208
Finding out more about him

186
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,208
was the key to discovering
Eren's past,

187
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,708
where she came from.

188
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,166
When Scythe discovered her
five years ago,

189
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,041
that's when
her life as Ein began.

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,041
They met in Asia -
in Hong Kong.

191
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,500
And you're positive,

192
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,250
the man in this picture
was here?

193
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,041
Yes, sir.

194
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,666
It was five years ago.

195
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,500
That man said that he was
interested in becoming

196
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,125
a foster parent
for the girl from Ulan Bator.

197
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,625
Really?

198
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,958
Mongolia?

199
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,250
She was such a beautiful child.

200
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,541
I'd say she's probably
about your age now

201
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
or maybe
just a little younger.

202
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,875
It's kind of strange,
but she looked a lot like

203
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,708
the young lady
you're with today.

204
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,250
Now, we've come
all the way to Ulan Bator,

205
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,208
but we still can't find out
anything about her past.

206
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,458
Stand on the wide plateau
and gaze at the sky...

207
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,000
and surely the answer
will come to you.

208
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,041
You can never forget...

209
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,041
that sky.

210
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,333
We're here.

211
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,333
Yes.

212
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,541
If you're truly
a child of Mongolia,

213
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,583
it would be impossible
to forget that sky.

214
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,375
It's part of your being...

215
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,000
your heart and soul.

216
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,625
Just look up
and you'll know.

217
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,291
We can stop searching,
this is it.

218
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,000
Are you sure?

219
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,541
Yes.

220
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,541
We don't have to go
any farther.

221
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,583
This is the sky
I always dreamed about,

222
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,875
it's part of my memory.

223
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,250
I know this is it.

224
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,416
I lived a life,
leaving nothing behind

225
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,041
but shattered dreams
and broken promises.

226
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,083
There was one promise
I could never break.

227
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,958
I found what I needed.

228
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,416
I have this feeling,

229
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,958
and the name I was given.

230
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,791
I promised...
to make you smile.

231
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,916
I have memories now.

232
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,625
The time I've spent with you.

233
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,208
You'll be truly happy.

234
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,958
I know you will.

235
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,958
[Music]

236
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,708
These things...
these are my own.

237
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,250
I can take them and live.

238
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,208
They're all I need.
