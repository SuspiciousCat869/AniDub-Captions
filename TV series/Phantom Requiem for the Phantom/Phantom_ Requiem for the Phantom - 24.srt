00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,958
[Music]

2
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,583
I'll take care of it.

3
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,833
This thing with Cal,
I'll do it.

4
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,541
Sacrifice yourself?

5
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,875
No way in hell!

6
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,083
I need you to make arrangements

7
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,000
so that you and I
can get outta here.

8
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,916
We're under serious
time constraints,

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,666
so I don't want you
to waste any of it

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,666
on this business with Cal.

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,875
Focus on getting us out.
That's it.

12
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,875
I need you to tell me, Reiji,

13
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,833
are you sure that you can
pull the trigger?

14
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,875
Yeah, I think.

15
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,416
Eren, please.

16
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,000
Give me some time.

17
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,541
That's all that I need.

18
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,541
Okay.

19
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,041
But you need to make
your decision today.

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,041
And If you can't figure it out,
I'll do it myself.

21
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,166
I'll kill her.

22
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,291
And Mio will be safe.

23
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,125
This thing with Cal
is too personal.

24
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,875
I can't just let Eren
take care of it.

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,291
It has to be me.

26
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,375
But how?

27
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,875
Reiji...

28
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,250
Hey...

29
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,875
You'll stay with us, right?

30
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,541
Reiji, what's up?

31
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,083
I didn't see you
standing there.

32
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,375
What do you say to lunch
with two fine ladies?

33
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,500
I mean, since Mio's got you

34
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,500
on such a short leash
these days,

35
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,291
I thought this'd be a good
chance for the three of us

36
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,208
to catch up a bit, you know.

37
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,541
With Mio and Eren
both out today,

38
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:09,166
you might get a little lonely
sitting by yourself.

39
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,833
Eren's gone?

40
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,166
But she came to school
with me this morning.

41
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,166
What happened?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,791
She went home early.

43
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,250
She said she just started
to feel kinda crappy today.

44
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,416
I'm surprised you didn't
notice, big brother.

45
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,750
Wait! At least tell us
how far you've gone with Mio

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,833
before you run off
and leave us here!

47
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,666
Eren!

48
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,333
The number you dialed
is either unavailable

49
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,041
or has left the coverage area.

50
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,708
Please try again later.

51
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,291
There you are!
Are you embarrassed

52
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,958
because you couldn't
have your way with her?

53
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,375
Come on. There's gotta be
something juicy!

54
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,125
Look, I'm not in the mood
for it right now.

55
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
What crawled up your butt
and died?

56
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,625
I'm sure your little baby sister
will be just fine!

57
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,416
Your obsession with her
is bordering on sick!

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, you guys!

59
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,916
Fifth period's about to start
so we gotta go!

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,708
Come on.
Let's get back to class!

61
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,791
Give it back.

62
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,125
You have to follow the rules
like the rest of us.

63
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,875
That means cell phones off!

64
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,375
Now we gotta get you
back to class

65
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,708
before you get any dumber.

66
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,291
Time's running out!

67
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,041
Voicemail services.

68
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,791
You have one new message
and no saved messages.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,416
I'm sorry, Reiji.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,875
I know that what I'm
going to do will upset you.

71
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,083
But in the end,
I honestly think

72
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,041
this will be
what's best for everyone.

73
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,750
You shouldn't fight Cal.

74
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,333
I'm the one who dragged Mio
into this whole mess.

75
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:57,000
I owe it to her to make sure
she comes home safe,

76
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,708
even if it ends up
costing me my life.

77
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,916
But it won't come to that.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,791
I'll find you
after I get Mio.

79
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,125
We have the agreed upon
time and place,

80
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,625
so if I don't show up,
if I'm even one minute late -

81
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,958
just assume I'm dead.

82
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,500
Don't wait for me.

83
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,500
Received today at 2:15 PM.

84
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,416
No!
Eren, please!

85
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,875
You can't do this!

86
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,458
I can't stand to
lose any more people.

87
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,291
I don't want
anyone else getting hurt!

88
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,416
I gotta stop her!

89
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,708
That one there -
that's Ein.

90
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,791
She's our prototype.

91
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,333
Contact Master.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,958
It's actually
kinda surprising.

93
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,250
I figured
you'd scream and claw

94
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,708
and maybe put up
more of a fight.

95
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,500
But why?
I'm a girl like you.

96
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,000
Not an animal.

97
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,791
We're only alike
because he used us.

98
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,208
You're in this situation
right now

99
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,333
because of
that two-faced liar.

100
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,666
I just assumed
knowing all of that,

101
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
you'd be more bitter.

102
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,333
I'm not.

103
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
I don't see it that way.

104
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,583
It's not his fault.

105
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,625
Are you saying I'm wrong?

106
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,833
I just can't believe
you could hate him this much,

107
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,541
that anyone could have
that much hate

108
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,666
built up inside of them.

109
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,666
You weren't alone
in your sadness.

110
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,458
Don't you know that?

111
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,083
He went through it too.

112
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,833
And what the hell
do you know?

113
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,500
Listen, Reiji's
not an evil person.

114
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,250
It's obvious.

115
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,583
If you just try to
talk to him a little.

116
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,875
Did you think
I'd really buy that?

117
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,708
Honestly,
you and Reiji both,

118
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,750
have got to be the most

119
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,666
full of crap people
I've ever met.

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,500
And I'm starting to think
everyone in this country

121
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,291
is just like you.

122
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,125
Tell me...

123
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,666
have you ever been so cold
that you've gone numb?

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,666
You ever been beaten

125
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,208
without being able
to fight back?

126
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,000
How about this?

127
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083
Going three days
with nothing to eat?

128
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,000
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

129
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,291
Do you think there's nothing
in this big bad world

130
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,458
that can ever reach into
your perfect life and hurt you?

131
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,375
That it's right,
that the stars aligned

132
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,750
so that only you
would be treated

133
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,791
like some kind of treasure.

134
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,666
Do you think that everyone
should care about you?

135
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,291
You don't know anything
about the real world.

136
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,083
You've lived your whole
cushy little existence

137
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,125
in this stupid country.

138
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:29,250
You could never understand
the way people like me feel.

139
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,958
Please!
Don't do it!

140
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,000
Over the course
of my entire life,

141
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,083
did you know I've only had
one nice dress?

142
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,875
And even that thing
got burned to ashes.

143
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
Such smooth skin.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,041
What kind of food
did you grow up on

145
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,791
to have skin like that?

146
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,208
Only the best for
the little princess, right?

147
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,500
It's time
I taught you a lesson.

148
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,750
You need to learn
what true despair feels like.

149
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,583
How it feels to be beaten,

150
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,791
to be at the mercy
of someone else

151
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,791
and powerless
to do anything,

152
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,583
to be treated
like an animal.

153
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,833
You'll never forget it

154
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,916
'cause I'm gonna carve
that feeling into you.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,416
And I'm gonna leave you with
a big ugly scar on your heart

156
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,416
that you'll feel with every beat
for the rest of your life.

157
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,416
Reiji...

158
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,833
I've been waiting for you
all this time.

159
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,500
You promised
that you'd be back,

160
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,000
that's what you said.

161
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:48,125
And so I've waited,
I waited right here...

162
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,916
all this time.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,958
Reiji...

164
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,166
Hello, Shiga.

165
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,333
I apologize
for bothering you this late.

166
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,625
It's fine.

167
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,625
But it must be bad news
you're delivering.

168
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,750
It concerns Mio Fujieda.

169
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm ashamed to admit
it's due to my carelessness

170
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,291
that the young lady
was dragged into trouble.

171
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,291
Trouble she cannot
handle on her own.

172
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,375
This matter requires
prompt attention.

173
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,208
We must act now.

174
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,125
I accept
full responsibility in this

175
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,291
and will pay for it,
however is necessary.

176
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,583
But, our number one priority

177
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,041
must be to rescue
Miss Fujieda.

178
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,500
And to help us do that,

179
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,375
I would like to utilize
the services

180
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,375
of the Godo Family's
retainers.

181
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,333
I imagine the central cause
of this problem

182
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,791
is those Americans.

183
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
Do we know about Mio?

184
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,958
Is she even still alive?

185
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,916
Yes. She is.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,583
Well, then there's no need
to get involved.

187
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,333
Do not bring the Godo Family
into this.

188
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,333
I want you to leave everything
to those foreigners.

189
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,000
But, I don't understand.

190
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,916
If the Family
is drawn into this matter,

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,416
the entire country
will be aware of it.

192
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,125
"Why does the Godo Family
care so much about this girl,"

193
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,125
they will ask.

194
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,791
And they will ask.

195
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,875
And they will not stop

196
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
until they get
an answer they like.

197
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,583
Today, you keep your fingers.

198
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,250
No reason for you
to take responsibility.

199
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,708
But, sir!

200
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,416
I said there was
no reason, Shiga!

201
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,541
There is no connection
between the Godos -

202
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,083
and the Fujiedas.

203
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,041
There cannot be!

204
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,250
Not now,
not in the past.

205
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,500
Never.
Do you understand?

206
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,916
You are to do nothing at all
as long as Mio is unharmed.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,958
As long as their purpose
has nothing to do

208
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,416
with money or blackmail,
there's nothing we can do.

209
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,666
I appreciate
your concern in this,

210
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,458
you know I do, Shiga.

211
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,166
But see, we Yakuza
in our limited imaginations

212
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,166
are primarily takers,
not guardians of human life.

213
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,666
We possess other, albeit,
less refined qualities.

214
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,125
Guns and knives
are only good for killing.

215
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,375
That is their sole purpose.

216
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,708
They are useless when it comes
to protecting others.

217
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,166
Thank you, sir.
I understand.

218
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,125
And I will definitely
keep that in mind.

219
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,000
Throughout all this time,

220
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,000
I have portrayed
the role of myself

221
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,291
in the play
that I have created.

222
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,083
The stage lights come up,

223
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,375
bathing the scenery
in a fittingly crimson hue

224
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,250
and revealing the new players
who have taken the stage

225
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,166
in preparation
for the finale.

226
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,916
Players that are sure to bring
a bloody denouement.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,541
Ein was my thesis.

228
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,291
Zwei and Drei were nothing
more than rough drafts.

229
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,041
And it was the result
of that work

230
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,708
that led to
the creation of players

231
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,916
suitable for my finale.

232
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,666
Zahlen Schwestern.

233
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,708
Beautifully devoid
of trepidation

234
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,458
or the weakness
of human compassion.

235
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,541
They are wraiths,

236
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,666
capable of swift
distribution of death

237
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,833
with unflinching souls.

238
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,500
Both the Godo Family
and Inferno

239
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:45,166
are merely the scenery
on this stage.

240
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,666
Once Ein and Zwei
are hunted down by Drei,

241
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,250
they'll bare their fangs
like cornered prey.

242
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,916
Then the climax
can truly begin,

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,291
a beautifully choreographed
tarantella of annihilation.

244
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,166
And I will have you,
Zahlen Schwestern,

245
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,416
be an integral part
of that choreography.

246
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,166
For now -
I'm going to wait.

247
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,958
Until the moment
where at last,

248
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,875
we are summoned
to take our final cues.

249
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,791
Is this Ein?

250
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,166
It is.

251
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,416
Just tell me what you want.

252
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041
I want you to tell me where
we could meet up in private.

253
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,250
I wanna get this crap
settled as soon as possible.

254
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,833
Yeah, you got it.

255
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,708
Just you and me.

256
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,208
Who is she talking to?

257
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,958
Is that Reiji?

258
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,208
That place'll work just fine.

259
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,416
Three a.m.?

260
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,708
I'll be there.

261
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,750
You know that abandoned building
by the Shinokura Academy?

262
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,916
The one that used to be
the girls' dorm?

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,791
That's the one.

264
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,583
Your girl Mio
is inside there.

265
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,958
And you might wanna bring
something for her to wear.

266
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,166
Ah, you're up.

267
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,458
Time to let it go.

268
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,041
Whatever kinda hatred,
or anger,

269
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,833
or whatever the hell
you think about me,

270
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,083
you should just
forget about it.

271
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,625
I've pissed off
enough of the wrong people,

272
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,625
and I'm not even sure

273
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,208
I'm gonna live
through the night.

274
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,625
Actually, the only thing
that I am sure of -

275
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,541
is I'll be in hell
before too long.

276
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,875
So goodbye.

277
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,125
Mio.

278
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,458
Where have you been?

279
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,583
I was worried sick.

280
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,166
I'm sorry to bother you
tonight, ma'am.

281
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm in class with Mio
and since she was out,

282
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,625
I brought this handout for her.

283
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,458
Mio wasn't at school today?

284
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,208
Could you give this to her?

285
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,250
Yeah.

286
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,458
Thanks.

287
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,166
Oh... and tell her,
I hope she feels better.

288
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
Oh! Hold on.

289
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,666
No! It's nothing.
Never mind.

290
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,416
Be safe out there.

291
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,958
Have a good night.

292
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,708
I wonder -
is that him?

293
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,875
Eren!

294
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,333
My name's Ein.

295
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,416
What?

296
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I don't have to
lie to you any longer,

297
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,541
so I want you to call me
by my true name...

298
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,666
Ein.

299
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,666
Lie to me?

300
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,041
Eren, what are you
talking about?

301
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,250
I brought a change of clothes
for you.

302
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,916
How did you find me?

303
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,375
Who told you where I was?

304
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,500
Drei.

305
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,208
Who is that?

306
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,833
Do you mean Cal?

307
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes.

308
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,208
She sometimes goes
by that name as well.

309
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,125
Who are you people?

310
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,916
I assume Drei told you.

311
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,875
Yeah, she did.

312
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:29,250
She told me
that you were killers.

313
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,375
Yes...

314
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,375
we're both killers.

315
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,208
No.

316
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,333
That's impossible.

317
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,791
I'm sorry, but you'll have to
make it home by yourself.

318
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,000
Use this to call the police
if you'd like.

319
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,375
Cal left a while ago.

320
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,875
She was talking about
putting an end to all this.

321
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,583
I... think
she's gonna kill him.

322
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,875
I know.

323
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,875
You... do?

324
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,208
Then... it was you
on the phone.

325
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,750
Are you gonna fight her?

326
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,500
But wait...

327
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,708
isn't there something I can do
to stop this from happening?

328
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,458
Please, Ein!
I love Reiji!

329
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,125
I would do anything for him.
Whatever he needed.

330
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,208
Why can't that
just be enough?

331
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,125
Why won't you let me
be with him?

332
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,833
I don't doubt that the feelings
you have for him are real.

333
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,875
But you have to understand,

334
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,958
it will take more than that
to stop Drei.

335
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:38,333
Unless I kill her,
she will kill Reiji.

336
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,791
It's my job to stop
that from happening.

337
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,250
Not yours.

338
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,708
If you want to help Reiji,

339
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,541
stay here
for a little while longer.

340
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,958
If you can do that,

341
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,041
he has a better chance
of surviving through the night.

342
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,291
Please, there's something
I have to know.

343
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,000
Did Reiji want me
involved in this?

344
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,333
No. Not at all.

345
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,541
I'm the one
who pulled you in.

346
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,833
Reiji isn't the kind of person
who can fake his feelings.

347
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,541
He can't laugh or cry
as an act.

348
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,166
So, if you've ever seen a smile
or a tear on his face before,

349
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,916
I can promise you,
it was the real thing.

350
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,500
From the moment
you gave me the name Eren,

351
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,166
I've dedicated myself
to protecting you.

352
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,500
I need you
to stay alive, Reiji.

353
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,666
For my sake.

354
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,291
You can go on living,

355
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,916
and that'll be the proof...

356
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,333
that I lived.

357
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,750
We are ghosts,
that have no place to haunt.

358
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,916
Non-existent phantoms.

359
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,958
[Music]

360
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,041
Please, tell me...

361
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,916
If I can never have
happiness in real life,

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,291
can't I at least get to
dream about it sometimes?
