1
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,291
Hey, what're you doing?

2
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,333
What's it look like?

3
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:52,666
Cooking.

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,583
Hope you're hungry!

5
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,916
What in the heck
is in there?

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,458
Those.

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,166
Come on,
don't be scared of it.

8
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,458
I cooked pretty
much all the meals

9
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,500
when I lived with Judy.

10
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,125
Man, that's good!

11
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,875
Yeah! Innit it?

12
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,958
Yeah, so I grabbed one of
the nice expensive pots

13
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,208
off the shelf.

14
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,291
And then I just
whipped out a $50 bill.

15
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,291
You should've seen the old guy
at the counter's face

16
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,416
when I flashed
that cash at him.

17
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,166
Oh, oh, and then,
I was like--

18
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,500
I see.

19
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,833
You'd like to
take this girl in

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,000
and train her
in the ways of an assassin?

21
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, Cal.

22
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,791
Yeah?

23
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,083
You don't...

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,208
happen to know
how to use a gun, do you?

25
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,958
Oh, yeah.

26
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,625
"You feel lucky, punk?
Well, do ya?"

27
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,625
Well, that's how
Clint Eastwood does it.

28
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,375
Ummmmm...
Then there's...

29
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,583
Look, I'm serious here.

30
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,083
Listen,

31
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm trying to make a plan
to avenge Judy's death.

32
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,791
But I'll be straight with you,
five mill's not enough.

33
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,416
Okay.

34
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,875
But...

35
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,208
the difference
isn't really all that much,

36
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm sure
you can earn the rest.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
What do you mean by that?

38
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,166
It's easy,
you'll be my assistant.

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,083
You don't have
to say yes, but--

40
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,041
That's so cool!

41
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,875
So, I'm gonna be
the Phantom's assistant!

42
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,708
Yeah.

43
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,583
It's cool,
I can handle it.

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey, so if I'm really
gonna be your assistant,

45
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,333
that means I can be there
when you do it,

46
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,416
when you get the guys
that murdered Judy, right?

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,041
Well, first off,

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,291
we're gonna have to
pick up something.

49
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,708
Like what?

50
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,958
You gonna get me a gun?

51
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,791
Some new clothes.

52
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,250
Yeah,
we'll go shopping tomorrow.

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,041
Okay, sure.

54
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,500
You goin' out?

55
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,291
Gotta job to do.

56
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,041
Well, what should I do?

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,750
You stay here
and guard the hideout, okay?

58
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,041
What? That's boring.

59
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, work is
supposed to be boring.

60
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,000
That's why it's called work.

61
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,875
Just hang out here, will ya?

62
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

63
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,833
Five million dollars

64
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,291
and four of our men's lives
were taken.

65
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,500
What's more,

66
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,916
this all took place
on your turf.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,708
But you refuse to offer
compensation or an apology?

68
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,000
I am sorry for those who died.

69
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,333
But we can't be held
responsible

70
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,250
for events that transpired
before our arrival.

71
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,166
You bitch!

72
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,083
Cool it.

73
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,625
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,458
Look, our business took a hit

75
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,916
with this
unforeseen event as well.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,458
We are doing
everything in our power

77
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,500
to find out
exactly what happened.

78
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,958
Yeah?

79
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,458
Then maybe you'll be able
to get us back our money.

80
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,833
In the meantime,

81
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,625
I would like you
to remain stateside

82
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,083
until the matter
is completely resolved.

83
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,583
Of course, I'll see to it
your stay is comfortable.

84
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,333
Well, I'm not sure that--

85
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,916
We had our money stolen.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,666
And we lost
some of our best guys.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
I personally
don't wanna go home

88
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,708
completely empty-handed
with our tails between our legs.

89
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,333
Come on.

90
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,625
Let's stay
a little while longer.

91
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,625
How will we explain it
to the old man?

92
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,583
Tell him the food here
gave me the runs.

93
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,541
Isaac's behind all this,
I know it.

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,416
You sure about that?

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,583
There's no way our conversation
at Headquarters

96
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,083
was leaked outside the room.

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,458
It had to be an inside job.

98
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,875
But, what went down didn't
exactly work out for him either.

99
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,375
That's true.

100
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,291
At least it would appear
that losing five million dollars

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,375
and an untold amount
of street cred,

102
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,458
would be a bad thing.

103
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,625
But maybe it's not.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,000
I suspect that he sees it

105
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,958
as the cost
of preventing the Godo Family

106
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,625
from becoming
a part of Inferno.

107
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,000
He's obviously afraid of me

108
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,625
getting such a strong backing
in the organization.

109
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,833
It just seems too aggressive.

110
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,541
You think he got
to the top of Inferno

111
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,125
with just tough talk?

112
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,250
He's the kind of guy
that'll do whatever he can

113
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,291
to get what he wants.

114
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,583
I'm almost positive
that he'll try to take out

115
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,125
the Godo's again.

116
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,875
Then why don't you just
let them all go back to Japan?

117
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,250
That would mean letting go
of our most tempting bait.

118
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,666
What?

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
We're shark fishing.

120
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,708
Using Godo as the bait.

121
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,833
And you as the hook.

122
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,875
Yes.

123
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,041
It seems we're staying here
a bit longer.

124
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,916
I would appreciate it
if you remained in town as well.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,750
Yes, of course.

126
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,208
And as for our
contingency plan--

127
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,000
Give it a goddamn rest
already, Shiga.

128
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,791
You're gonna spoil the booze.

129
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,083
Well, we'll talk later.

130
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,208
I hope the rest of your stay
is pleasant.

131
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,291
I've got some good news.

132
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,125
I was finally able
to track down a coordinator

133
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,083
with no ties to Inferno.

134
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,750
Was that that Giuseppe guy?

135
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,916
If he's as knowledgeable
about the underworld scene here

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,416
as he says he is,

137
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,458
maybe you can stop worrying
and enjoy yourself for once.

138
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,083
Yes,
you could be right about that.

139
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,333
Have a drink and forget
about it for a while,

140
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,916
It's on Inferno.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,791
We got some 30-year-old Scotch
right here.

142
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,916
Well, can't let this
go to waste now.

143
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,458
Bait, huh?

144
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,791
Hey! Reiji.

145
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,416
The hideout's totally secure!

146
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,458
Don't be so loud about it, okay?

147
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,208
Ohmigod, I'm sorry!

148
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,791
Damn, you weren't kidding

149
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,458
when you said we'd have
a comfortable stay.

150
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,291
I never kid.

151
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,708
You know, Claudia,

152
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,000
I meant it when I said
I wouldn't go back empty-handed.

153
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,208
Your subordinate
isn't too happy

154
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,291
with this turn of events.

155
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,083
Who? Shiga?

156
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,333
Not to worry.

157
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,833
He's my advisor,
so it's part of his job.

158
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,750
I never trust a yes man.

159
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,333
Right.

160
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,625
If I were you,

161
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,750
I'd definitely be
watching my step right now.

162
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,416
You're on the edge,
aren't you?

163
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,083
You can tell?

164
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,833
It's like they say
back in Japan,

165
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,375
the stake that sticks out
gets hammered down.

166
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:50,125
But, once this thing's
sorted out,

167
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,250
the strength of the Godo's
will carry you.

168
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,541
Wonderful.

169
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,875
[Music]

170
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,166
Found anything?

171
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,625
Uh, hold on.

172
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,541
Ya know, it's been two hours.

173
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,625
Yeah, but,
I'm kinda stuck.

174
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,333
Nothing you want?
Come on.

175
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,333
There's lot's of stuff!

176
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,750
Well?

177
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,791
There's just
too many of them.

178
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,291
This is all way harder
than I thought it'd be.

179
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,250
I don't even know if I could
narrow it down to one.

180
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,875
Just find the one
you want the most,

181
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,750
and we'll get you that one.

182
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,166
But it's hard.

183
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,083
I can't decide on which one
I like the most,

184
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,375
it's like I like them
all the same or something.

185
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,958
And if I do pick one,

186
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,041
that means I have to give up
on something else I like.

187
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
Don't worry.

188
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,458
It's not like this store
is gonna go anywhere.

189
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,625
If you really want something,

190
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,208
we can come back
and get it.

191
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,166
Really?

192
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,416
Yep.

193
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,625
So all you gotta do today,

194
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,583
is pick out the one
you wanna wear today.

195
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,625
Cool! Well...

196
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,083
But we're not gonna
come here everyday

197
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,500
to buy you new clothes, okay?

198
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,958
Yeah, I know!

199
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,791
I hope so.

200
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,583
Hey, hey,
do I look cute in this?

201
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,916
Yeah.
You look really cute.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,333
I've never had clothes
this nice before.

203
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,041
Thank you!

204
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,625
Hey!

205
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,958
Come on, slowpoke!

206
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,708
Go on home,
I'll be right there.

207
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,375
SIG-Sauer, huh?

208
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,875
Seein' how you like
that Beretta so much,

209
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,083
I grabbed this one.

210
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,541
Nine millimeter, 15-shot.

211
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,791
But, since you said

212
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,416
she'd never used
a gun before,

213
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,625
I thought
I'd get something smaller.

214
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,666
It looks good to me.

215
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,416
Let's try it out.

216
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,291
Thank you.

217
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,291
So?

218
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,000
"So" what?

219
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
So what else is going on?

220
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,625
You didn't come
all the way here

221
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,083
to give me a gun
I didn't ask for.

222
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,583
Well, it's about
your little friend, Cal.

223
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,291
Her name came up
in the meeting today.

224
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,125
Isaac bring her up?

225
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,583
Worse than that.

226
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,416
It was McGuire.

227
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,333
He wants to know if
there's been any progress

228
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,458
in Cal's training.

229
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,416
So I just thought
it might be a good idea

230
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,291
if you at least taught her
how to use a gun.

231
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,375
That took a while.

232
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,625
What's up?

233
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,875
You already decided
to change?

234
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,708
Those are my special clothes.

235
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,833
I can just wear these
if I'm hanging out at home.

236
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,000
I guess you're right.

237
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,583
But you should
grab your jacket.

238
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,208
Huh?

239
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,625
You're gonna learn
how to use a gun today.

240
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,166
Really?

241
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,000
So, this is where
you practice?

242
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,208
It's been a long time
since I've been here.

243
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,166
It seems lonely.

244
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,958
Let's get started.

245
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,000
Hold the gun firmly.

246
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,125
Focus your strength
on your hands.

247
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,541
Stretch your right arm out
and pull with your left.

248
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,083
Good. Very good.

249
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,750
Now make sure
that you can see your target

250
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,250
right in the middle
of that notch in the back.

251
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,833
You see it?

252
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,541
My hands are shaking.

253
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,708
Don't focus your strength
on your arms,

254
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,416
focus on the fingers
holding the gun.

255
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,500
Now keep holding it like that,

256
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,333
and slowly pull the trigger.

257
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,625
Just slow down.

258
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,750
Try not to pull it.

259
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,583
Give it a steady squeeze.

260
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,625
'Kay.

261
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,916
Whoa! I hit it!
I really hit it!

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,916
Hey! You see that?

263
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,791
Aw, yeah!

264
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,958
You gotta change out the clip.

265
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,375
She seems pretty comfortable
handling the gun.

266
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,625
Okay.

267
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,166
Practice by yourself
for a while.

268
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,583
Okay!

269
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,958
So it's lonely, huh?

270
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,666
"You talkin' to me?

271
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,625
You talkin' to me?

272
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,458
You talkin' to me?

273
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,041
Then who the hell else
are you talkin',

274
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,166
you talkin' to me?

275
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,041
Okay."

276
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,166
"You're dead."

277
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,458
Hm?
Oh, man.

278
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,666
I missed big time.

279
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,916
Cal.

280
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,916
Yeah, well, I...
I was just fooling around.

281
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
That was DeNiro.

282
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,041
Lemme see it again.

283
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,916
Huh?

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,458
Cal, I want you to do your
DeNiro thing one more time.

285
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,166
"You talkin' to me?

286
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,416
Not the words.

287
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,416
Listen.

288
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,791
Don't just shoot right away.

289
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
When you think you're ready,

290
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,250
count one
and then pull the trigger.

291
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,041
Alright.

292
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,666
Holy crap!

293
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,750
I did it! I did it!

294
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,625
Yeah?

295
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,291
You ready to go shark fishing?

296
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,541
Godo's starting to get
a little stir crazy.

297
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,583
He's looking to go out
and hit the casinos tonight.

298
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,291
Keep an eye on him,

299
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,291
and be on the lookout
for Isaac to make his move.

300
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,833
Hell, yeah.

301
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,458
I wasn't even close.

302
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,708
They seem pretty relaxed.

303
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
Yeah.

304
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,125
Argh!

305
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,833
It's not my lucky night.

306
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,250
Aww! Those are the breaks,
my friend.

307
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,333
Only those who believe
in the Goddess of Victory

308
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,791
can hope to win her heart.

309
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,041
She's already spread her legs
so wide for you,

310
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,500
I'd just be getting
your sloppy seconds.

311
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,000
What? You quitting?

312
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,875
Just going back
for a little taste,

313
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,458
at least I got that.

314
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,333
Don't get too wasted.

315
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,583
I'm kinda surprised

317
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,041
that he decided to break off
from the group like that.

318
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,541
Alright, bro,
looks like you're in.

319
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,958
Uh, sure.

320
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,583
Hey!

321
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,250
How much do you wanna bet

322
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,583
that this place is
totally run by the mafia?

323
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,458
This isn't some kinda
DeNiro movie, ya know.

324
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,583
She's probably a natural,
like me.

325
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,208
But does that mean
it's okay

326
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,750
to make her walk down
the same path that I took?

327
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,583
No, I need to set her free.

328
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,958
As soon as I can.

329
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,625
Wanna play poker?

330

'Scuse me.

331
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,333
Yes, sir?

332
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,625
I lost my friend,

333
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,750
I think he was just
sitting here a minute ago.

334
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,833
Oh, is your friend
a Japanese guy?

335
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,666
My guess is he went back
to his room.

336
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,000
He just left
with a young lady.

337
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,000
There goes the bait.

00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,541
Ah! Shit.

340
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,833
No.

341
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,833
It can't be.

342
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,833
Eren?

344
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,291
No way.

345
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,416
It can't be her.

346
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,375
Eren is dead.

347
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,958
I killed her.
