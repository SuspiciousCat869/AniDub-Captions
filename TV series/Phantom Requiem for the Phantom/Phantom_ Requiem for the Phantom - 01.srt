1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,416
Who's the next target?

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,625
Frank Clard.

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,791
It took some work

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,458
but I was finally
able to catch his scent.

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,166
You gonna use those guys again?

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,250
You know, the weird ones.

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,500
Yes.

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,375
I believe we've already
decided to send them in.

9
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,541
It's gonna be a big
production, isn't it?

10
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,000
I think it's a necessity

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,708
if we truly want to raise
awareness of our existence.

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,750
Their power rages,
becoming hellfire,

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,333
burning even hell
to the ground.

14
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,833
And so we shall build
our world from the ashes.

16

You're injured.

17
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,333
It's just a scratch.

18
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,541
Me, I kill.

19
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,166
In order to live.

20
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,166

I have to get out of here
or they're gonna kill me!

24
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,583
I have to run
or I'm dead.

25
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,166
Those eyes...

26
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,250
I can't escape
from those cold black eyes.

27
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,916
What am I gonna do?

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,666
What am I gonna do?

29
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,458
If I can't get away,
I'll have to kill them.

30
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:13,083
It's kill or be killed.

31
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,250
Where? Where am I?

32
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,791
What is this place?

33
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,875
Why am I here?

34
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,000
What happened?

35
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,458
Who am I?
Why can't I remember...

36
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,791
my name.

37
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,958
Kanji?

38
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,500
A backpack.

39
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,083
That's me.

40
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,500
I guess.

41
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,666
Maybe.

42
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,916
Maybe I'm
a Japanese traveler who's lost.

43
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,583
What's going on?

44
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,958
Why can't
I remember anything?

45
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,708
Whoever attacked me

46
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,791
might still be lurking
around here someplace.

47
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,958
You shouldn't just be going

48
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,500
running off by yourself
all the time, Clo.

49
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,708
You do that,
and what the hell's the point

50
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,625
of having a bodyguard?

51
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,833
Well, would you like
to take a ride with me?

52
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,041
No way.

53
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,458
Relax, Lizzie,

54
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,125
I'm just going to
check up on them.

55
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,916
I can't very well
leave all the decisions

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,291
to that man alone,
now can I?

57
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,666
That snake in the grass.

58
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,208
Ten to one says
he's busy playing

59
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,750
with that fine
new toy of his by now.

60
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,875
What a disgusting pig!

61
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,791
He contributes a lot
to the organization, Lizzie.

62
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,166
Well,
he is the favorite puppet

63
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,666
of McGuire and the others.

64
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,666
So we're gonna
have to deal with him.

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,875
We use whatever means
we have at our disposal

66
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,500
to achieve our goal.

67
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,875
That's always been
the style of Inferno.

68
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,500
I know that, but...

69
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,833
Listen up, Clo.

70
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,750
You're treading
on dangerous ground.

71
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,958
Maybe too much of it.

72
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,833
You ever need my help,
just let me know.

73
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,291
I'm counting on it.

74
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,625
Thank you.

75
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,333
Now if the girl could just
learn to be a better driver.

76
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,750
His ability to assess is 074.

77
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,125
Awakening rate is 087.

78
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,458
That he's reached these values
after a only few minutes awake

79
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,000
is simply staggering.

80
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,583
As I told you before...

81
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,791
the young man is a gem.

82
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,291
I'm gonna burn in Hell
for all of this.

83
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,708
That is, of course,
unless I'm already there.

84
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,708
Sensory awareness very sharp.

85
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,250
That is the true nature
of animals.

86
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,583
It's the wild instinct
that is lying dormant

87
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,250
beneath the evolution
of his reasoning.

88
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,166
He will hone in on it,
I'm sure.

89
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,458
Although it will take some time

90
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,708
to reach the awareness
that I seek.

91
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,583
I'd say it's about time
for you to appear, Phantom.

92
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,291
But, show some restraint.

93
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,833
Yes, Master.

94
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,958
If you don't want to die.

95
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,125
Those eyes!

96
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,208
Then come at me
with everything you've got.

97
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,958
In a moment of crisis,

98
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,916
a danger to one's life,

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,750
a threat to one's
very existence,

100
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,916
when one is faced
with sudden misfortune,

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,625
one must be in touch with
his or her animal instincts

102
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,958
in order to survive.

103
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,083
If one relies on things
like morals and kindness,

104
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,875
if one believes in his heart
that his safety is guaranteed

105
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,333
based on those
transparent ideals,

106
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,958
then they are a weak human

107
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,833
who has abandoned
the "living" of this life.

108
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
The unfortunate truth
is this kind of reliance

109
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,625
on the intangible
has become the norm.

110
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,666
It sickens me.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,208
Well, well.
If it isn't Ms. McCunnen.

112
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,916
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

Would you like to see
where we stand?

116
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,875
Yes.

117
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,333
Then by all means.

118
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,500
Who is that girl?

119
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,541
Why is she after me?

120
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,250
I don't know.

121
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,125
I don't know anything.

122

Not where I am,
not how I got here.

123

I don't even know my name.

00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,750
There's no escape.

125
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,583
There is no escape.

126
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,625
If I can't get away.

127
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,125
It's this way for both of us.

128
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583

or be killed!

no future...

I don't even have a name.

What do I have to do

00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,291
What do you think?

170
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,458
Is he not a wonderful find?

171
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,625
All things considered,

172
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,958
the result turned out
quite splendidly.

173
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,958
No prior training,
no knowledge of tactics.

174
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,000
A blank canvas.

175
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,125
He operated solely
on natural instinct.

176
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,208
But above all of that,

177
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,458
although
it may have been temporary,

178
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,166
he surpassed even Ein.

179
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,166
Phantom.

180
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,875
How shameful.

181
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,958
Forgive me for failing you.

182
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,916
He's a prodigy.

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
But his talent hides,
lurking beneath the surface

184
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,083
until he finds himself
faced with the stress

185
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,750
of a life or death situation.

186
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,208
He is certainly
the kind of person

187
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,791
who was born
to join Inferno.

188
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,875
Even if that's true,

189
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,291
are you sure
he would want that?

190
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,083
There is neither an egg
that refuses to hatch

191
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,375
nor a seed that evades
its eventual sprouting.

192
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,083
This has nothing to do
with his will.

193
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,958
Ah, more brainwashing.

194
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,791
It's the best method
for achieving our goals.

195
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,625
Using hypnosis and medication,

196
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,458
I sealed tight all memories
dealing with his identity.

197
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,958
Please understand,
Ms. McCunnen,

198
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,583
this is mercy.

199
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,375
It could've been
much worse for him.

200
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,541
A stroke of bad luck

201
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,500
led him in into
an unfortunate situation.

202
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,250
Under normal circumstances
he'd have been a witness,

203
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,625
and thus, eliminated.

204
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,333
I thought I'd give him
one more chance

205
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,958
to live a fruitful life.

206
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,208
A Japanese tourist
that's traveling by himself...

207
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,250
there's no search party?

208
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,875
No one will be able to
track his path any longer,

209
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,875
so our secret
is perfectly safe.

210
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,458
Okay, then.

211
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,125
Scythe Master,
I'll leave this boy to you.

212
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,916
I appreciate your confidence.

213
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,583
Ein and Zwei.

214
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,250
Perhaps you should put
a little more thought

215
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,583
into the names
you give your subjects.

216
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,166
Such arrogance!

217
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,708
Just how much longer
do you think

218
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:26,208
you'll be giving me orders
like that, madam?

219
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,500
I am the first woman, Ein.

220
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:47,208
You are the second man, Zwei.

221
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,791
Together.

222
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,458
What're you doing?

223
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,791
That is all, Ein.

224
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,583
Go home.

225
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,541
Return to your post.

226
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,208
Yes, Master.

227
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,541
Together, we are ghosts

228
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,625
that have
no place to haunt.

229
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,500
Nonexistent phantoms.

230
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,791
Welcome back home, sir.

231
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,625
You have a nice flight?

232
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,625
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,166
Where's everyone else?

234
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,166
They're here.

235
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,083
They're all inside
taking a nap.

236
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,958
It's the damn middle
of the day.

237
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,208
What the hell's
going on here?

238
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,208
Wait!
Who are you people?

239
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,000
We're phantoms.

240
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,291
Phantom,

241
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,000
the strongest assassin
in all of Inferno.

242
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:00,250
And the title given to the top
sniper in the organization.

243
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,666
My greatest masterpiece.

244
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,750
And now,
he is another.

245
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,958
That's takin' it too far.

246
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,833
I see.

247
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,833
Lookin' good.

248
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,500
That's one more
outta the way.

249
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,541
By now, two out
of the five organizations in LA

250
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,333
have totally fallen apart.

251
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,666
This is a start, my friends.

252
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:50,291
We're going to create
a new era with our own hands.

253
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:55,416
We will create
the era of Inferno.

254
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,416
[Music]

255
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,750
Ghosts, that have
no place to haunt.

256
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,125
Nonexistent phantoms.

257
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,541
[Music]

258
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,958
You are now only
allowed to exist

259
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,958
for the purpose
of killing others.
