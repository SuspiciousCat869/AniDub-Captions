[Music]

2
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,708
Well?

3
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,625
Oh, it looks fine.

4
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,333
I mean, good.

5
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,041
Uh, it looks great, really.

6
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,083
Hm. Yeah, whatever.

7
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,625
Hey, come on, slowpoke,
we don't have forever, you know.

8
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,875
Yeah, I'm coming, alright.

9
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,541
It's this way, I think.

10
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,625
You looked at the map,
didn't you?

11
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,125
Yeah, of course I did.

12
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm gonna look in there,
will you wait for me?

13
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,291
Of course.

14
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
Your wallet, please?

15
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Hello, young man!

16
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,916
Nice to meet you.

17
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,041
He's cute.
Gonna carry him all day?

18
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,875
Yes, sir.

19
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,083
So, are you here alone?

20
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:41,916
Let's go sit down.

21
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,583
I'll buy you a new one.

22
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,541
Dummy.

23
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,458
This is very sweet of you.

24
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,250
Well, it was my fault, so...

25
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,041
It's the least we could do.

26
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,333
Ahh! It looks yummy.

27
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,333
So uh, you guys in school?

28
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,541
Uh, yes, ma'am.

29
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,458
But it's a weekday.

30
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,875
Playing hooky?

31
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,833
Well, there's more to it
than that.

32
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,458
It's the school's
founding anniversary

33
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,791
and they're having
a lame party for it.

34
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,958
It's cool.

35
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,125
I used to ditch sometimes.

36
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,416
Don't we all?

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,875
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,000
You have some ice cream
on your mouth.

39
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,458
Oh!

40
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,791
You're too careless...

41
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,125
Wallace.

42
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,916
Ready to go?

43
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,583
So did you memorize
the floor plan?

44
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,666
It's drilled into my head.

45
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,500
How many security cameras
do they have set up

46
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,750
on the main walkway?

47
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,208
Sixty eight.

48
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,125
There are a couple
of blind spots...

49
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,666
but not quite enough.

50
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,708
Be more careful
when you're talking to people.

51
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,166
We should go back home

53
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,791
and work up
our plan of attack.

54
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,833
Our supplies
should be arriving soon.

55
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,333
Yeah, right.

56
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,833
Hey, Zwei...

57
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,250
Your acting...

58
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,583
stinks.

59
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,458
With the addition of Zwei,

60
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,375
Phantom can now
carry out her missions

61
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,541
far more efficiently.

62
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,041
They are a cohesive unit.

63
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,083
Those kids kinda
give me the creeps,

64
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,125
but I appreciate you
helping us establish a presence

65
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,750
on the East Coast
so far ahead of schedule.

66
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,291
It's my pleasure.

67
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,333
Phantom...

68
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,125
has been used
quite a bit of late.

69
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,750
Such repeated use
won't draw attention, will it?

70
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,750
I feel the same way.

71
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,708
Perhaps we should be
more prudent.

72
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,166
Put Phantom on hold
for a little while.

73
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,833
With all due respect,

74
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,250
you shouldn't trouble yourself

75
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,166
with undue concern
for Phantom's exposure.

76
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
I implore you to allow us

77
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,125
to proceed with this mission
as originally planned.

78
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,583
As added insurance,
I will be traveling there myself

79
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,291
to oversee the assignment.

80
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh, yeah?

81
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,958
Got a hard-on
for this one, huh?

82
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,208
Alright, I'll leave it
to your Phantom.

83
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,000
I appreciate your faith, sir.

84
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,166
Wallace Yang...

85
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,916
That's the alias
given to me by Inferno.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,125
A student,
living in Los Angeles.

87
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,791
An ironic choice,

88
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,041
the name of the first man
I murdered.

89
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,583
Ever since that night...

90
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,541
I've been working
regularly for Inferno.

91
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,833
Killing,
on their behalf.

92
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,083
Together with Ein.

93
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,875
As a team.

94
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,333
Don Lucio...

95
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,083
High rolling
Dallas mafia boss.

96
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,500
He's a recluse.

97
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,583
Spends most of his time

98
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,625
in the protection
of his mansion.

99
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,791
But tomorrow
is an exception.

100
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,166
He's traveling to the mall

101
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,708
to get a birthday present
for his granddaughter.

102
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,500
That's when we strike.

103
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,041
A present for us.

104
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,333
We are expecting the target
to arrive

105
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,000
at approximately 3 p.m.

106
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,708
We should be in place
and ready to act

107
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,583
well before he arrives.

108
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,125
Where is the best place
to pull it off?

109
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,041
You tell me.

110
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,125
What's this, a test?

111
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,041
Master asked me to.

112
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,625
We should definitely
mingle a bit

113
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,333
before we approach the target.

114
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,291
It's important for us
to fit in.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,333
But, we can't do the deed
inside the mall.

116
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,625
Why's that?

117
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
It's too public.

118
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,083
I'm sure it'll be crawling
with guards inside as well.

119
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,708
They may even have control
of the security cameras.

120
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,708
We should make our move
somewhere more unexpected,

121
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,458
a place with less security.

122
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,083
And where would that be?

123
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,625
There's only one place.

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
We gotta be
where the target and his men

125
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,958
feel like
they can relax a bit.

126
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:06,791
Then...

127
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,958
Alright.

128
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,875
You're right, Zwei.

129
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,750
Let's go back to the room.

130
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,791
Yeah.

131
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,791
[Music]

132
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,541
Yeah, what is it?

133
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,750
I've located the target,
but they may have spotted me.

134
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,958
I've got two tracers
on my tail.

135
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,208
I need you to help me
throw off the scent.

136
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
Meet me at the fountain
by Elevator 9.

137
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,208
Hurry!

138
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,083
How long am I supposed
to wait for you?

139
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,166
I've had to walk around
all by myself.

140
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,875
Sorry.

141
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,083
I don't wanna hear another
one of your lame excuses.

142
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,375
So, what are you gonna do

143
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,666
to make up for being
such an insensitive jerk!

144
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,958
Well, uh...

145
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,000
You better give me
a real good answer.

146
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,208
Tell you what.

147
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,416
I'll buy you anything
that you want today.

148
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,708
And dinner.

149
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,291
Yeah, okay.

150
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,666
While I was waiting,

151
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,583
I checked out a buncha stores.

152
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,875
This is gonna be painful.

153
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,333
It's your fault, silly.

154
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,041
I said I'm sorry, didn't I?

155
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
The target's
in an antique store

156
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,541
in the mall's
southern sector.

157
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,833
So his car should arrive
to collect him

158
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,708
at the south entrance.

159
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,458
So, should we leave now?

160
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,041
We appreciate your business.

161
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,208
This outfit
would look totally fabulous

162
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,541
with those shoes over there.

163
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,833
You ready to do this?

164
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,125
Yeah.
I'll go in for the attack.

165
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,458
So cover me.

166
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,500
Got it.

167
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,166
We gotta be where
the target and his men

168
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,958
feel like
they can relax a bit.

169
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,458
Now, we take our leave.

170
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,625
Outstanding work, you two.

171
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,666
Bravo.

172
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,416
What's up?

173
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,375
It's nothing, really.

174
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,083
And you?

175
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,041
Oh! I'm totally fine.

176
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,208
Everything's great.

177
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,875
To what bychance do I owe
the honor of your presence?

178
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,375
Just checking up.

179
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,958
It's common
to commend one's subordinate

180
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,416
for a job well done.

181
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,875
I'm impressed.

182
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,958
And I appreciate
your diligence.

183
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,458
I appreciate your praise
as well.

184
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,541
That young man...

185
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,708
has been transformed.

186
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,666
Does this please you?

187
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,291
Well, of course, yes.

188
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,416
Problem?

189
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,166
No. So where are they now?

190
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,375
They are returning
on a commercial flight,

191
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,375
after disposing
of the equipment.

192
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,916
You wanna go, someday?

193
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,916
Not particularly.

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,958
Oh.

195
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,500
The waiting tire her out?

196
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,541
Oh, hello again.

197
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,958
Getting away?

198
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,541
Going back, actually.

199
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,083
We were on a trip here.

200
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,375
Well, that's nice.

201
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,458
Did y'all have a good time?

202
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,500
We did.

203
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,666
It was great.

204
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,916
Good.

205
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,916
Well, maybe
we'll see you again.

206
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,250
Bye.

207
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,458
See ya.

208
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,416
Hey, Zwei...

209
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,166
Your acting
was much better.

210
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,875
Two dogs...

211
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
kept in a cage
until the next hunt.

212
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,916
That's all we are now.

213
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,916
Time for another.

214
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:32,875
What's up?

215
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,625
It's nothing, I guess.

216
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't worry about it.

217
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,541
Master was right about him.

218
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,833
The same path...

219
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,500
the path that took me
two years to complete...

220
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,333
only took him three months.

221
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,666
He is who I used to be.

222
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,333
But...

223
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,916
I'm afraid...

224
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,291
I'm afraid that...

225
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,083
by watching him...

226
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,791
I might learn the truth
about myself.

227
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,083
Those eyes...

228
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,916
scare me.

229
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,583
[Music]

230
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,791
We toss aside our emotions,

231
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,000
and pull the trigger.

232
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,500
We take away
the happiness of others.
