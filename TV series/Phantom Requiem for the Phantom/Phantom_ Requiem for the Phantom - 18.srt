2
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,375
I've never had clothes
this nice before.

3
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,541
Thank you!

4
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,916
Cal!

5
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,958
I was an early victim
of Claudia's treason.

6
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,958
A plot deftly woven
with strands of deceit.

7
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,000
Not content with betraying me

8
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,458
and turning
the title of "Phantom"

9
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,291
into one synonymous
with sexual slave,

10
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,000
she seized power with
the bloody coup of your friend,

11
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,000
acts that would make
Machiavelli blush.

12
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,916
Lizzie Garland contacted me
earlier this evening,

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,750
rather alarmed
that Ms. McCunnen

14
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,041
was nowhere to be found.

15
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,916
Her disappearance is suspect,

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,041
she's usually very quick
with an alibi.

17
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,166
As much as I'd prefer
not to believe it...

18
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,875
the evidence you've presented
is certainly compelling.

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,958
As for the Godo Family,

20
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,333
you suggest we ignore
their previous alignment,

21
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,000
and allow them to operate under
our organizational structure?

22
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,500
I can imagine
Inferno's pride still stings

23
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,000
from the theft of product

24
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,541
that the Godos
were a party to last year.

25
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,083
However, profit potential
in the Far East

26
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,291
exceeds the loss
suffered in that robbery,

27
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,375
by a large degree, in fact.

28
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,958
Oh?

29
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,875
The man who worked in collusion
with Claudia has been disposed.

30
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,291
The direct result of a difficult
executive decision

31
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,458
reached by Mr. Shiga,

32
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,875
and one illustrative
of his desire

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,583
to make amends with Inferno.

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,541
We will honor
the intent of our partnership,

35
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,416
but the details will
require renegotiation.

36
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,583
Of course, as penalty for their
involvement in the incident,

37
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,125
we will insist that the family
take a smaller share

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:09,708
than in our initial arrangement,
do you agree?

39
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,208
Very well, Mr. Shiga.

40
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,000
It seems we now have a mutual
foe in our former ally,

41
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,583
Claudia McCunnen.

42
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
I assure you she will pay

43
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,125
a very steep price
for her treachery.

44
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,791
I appreciate your understanding,
Mr. McGuire.

45
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,500
We are currently investigating
Claudia's whereabouts.

46
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,916
But the real mystery
is Phantom.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,083
How will he respond
to her absence?

48
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,958
If I may suggest, Mr. McGuire,

49
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,041
Ein would be
an appropriate agent

50
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,125
to solve that question
once and for all.

51
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,041
A battle between the current
and former Phantoms.

52
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,250
That's lovely.

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,125
Have you lost your damn mind?

54
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,583
You want to team up
with the Bloodies?

55
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,541
Clo, Isaac practically
put your brother

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,416
in the grave himself!

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,666
I know, but they have
the backing

58
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,708
of a new organization,

59
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
a very large and powerful
syndicate.

60
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,625
What in the hell
are you talking about?

61
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,458
This group is destined
to be a major player

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,958
on a global stage.

63
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,083
Oh, yeah?

64
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,125
And you wanna get
to the top so bad,

65
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,291
you'll sell your soul
to the highest bidder.

66
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,083
I'll reach the heights
that my brother never could

67
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,000
in his lifetime.

68
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,541
My success will serve
as a shrine to his memory.

69
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:24,916
Giving up now
would not honor him.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,458
Please, Lizzie,
I need your help.

71
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't do this all by myself.

72
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,375
I hope you can
understand this, Clo,

73
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,625
I've been in the game
for a long time now,

74
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,125
but I still have some morals.

75
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,166
There's a line
that I just won't cross.

76
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,833
Promise me that you won't
cross that line either.

77
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,125
I'm serious, Clo.

78
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,916
Promise me that,
and I'm still with ya.

79
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,000
I swear on my life.

80
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,333
You went too far,
too goddamn far.

81
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,875
You screwed it all up.

82
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,208
We tore up the place,
but didn't find anything.

83
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,500
Shit, call Lizzie,
and tell her it's clean,

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,958
there ain't a damn thing
worthwhile here.

85
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,291
Yo, dudes,
I found the car keys!

86
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,125
Sweet, come on, man,
let's open that bitch up.

87
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,916
I'd rather be driving
its hot piece of ass owner.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,208
No shit.

89
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,291
Reiji! Thank God.

90
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,083
I'm so glad you're alright.

91
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,041
Well, I guess you know
the situation by now.

92
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,791
Claudia!
What've you done?

93
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,416
I'm not gonna waste your time
with bullshit excuses.

94
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,958
All this time, I've only
ever done what I had to

95
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,958
to keep myself
from getting pulled under.

96
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,250
And I've rewarded you
for your loyalty.

97
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,666
I have no intentions
of giving up now.

98
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,541
You have to listen to me.

99
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,833
Reiji, I need you with me.

100
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,625
I have contacts
on the East Coast

101
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,541
that can help us out.

102
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,333
Inferno will
send someone after us,

103
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,291
but I'm confident
you can handle that.

104
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,000
Meet me at the diner
on Route 39.

105
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,708
Please, Reiji,
my life depends on you.

106
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,875
It's your fault.

107
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,625
[Music]

108
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,208
You know, those scars
could be removed

109
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
with minor surgery.

110
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,458
So tell me, why have I not
allowed you such treatment?

111
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,333
Out of cruelty?

112
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,666
No, Master.

113
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,291
What do those imperfections
represent?

114
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,458
Corruption and disgrace.

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,333
Correct, Ein.

116
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,541
You were the crowning
achievement

117
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,500
of my life's ambition.

118
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,208
A work of art desecrated
by that fool Zwei.

119
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,083
You've fallen
so far from perfection

120
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,625
that it disgusts me
to even look at you.

121
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,000
Perhaps there's hope.

122
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,500
Although you are now
a miserable shell

123
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,625
of your former glory,

124
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,583
it's possible one day
you may redeem those qualities

125
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:51,000
which were tarnished by
betrayal, if you kill Zwei.

126
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,833
If you can eliminate the one
who corrupted your mind,

127
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,041
the one who sullied your body,

128
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,500
perhaps you can
restore your luster.

129
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,875
And we can remove
those bothersome reminders.

130
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,291
I'll once again have
the master's pride in his work.

131
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,000
I won't fail you, Master.

132
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,958
You believe it's likely

133
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,708
she'll defeat
the current Phantom?

134
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,666
What I believe is

135
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,041
Ein will no doubt take the fight
to its ultimate conclusion...

136
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,458
and pay the ultimate price
if needed.

137
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:30,291
So, you're willing to count her
as a collateral loss?

138
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:35,166
In a way, Ein represents
my crude, experimental phase.

139
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,750
But now I'm on the cusp
of achieving a higher level

140
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,041
of refined expression.

141
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,458
Although I look upon
my first work with fondness,

142
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:50,000
I can't hold on to her
for the sake of mere nostalgia.

143
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,333
But given that we are
at the final stage,

144
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,791
do you think it's wise
to rely on her to deliver?

145
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,916
An actor's performance
can transcend

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,291
the most tiresome of dialogue.

147
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,375
An errant brushstroke
can spawn a masterpiece,

148
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,791
bringing unexpected delight
to artist and patron,

149
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,708
mischief caused by the muses.

150
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:18,083
Will our finale be
tragedy, or comedy?

151
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,791
I actually find
entrusting the outcome to fate

152
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,541
quite thrilling.

153
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,041
My mind races to envision

154
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,625
the endless
possibilities to come.

155
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,291
This mission hits close to home
for you, Ms. Garland.

156
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,416
Are you positive you can
go through with it?

157
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,875
Come on, man.

158
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,291
Haven't I proven myself by now?

159
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,291
You and Claudia have been close
for a very long time.

160
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,000
My fear is
you might be too emotional

161
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,125
to pull the trigger.

162
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,250
Shut the hell up!
I'm on it!

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,208
Girls don't like boys
who aren't on time, Reiji.

164
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,833
This is it.
Where it all started.

165
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,875
That's it, Zwei.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,791
I can't.

167

I'm not Zwei.

168
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,791
I can't be him.

Cal!

170

What the hell have I done?

171
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,625
Right now,

172
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,125
I'm doing exactly
as I always wanted,

173
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,333
running so fast
no one can catch up,

174
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,541
leaving everything
a blur in the distance.

175

Yeah, but...

176
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,541
you're gonna lose touch
with the ground that way.

177
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,291
That's real freedom.

178
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,000
Unbound and light as air.

179
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,541
How far were you trying to go

180
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,541
that made you take
such huge risks?

181
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,416
Honestly, I don't know.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
As far as I could, I suppose.

183
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,166
Listen, Clo...

184
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,875
all this running,
this whole damn lifestyle,

185
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,250
just wears you out.

186
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,375
What happens
when you finally fall?

187
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,541
Aren't you gonna regret
leaving something behind?

188
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,250
Losing everything?

189
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,416
I have to accept that.

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
The things
I've seen at this height,

191
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,000
I could never have experienced
any other way.

192
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,083
It's worth any cost.

193
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,208
I've always wanted
to see them.

I'm sorry.

198
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,000
Are you just going to accept
your death without a fight?

199
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,375
It's useless to fight you.

200
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,041
My orders are to fight you
and achieve victory.

201
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,041
I must fulfill them.

202
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,333
I must prove
that I am the strongest.

The rightful holder
of the title "Phantom."

Well, then you should
fulfill them.

205
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,791
I'll fight.

206
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,916
You're still strong...

following that man's orders,

his reasons to risk
your life and fight.

209

Scythe still controls you.

Eren.

But why?

212
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,666
There's no way
I can beat you.

213
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,625
I don't even really want to.

00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:35,416
No, I'm done.

215
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
If I did kill you
and left this place forever,

216
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,625
what the hell
would I do then?

217
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,833
What the hell
would that change?

218
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,000
Would I stop being lied to?

219
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,750
Could I save
the people I love?

220
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,916
There's no exit
from this goddamn way of life,

221
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,666
no relief from this cycle.
So do it.

Reiji, I don't blame you,

00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,666
there's nothing
you could've done,

225
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,375
I know exactly how you feel.

226
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,583
But Eren, you're still
in that world.

227
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,166
You're still living for the one
who lies to you, for Scythe.

228
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,000
No.

229
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What I'm living for now
is this.

230
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,041
I remember what you told me,

231
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,875
you told me to find
my own reason to live.

232
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,041
This scar
is a constant reminder

233
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,958
of what you did for me.

234
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,541
It reminds me
of your strength.

235
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,041
That day, you did things

236
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:55,666
you never thought
you could do, for my sake.

237
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,583
The proof of your devotion
will always be here,

238
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,791
it's carved on my body.

239
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,500
Because of that,
I could never give up on myself.

240
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,666
Eren...

241
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,250
You're my other self.

242
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,500
You took the path that I wasn't
strong enough to take.

243
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,041
I went back,

244
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,000
you kept fighting
for your own life.

245
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,541
Since then,
I've been dreaming of you.

246
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,416
I could always take comfort
in the thought

247
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
that my other self was living
somewhere in the world,

248
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,500
strong and free.

249
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:35,500
This scar binds us together,
my life to yours.

250
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,625
I couldn't accept it
any other way.

251
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,875
It would be too painful.

252
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,750
If you can't go on
living like this,

253
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:46,125
no one could ever blame you
for that, but still...

254
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,041
If you want to keep
your promise to protect me,

255
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,500
you have to
end my life first.

256
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,000
Save me from the pain
of losing you.

257
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,416
I can't do that,
there's no way.

258
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,958
With you gone,

259
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,208
I'm just my Master's
greatest failure.

260
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,291
A useless puppet
waiting to be thrown away.

261
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,125
Eren!

262
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,250
You're my only salvation
from this endless hell.

263
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,958
Your life
is the only comfort I have.

264
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,833
So please, Reiji,
kill me first.

265
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,875
Because I don't ever
want to live

266
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,791
in a world
that doesn't have you in it.

267
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:35,250
Until today, I felt like
I couldn't keep any promise.

268
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,125
I thought
that I had lost everything.

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,875
Eren...

271
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,291
I tried to keep the promise
I made to you that night.

272
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,958
But I failed you.
I'll risk my life,

You'll never see him again.

I must say that this
is an extremely disappointing

00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,125
turn of events.

277
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,416
I'm not so sure of that.

Perhaps this is just
a brief intermission
