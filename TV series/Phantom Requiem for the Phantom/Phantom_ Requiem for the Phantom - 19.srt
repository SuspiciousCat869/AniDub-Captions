[Music]

2
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,208
You shouldn't
drink yourself blind

3
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,291
just because you're not
getting any customers.

4
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,791
It like I'm having to come
get you every night lately.

5
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,541
Yeah, I know
you're probably right,

6
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,375
but I'm glad
I gotta good little sister.

7
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,791
Thanks.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,041
Judy?

9
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,750
Judy!

10
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,000
Why her?

11
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,625
Judy?

12
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,083
I'm looking for where
Miss Judy Devens died.

13
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
Is this it?

14
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,166
Who are you?

15
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,041
I heard what they called you.

16
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,333
They called you Phantom.

17
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,083
I know who that is,
Judy's friends told me

18
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,250
he's someone that goes around
and kills gangsters.

19
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Does that mean
you're a real assassin?

20
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,458
You really are,
aren't you?

21
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,750
You're the assassin Phantom.

22
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,708
Yeah, that's me.

23
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,791
Hey.

24
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,583
I'll give you
all of this damn money

25
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,083
if you kill them for me.

26
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,791
The guy in the alley,
the guy with the gun,

27
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,625
the guy who was supposed
to get the money.

28
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,625
Kill everybody that had anything
to do with Judy's murder.

29
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,791
Will you do it for me?

30
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,583
Judy...

31
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,958
So...

32
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,000
I was actually able
to get close to Phantom.

33
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:35,291
If I take the money I found
from the guys that killed you,

34
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,333
I think he can help me
avenge your death.

35
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, Cal.

36
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,458
I'll be straight with you,
five mill's not enough.

37
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,916
Okay.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,250
But...

39
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,750
the difference isn't really
all that much.

40
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,458
I'm sure
you can earn the rest.

41
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,208
What do you mean by that?

42
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,583
It's easy,
you'll be my assistant.

43
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,041
That's so cool!

44
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,833
Hey!

45
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,500
So if I'm really gonna be
your assistant,

46
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,666
that means I can be there
when you do it,

47
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,666
when you get the guys
that murdered Judy, right?

48
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,541
Well, first off, we're gonna
have to pick up something.

49
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,291
Found anything?

50
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,541
Uh, hold on.

51
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,625
Just find the one
you want the most,

52
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,291
and we'll get you that one.

53
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,500
But it's hard,

54
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,750
I can't decide on which one
I like the most,

55
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,625
it's like I like them
all the same or something.

56
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,208
And if I do pick one,

57
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,916
that means I have to give up
on something else I like.

58
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,083
Don't worry,

59
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,458
it's not like this store
is gonna go anywhere.

60
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,166
If you really want something,
we can come back and get it.

61
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,583
Really?

62
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,500
Yep.
So all you gotta do today,

63
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,583
is pick out the one
you wanna wear today.

64
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,625
Cool! Well...

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,666
Hey, hey,
do I look cute in this?

66
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,958
Yeah.
You look really cute.

67
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,125
I've never had clothes
this nice before,

68
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,625
thank you!

69
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,791
If you can wait
for just a bit,

70
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:33,875
I'll get dinner
ready for you

71
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,666
when I'm done with
all of this stuff.

72
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,500
Okay.
But why are you cleaning?

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,708
'Cause this place is filthy.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,041
I guess it makes sense though.

75
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,416
An assassin who made sure
his room was all neat and tidy,

76
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
probably
wouldn't seem that hardcore.

77
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,375
Now that I'm your assistant,
you can leave this stuff to me.

78
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,958
Cool! Well, thanks.

79
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,208
I'm gonna have to be
pretty useful

80
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,833
if I wanna earn what
that five million doesn't cover.

81
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,916
Hey, Reiji?
You got a family?

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,958
Family?

83
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,750
They're in heaven.

84
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,750
Oh, yeah?

85
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

86
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,541
So you're like me.

87
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,791
Your folks too, huh?

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,750
I don't know for sure.

89
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,833
I ran away from my lying
sack of crap father.

90
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,583
A little while after that,
Judy took me in.

91
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,916
If it wasn't for her,

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,708
I think I'd probably
be dead by now.

93
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,958
That's tough.
Sorry, Cal.

94
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,125
The way I see it,
she's the only family I got,

95
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,500
but now, now she's dead.

96
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,125
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,166
It's fine.

98
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,625
Since I don't have her
anymore...

99
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,458
I don't know where to go,
I just feel so lost.

100
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,791
I really don't know
what the heck to do.

101
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,916
I know.

102
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,750
I've felt the same way.

103
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,125
It's a part of life,
everybody dies.

104
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,791
Hey, Cal.

105
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,041
All right,
give me your hand.

106
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,500
What for?

107
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,125
Your payment for today.

108
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,708
Oh, wow!

109
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,541
Oh my god, thank you!

110
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,583
I'll take good care of it.

111
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,708
I promise I will, always.

112
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,583
All of our main performers
have gathered.

113
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,833
Claudia, who betrayed me

114
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,458
and again devises
a nefarious plot.

115
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,291
Daisuke Godo,
who is being roped into Inferno

116
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,291
solely to provide her security.

117
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,333
Wisemel,
who saw the folds of this plot

118
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,208
and currently
tries to stop it with force.

119
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,708
And then there's this one,
our newest player.

120
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,708
A compelling ensemble indeed.

121
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:49,666
Now, we have quite a bit
of work to do, Ein.

122
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,750
Is he the one?

123
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,208
You think he's the one
who killed Judy?

124
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,625
I don't know, probably.

125
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,166
I'd at least
be willing to bet

126
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,333
he's one of the people
responsible.

127
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,750
I want to be with you
when it happens.

128
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,291
It's him!
He's behind the water tower!

129
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,541
Show yourself!

130
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,666
Reiji?

131
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,708
Show me your face!

132
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,083
I can't believe you bastards!

133
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,583
Mr. Godo,
don't do anything yet.

134
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,791
Why?

135
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,666
Wait, what just happened?

136
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:49,333
It was for you.

137
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,666
Ray, I got your back.

138
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,041
No!

139
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,250
Oh my god, Reiji,
are you okay?

140
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,500
Did he get you?

141
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,750
I'm fine,
it's just a scratch.

142
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,416
You're so stupid.

143
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,875
Why would you do
something so stupid?

144
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,375
Couldn't help it.

145
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,833
Chalk it up to some kinda
morbid curiosity.

146
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,750
You did a good job today.
I'm proud of you.

147
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,375
Come on, Cal,
you got revenge for Judy.

148
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,958
That's a big deal.

149
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Yeah.

150
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,041
Mission accomplished.

151
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,625
Good job.

152
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,791
Leave your position
via route C,

153
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,750
wait for your next order.

154
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,708
Yes, Master.

155
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,166
Hey, when I went out
to pick up groceries,

156
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,625
I heard someone saying
Isaac from the Bloodies died.

157
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,666
Yeah.

158
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,041
So then, it's over, huh?
We got revenge.

159
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,083
That's it.

160
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,125
Well, how was
my assassin training?

161
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,041
Was I on my way
to getting any good?

162
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,625
If you wanted me to,

163
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,666
I suppose I could stick around
and help you on your missions.

164
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,083
You need to forget
about being a killer.

165
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,416
Why?

166
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,750
Just forget about it, okay?

167
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:48,208
Okay, I guess
you don't need me anymore.

168
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,583
Do you?

169
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,125
Now, I didn't say that.

170
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,666
I'd probably starve
if you weren't around to cook.

171
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,041
You can cook
and clean and stuff.

172
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,458
That's great!
Oh, I'll totally be your maid!

173
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,791
I always loved that outfit!

174
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,875
And I can wear it
around the house

175
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,375
while I'm doing
my cleaning and stuff!

176
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,000
Reiji...

177
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,541
What's up?

178
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,875
I, uh, I want you to know

179
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,333
that I still want to be
your assistant.

180
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,208
Come on, that's over.

181
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,375
Yeah, I know, but, I've been
thinking about it a lot

182
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,541
and there's a bunch of stuff
I wanted to say.

183
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,333
Maybe if I told you
more about myself,

184
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,250
you'd understand why.

185
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,791
Listen,
you're one of the smartest,

186
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,166
most capable people I know.

187
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,458
You could do
anything you want.

188
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,541
So why in the hell do you wanna
just throw it all away?

189
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,375
You don't like what you do?

190
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,833
No.

191
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,333
So, you don't like yourself,
do you?

192
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,291
No, I don't.

193
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,333
Do you think I wanted to spend
my life as a goddamn killer?

194
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,291
I hate myself.
I'm worthless.

195
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,208
No, you're not.

196
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,416
I'm too young
to be this broken.

197
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,916
And if you follow me,
you're gonna be fucked up, too!

198
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,958
I'm sorry, Reiji, sorry.

199
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:46,291
Cal, I was being a jerk.
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want this life
for you.

201
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,875
So many people've died
because of what I am now.

202
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,625
If it wasn't for me,
they'd still be alive.

203
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,250
They could've gone back home
to the people

204
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,583
who meant something to them.

205
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,750
It was never your fault.

206
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,958
It's your job, Reiji,
and if you didn't do it,

207
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,500
someone else would.

208
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,541
That's just an excuse.

209
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,583
Oh, fine.
Then tell me,

210
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,125
did you want to
kill those people?

211
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,500
Did you shoot them because
you thought it'd be a good time?

212
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,666
You like it?
Is it fun for you?

213
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,541
It's not, is it?

214
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,791
You gotta understand,

215
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,458
once you kill somebody,
the whole damn world changes,

216
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,166
right then.

217
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875
It's hard to describe, but,

218
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,666
it's like
everything else dies, too.

219
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,208
The world starts to turn gray.

220
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,708
You still have a kind heart.

221
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,375
And you can accept people
for who they are,

222
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,583
it doesn't matter to you.

223
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,666
I just don't want you
to lose that.

224
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,000
This place I'm in now,
I can't bring you into it.

225
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,250
I care too much about you.

226
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,416
What am I supposed to do?

227
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,833
That world is where you're
always gonna be, isn't it?

228
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:06,916
I have to go there

229
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,708
if I want to be with you
forever, right?

230
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,333
You can't.

231
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,541
I don't want to ever
be apart from you.

232
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,625
I want to always
be by your side.

233
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,875
Forever.

234
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,958
I want to be...

235
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,416
with you.

236
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,583
I think I get it now, finally.

237
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,125
I want to be who I was
before this.

238
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,125
I thought somehow
I could be that person again

239
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,333
if I was with you.

240
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,541
Like you're the key.

241
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,833
I can be that for you,
I know I can.

242
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,833
I can learn
to live in your world.

243
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:03,750
No, let me do it.
I need to go back.

244
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,583
I need to get back
into the world you live in

245
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,458
and out of mine.

246
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:15,250
Reiji, you said
you would be by my side.

247
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,791
You made a promise.
You promised, remember?

248
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,250
I can't believe they're just
gonna call you in right now.

249
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,458
I'll probably be gone awhile.

250
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,375
You should go on to bed soon.

251
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,833
Naw, I'll stay up.

252
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,833
I found an old broken VCR
earlier this afternoon,

253
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,750
I think I'm gonna see
if I can get it working.

254
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,750
Just buy a new one.

255
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,000
That's a waste of money.
It might still work!

256
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,333
You think it'll work, huh?

257
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,666
Maybe you're right.

258
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,166
Hey, come back soon.

259
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,708
'Kay.

260
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,375
Promise?

261
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,791
Yeah, I promise.

262
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,500
That's right,
it's a promise.

263
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,375
...which leads
to the Peace Party...

264
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,791
Sweet!
It freakin' works!

265
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,833
That's right, Mary.

266
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,166
This, of course...

267
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,333
I wonder if the video store's
still open.

268
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,875
Reiji! Reiji!

269
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,208
You can't go in, kid!
It's dangerous!

270
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,041
Reiji's inside!
Help him! Help him!

271
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,750
Reiji!

272
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,125
What happened?

273
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,791
You'll be back.
Right?

274
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,708
You promised me you would.

275
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
Liar!

276
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,000
You said we'd never be apart!

277
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,208
You said you'd stay with me!

278
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,208
You promised!

279
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,708
Yes, he made a promise to you
and he broke it.

280
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,583
That man is
quite the con artist.

281
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,750
A liar.

282
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,666
Who are you... mister?

283
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,750
[Music]

284
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,875
It's okay to grieve.

285
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:45,291
You're leaving something behind,
it's human nature.

286
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,791
But now you have to go back
to who you were before.
