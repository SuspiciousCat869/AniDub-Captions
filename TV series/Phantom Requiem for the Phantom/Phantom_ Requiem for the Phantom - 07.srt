2
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,208
There is one more thing.

3
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,666
I have another task for you
in LA.

4
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,000
I was under the impression
that the focus of our activities

5
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,500
would be shifting
to the East Coast after LA.

6
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:04,666
This particular operation isn't
from McGuire and the others.

7
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,500
No, this is to score points
on a personal level.

8
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,333
So your superiors
will owe you one,

9
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,666
you want to make
an unexpected contribution.

10
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,916
Yes.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,916
So what do you think
about making this one

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,458
a bit more clandestine?

13
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,291
I must confess to you,

14
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,708
I enjoy doing things sub-rosa.

15
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,666
I'd expect no less.

16
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,541
And I promise you,

17
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,041
everything will commence
in profound secrecy.

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,250
This will show
the true greatness of Phantom,

19
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,875
won't it?

20
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,916
[Music]

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,166
Thank you.

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,958
That was your local weather
and now on to the news.

23
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,875
It's a topic that always gets
a lot of attention around here.

24
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,125
The construction
of the much talked about

25
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,208
large-scale shopping mall
in Santa Monica.

26
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,541
Although the West Coast
garners the attention

27
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,125
of thousands of tourists a year,

28
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,541
most of them frequent
the big recreational parks...

29
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,375
Who was it?

30
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,875
My part-time job.

31
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:05,958
Someone called in sick

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,166
so they want me
to come in and cover.

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
Okay.

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,083
I'll drop you off.

35
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,250
I was planning to go out
to practice my driving anyway.

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,875
You don't need to.

37
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,958
If we're supposed to be
a couple living together,

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,208
it seems like
the normal thing to do.

39
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,208
I guess.

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,416
Now for our next story.

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,625
It's an unfortunate
but well known fact

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,083
that the illegal drug market
on the West Coast

43
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,583
has been monopolized by
the Chinese Mafia for some time.

44
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,666
However, recently,
the Japanese Mafia

45
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,458
has been stepping in.

46
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,083
This greater presence
has led to various scuffles

47
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,458
in Chinatown
and the surrounding areas.

48
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,750
You should be careful.

49
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,250
Don't worry about it.

50
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,625
I'm not gonna get myself
dragged into that whole mess.

51
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,333
That's not what I meant.

52
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,125
We don't want anyone
to find this place

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,958
because you set off
the fire alarm.

54
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,166
Yeah, right.

55
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you two going somewhere?

56
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,166
Hello, Ms. McCunnen.

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Maybe you'd like to
come with me?

58
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,750
I'm sorry, but I was planning
on going out

59
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,333
to practice driving
for a while.

60
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,333
Why don't you try
using this piece of hardware?

61
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,250
I think I'll walk.

62
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:45,125
So? How's she handle?
You like the car?

63
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,583
Don't you feel like you could
just keep on driving forever?

64
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,208
Makes you feel like the goddamn
king of the world, doesn't it?

65
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,500
Not me.

66
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,208
I don't know if I'm ready
for a car like this,

67
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,000
it's too much.

68
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,916
I'm impressed
that you were able to stop.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
For a second there,
it was all over.

70
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
All over?

71
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,583
I've learned that nothing
will ever be over,

72
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,875
not even if I die.

73
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,291
And all that'll mean,

74
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,833
is fewer murder victims.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,958
You're wrong.

76
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,541
You're not going to die
for nothing.

77
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,958
It will matter.

78
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,791
And I will decide the place
for you to die.

79
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,583
As one of the few men
who've won my trust,

80
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,041
I'd say you've earned
that much.

81
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,708
Now, go.

82
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,875
Keep driving, Zwei.

83
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,166
I know this mission
might seem a bit unexpected,

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,416
but these things happen.

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,166
Consider it a part-time job.

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,750
Yes.

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,916
Claudia seems to be infatuated
with Zwei.

88
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,708
I want you to keep your eye out
that she doesn't steal him.

89
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,625
Even if that were
to take place,

90
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,541
it wouldn't be a problem.

91
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,166
Zwei's participation

92
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,250
is not necessarily required
for me to complete my missions.

93
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,083
That's true.

94
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,958
I mean, the two of you
working together as a team

95
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,333
was simply the effect
of mere coincidence.

96
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,833
And convenience.

97
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,125
Take her out for a spin.

98
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,750
Get to know her a little better.

99
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,583
Just be back within the hour.

100
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,250
Are you sure about that?

101
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,708
Of course.

102
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,416
I want you to get familiar
with this sort of thing.

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,666
Enjoy your drive.

104
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,458
See ya.

105
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,875
That's one hell of a car

106
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,750
you're stepping out of
in those heels.

107
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,166
Tell me,
you think it's cool,

108
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,833
meeting out in the open
like this?

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,583
Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,208
I understand
if you feel intimidated.

111
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,875
But I guarantee you,

112
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,375
you are safe
in speaking to me here today.

113
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,291
I'll take your word for it.

114
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,416
I thought a lot about
the plan you designed.

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,083
Basically, you ready
the weapons and logistics.

116
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,208
We're the soldiers,

117
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,083
we get in there
and make the grab.

118
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,166
Those are the terms
as I understand,

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,833
unless
I'm missing something.

120
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,625
No.

121
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,750
We do this
and then you pay up.

122
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,000
500 kilograms of cocaine,
uncut, no filler.

123
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,166
Ha! That's about 200 mil,

124
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,916
which'll keep our funding
problems at bay for a while, eh?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,583
Yes.

126
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
Does something
not sit right with you?

127
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,166
I'm not sure I see the benefit,
Ms. McCunnen.

128
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,958
I'd like to know
what you're going to gain

129
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,541
by offering
such good terms to us,

130
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,958
if you don't mind.

131
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,875
I'm just trying to do
the Godo Family a favor.

132
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,416
And knowing your family's
reputation for loyalty,

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,333
I'm trying to get you
to owe me one.

134
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,083
Yeah.

135
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,583
So you're looking for backing,
huh?

136
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,833
Yes, I'll give you
200 million,

137
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,000
but in the end,
I'll gain something

138
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,250
that's worth so much more to me
than money.

139
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,458
I see.

140
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,541
Sounds like
a fair deal to me.

141
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,750
It doesn't matter, it's done.

142
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,833
We've already made our decision
either way.

143
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,500
It's too good to pass up.

144
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,250
You can count us in.

145
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,416
That's true.

146
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,583
I mean, the two of you
working together as a team

147
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,833
was simply the effect
of mere coincidence.

148
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,375
Look, I'm an INN reporter.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,583
- Hey!
- Shut up and listen.

150
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,166
Just take this! Please!

151
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,958
But, why?

152
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,291
I want you to give it
to the police.

153
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,583
That's all you have to do.

154
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,875
Now hurry.

155
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,833
Wait! Hold on!

[Music]

157
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,916
Why is this happening?

158
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,625
I'm done with this.

159
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,375
I gotta eat something soon.

160
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,083
So tired.

161
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,291
Don't even know
what day it is.

162
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,666
I wanna go back,
back home.

163
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,041
It's quiet now,
so if I run, I might make it.

164
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,416
No way.
I go out now,

165
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
I know she'll find me,

166
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,500
and then,
she'll kill me.

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,708
After the tough time
he's given you, Phantom,

168
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,166
he still clings to life.

169
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,041
I must say I'm impressed.

170
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,583
Through suppression
of his hunger and even his fear,

171
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,625
he chose to remain
in this place.

172
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,458
He assessed this
as the only course of action

173
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,083
to his survival.

174
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,291
It was his instinct
that made him continue

175
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,750
to suppress his impulses.

176
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,250
Interesting!

177
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,791
A fascinating subject.

178
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,291
Zwei, Zwei,

179
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,833
wake up.

180
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,000
We're going out.

181
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,291
You need to get ready.

182
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,416
Sure, right.

183
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,750
New mission,
we'll do it tonight.

184
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,375
But before it gets dark,
we need to scout the location.

185
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,791
At 20:00 hours tonight,

186
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,875
500 kilograms of cocaine
will come through here.

187
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,333
And let me guess,
Inferno wants it.

188
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,000
The primary objective
of our mission

189
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,583
is to back up
the assault unit.

190
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,958
What do you know about
these assault unit guys?

191
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,333
Are they reliable?

192
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,916
Claudia seems to be somewhat
infatuated with Zwei.

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,416
I want you to keep your eye out
that she doesn't steal him.

194
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,541
They told me nothing.

195
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,041
I don't know.

196
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,583
So this is a mission
that only Phantom can carry out.

197
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,791
Let's go back, we have
to ready our weapons.

198
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,250
Hey, Ein, tell me,

199
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,625
are you able to remember
any of your dreams?

200
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,750
My dreams?

201
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,041
Like things
that you've never seen before,

202
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,916
or people you know
you've never met.

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,250
I guess I just wonder,
are they dreams?

204
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,875
Or, memories?

205
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,208
Dunno.

206
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,708
What do you dream about?

207
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,708
You have 'em, right?

208
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,500
Sometimes.

209
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,958
I have dreams
about colors.

210
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,208
Yeah? Is that all?

211
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,958
No, there's...
there's wind.

212
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,916
Strong wind.

213
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,416
And there's blue, white,
and green.

214
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,791
But that's all there is
in that place.

215
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,708
Nothing else.

216
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,250
All I can ever remember
is the bright lights,

217
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,750
the colors,
and the blustery wind,

218
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,250
the strongest wind I've known.

219
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,500
I wonder if that place
you dream of, if that's home.

220
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,333
I don't know.

221
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,666
It doesn't matter.

222
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,250
What would we do?

223
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,541
We find out where we're from.

224
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,208
Then what?

225
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,416
Wouldn't you at least
want to check it out?

226
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,958
Come on, the place holds a spot
in your memory, your past.

227
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,708
It's gotta be important.

228
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:30,291
It's not,
there's no place for us there.

229
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,375
There's no place
for killers anywhere.

230
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,375
There's nowhere.

231
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,166
Just right here
and right now.

232
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,083
There's nothing else for us.

233
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,208
Dreams are an illusion.

234
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,000
They just blur
your view of reality.

235
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,666
Yo, it's me.

236
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,458
Lizzie. What is it?

237
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,708
Well, Zwei.

238
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,125
I've got a message for you.

239
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,333
From Clo.

240
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,625
She wants you at her house,
eight o'clock.

241
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,625
That's pretty short notice.

242
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,000
Is something going on?

243
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,500
We're switching shifts.

244
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,375
I have this big hoopla
to attend tonight,

245
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,833
so it was decided that you'll be
guarding Clo in my place.

246
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,458
You can handle that, can't you?

247
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,958
I don't think so.

248
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,125
We already have
our orders for tonight.

249
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,875
What?
No one told me.

250
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,291
Who gave you those orders?

251
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,375
Scythe Master.

252
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,500
He must be acting
out on his own again.

253
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,208
Not like
that matters to you much,

254
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,458
Clo being your boss and all.

255
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,875
- But.
- Eight o'clock.

256
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,708
Don't forget.

257
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,666
It's alright, you should go.

258
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,083
Ein...

259
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,166
I'll carry out the mission
given by Master alone.

260
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,625
I've done it before.

261
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,541
You follow Ms. McCunnen's
instructions to the letter.

262
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,666
You sure?
It's not safe.

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,916
I'll be fine.

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,958
You'll be doing it alone.

265
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,916
It's not up to us.

266
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,125
We don't decide any of this.

267
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,083
Yes. It seems that he's been
doing quite a bit

268
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
without involving me.

269
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,750
Remember, Scythe Master
isn't a fool, no.

270
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,166
He's just trying to keep
his research secret.

271
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,833
Right.

272
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,083
Then humor his ambitious little
bones under your management.

273
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,916
I'm sure you can
make it work for you.

274
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,166
You can take the car
that we have hidden

275
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,000
on Fifth Avenue.

276
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,083
Okay.

277
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,583
I don't care if it's money
or drugs or whatever.

278
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,833
Just let him have his way.

279
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,291
But once he goes beyond
those things...

280
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,500
Once he crosses the line,
I will step in

281
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,916
and fulfill my duty.

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,833
I will bury Scythe.

283
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,041
Along with his little puppet.

284
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,125
Ein...

285
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,791
be careful.

286
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,250
You be careful, too.

287
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
[Music]

288
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,791
If I come to know my past...

289
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,833
If I come to know
about myself,

290
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,041
I'm not sure I can
continue to be myself.
