[Music]

2
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,666
Five million dollars.

3
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,416
Disrespecting my yard,

4
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
and taking five goddamn
million of my dollars?

5
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,166
There's got to be some penalties
for that type of shit.

6
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,541
Find who's responsible
and drag his sorry ass to me.

7
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,750
I wanna deal with him
personally.

8
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,041
But if there's
gonna be some commotion,

9
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,083
drop him.

10
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,833
Oh my god, thanks, Reiji.

11
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,208
It's silly,

12
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,375
but it's always been
a fantasy of mine to do this.

13
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,458
I've always wanted to order
a mountain of burgers

14
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,958
to pile up on the table,

15
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,833
and pig out, ya know?

16
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,625
Yeah.

17
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,000
So, Cal, the thing we were
talking about earlier.

18
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,791
The guy that killed Judy,
you see him?

19
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,750
So I've been thinking about it.

20
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,750
How are we gonna
take care of these guys?

21
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,916
Huh?

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,958
I mean, if you're really
gonna take revenge

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,541
for Judy's murder for me,
how you gonna do it?

24
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,916
These are the kinda guys

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,458
that probably carry
Uzis and stuff.

26
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,875
Don't think I can handle it?

27
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,000
You don't look
like the hero type to me.

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,833
Yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,458
I'm used to that by now.

30
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,166
But you won't have to worry.

31
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,958
I'm not gonna be the one
who's gonna do the job anyway,

32
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll ask a friend of mine
to handle it.

33
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,541
Oh, really?

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,541
Yep.

35
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,875
You really have a friend
like that?

36
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,583
I'm actually a pretty
well-connected guy.

37
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,750
And as soon as
you spill the beans

38
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,458
and tell us
who we're after,

39
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,833
my friend's
gonna hunt him down,

40
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,666
and make sure his heart
stops its beating problem.

41
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,625
So tell me,
what does this guy look like?

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,125
When it's done,
I wanna be there.

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,541
What?

44
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,083
I wanna see it happen myself.
It'd mean a lot to me.

45
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,083
Please, Reiji, please
let me be there when it happens.

46
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,083
No way.

47
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,083
Aw, come on.

48
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,250
I'll ask
your friend myself

49
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,250
if you're nervous
about it or something.

50
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,958
Pretty please?

51
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,625
Little girls don't need
to get involved with that stuff.

52
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,875
But...

53
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,291
There's no way in hell.

54
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,833
Hey, listen, I'm sorry,
but I can't.

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,250
Okay, you win.

56
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
I'll do it.

57
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,833
I promise I'll ask my friend
if that'll be cool with them.

58
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,041
You will?

59
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,458
Yeah, but...

60
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
So once the meeting
with your friend is set up,

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,791
I'll tell ya
what they look like.

62
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,416
Just to let you know,

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,625
it may take me
a little bit of time

64
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,833
to get in touch
with the right person.

65
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,291
But I'll see if
I can track 'em down tonight.

66
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,291
I'll talk to you
again tomorrow.

67
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,333
Uhh, tomorrow, huh?

68
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,291
Yeah, you busy or something?

69
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,625
Well, we were
a few months behind

70
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,000
on our rent
at the apartment,

71
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,625
and the landlord kinda
kicked me out this morning.

72
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,666
But maybe I can stay
at your place?

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
So what's up, Lizzie?

74
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,000
How is the detective work going?

75
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,875
Any leads?

76
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,958
Phantom's busy checking out
the roommate's story.

77
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,541
And I'm seeing
if I can find some eyeballs.

78
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,625
But, it may take a little while.

79
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,833
I'm looking forward
to getting this figured out.

80
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,541
Who in the hell screwed this up?

81
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,208
I have to get
the Godos behind me

82
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,083
to get more leverage
in Inferno.

83
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,791
I can't let this bullshit
get in the way.

84
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,875
Ahhh, so this is your place,
huh?

85
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,541
It's kinda depressing.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,166
It does me just fine
for what I need out of it.

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,875
It's totally empty!

88
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,666
Yeah.

89
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,416
What are you doing?

90
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,791
We don't want these burgers
to go to waste, do we?

91
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,291
I guess not.

92
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,416
But are you threatening
to stay here

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
until they're all gone?

94
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,916
Say what?

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,875
Nothing.

96
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,541
The bedroom's over there.

97
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm fine with you
getting this bed.

98
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,208
Did someone else
used to live with you?

99
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,125
Why?

100
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,708
Oh, just a hunch.

101
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,041
Yeah, a long time ago.

102
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,416
Girlfriend?

103
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,666
No.

104
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
Hey, Reiji?

105
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,500
Hmm?

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,625
Can I... use your shower?

107
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,416
So uh...

108
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,333
You want me to pretend to be
this gangsta friend of yours?

109
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,833
Yeah, do you mind?

110
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,166
Well, I certainly wouldn't mind
you owing me a favor.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,541
You think this girl
really knows anything

112
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,666
about what happened?

113
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,333
I dunno.

114
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,041
Well then, what in the hell
are you doing with her?

115
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,541
Hey, Reiji!

116
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,708
Sorry!
I forgot to get a stupid towel.

117
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,208
Yeah, hold on.

118
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,375
What now?

119
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,666
I just think it's funny
that the notorious Phantom

120
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,750
is getting house trained
by a little girl!

121
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,166
Now, just because
y'all are having a sleepover--

122
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,083
He hung up on me.

123
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,041
So there must be
some kinda reason

124
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,625
why you've been diggin' around
in my backyard.

125
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,000
Right? Is there?

126
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,833
Wow, really?

127
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,625
Yep. My friend said
they'd do it for us.

128
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,833
We should hear from them
some time tomorrow.

129
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,041
Thanks a lot.

130
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,041
Hey, Reiji?

131
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,208
You got a family?

132
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,291
Family?

133
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,166
They're in heaven.

134
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,958
Oh, yeah?

135
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,166
Yeah.

136
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,208
So you're like me.

137
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,041
Your folks too, huh?

138
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,041
I don't know for sure.

139
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,333
I ran away from
my lyin' sack a crap father.

140
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,125
A little while after that,
Judy took me in.

141
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,916
If It wasn't for her, I think
I'd probably be dead by now.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,083
That's tough, sorry, Cal.

143
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,125
The way I see it,
she's the only family I got.

144
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,875
But now...

145
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,791
now she's dead.

146
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:51,916
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,583
It's fine.

148
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,000
Since I don't have her anymore,

149
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,583
I don't know where to go.

150
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,750
I just feel so lost.

151
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,333
I really don't know
what the heck to do.

152
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,375
I know.

153
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,916
I felt the same way.

154
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,541
It's a part of life,
everybody dies.

155
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,708
Some people suffer
for a long, long time.

156
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,625
And some people go
with no one to remember them.

157
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,833
But no matter what happened,
Judy has you to remember her.

158
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,041
She's lucky in that way.

159
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,250
You think so?

160
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
Yeah.

161
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,958
You really think so?

162
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,750
Yeah.

163
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,583
I don't know where to go.

164
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,125
I just feel so lost.

165
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,250
I really don't know
what the heck to do.

166
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
I believe
you have a house guest.

167
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,541
My witness.

168
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,416
I gotta say, man,

169
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,375
this place could really use
some jazzin' up,

170
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,291
some pictures and shit.

171
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,166
What the hell do you want?

172
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,375
Now don't be
such a wet blanket.

173
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,833
I just ran into
this fine sister

174
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,208
diggin' around
on my property,

175
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,666
looking for some kinda dirt
or story or something.

176
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,125
And I'll be damned
if she didn't have

177
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,375
some really interesting things
to talk about.

178
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,083
Now let me talk to my witness.

179
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,166
I gotta feeling
she'll tell me what she knows.

180
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,250
She in there?

181
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,916
The girl doesn't know anything.

182
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,041
Move it.

183
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,791
There's no way in hell
she could make the shooter

184
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,041
in that dark of a place.

185
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,625
If she says she saw him,
she's lying.

186
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,666
Move.

187
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,250
You deaf?

188
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,833
Hold on.

189
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,333
Shit!

190
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,125
Don't tell me that Phantom
is actually gonna go

191
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,916
toe to toe with me
over some triflin' little girl?

192
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,625
I must say you got me
even more intrigued now.

193
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,083
You know, I had a funny feeling
about this whole thing.

194
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,291
You and Claudia are playing
some kinda backroom game, huh.

195
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,583
No, sir.

196
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,916
Ten A.M. tomorrow.

197
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,541
Come to the base.

198
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,583
You can tell your whole little
story to me and McGuire.

199
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,458
And if you're
blowin' smoke then,

200
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,708
we're gonna have to
find the truth the hard way.

201
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,916
Sorry about that.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,708
I just couldn't act
like I didn't know anything.

203
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,041
It's cool.

204
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,958
But doesn't this
screw things up?

205
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,750
What the hell are you gonna
tell the bosses tomorrow?

206
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,208
Don't worry, I'll think
of something to tell them.

207
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,333
So you think
she doesn't know, huh?

208
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,458
No, I'm sure she doesn't.

209
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,583
Alright then.

210
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,875
You don't know anything,

211
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,833
nothing at all,
right, Cal?

212
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,791
But you'll tell me
your story, won't ya?

213
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,833
That night...

214
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:55,625
Judy?

215
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,583
Judy!

216
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,291
That's what happened.

217
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,416
I figured as much.

218
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,750
You figured what?

219
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,208
That I didn't see anything?

220
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,625
That guy that was here...

221
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,875
That's Isaac Wisemel,
isn't it?

222
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,291
That's the guy who runs
the Bloodies gang, right?

223
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,875
Yeah.

224
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,000
Reiji...

225
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,166
why did you wanna
protect me from him?

226
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,000
I heard what they called you.

227
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,375
They called you Phantom.

228
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
I know who that is.

229
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,666
Judy's friends told me

230
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,291
he's someone that goes around
and kills gangsters.

231
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,375
Does that mean
you're a real assassin?

232
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,291
You really are, aren't you?

233
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,708
You're the assassin Phantom.

234
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,083
Yeah, that's me.

235
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,625
Hey...

236
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,750
Holy...

237
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,250
It's the money those
Japanese guys were carrying.

238
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,791
Five million dollars.

239
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,333
Holy crap, Cal!
Did you steal it?

240
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,083
No, I didn't!
I swear I didn't!

241
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,125
I don't want anything to do
with this dirty money!

242
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,583
I was hoping I'd find someone.

243
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,583
Someone I could pay
to help me.

244
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,166
You're the Phantom, Reiji?

245
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,333
You really are?

246
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,958
I'll give you
all of this damn money

247
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,250
if you kill them for me.

248
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
The guy in the alley.

249
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,041
The guy with the gun.

250
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
The guy who was
supposed to get the money.

251
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,750
Kill everybody that had anything
to do with Judy's murder.

252
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,833
Will you do it for me?

253
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,500
We'll discuss my fee
for the job tomorrow.

254
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,291
Let's sleep on it for now.

255
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,583
I lied to you, I'm sorry.

256
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,666
Yeah, me too.

257
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,916
This situation
has gone from bad to worse.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,291
We still don't know
who the shooter is.

259
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,833
And I have five million
sitting on my coffee table.

260
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,708
If word gets out
that I've got their cash,

261
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,791
Inferno is not gonna be
happy about it.

262
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,291
Kill everybody that had anything
to do with Judy's murder.

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,208
What the hell am I gonna do?

264
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,583
How can I make Cal happy
without pissing off Inferno?

265
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,916
Would you care to tell me
what's going on?

266
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I shouldn't really
talk about it now.

267
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,833
If he sees the two of us
talking alone like this,

268
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,958
Isaac will get suspicious.

269
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,416
I'm gonna explain myself
in front of everyone.

270
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,166
Now I believe you have

271
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,166
something of interest
to share, Phantom.

272
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,583
Yes, sir.

273
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,125
First, I need to clear up
a small misunderstanding.

274
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,166
A misunderstanding, you say?

275
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,500
Now it is true
that I'm sheltering

276
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,916
an alleged witness
to the other night's incident.

277
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,208
But she's just a family member

278
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,291
of the woman that was killed
in the crossfire,

279
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,666
and has no
relevant information.

280
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh? And you're sure?

281
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,791
With the title "Phantom"

282
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,000
comes skills
for discovering the truth.

283
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,458
Sounds like bullshit to me.

284
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,583
I can't say
that I'm convinced.

285
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,666
Do you have any evidence
to back up your assertion?

286
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,916
Did you use any truth serum?

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,083
No.

288
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,625
Any recorded data?

289
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,125
None.

290
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,541
So my colleague is right,

291
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,708
and we are just to
trust you at word?

292
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,541
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,416
Not good enough for me, no way.

294
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,083
What are your thoughts, Claudia?

295
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,166
That's all, Phantom?

296
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,958
Trust me,
I have my reasons

297
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,250
for not using a truth serum.

298
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,666
Do your reasons
run deep enough

299
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,208
to excuse
why you pulled out a weapon

300
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,708
in the presence of Isaac?

301
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,916
Yes, sir.

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,333
Then illuminate me.

303
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,666
It's simple.

304
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,625
I didn't wanna damage her
any further.

305
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,375
So now you're some kind of
humanitarian or something?

306
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,416
No, sir.

307
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,333
I didn't wanna put the potential
that I saw in her

308
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,083
in any kind of jeopardy.

309
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,708
I see a further use
for this girl.

310
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,291
Do tell.

311
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,541
Well, sir...

312
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,750
She seems to possess
some rare qualities.

313
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,791
They may even be called
talents.

314
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,416
This girl has an intense
motivation to kill.

315
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,250
And an intense solitude.

316
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,250
A ghost
haunting this world alone.

317
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,500
Is that so?

318
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,708
I seem to recall hearing
similar things in the past.

319
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,833
I see.

320
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,208
You'd like to take
this girl in

321
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,791
and train her
in the ways of an assassin?

322
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,583
Yes.

323
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,583
If you'll allow it,

324
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,833
I'll personally train
this girl

325
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,708
so that she can serve
as my own right hand.

326
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,208
What proof do you have
she possesses such talent?

327
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,958
Just a hunch.

328
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,583
I am sick and tired
of hearing this crap!

329
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,666
I can't really
put it into words,

330
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,583
but I believe it's true.

331
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,541
It may be hard for you
to take it on faith alone,

332
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,250
but it doesn't change it.

333
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,125
You got a big mouth, son.

334
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,958
I have just one question.

335
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,125
If you're willing to go this far
to gain a new assistant,

336
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,375
are you saying you're displeased
with your current situation?

337
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,208
Your pairing with Lizzie?

338
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,916
Well, I can't say that we're
a match made in heaven.

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,708
The whole "partner" thing
has always seemed

340
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,958
just a little bit forced
to me.

341
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,375
He's a freaking genius,
and I'm just pretty good.

342
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,083
If he thinks this new girl
will work out better for him,

343
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,708
then she should take my place
whenever she's ready.

344
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,500
I ain't crying.

345
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,541
In regards to the prostitute
killed along with the Yakuza,

346
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,958
a Miss Judy Devens was her name,
if I'm not mistaken.

347
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,750
Are you certain
she had no larger role

348
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,916
in the incident?

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,708
Yeah. Just unlucky.

350
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,500
Wrong place and time.

351
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,500
Sir, I checked up
on her background myself.

352
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,916
Well, Isaac,
what do you think?

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
I still think
the whole thing stinks.

354
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,166
I will allow it for now.

355
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,500
Don't fail me.

356
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,291
Sir.

357
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:52,791
Phantom, I eagerly await
your report.

358
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,875
Quite an interesting
performance, Reiji.

359
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,458
I don't buy that act
for a goddamn second.

360
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,416
I'll be watching you, boy.

361
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,416
This may fly with Claudia,
but not with me.

362
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,708
Sorry about that.

363
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,083
Don't worry.

364
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,958
Sorry I caved to Isaac.

365
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,541
So now what?

366
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,291
Why don't you tell me?

367
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,375
There's no way in hell

368
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,666
you wanna make more people
like you.

369
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
You lied to them
to protect her, right?

370
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,166
You know, because of
that hard sales pitch,

371
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,583
it's gonna be your ass
that's on the line.

372
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
I know.

373
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,791
[Music]

374
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,458
After the meeting,

375
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,541
everything's
still totally up in the air.

376
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,583
The shooter...

377
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,750
The five mil...

378
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,000
Payback for Judy...

379
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,625
What the hell do I do?

380
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,458
[Music]

381
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,583
The girl's a natural.

382
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,791
But still,
does that make it alright

383
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:47,250
to lead her down
this same bloody path?
