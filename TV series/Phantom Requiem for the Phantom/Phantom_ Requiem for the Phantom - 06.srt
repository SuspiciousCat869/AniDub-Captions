[Music]

2
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,208
I kill people with this hand...

3
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,708
and I eat with this hand.

4
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,958
There isn't any difference...

5
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,916
I do both these things...

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
so I can live.

7
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,916
That's how life is...

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,666
we kill to eat.

9
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,083
Hey.

10
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,083
Sorry for your loss,
it's a real shame.

11
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
What the hell, Gant?

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,791
You have no right to be here!

13
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,416
Be careful, Tony.

14
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,791
Okay?

15
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,083
I don't know what you mean.

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,958
Yeah, you're innocent.

18
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,750
Try not to forget I've known
the lot of you boys

19
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,875
ever since you were
snotty little brats.

20
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,333
I know more than you think.

21
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,333
I can see it in your eyes.

22
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,041
You're looking
for a bloodbath.

23
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,833
Tony...

24
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,875
don't be stupid.

25
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,916
I've always got my eyes on you.

26
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,541
Are we gonna finish this?

27
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,750
Yes.

28
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,208
We will destroy Inferno.

29
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,000
This isn't just revenge.

30
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,666
We'll do it
to protect the family.

31
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,666
But with that asshole Gant
practically stalking us,

32
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291
we need to be careful.

33
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,833
I have an idea.

34
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,500
There is a way to rid ourselves
of them forever.

35
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,125
And we won't even have to
dirty our hands in the process.

36
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,833
The way I understand it,

37
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,541
Inferno is made up of wiseguys
trying to buck their bosses

38
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,833
and join hands
with their enemies.

39
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,041
I put together a list of guys
who would seem

40
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,708
to benefit the most by cutting
their family affiliations

41
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,208
and joining up with
these other back stabbers.

42
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,708
Richard Harrington...

43
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,666
Carlo Mendoza...

44
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,166
These are made guys.

45
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,333
Are you saying they're goin'
against their own families?

46
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,333
And if we dig up evidence
that confirms my hunch,

47
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,208
they'll all be history.

48
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,583
Any mafia organization
would take exception

49
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,666
to that kind of disloyalty.

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,208
They're spitting
on the code of conduct.

51
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,000
So they'll be sent to hell
by their families.

52
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,416
Yeah.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,125
Freakin' brilliant, Tony.

54
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,000
Anton, I'll leave
the arrangements to you.

55
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,333
Stay close to them
and reveal their true colors

56
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,541
to their families.

57
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,208
But, be cautious.

58
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,458
Good morning, Ms. McCunnen.

59
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,041
You're looking
just as beautiful as always.

60
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,958
Why are you here?

61
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,500
I asked him to come.

62
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,916
He has informative opinions
based on a unique insight.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,625
I think we can learn quite a bit
from listening to him.

64
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,750
In fact, I plan on
having him participate

65
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,458
in future executive
meetings as a regular.

66
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,333
You don't have
any issues with that, do you?

67
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,458
No, sir.

68
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,166
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

69
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,875
The reason I called
this meeting today,

70
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,750
is to inform you of Tony Stone's
latest actions.

71
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,000
Stone?

72
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,750
Our message
didn't quite hit home enough?

73
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,208
I've obtained information
he's been spying on us.

74
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,291
I suspected
I had an annoying fly

75
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,375
buzzing around me recently.

76
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,583
So he was sent by
Tony the Stone of all people.

77
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,416
I guess that signal
we sent him the other day

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
did not have
the desired effect.

79
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,250
Seems like he's trying
to play it cool

80
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,458
and not just hitting us
right back.

81
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,500
He's trying to figure out
if we have a weak point.

82
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,458
Obviously he needs
to be taken care of.

83
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,833
However,
that was not the plan.

84
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,375
We originally
wanted to take over

85
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,916
the Stone family's territory

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,083
without turning it
into a battlefield.

87
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,083
So then what do you suggest
we do, Scythe?

88
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,666
The odds of a man like
Tony Stone behaving rashly,

89
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,833
well, they would have to be
a one in a million chance,

90
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,666
wouldn't they?

91
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,625
Yes, that's true.

92
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,541
Scythe, what do you
have in mind?

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,625
She's been gone awhile.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,333
It's too dangerous.

95
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,625
We could never guarantee
something like that.

96
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,166
Oh, we could,
if we used the Phantom.

97
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,166
I would imagine
she's proven herself to you

98
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,416
many times over by now.

99
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,833
She has.

100
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,208
And although this is
a bigger "production"

101
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,000
than we've done before,

102
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,958
she has been able to pull off
some pretty impressive stuff

103
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
for us in the past.

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,125
We may have a shot at making
this thing work.

105
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,291
I'd like to hear your thoughts
on this, Mr. McGuire.

106
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,541
You certainly seem to possess
an innate ability to know

107
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,958
when you should promote
your talent, don't you?

108
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,875
Yes, I do.

109
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,916
Fine then.

110
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,791
Why don't we take a chance
on that confidence of yours,

111
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,666
Scythe Master.

112
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,916
Good, Ein.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,458
Wonderful.

114
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,083
You really are
a brilliant subject.

115
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,625
This meaningless world
filled with confusion,

116
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,916
is going to be changed
by my will.

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,250
A new order,
a new balance.

118
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,083
I will orchestrate it all.

119
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,833
In this performance,

120
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,833
God Himself watches
from the balcony.

121
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:39,500
You are my lead, Ein,
my precious prima donna.

122
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,416
The meeting?

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,666
Did it go okay?

124
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,500
This is for
our next operation.

125
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,083
You can go over it thoroughly
later.

126
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,500
This time it's a series
of missions.

127
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,541
Many targets,
12 of them.

128
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,125
You serious?

129
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,166
All of them in one night?

130
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,500
Our individual missions
really aren't that difficult.

131
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,833
We just have to time things
carefully,

132
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,500
and focus on being
perfectly in sync.

133
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,541
So, these guys
are all senior members

134
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,458
of Inferno's rivals?

135
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,500
If this succeeds,
the power balance

136
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,833
on the West Coast is
gonna change significantly.

137
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,125
I dunno.

138
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,000
Doesn't it seem
kinda hasty to you?

139
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,000
Remember,
that is none of your concern.

140
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,375
But don't you think
it's natural

141
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,750
to wanna know why?

142
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,708
Did somebody tell you
that it was?

143
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,416
You shouldn't bother.

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,125
It doesn't have anything to do
with our way of existing.

145
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,166
What is our way of existing?

146
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,208
Do you know?

147
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,166
Be a tool,

148
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,375
be an instrument.

149
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,458
All we need to do
is just function.

150
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,375
Don't think about
unnecessary things.

151
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,041
How can you just say it
like that?

152
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,541
I'm only thinking.

153
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,333
That doesn't
hurt anything, does it?

154
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,583
We'll be destroyed...

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,375
destroyed.

156
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
Both of us.

157
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,416
I'm pleased to see

158
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,208
that everything's prepared
so promptly.

159
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,166
Don't give me that
silly smile, you son of a bitch.

160
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,000
This so-called plan of yours
is hardly an operation...

161
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,125
it's a joke.

162
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,750
You're putting me
and my whole team in danger.

163
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,500
Whatever do you mean?

164
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,166
I simply have confidence
in your team's abilities.

165
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,625
And another thing,
why are you insisting

166
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,291
on running this show
all by yourself

167
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,750
like you own the damn place?

168
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,666
Where's Clo, anyway?

169
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,083
Claudia had a matter

170
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,791
that required
her personal attention.

171
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,333
So...

172
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,458
I'll be acting in her stead.

173
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,541
Listen, Slimeball,
I'd do anything for Claudia,

174
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,875
no matter
how dangerous it was.

175
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,541
But I don't know why the hell
I should risk my life

176
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,541
for your sorry ass.

177
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,541
We will be having
more and more

178
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,833
of this type of operation,
you know.

179
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,458
I hate to tell you this,
but you may have to rethink

180
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,500
your future plans,
Miss Garland.

181
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,541
But such is life.

182
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,250
Lizzie, it's time!

183
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,708
We gotta get outta here.

184
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,500
Let's go.

185
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,500
We should go.

186
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,750
Right.

187
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,541
Great seeing you again,
have a good time.

188
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,708
Phase one, complete.

189
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,500
Roger, phase two, starting.

190
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,708
Now, hurry!
He's headed for the exit!

191
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,625
Search that way!

192
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,666
I got him!
Over here!

193
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,041
Who is this guy?

194
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,333
I know I've seen him
somewhere before.

195
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,791
I think he worked
as a bouncer

196
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,958
in one of Tony Stone's
strip clubs.

197
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,583
The Stone Family?

198
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,041
Why did they come
after the old man?

199
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,375
Those bastards!

200
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,083
Yeah, doesn't look like
Carlo's doing anything

201
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,416
special tonight.

202
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,750
Just stuffin' his face
at some high roller joint.

203
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,833
That guy's a real piece of work,
if you ask me.

204
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,041
Yes, sir, I understand.

205
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,875
Right. Okay.

206
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,666
I'll talk to you
on the next scheduled call then.

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,750
What's going on?

208
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,000
With regards to
the Ahlen Construction murder,

209
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,750
there's a rumor
that a local mafia family

210
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,625
was involved in the killing.

211
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,375
So, it remains highly likely
that this is a fight

212
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,208
between rival syndicates.

213
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:50,916
I see.

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,458
Oh, yes.

215
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,625
According to the information
we just received,

216
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,583
a gunfight has caused
a fatal accident.

217
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,291
We have someone on the PCH
now reporting to us live.

218
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,500
Perhaps they can
shed some light

219
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,291
on this terrible tragedy.

220
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,291
Typical media overreaction,
huh.

221
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,750
This night has just begun.

222
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,291
What are you trying to say,
Ms. McCunnen?

223
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,458
There's gonna be more?

224
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,041
Tonight's bloodshed
is just the beginning.

225
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,500
You see,
from this evening on,

226
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,291
it is truly going to be
a new era.

227
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,500
We should celebrate.

228
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,583
Let's toast
the survival of the fittest.

229
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,750
It's a world where
any dream is possible

230
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,708
if you have the power,
Mr. Godo.

231
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,708
Would that way of life
appeal to you?

232
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,791
Anton, what the hell
is going on?

233
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,041
Where's Abel and Bark?

234
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,875
Why the hell
aren't they responding!

235
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,333
Don't they know we're
in the middle of a goddamn war?

236
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,833
They're all dead by now, Tony.

237
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,625
Like a bullet, each one of them
left their mark.

238
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,875
I'm sure they're satisfied.

239
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,958
Wait.
What do you mean?

240
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Are you saying
Bark and the others

241
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,500
are behind those bosses
getting whacked tonight?

242
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,833
Well, that's what everyone's
gonna believe.

243
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,125
After all, dead men can't
answer questions, can they?

244
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,500
A theory you can test.

245
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,041
Anton! Why?

246
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,583
Don't you get it?

247
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,583
No, I guess you wouldn't,
you never waver.

248
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,208
You're Tony the Stone.

249
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,666
You done good, kid,
real good.

250
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,083
Yeah, and finally,
I'll be able

251
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,375
to get out
of this filthy town.

252
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,791
I've been waiting 25 years
to break free

253
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,083
from this cesspool.

254
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,541
It's all over now.

255
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,583
Retiring already?
So young.

256
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,291
I received a pretty
substantial pay-off

257
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,291
from Inferno.

258
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,791
I can buy
a nice little cottage

259
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,833
or something on a beach
in the Caribbean.

260
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,583
What was your cut?

261
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,916
My first promotion
in 15 years.

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I mean,
when you think about it,

263
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,750
I did single-handedly
end a mafia war.

264
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,000
You did.

265
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,791
Looks like we'll both have
a long life to look forward to.

266
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,250
An era came to a sad end
yesterday.

267
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,250
The six men
who had long controlled

268
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,500
the criminal underworld for
the entirety of the West Coast

269
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,000
were all tragically killed.

270
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,625
Tony Stone was considered to be
the mastermind of it all,

271
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,958
and the law ended up
bringing him to justice.

272
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,666
Having lost their leaders,

273
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,250
each organization
will be led to the new era

274
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,500
by our friends and brethren.

275
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Under the banner of Inferno.

276
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,041
Splendid!

277
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,416
It's a miracle,

278
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,416
and we can attribute it all
to your Phantom.

279
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,625
Pleased to be of service.

280
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,875
Lieutenant Cyrus Gant,
received an award

281
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,500
from the Mayor earlier today
for his contribution

282
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,916
in resolving the mafia war,

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,750
a conflict that shook
the heart of this city.

284
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,958
Melanie Square entrepreneur
and gang leader, Tony Stone,

285
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,208
was behind...

286
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,458
So Ein, do people
actually believe

287
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,166
that's what happened
to those men?

288
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,333
You'll find people don't really
care about the truth.

289
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,250
They're not even interested.

290
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,500
...was brought to an end

291
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,333
by Lt. Gant's heroic actions.

292
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,458
I wonder
if anyone will pray

293
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,625
for the people
that died that day.

294
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,666
I wonder who'll
atone for that sin.

295
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,500
There is neither
prayer nor atonement.

296
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,833
Death is the end
of everything.

297
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,916
It doesn't matter
what you do after that.

298
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,625
There's no point.

299
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,416
[Music]

300
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,583
There is nothing...

301
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,500
dreams are just illusions.

302
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,541
All they do,
is get in your way.
