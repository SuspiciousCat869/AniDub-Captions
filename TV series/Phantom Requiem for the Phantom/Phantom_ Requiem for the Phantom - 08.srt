2
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,666
Could I be excused
from guard duty,

3
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,375
just for tonight?

4
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,375
I have some
important business.

5
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,208
And what if...

6
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,416
I had more important business?

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,166
What is it?

8
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,375
You're kidding.

9
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,000
Here.

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,958
I thought you might want
your passport.

11
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,958
Your identity,

12
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,750
your name,

13
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,583
and your past.

[Music]

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,708
Ein...

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,583
Be careful.

17
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't know.

18
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,708
How could I have known.

19
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,625
The fate that was
about to unfold.

20
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,833
The future that lay ahead.

21
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,708
It's okay to look.

22
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,291
Are you afraid of
getting your past back?

23
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,583
No, I dunno.

24
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,791
It's just that I've been
killing people

25
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,416
for the organization
for so long now.

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Yes, and you've been
extraordinarily helpful.

27
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,083
The thing is,
I was able to do that

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,708
because I have no past
or memories to cloud my mind.

29
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,208
It allowed you
to follow orders

30
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,750
like a machine,

31
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,666
feeling no guilt or remorse
for your actions.

32
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,916
If you get back
to your true self,

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,041
that guilt could rise up
and eat you alive.

34
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,791
Which is precisely
what you're afraid of.

35
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:51,333
But, that's why I want you
to know yourself,

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:55,416
what exists inside you,
to know your own will.

37
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,375
My will.

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,958
Distance: 249 yards,

39
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,958
with low intensity gusts of wind
from the south.

40
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,000
Restore your true self.

41
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,916
Then, and only then, can you
accept yourself, as Zwei.

42
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,833
How goddamn selfish!

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,958
Your organization
erases my mind...

44
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,416
it forces me to do things
that make me a murderer...

45
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,333
and now you want me to--

46
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,791
It's a revolution.

47
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,291
Our organization
is going through changes.

48
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,375
Soon, it will be reborn.

49
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,875
And when that happens...

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,750
Zwei, I want you.

51
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,625
See? No matter
how capable you are,

52
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,750
I need someone who is
more than just a puppet

53
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,125
who can only do
what he's told.

54
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,583
I need you to be
something of a partner.

55
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,416
A subordinate still
of course,

56
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,083
but one I can trust.

57
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,875
One who'll follow me
of his own free will.

58
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,083
If I come to know who I was,

59
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:18,291
I don't know
if I can stay who I am.

60
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm sure you can.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,333
My job is to back up
the assault.

62
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,875
The people I see in front of me
are just targets.

63
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,583
Shit! Who are those guys?

64
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,916
The truck!

65
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,041
Damn! A sniper!

66
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,416
We did it!

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,458
It may be too early
to celebrate.

68
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,958
Just step on it.

69
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
Right.

70
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,708
So you think you can
trap us all down here.

71
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,000
You sure got some balls.

72
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,833
Read the name out loud.

73
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,625
Azuma.

74
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,875
Reiji.

75
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,416
You remember now?

76
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,875
That's right, I do.

77
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,208
I was traveling, and then...

78
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,166
I've killed...

79
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,416
so many...

80
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
with my own hands.

81
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,125
Because I just...

82
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,291
I just wanted to live.

83
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,333
Oh God, I wish I didn't know.

84
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,500
I told you,

85
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,708
I don't need someone
who's just a puppet.

86
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,208
Wake up from your dream.

87
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,250
You can become you again.

88
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,583
Your past, your guilt,
you have to accept it,

89
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,916
all of it,
and face your own will.

90
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,125
Reiji Azuma.

91
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,958
Phantom.

92
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,750
Goddamn Scythe!

93
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,791
What do you want from me?

94
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,958
I want you to come with me,

95
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,791
but, of your own free will.

96
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,958
There's someone right here
before you who needs your help.

97
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,041
Because this is where
you belong.

98
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,000
And if you're willing to have
more blood on your hands,

99
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,750
if you believe
your soul has the strength

100
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,166
to bear mortal sins with me,

101
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,625
I can promise to give you
a wonderful future.

102
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,250
Since you have free will,

103
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,916
that means the other choice
is available to you as well.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,666
What choice?

105
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,416
The other one.

106
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,916
You know what it is.

107
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,833
Going back home?

108
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,583
If that's truly what you desire
above all things,

109
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,208
I can make
a special case for you.

110
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,000
You may doubt
what I'm saying to you,

111
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,916
but I'm serious.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,166
I will let you go back, promise.

113
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,875
Listen Reiji, I want you
to think for yourself,

114
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,166
no matter where
it may lead you.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,916
Are you crazy?

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,375
You're shooting
your own people!

117
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,666
I don't care if Scythe
ordered you to do this.

118
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,750
Stop being his goddamn puppet!

119
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,500
You can't escape from here!

120
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,750
Think about it!

121
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,541
You know that old man's
just using you

122
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,166
as his little pawn, don't you?

123
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,083
Going back,

124
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,041
back to Japan.

125
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,750
I know this has to be
a big decision.

126
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,916
So I'll give you some time,

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,333
time to think about it.

128
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,041
Hello,
this is the Azuma residence.

129
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,916
Hello?

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,250
Is anyone there?

131
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,125
Hello?

132
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,916
Hello?

133
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,041
I can never go back.

134
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,416
Never.

135
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,875
Find her!

136
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,125
I can't believe
that bastard Scythe.

137
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,166
His little zombie
just dropped some of our boys.

138
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,416
We'll give him a fitting sendoff
after the final curtain.

139
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,791
Not forgetting our Phantom.

140
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,833
Ein, what the hell?

141
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,875
Did you come out here
to kill me?

142
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,750
What do you mean?

143
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,041
You don't know anything?

144
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,041
Good.

145
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,583
Then go back
to the organization.

146
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,541
If you show up alone...

147
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,750
Ein!

148
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,958
Ein?

149
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,958
It's me.

150
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,416
We've had a change of plans.

151
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,833
Scythe has betrayed
the organization.

152
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,833
He used Phantom
to attack Inferno's shipment.

153
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,833
Of course,
he vanished immediately.

154
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,583
Phantom's on the run, too.

155
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,791
Lizzie managed to get
a shot in, thankfully.

156
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,666
The organization is pouring
all its resources

157
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,833
into hunting
both of them down.

158
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,333
As of now,
we don't have a lead on either.

159
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,875
Inferno suspects
that you've betrayed them too,

160
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,625
but I can prove
where you were.

161
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,625
So listen carefully.

162
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,375
You don't have
the luxury of time,

163
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,958
make your decision now.

164
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:10,583
You're either going to
come to me, or not.

165
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,916
So as it stands now:

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,166
Scythe and Phantom
are the enemy.

167
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,541
If you choose
to take their side,

168
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,416
you're dead, that's it.

169
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,583
It won't stop bleeding,
the bullet is still inside.

170
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,541
I gotta get her
to a doctor now.

171
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,958
I can't.

172
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,875
They're probably checking
all the hospitals.

173
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,916
Okay.

174
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,666
Hang in there, please.

175
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,541
All the escape routes
are blocked.

176
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,000
They're birds in a cage.

177
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,166
No one escapes
the organization,

178
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,916
not even
the illustrious Phantom.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,333
Yeah, that's true,

180
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,375
but now that we don't
have Phantom,

181
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,458
who's gonna
hunt down the prey?

182
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,416
Please, Ein.

183
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,208
Don't die.

184
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,375
You got all these people
at your disposal,

185
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,750
and you still can't find them?

186
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,250
The freeway?
Then block it!

187
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,541
Dammit!

188
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,541
I knew I should
just finished that bitch.

189
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,416
Clo, where is he now?

190
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
You mean Zwei?

191
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

192
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,375
A.k.a. Scythe's other lapdog.

193
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,666
He might just take
their side, you know.

194
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,916
If that happens, Lizzie,

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,791
I think
you should take care of him.

196
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,833
Ein...

197
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,000
you know something?

198
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,000
Tonight,
when I saw Ms. McCunnen,

199
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,541
she gave me a passport.

200
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,875
It was my passport.

201
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,125
It brought back
all my memories.

202
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,375
My family.

203
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,416
My home.

204
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,958
I finally had a place
I could go back to.

205
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,291
I also learned
what my real name is.

206
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,333
It's Reiji.

207
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,750
My name is Reiji Azuma.

208
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,166
It's a whole lot
better sounding

209
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,416
than that stupid Zwei,
don't you think?

210
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,291
But what's weird is...

211
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,875
it didn't make me happy.

212
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,000
Now,
I'm a different person.

213
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:24,708
I don't know
if I belong there anymore.

214
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,666
Does that make
going back to the organization

215
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,916
my only choice?

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,500
Maybe you and I could
go back together, Ein.

217
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,833
So as it stands now:

218
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,375
Scythe and Phantom
are the enemy.

219
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,750
If you choose
to take their side,

220
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,458
you're dead, that's it.

221
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,125
I won't be able to save you.

222
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,541
No.

223
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,791
If Ein goes back,
she's dead.

224
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:54,791
Then,
I'll just leave her here.

225
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,791
And I'll go back by myself.

226
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,458
What's up?

227
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,125
It's nothing, I guess.

228
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
Don't worry about it.

229
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,875
There's wind.

230
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:33,875
And there's blue, white,
and green.

231
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,375
But that's all there is
in that place.

232
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,958
Nothing else.

233
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,791
All I can ever remember
is the bright lights,

234
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,333
the colors,
and the blustery wind,

235
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,875
the strongest wind I've known.

236
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,000
Ein...

237
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,000
be careful.

238
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
You be careful, too.

239
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,500
Neither one of us had a name.

240
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,458
All we were given
were numbers,

241
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,791
then we were both used
like pawns, like trash.

242
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,708
To hell with it,
with all of it.

243
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,083
To hell with such a meaningless
way of life.

244
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,666
You're awake.

245
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,666
Ein, I will protect you now.

246
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,958
I promise.

247
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,000
I will.

248
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,958
And I'll never
let the organization take you.

249
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,333
Let's go together.

250
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,500
Leave here, leave Inferno.

251
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,000
Reiji.

252
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,750
Ein, let's go, okay?

253
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,833
[Music]

254
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,291
I'll give you a new name.

255
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,416
It won't be like Phantom.

256
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,916
It won't be some number.

257
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It'll be your real name.
