00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,032
[bell chimes]

2
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,037
Thank you for taking
the time to see me.

3
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,623
What a nice little shop this is.

4
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,668
My pleasure, but I should
really be thanking you.

5
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,212
And yes, a friend
recommended this place.

6
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,424
I'm afraid I have
a number of questions.

7
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,302
I'm sure. Of course.

8
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,763
And I have a lot of things
that I'd like to explain.

9
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,402
Feel free to correct
me if I'm wrong,

10
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,530
but you and Kaname had no
clue about that data, right?

11
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,823
True.

12
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,701
Although, it seems
as if you did.

13
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,745
You said that it was
a new drug being developed

14
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,538
by Omori Pharmaceuticals.

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,542
So this SQUARE. What is it?

16
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,294
Please tell me.

17
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,755
[IZUMI] Well, it's a drug
that's closely tied to the DCD's

18
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,298
current investigation.

19
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,385
That's part of why
it's a big deal.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,137
That investigation,
right now, it's...

21
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,599
[SEKI]
Plus‐Zero?

22
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,643
Its official name is SQUARE.

23
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,228
In the sample photo we received,

24
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,689
there were two
tablets in one set.

25
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,441
Well, the good news is,
we can pretty much confirm

26
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,111
just from the reports
Izumi's gathered

27
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:18,448
that SQUARE is what Plus
was directly modeled after.

28
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,534
Which means, we can
be fairly confident

29
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,619
it's the new drug
Omori Pharmaceuticals

30
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,413
was in the process
of developing.

31
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,500
So, apparently
Aoyama was correct.

32
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,210
Congratulations.

33
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,129
Wait, if we already
know that the data needed

34
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,923
to create Plus came
from the Kujo Family,

35
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,217
then doesn't that mean we've
actually caught Mr. Kujo

36
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,135
red‐handed?

37
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,053
That'd be jumping
to conclusions.

38
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,431
We need some real proof first.

39
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,850
We have to keep
this quiet until then.

40
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,601
That includes from Miyase.

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,940
I apologize. I can't say more.

42
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,567
[MIYASE] Do you and your
team really think that

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,153
the Kujo Family
is connected with this?

44
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,489
We do believe that
it's a possibility.

45
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,700
Does this also have
to do with STAND?

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,410
Can you tell me about that?

47
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,911
I'm not...

48
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,663
I'm personally not sure.

49
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,333
I understand.

50
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,671
To be honest...
I have some regrets.

51
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,803
If you and your
team are correct,

52
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,680
then I think I might
need to distance myself

53
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,807
from that house.

54
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,225
But...

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,395
Preparing all his
meals, keeping things clean,

56
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,690
and working hard to make
it so he can sleep well.

57
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,442
I don't think I can change that.

58
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,611
Change my routine.

59
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,529
I'm a little uncertain.

60
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,573
Not quite sure what
I should do here.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,078
[IZUMI] Would you be
willing to help me out?

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,873
That way, if there
are any suspicions,

63
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,709
we can look into it and
gather the proof we need.

64
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,504
That's the whole job of
the DCD in a nutshell.

65
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,380
We just have to keep
searching for the truth

66
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,508
until we find it.

67
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,259
I believe that your
thoughts and opinions

68
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,137
are a vital part of
the evidence we need.

69
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,348
You're one of the
closest people to him.

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,351
So if you truly believe
that Mr. Kujo is innocent,

71
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,480
we have to consider that, along
with all of the other factors.

72
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,317
Bottom line is, we're going
to need your help, Mr. Miyase.

73
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,950
[AOYAMA] You want to officially
ask him to cooperate?

74
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,201
That's right.

75
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,286
It would be nice to get
more internal information

76
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,665
on the Kujo Family, even if
it came with some risks.

77
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,000
But this could end up
hurting you in the end.

78
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,336
Do you feel confident
about Miyase?

79
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes, I do.
I believe it'll be okay.

80
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,011
In that case,
I'll leave this to you.

81
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,099
Why do you seem so surprised?

82
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,226
You came to this
decision on your own.

83
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,813
Just continue to be bold,
as you have been.

84
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,897
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,037
[SHINDO]
Is Mr. Kujo still at the office?

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,205
[MIYASE]
Yes.

87
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,667
Well, that was a disturbingly
lifeless response.

88
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,294
Oh, was it?

89
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,964
Mr. Kujo's condition
refuses to stabilize as is.

90
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,466
You can't collapse on me, too.

91
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,218
I don't know the details,

92
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,596
but I know who he counts
on most around here,

93
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,055
and that is you.

94
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,826
Good to see you.

95
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,202
C'mon, follow me.

96
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,582
[MIYASE] I was trying to
figure out the best place

97
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,418
for the two of us
to relax and talk.

98
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,086
I hope this is okay with you.

99
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,296
Of course.

100
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,884
Oh, geraniums. How pretty.

101
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,177
Just like I promised.

102
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,887
I'm glad I got to
show them to you.

103
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,224
[IZUMI] Were you in
the middle of doing this?

104
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,852
Yeah, I replant
them every season.

105
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,354
That sounds like a big job.

106
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,481
Do you get to decide
what you want to plant?

107
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,774
Yes.

108
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,944
How to care for a flower
depends on what kind it is.

109
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,488
But it's a pretty great
thing to see them sprout,

110
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,406
just as you hoped they would.

111
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,992
Wow, that does sound gratifying.

112
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,161
Well, would you
like to give it a try?

113
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,204
Sure!

114
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,208
Okay, am I doing this right?

115
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,044
Yes, so all you wanna do now
is add a little bit more soil.

116
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,881
And you're done.

117
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,049
All right!

118
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,387
Pardon me a moment.

119
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,142
You just had a little
dirt on your cheek.

120
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,979
Oh! Thank you, then!
Can't have that.

121
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,066
[MIYASE laughs]

122
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,823
You have such
tiny hands, and yet...

123
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,533
You're trying to use
them to grasp at

124
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,660
such a shapeless truth.

125
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,704
You're a very strong person.

126
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,164
I know you're going to
continue moving forward,

127
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,749
honest and true.

128
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,960
Mr. Miyase.

129
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,629
See, I've been
in Mr. Kujo's care,

130
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,757
well, ever since I was
a very young child.

131
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,134
That's why

132
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,262
in my mind, I'll always
see him as my older brother.

133
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,890
See, I believe in Mr. Kujo.

134
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,851
And my mind won't
change on that.

135
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,937
Miss Izumi.

136
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,523
Knowing all of that,
would you still be willing

137
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,899
to take my hand?

138
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,412
[IZUMI] All of that is exactly
why I asked for your help,

139
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,830
Mr. Miyase.

140
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,256
Very well, then.

141
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,050
I'll help you however I can.

142
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,937
Well, Mr. Miyase gave
us a very promising reply.

143
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,980
Good job.

144
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,815
That's a really great catch.

145
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:26,941
Here's the question:

146
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,069
Can we actually trust this man?

147
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,488
I mean, he's not after your
body, or anything, right?

148
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,363
[IZUMI chuckles]

149
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,115
Come on, Yui.

150
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,910
But the thing is,
even if he's willing to help us,

151
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,787
I'm sure he won't be able
to tell us everything,

152
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
considering his position.

153
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,333
Our best bet's probably to
simplify what we want to ask him

154
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,001
down to a few key points.

155
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,669
Yeah, I agree with you,

156
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,046
but there are so many unknowns,

157
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,507
it's hard to know
exactly where to start.

158
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,550
We'd be having an
easier time if STAND

159
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,886
would just be a bit
more cooperative.

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,221
Oh, yeah, about that.

161
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,555
I actually have a plan.

162
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,395
[door opens, closes]

163
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,689
[SUGANO] Wow, you've
got quite a pile there.

164
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,858
Don't tell me all of that
is for one case.

165
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,778
Sure is. Where'd Mr. Hattori go?

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,239
I haven't heard from him
since he left that with you.

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,241
Sorry I'm not more help.

168
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,909
[SUGANO chuckles]

169
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,536
Well, good luck with that.

170
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,330
Oh, hey, Natsuki,
how did the questioning go?

171
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,583
Yeah. Nothing's really changed.

172
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,503
He just keeps repeating
that he has nothing to say.

173
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,879
[ASAGIRI]
That figures.

174
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,048
If Makoto Tsuduki
would actually cooperate,

175
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,592
we could move forward
with the Anonymous Case.

176
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,219
[SUGANO] There hasn't
been anything new on it

177
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,303
for a while now.

178
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,514
The DCD has been quiet lately.

179
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,432
No word from Rei either.

180
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,269
I guess she's keeping
her head down for now.

181
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,355
I'm sure she would be,
considering what happened.

182
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,361
[door opens]

183
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,529
[IZUMI]
Hey, everyone.

184
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,159
There's, uh...

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,369
...something I wanted to
discuss with all of you.

186
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,496
Really? Come on, not this again.

187
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,916
What is it you
wanted to talk about?

188
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,209
Well, it's just that...

189
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,628
I've been scouting Mr. Kujo
for a few weeks now,

190
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,630
and it's not going so great.

191
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,008
I was thinking, if you
receive any new information

192
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,678
that isn't in the files,
would you please tell me?

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,471
No, of course we can't.

194
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,557
You are not an official
part of STAND,

195
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,809
therefore we have
nothing to tell you.

196
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,186
I see.

197
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,396
So, should I take that
to mean that Mr. Kujo

198
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,524
is involved with the case STAND
is currently investigating?

199
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,485
I may not be a member of STAND,

200
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,447
but I am the recruiter,
and I take that seriously.

201
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,450
I'm doing my absolute best
to get this job done right.

202
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,660
I hope you can see that.

203
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
So, in the interest
of making that happen,

204
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,831
couldn't you at least
tell me something?

205
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
You have everything we do.
There's nothing new.

206
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,757
I understand.

207
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,050
Thank you very much.

208
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,766
[SUGANO chuckles]

209
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,352
Looks like someone's
back on her feet.

210
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,355
[ASAGIRI] Yep, and just as
ready as ever to cause trouble.

211
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,657
STAND has obviously
found out something

212
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,283
about Mr. Kujo.

213
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,869
That's more than enough
information to get started.

214
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,135
[ARAKIDA]
Aoyama.

215
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,972
Oh, hey.
How's it going, Arakida?

216
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,266
Listen, Izumi came
to see us today.

217
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,602
Right. She went looking
for info on Kujo.

218
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,479
I'm sorry if she's
been a hassle.

219
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,733
So, wait, are you saying this
wasn't a part of your plan?

220
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,026
Oh... no.

221
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,403
Our hands are tied, though,

222
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,697
so I can't say I'm all that
surprised that Izumi's

223
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,657
out there doing
whatever she can.

224
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,575
But isn't she always
just doing what she can

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,743
to get by?

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,954
I mean, she was only
chosen to be in the DCD

227
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,373
because of her condition,
wasn't she?

228
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,666
At first, yes.

229
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,876
But she's clearly been
doing everything she can

230
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,005
not to rely on her condition.

231
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,924
That was your advice, wasn't it?

232
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,594
I don't know, but that
wasn't really my intention.

233
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,264
Well... Izumi still
took it that way.

234
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,516
That's just how she is.

235
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,393
I was pretty certain you
would've figured that out

236
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,477
by now.

237
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,407
[phone ringing]

238
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,496
Hello, this is Izumi.

239
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,832
Listen, are you
working right now?

240
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,668
[IZUMI]
Yeah. But I have some time.

241
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,837
Oh, okay.

242
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,963
So, uh...

243
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,093
Remember how I called you naÃ¯ve?

244
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,263
I still don't believe
I was wrong.

245
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,140
Okay.

246
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,685
[ARAKIDA] But there
were things I didn't see.

247
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,812
And the reason I couldn't
admit that was because

248
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,647
of my own personal bias.

249
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,360
I do know you're more
than some damsel

250
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,153
who just needs protecting.

251
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,368
Sorry for before.

252
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,536
Oh, no! Please don't apologize!

253
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,790
You were exactly right,
Mr. Arakida.

254
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,084
I realize now
I'm not skilled enough yet

255
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,835
to be able to stand
alongside all of you

256
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,128
out in the field.

257
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,172
The only reason I was
even here to begin with

258
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,424
was because of my drug immunity.

259
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,636
I knew it, and it made
me feel inferior.

260
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,680
Even then, I didn't
really care at first.

261
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,768
At least I could be of
use to everyone, right?

262
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,562
Except I couldn't
protect people like that.

263
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,606
So, then, I figured out
that I have to think

264
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,151
on my own as an
agent of the DCD.

265
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,572
Your words are what drove
that home for me, Mr. Arakida.

266
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,158
I want to do everything
I can to become stronger

267
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,952
so I can protect the weak,

268
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,454
and always keep
my focus on them.

269
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,456
That's why I've decided

270
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,626
that I won't be
looking down anymore!

271
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,212
I guess that's just how you are.

272
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,216
The unknown corpse
found in connection

273
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,801
to the Anonymous Case.

274
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,553
If we can identify it somehow,

275
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,765
that may help us secure
Soma Kujo's cooperation.

276
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,642
Wait, are you...?

277
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,311
[ARAKIDA] You are a scout,
so I can tell you that much.

278
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,981
Then I thought you
could use the help.

279
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,191
Mr. Arakida.

280
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,026
[ARAKIDA]
I'm afraid that's all I can do.

281
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,404
I'm a member of STAND,
and you aren't.

282
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,197
That hasn't changed.

283
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,241
[IZUMI] Even so, we both
want to make sure

284
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,618
this case gets solved.

285
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,663
I'll do everything my position
allows to see that happen.

286
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
Good.

287
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,888
[HIYAMA]
I see.

288
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,099
So that's where we are
with the Anonymous Case.

289
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,560
Very well, I can
take it from here.

290
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,729
[MAKI]
One other thing.

291
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,981
Izumi asked if we can
look into the identity

292
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,733
of the victim for her.

293
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,027
Sounds like Rei's putting
the pieces together.

294
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,071
Pretty impressive she
got that far on her own.

295
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,990
[HIYAMA]
So, Maki. What are you saying?

296
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,992
We should tell her
what she wants to know?

297
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,660
Kei isn't the only one.

298
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,454
I feel the same.

299
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,332
It may be information that's
tied to the Kujo Family,

300
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,126
but on its own, it isn't going
to determine the culprit.

301
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,170
I don't think telling
her presents a problem.

302
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,927
[HIYAMA] Well, what's your
assessment based on this?

303
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,013
Do you believe
Soma Kujo is guilty?

304
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,224
At this point in time,

305
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,059
we really can't say.

306
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,686
Although, if we did
keep this hidden,

307
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,398
I don't think that would be
fair to him or Izumi.

308
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,235
All right, then.

309
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,904
If you want to help her out,
you can go ahead.

310
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,280
But remember.

311
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,991
I'm only saying that because
I trust the three of you.

312
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,621
And just in case you
didn't know, Hiyama,

313
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,914
we trust you, too.

314
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,249
[HIYAMA]
Is that so?

315
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,421
[phone chimes]

316
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,806
[IZUMI]
Omori Pharmaceutical.

317
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,686
That's it.

318
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,772
This ties Mr. Kujo to
the Anonymous Case.

319
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,065
[phone chimes]

320
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,450
[MIYASE] You know how you
called me the other day

321
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,536
about that Hibiya person?

322
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,704
[IZUMI]
Of course.

323
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,623
You told me that you'd never
heard of him before, right?

324
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,709
Yes, and that was true,

325
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,044
but after we spoke,
I learned something.

326
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,879
What did you find?

327
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,257
[MIYASE]
It's nothing official, but here.

328
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,508
Take a look at this.

329
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,846
I take it that Kaname
did some digging?

330
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,350
[MIYASE] Mr. Hibiya was
a talented researcher,

331
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,311
but all of his work
records have been wiped

332
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,187
after a certain point,

333
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,732
and he's been
missing ever since.

334
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,484
Right around the time
of the Anonymous Case.

335
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,069
The Anonymous Case?

336
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,030
Oh, never mind. It's nothing.

337
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,368
There was another thing, too,
regarding that drug SQUARE.

338
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,371
It seems he was a central
figure in its development.

339
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,174
[SEKI]
Thank you for seeing us.

340
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,425
We appreciate it.

341
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,968
[MOHLW BRASS 1A]
We can skip the pleasantries.

342
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,845
Did you have
something to report?

343
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,929
[SEKI]
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,057
As you know, Soma Kujo
is one of the people

345
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,391
we've been scouting.

346
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,810
We've come across some
information that makes it clear

347
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,230
that we need to look
into him further.

348
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,858
There is a possibility
that he's tied to a drug

349
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,235
that is currently
under investigation.

350
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,695
What's your point?

351
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,073
Until we can be certain
of his involvement,

352
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,618
wouldn't it be better to hold
off on recruiting him, sir?

353
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,079
[MOHLW BRASS 1A] Do you have
any proof of this involvement?

354
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,999
Nothing concrete enough
to be worth showing you yet.

355
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,418
I can't make that
decision without evidence.

356
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,463
But if we find
proof he was involved,

357
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,964
something solid,

358
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,676
then surely that would
affect his eligibility

359
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,512
where joining STAND
is concerned.

360
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,555
I understand what
you're trying to say.

361
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,808
But for now, the MPD
has jurisdiction

362
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
over all STAND matters.

363
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,145
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
that this is out of my hands.

364
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,523
Very well.
Then I'll talk to the MPD.

365
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,149
With your permission, of course.

366
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,859
Go on. Do as you please.

367
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,450
[IZUMI]
How did it go?

368
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,369
They wouldn't see me.

369
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,995
So, no help there.

370
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,830
[SEKI]
None.

371
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,332
But they've tipped
their hand now.

372
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,876
I don't know what, but the
brass is plotting something.

373
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,338
The higher‐ups know
about the ugly rumors

374
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,049
going around concerning
the Kujo Family.

375
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,009
Drugs and possibly worse.

376
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,720
The link we uncovered
would've been enough

377
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,638
for the Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare

378
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,432
to put pressure on them.

379
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,600
It was perfect ammunition.

380
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,602
But not only didn't they bite,

381
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,604
they tried to shut us down.

382
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,650
And let's not forget the fact
that all the candidates

383
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,194
for STAND seem to be tied
to the Anonymous Case

384
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,696
in one way or another.

385
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,325
Yeah, that's been bothering
me a little, as well.

386
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,745
Maki, who was taken
hostage as the suspect

387
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,079
tried to flee.

388
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,582
Makoto, who was detained
and is being questioned

389
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,083
about the case.

390
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,669
His younger brother Kyosuke.

391
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,588
And then there's
the Kujo Family,

392
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,091
who could possibly be
the ones behind everything.

393
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,177
[SEKI]
And Aoyama who has obvious ties

394
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,887
with the Aoyama Trading Company,

395
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,514
which funded the
development of the new drug.

396
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,559
STAND's purpose is to
investigate unsolved cases.

397
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,519
In theory, it makes sense
for them to be looking

398
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,522
into the Anonymous Case. But...

399
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,026
Everything's just
a little too convenient.

400
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,943
That's right.

401
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,821
I've been trying to figure out
why STAND was created.

402
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,323
Aoyama has, too,

403
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,742
but we haven't found
anything so far.

404
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,244
There's just too much
we don't know.

405
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,622
The more we look into
the agency's history,

406
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,124
the more it feels like they're
trying to hide something.

407
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,630
[IZUMI] We have one man
whose guilt seems certain.

408
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,841
And another who believes
in him, no matter what.

409
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,885
Meanwhile, the people
who should be on our side

410
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,221
become more and more mysterious.

411
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,060
The closer we get, the more
the truth changes its shape

412
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,855
until it's almost hard to know
what we're looking for anymore.

413
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,066
I can't shake that feeling,

414
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,151
and it makes me hesitate
to step further

415
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,153
into the darkness
that lies ahead.

416
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,539
If it's all right with you,

417
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,750
I'm going to go and
see Mr. Arakida.

418
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,919
Sure. Tell him hi for me.

419
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,005
[phone chimes]

420
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,560
You know that coming
here is dangerous.

421
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,187
Or you should.

422
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,022
Mr. Hattori.

423
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,192
[HATTORI] I gave you
fair warning, didn't I?

424
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,778
But you still poked your nose
where it doesn't belong.
