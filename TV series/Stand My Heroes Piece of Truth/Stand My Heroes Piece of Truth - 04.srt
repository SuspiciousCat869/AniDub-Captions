Sure. Usually, anyway.

up for getting together

we should do that.

It sounds like he's

The doctors said it
was from overwork.

So, you're getting
the hang of scouting,

Right. And you've
made great contacts.

agree to join STAND yet

I'm glad I could help!

160
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,794
Oh, wow. Look over there!

161
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,089
Those look amazing!

162
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,632
Come on, let's split one!

163
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,426
[IZUMI chuckles]

164
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,510
What is it?

165
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,511
Just you.

166
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,638
You look like you're
having so much fun.

167
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,601
Because I am having fun.
We're on a date, right?

168
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,145
I'll be honest, all I was hoping
for was that you'd finally

169
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,897
have a chance to step
out of work mode

170
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,066
and enjoy the day with me.

171
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,068
I think you accomplished that.

172
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,112
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun!

173
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
You mean it?

174
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,698
Awesome!

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,158
[GIRL 4A]
Doesn't he look like Kyon?

176
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,911
Oh, wow, he does!

177
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,871
Busted. Let's bail!

178
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,961
Oh, man.

179
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,339
Sorry to make you run.
I kinda panicked!

180
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,340
It's fine.

181
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,175
That was kind of
a close one, huh?

182
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,176
Too close.

183
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,844
In that moment, all I
could see in my mind

184
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,598
were cheesy headlines about
some steamy new love affair.

185
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,933
Though now that I think of it,

186
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
if the headlines were about
you, I wouldn't mind much.

187
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,814
There you go with
the teasing again.

188
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,941
Miss Rei. Come on.

189
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,235
You know I'm being
honest with you.

190
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,862
Look, it's just so complicated‐‐

191
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,115
[KYOSUKE]
It's my brother, isn't it?

192
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,950
[IZUMI]
The thing is... He's...

193
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,994
Your brother is a potential
STAND candidate.

194
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,664
And you are, too.

195
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,165
That's true.

196
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,960
Which means, as soon as
my brother joins STAND,

197
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,838
this'll all be over and
you'll instantly forget me.

198
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,089
Life's brutal, man.

199
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,425
Or, I might just join
immediately if you could

200
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,970
look me in the eye right now
and tell me you like me.

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,141
[IZUMI]
I'm not saying that!

202
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,183
[KYOSUKE]
Aww.

203
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,393
[laughs]

204
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,938
Hey, hey, hey.

205
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,233
Watabe, man of the people,
has brought you treats again!

206
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,532
Uh, what's up?

207
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,453
[WATABE] So finding information
on this mystery drug

208
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,706
is even more difficult than
you thought it would be.

209
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,000
It's baffling that we
still don't know what it is

210
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,960
or where it's coming from.

211
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,045
Kotaro's running the
component analysis

212
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,505
and we'll have that soon.

213
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,551
And Natsume's looking into
"Plus" since it was so similar.

214
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,220
Come to think of it, does
anyone know where he is?

215
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,931
Maybe he went to
wash up or something.

216
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,018
By the looks of it,
he was here all night

217
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,395
Your hands are
full, aren't they?

218
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,189
Yeah, I haven't really
been able to help out

219
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,773
with that case at all.

220
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,359
That's only because you've
been busy with your own work.

221
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,113
You're far too nice, which is
why he keeps messing with you.

222
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,323
[WATABE]
Am I missing something?

223
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,490
Who do you mean?

224
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,075
Rei here has an admirer.

225
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,745
Kyosuke Tsuduki keeps
asking her to go out.

226
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,206
But it's not like they're
real dates or anything.

227
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,290
Wow.

228
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,959
First some socialites
and now a big actor.

229
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,462
Turns out you're a pretty
smooth operator, Rei!

230
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,713
No, I'm not!

231
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,089
[YUI]
Figured it out!

232
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,343
I've finally got the component
analysis for the mystery drug.

233
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,595
It's not just similar to
the Plus that circulated

234
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,888
15 years ago.

235
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,182
The drug we've been
studying is Plus.

236
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,147
How can we be certain, though?

237
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,733
Wasn't the data we had
on Plus incomplete?

238
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,985
[YUI] I'm gonna let
Natsume explain that.

239
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,780
[NATSUME] I did some initial
digging but came up empty,

240
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,741
so I ended up getting some
documents from the MPD.

241
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,036
Which I'll need back since I'll
be getting rid of them later.

242
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,204
Does that mean...?

243
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,372
[WATABE laughs]

244
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,540
Excellent work, Natsume!

245
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,667
Honestly.

246
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,752
You can scold me another time.

247
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,671
Basically, the main problem
was the fact that

248
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,715
the component analysis
results had been hidden away.

249
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,509
Which is weird, right?

250
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,971
I found them stored alongside
the other top secret files.

251
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,390
They were considered
classified data.

252
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,517
Only a select few from
a certain agency

253
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,311
could even get
access to them.

254
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,938
And it was STAND.

255
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,232
You're sure?

256
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,525
[NATSUME]
Security was tight.

257
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,403
I just barely managed
to get the analysis out.

258
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,656
I'm pretty sure what this
means is that Plus is involved

259
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,409
in some cases that
STAND will be dealing with.

260
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,828
Did you know
about this, Mr. Seki?

261
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
No.

262
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,792
[AOYAMA] It seems strange
to me that anyone would have

263
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,545
drug‐related data
other than the DCD.

264
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,006
[NATSUME] Not to mention
that it was top secret.

265
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,716
Something's fishy.

266
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,010
[YUI]
I'm just speculating here.

267
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,094
But with STAND,

268
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,346
that agency might have
some ulterior motives

269
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,140
that we're
completely unaware of.

270
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,603
[SEKI] For now, Aoyama
and I will deal with this.

271
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,856
We've been able to uncover
something about this drug,

272
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,774
which is great progress.

273
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,986
Aoyama and Imaoji, find out
where it's coming from.

274
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,195
Sure.

275
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,324
Yui and Natsume,
find out everything you can,

276
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,369
both on this and on the drug
commonly known as "Plus."

277
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,245
Roger that.

278
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,373
[phone ringing]

279
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,499
[IZUMI]
Excuse me.

280
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,919
What's going on, Kyosuke?

281
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,088
[KYOSUKE]
Miss Rei! It's my brother!

282
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,631
He was taken by the police!

283
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,716
[IZUMI gasps]

284
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,809
[IZUMI] Oh, he went with them
to be questioned voluntarily?

285
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,935
That's good.

286
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,729
I thought he'd been arrested.

287
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,857
Sorry. I kinda panicked.

288
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,317
[IZUMI]
It's all right.

289
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,235
I would have done
the same thing.

290
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,865
[KYOSUKE] The police had sent
him summons to come down

291
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,827
to the station, but apparently
he had been ignoring them.

292
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,372
If he declined again, they
were gonna issue a warrant

293
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,166
on suspicion of concealing
evidence or something.

294
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,626
They thought your
brother might be hiding

295
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,877
some kind of evidence?

296
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,337
Pertaining to what?

297
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,547
They weren't willing
to tell me anything,

298
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,758
but I did overhear
the detectives.

299
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,009
It's weird.

300
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,053
They kept saying
the word "anonymous."

301
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,305
Anonymous?

302
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,391
Could it be the
"Anonymous Case"?

303
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,393
Is Makoto involved in that?

304
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,603
Who knows. I have no clue.

305
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,105
Never heard of it before.

306
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,108
But...

307
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,527
There's just no way that
my brother did anything bad,

308
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,320
you know?

309
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,782
I mean, he's the kind of guy
who always does what's right.

310
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,783
Always.

311
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,535
And I'm so proud
of him for that.

312
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,915
I never did stand a chance
against him, though.

313
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,251
He's the son that my
parents were proud of.

314
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,378
I was always just a runner‐up.

315
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,965
Everyone I've ever liked
has wanted him instead.

316
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,258
That sounds hard.

317
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,470
Sorry, what am I talking about?

318
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,348
Just ignore me. It's nothing.

319
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,267
Can I tell you something?

320
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,103
I like you, Kyosuke.

321
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,982
You're a nice guy, and
a pretty charming one, too.

322
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,693
Wait, you really
think I'm charming?

323
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,777
[IZUMI]
Mm‐hmm.

324
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,489
Well, thanks.

325
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,452
I don't know what's going on,
but I'll help you if I can.

326
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,913
I'll look into this for you
and see what I can find out.

327
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,623
I owe you one, Miss Rei.

328
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,836
[IZUMI]
Yes. I'm heading back now.

329
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,879
Thanks.

[phone ringing]

331
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,218
Hello, Izumi here.

332
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,972
[MAKI] Hey, I heard Tsuduki
was taken away by the police.

333
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,932
[IZUMI]
So, you already know.

334
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,226
Sure do, and I heard
they were questioning him

335
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,103
about the Anonymous Case.

336
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:19,979
[IZUMI]
Well...

337
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,523
Listen, don't worry
about me, okay?

338
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,401
We're gonna be looking
into this matter, too.

339
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,278
Though we obviously won't
be asking the police

340
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,280
about it directly.

341
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,656
And Makoto?

342
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,325
He'll be out soon, won't he?

343
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,911
[MAKI] If it's just standard
questioning, then, yeah,

344
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,997
they shouldn't hold him for
days or anything, but still.

345
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,709
You should know, those brothers
are headed for trouble.

346
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,301
[IZUMI]
What's going on?

347
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,430
What is this?

348
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,730
Kyon's big brother was taken?

349
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,649
Wow! Crazy!

350
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,567
[NEWSCASTER 4A] There's no
formal word from the police,

351
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,945
causing much speculation
amongst fans.

352
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,322
Speaking of Mr. Tsuduki,
his younger brother

353
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,241
is currently working as
an actor and has become

354
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,951
a bit of a success himself!

355
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,161
Yes, and one can only
wonder if this might begin

356
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,829
to affect his work.

357
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,331
Who knows how this
could affect the ratings

358
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,749
for his current TV drama?

359
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,240
[ARAKIDA sighs]

360
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,493
[HATTORI] My, my.
Listen to that heavy sigh.

361
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,578
I can't blame you.

362
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,414
They're not holding
back on Mr. Tsuduki.

363
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,041
[ARAKIDA] Nothing else big
in the news right now, either.

364
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,209
You concerned?

365
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,336
[ARAKIDA]
Shut up.

366
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,339
I think you're worried
about the new damsel.

367
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,550
She's such an empathetic soul.

368
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,385
I bet she's probably
a mess right now.

369
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,681
I guess she finally
won you over, too, Sosei.

370
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,016
How surprising.

371
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,272
Oh, please. I've barely
even acknowledged her.

372
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
[IMAOJI]
Welcome back.

373
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,951
How'd it go?

374
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,162
Oh, I just followed
up on a few leads,

375
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,581
but I didn't find anything.

376
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,208
I don't know why he was
looking at the Anonymous Case,

377
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,794
and I couldn't discover how
he might've been involved.

378
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,379
It's so strange.

379
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,173
Interesting.

380
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,384
It is unusual that no other
details have been released.

381
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,720
So, I'd bet Section One
has some kind of gag order

382
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,221
about the case.

383
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,932
Or maybe, only a select
few from Section One

384
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,643
even know about it at all.

385
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,437
[IZUMI] Yes, that's what
Revel thought, too.

386
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,648
I asked if they thought there
was anything we could do

387
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,192
about all the awful,
negative comments.

388
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,070
But for now, they said they'd
just have to deal with it.

389
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,239
Hey, look, you should
probably get some rest, Rei.

390
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,075
You look a little pale to me.

391
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,076
Nah.

392
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,411
Were you taking those
back to the library?

393
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,871
I'll take them for you.

394
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,791
You have got to relax.

395
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,876
No good will come
from you panicking.

396
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,046
Hey, Rei!

397
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,923
There's about to be
a press conference

398
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,966
with Kyosuke Tsuduki.

399
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,261
For all the trouble
and the confusion,

400
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,513
I am truly sorry.

401
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,019
So, as my agency has
already announced,

402
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,270
it's not true.

403
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,523
The reports of my brother,
Makoto Tsuduki,

404
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,525
being arrested are false.

405
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,444
Right now, he's cooperating
with the police.

406
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,906
He's gone along with
all of their questioning.

407
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,991
I can't talk about why
he's being questioned

408
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,327
because it will affect
their investigation.

409
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,996
[REPORTER 4A] But is he
really just being questioned?

410
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,498
[REPORTER 4B]
He's a crime novelist.

411
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,875
You don't think he got tired
of writing about criminals

412
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,712
and decided to
become one himself?

413
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,588
[REPORTER 4C] Isn't it possible
that your brother was involved

414
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,842
in a crime and you
just had no idea?

415
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,385
No, it's not.

416
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,846
I firmly believe in Makoto.

417
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,682
He's awkward, but he loves us.

418
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm proud of my brother.

419
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,523
What's wrong?

420
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,734
I'm sorry, but I
really need to go!

421
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,490
Did you need something?

422
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,994
I came here regarding
Makoto Tsuduki.

423
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,912
The media has been
reporting that Makoto

was actually arrested.

425
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,127
The press is being ruthless
with both Makoto and Kyosuke.

426
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,171
There's been so much
speculation going around

427
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,839
that it's getting
out of control.

428
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,840
I thought...

429
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,425
Isn't there any way you
could at least announce

430
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,552
that he wasn't arrested?

431
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,554
I realize that I may
be out of line,

The belief that I'd been
progressing on this path
