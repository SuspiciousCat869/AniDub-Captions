1
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,448
[IMAOJI]
Hey, we're here.

2
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,617
So, what have we got?

3
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,829
That's funny, I thought it was
your job to figure that out.

4
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,122
It's not like I called
you guys out here

5
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,916
for a field trip.

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,086
So are those the drugs?

7
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,172
I've definitely never
seen this drug before.

8
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,091
Wonder if it's new.

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,342
Where's the owner?

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,468
Locked up.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,638
He was arrested 'cause he went
berserk downtown last night.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,223
Question him if you want to.

13
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,058
We've got him at the precinct.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,434
[IMAOJI]
I can go.

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,769
Great, thanks.

16
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,273
And you know what?

17
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,567
I think we should have Kotaro
take a look at this.

18
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,082
[SUGANO] You managed to get
Mr. Hiyama to introduce you

19
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,667
to the next STAND candidate?

20
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,168
I gotta say, that's impressive.

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,297
A best‐selling author, huh?

22
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,841
Must be nice having such
fancy connections.

23
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,842
[IZUMI]
Oh, stop.

24
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,969
You're coming with me this
time, anyway, aren't you?

25
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,054
[SUGANO]
Sorry!

26
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,723
Do you think maybe you
could ask one of the others

27
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,266
to go with you today?

28
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,602
I've got a bunch of
reports piled up, so...

29
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,064
[chuckling]

30
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,857
Not him.
Try the narc guys.

31
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,402
[IZUMI] They've been wrapped up
in another case all morning.

32
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,570
I guess there was a guy
arrested who had some kind of

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,073
new drug on him.

34
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,867
Mr. Asagiri's covering
it on your end.

35
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,536
Oh, yeah, that's right.

36
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,329
Well, why not go by yourself?

37
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,622
Only option, really.

38
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,457
I didn't think I was allowed to.

39
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,918
Mr. Aoyama said to
bring someone with me.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,628
[HATTORI]
Hm?

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,046
[IZUMI]
Mr. Hattori.

42
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,007
Oh, Makoto Tsuduki. Huh.

43
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,969
Isn't he the king of sappy,
tear‐jerker novels?

44
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,262
Sosei.

45
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,472
You're a big fan of his, right?

46
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,349
[ARAKIDA]
No. Shut up.

47
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,271
[IZUMI]
Um, gotta say...

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,189
Surprised you're a romance fan.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,149
Can we not?

50
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,984
Right! New subject.

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,444
Uh...

52
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,363
So... I've been wondering
about something.

53
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,368
Mr. Tsuduki is this genius
novelist who keeps writing

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,120
one crazy hit after another,

55
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,248
despite the fact that
he's so young, right?

56
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,500
And then you've got his
younger brother, Kyosuke,

57
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,835
who's a popular actor,

58
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,838
and he's also listed as
a candidate for STAND.

59
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,800
Is it typical for the police
to ask novelists and actors

60
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,677
to aide them in
their investigations?

61
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,929
They seem like
odd choices to me.

62
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,432
One of STAND's primary
goals is to try to explore

63
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,601
new ways of solving cases
that have never been

64
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,269
considered before.

65
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,647
I hear you on the actor thing,
but as far as Master Tsuduki‐‐

66
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,524
Ahem.

67
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,610
As far as Mr. Tsuduki
is concerned,

68
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,320
they're considering him
to potentially help

69
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,071
profile suspects.

70
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,615
Interesting.

71
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,201
Oh, right!
I forgot Mr. Tsuduki actually

72
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,536
used to write crime novels,
didn't he?

73
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,662
Yeah, he did.

74
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,999
Now, the police even consider
him to be a reliable resource.

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,334
Great! I'm excited.

76
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,253
I hope he'll agree
to help us out today.

77
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,465
Look, calm down.
This isn't a game, okay?

78
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,429
Anyway, we don't know how
reliable he'll actually be.

80
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,889
The police could be wrong.

81
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,892
Didn't you research how many
series he's writing now?

82
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,561
[IZUMI] But I thought I read
about some rumors recently

83
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,147
that he's possibly
considering retirement.

84
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,273
Could've sworn...

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,817
So you're one of those, huh?

86
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,568
A person who believes rumors?

87
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm not.

88
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,447
You were really planning to
meet him using unsubstantiated

89
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,033
information like that?

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,326
You need to do better.

91
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,410
Of course.

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,415
Oh, man.
He's even scarier today.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,171
[IZUMI]
Um, my name is Izumi,

94
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,508
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Makoto Tsuduki.

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,635
[CONCIERGE 3A] We've been
expecting you. Go on up.

96
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,346
[bell rings]

97
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,767
[MAKOTO]
Yes?

98
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,311
[IZUMI] Hello, I'm here on
Mr. Hiyama's referral?

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,938
My name is Izumi.

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,358
[door opens]

101
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,153
I'm Makoto Tsuduki.

102
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,074
[IZUMI]
So, basically,

103
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,201
we were just hoping you
might be willing to utilize

104
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,787
your exceptional observation
skills and ability

105
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,498
to read people to
help us with our work.

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm sure you'd like some
time to think it over,

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,835
and I understand.

108
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,086
But if you could
just let us know‐‐

109
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,588
[MAKOTO]
That's enough.

110
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,173
I said that I've
heard quite enough.

111
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,551
That sounds excruciatingly
tedious to the point

112
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,137
that it makes me
feel physically ill.

113
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,306
And if you believe you
can distill my abilities

114
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,225
down to something as commonplace
as "reading people,"

115
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,687
I can only imagine what
you're going to say next.

116
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,771
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,690
I know you came all
this way to see me,

118
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,650
but I'd like for you to go.

119
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,527
Um... Little help here?

120
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,409
Look. I'm sorry
if I insulted you.

121
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,161
I want you to know
that's not even close

122
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,038
to what I was going for.

123
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,290
But listen, I can't just
up and leave now that I know

124
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,791
that's what I've done.

125
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,919
Is there any chance of
convincing you to consider

126
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,796
hearing me out again?

127
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,758
There are two reasons
I can't take on this request.

128
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,676
The first is work‐related.

129
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,887
I'm rather busy right now.

130
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,847
And due to certain
personal reasons,

131
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,433
I may be ending all
of my current series.

132
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,684
[IZUMI, ARAKIDA gasp]

133
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,437
[MAKOTO] So, since I'll most
likely wrap them up soon,

134
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,773
I'll need to do everything
I can to ensure that I can

135
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,026
come up with endings my
readers will be satisfied with.

136
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,404
I simply have no time to
take on a side job right now.

137
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,283
As for the second reason,
that one's rather personal.

138
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,328
In my experience,
narcs are incompetent.

139
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,246
I don't trust them at all.

140
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,710
Quite simply, as long
as narcs are involved,

141
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,380
I have zero intention
of cooperating.

142
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,508
[ARAKIDA] You know, you need
to work on your game face.

143
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,177
You looked openly
disappointed in front of him.

144
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,470
Yeah, I know.

145
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,889
I just never expected
him to be quite so blunt.

146
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,557
It was hard to hide my shock.

147
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,561
Mmm, yet you managed
a parting shot.

148
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,855
Pretty audacious, leaving those
papers and telling him

149
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,232
you'd be back.

150
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,441
So weird.

151
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,111
He is ending his series.

152
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,779
Well, what if he does?

153
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,948
It's work.

154
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,617
If it became too personal,
he'd probably keep seesawing

155
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,703
back and forth.

156
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,829
[IZUMI]
Right.

157
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,211
[IMAOJI] These are the
drugs we confiscated.

158
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,921
Down at the precinct,
I questioned the guy

159
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,172
who had these on him.

160
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,882
He kept swearing up
and down that these pills

161
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,094
are perfectly safe because
they "aren't addictive."

162
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,596
Huh? Seriously?
And that makes them safe?

163
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,098
Where'd they come from?

164
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,475
He refused to tell us.

165
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,770
Kotaro. How's the
analysis going?

166
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,980
It's going.

167
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,524
There was one thing that
concerned me, though.

168
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,942
It's familiar.

169
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,945
It has similar components to
another drug in our database.

170
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,281
Enough to be striking.

171
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,199
The street name is "Plus."

172
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,492
Haven't seen it for a while.

173
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,870
It made the rounds
maybe ten‐odd years ago.

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,041
Interesting.
What type of drug is it?

175
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,333
[YUI]
That's unknown.

176
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,835
Wait, what?

177
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,380
All we had were the results
of its component analysis.

178
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,425
By itself, that's not
complete or sufficient data.

179
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,053
There might be more detailed
information kept elsewhere,

180
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,137
who knows.

181
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,513
But that's all I've got.

182
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,599
Hmm.

183
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,267
All right.

184
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,521
Yui, continue the analysis
and keep us up to speed.

185
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,607
Natsume, think you could
take another look

186
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,941
through the database?

187
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,901
[NATSUME]
Huh?

188
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,736
[SEKI] Go through the entire
thing and make sure there isn't

189
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,280
any other information
concerning Plus.

190
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,657
C'mon, that's a needle
in a haystack.

191
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,410
Kotaro already said he
couldn't find anything!

192
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,287
[YUI] Aren't you a firm
believer in getting off work

193
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,246
on time?

194
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,082
Then you'd better believe
we're gonna work you as hard

195
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,000
as a racehorse while
you're on the clock.

196
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:44,876
Hey!

197
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,169
[SEKI chuckles]

198
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,670
[IZUMI]
Um...

199
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,798
I was just wondering if there
was something I could do

200
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,049
to help.

201
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,343
[AOYAMA] Your scouting duties
should be your priority.

202
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,306
[AOYAMA]
Izumi.

203
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,768
I guess it didn't go well today?

204
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,104
I mean with Tsuduki.

205
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,524
Not really, it was
kind of discouraging.

206
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,026
[AOYAMA] Sorry I haven't been
able to help you out lately.

207
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,569
No! Don't worry!

208
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,737
I'm doing fine.

209
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,157
And Mr. Arakida was even kind
enough to call me audacious!

210
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,367
That's something!

211
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,744
[AOYAMA chuckles]

212
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,173
[KYOSUKE] You had no right
to decide on your own!

213
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,301
[MAKOTO]
Actually, I had every right.

214
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,428
[KYOSUKE]
Why are you always like this?

215
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,513
Fine!

216

[IZUMI chuckles]

217
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh, I see, so you're
the one who came earlier

218
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,108
and left those STAND
documents with him, huh?

219
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,527
Must be cool, being a narc.

220
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,736
It is, thanks!

221
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,282
[KYOSUKE] Heh. There's no need
to be so nervous, Miss Rei.

222
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,075
"Miss Rei"?

223
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,161
You can feel free
to call me Kyosuke.

224
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,079
I prefer things less formal.

225
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,500
Oh, no, did I
say something weird?

226
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
Nothing like that. I swear.

227
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,880
Just thinking how you're
nothing like your brother.

228
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,256
Get that all the time.

229
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,008
I mean, he's actually talented.

230
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,301
That's not what I meant!

231
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,594
[KYOSUKE laughs]

232
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,221
Yeah, I know. I kid.

233
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,057
Sorry you had to overhear
our drama earlier,

234
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,060
and for screwing up your
meeting with my brother.

235
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,980
Oh, it's fine. Seriously.

236
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,734
He was never gonna
welcome me back, anyway.

237
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,819
So are you familiar
with my brother's novel

238
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,697
<i>BeingInLoveInthe</i>
<i>CenteroftheWorld</i> ?

239
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,658
They're turning it into
a live‐action drama,

240
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,119
and they've just offered
me the leading role.

241
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,454
That's amazing.

242
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,123
[KYOSUKE] But my brother's
refused to agree to it

243
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,500
being made at all.

244
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,086
Apparently, it's because he's
planning on quitting everything,

245
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,089
so he doesn't want to deal
with an adaptation now.

246
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,842
But he shut it down
so quick, it pissed me off,

247
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,803
and that's why
I went to see him.

248
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,139
So, I guess you really
wanted that role, huh?

249
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,682
Of course.

250
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,143
It's not like offers to star
in one of my brother's works

251
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,438
come around every day,
so I was really excited.

252
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,525
And then he didn't even
discuss it with me.

253
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,695
There's obvious concern there
about him finishing his books,

254
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,198
but he keeps telling me
not to worry about him.

255
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,783
I'm his brother, though.

256
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,119
So, of course I'm going
to worry, you know?

257
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,704
You two are close, then?

We've always had
a pretty special bond.

According to the officer who
was in charge of the case,

when the accident happened,

00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,104
he was right in the
middle of an overdose.

As for the aftermath...

I guess you could say
it was "complicated."

The identity of the suspect,
the drugs he was using.

Everything in the case was left
unanswered and unsolved.

to apologize, Miss Rei.

But, uh, it might be hard
to get my brother to join you.

He's not the type
to ask for help,

'cause he's able to do
most things on his own.

My brother doesn't
rely on anybody.

00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,065
as a child!

320
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,651
But, why am I getting hits
for this when I searched

321
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,153
for drug cases?

322
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,492
"Summary of the Anonymous Case.

323
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,411
A victim who seemed to have died
under suspicious circumstances

324
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,455
was found in the city.

325
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,707
It has been rumored that
this case may have involved

326
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,542
drug smuggling.

327
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,003
At the time, the Ministry
of Health, Labor and Welfare

328
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,507
had their eyes on a certain
drug smuggling organization.

329
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,383
The people at the top
of this organization

330
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,178
are influential figures
in the medical field.

331
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,015
"There are rumors that even the
Kujo Family has ties with them."

332
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,141
Kujo.

333
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,987
There are so many
candidates that have

334
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,989
some kind of history
with drug cases.

335
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,995
I'm overthinking it, aren't I?

336
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,928
[IZUMI]
Mr. Tsuduki? It's Izumi.

337
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,929
Anyone home?

338
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,222
[thud]

339
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,601
Excuse me.

340
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,187
Mr. Tsuduki?

341
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,400
Pardon me. Uh‐‐

342
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,235
But today...

343
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,903
[IZUMI]
Hey. Hold on.

344
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,824
Wait, what?

345
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,908
[IZUMI]
What do you think?

346
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,577
Should I call an
ambulance for him?

347
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,037
[KYOSUKE] Oh, no.
If he's asleep, it's fine.

348
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,123
I'll have him get
checked out tomorrow.

349
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,792
Overworking, anemia,
lack of sleep.

350
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,587
I can think of a ton of
reasons why this would happen.

351
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,298
I'll head over right
after I'm done filming.

352
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,966
But until then, would you mind?

353
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:12,883
[IZUMI]
Of course.

354
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,970
I feel so helpless; is there
anything else I should do?

355
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,848
[KYOSUKE] Um... Wait,
today's Thursday, isn't it?

356
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,142
That means he might get
a visit from his publisher.

357
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,521
I'm sorry about this.

358
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,371
[IZUMI]
That must be it.

359
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,180
[IZUMI]
This is...

360
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,682
[door opens]

361
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,480
[IZUMI]
You're awake!

362
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,898
Thank goodness!

363
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,067
Sorry for coming in
without permission.

364
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,779
Although, I did contact
Kyosuke when I found you.

365
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,863
What time is it?

366
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,616
Oh, you don't worry
about your manuscript, okay?

367
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,786
I already handed it over
to your publisher for you.

368
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,791
Listen, why would you
push yourself this hard?

369
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,210
[MAKOTO]
That really doesn't concern you.

370
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,587
Well, Kyosuke was
worried about you, too.

371
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,297
And forgive me,
but he also mentioned

372
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,383
that you wouldn't discuss
anything about your work

373
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,428
with him, ever,
and it made him sad.

374
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,473
You're not actually
quitting, though, are you?

375
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,933
What are you talking about?

376
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,518
When I went into your office,

377
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,978
I accidentally
saw your computer.

378
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,606
Oh! I totally didn't read
it that carefully, though!

379
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,732
But you read it?

380
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,567
I'm so sorry.

381
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,069
Doesn't matter.

382
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,447
Not like it's something
that shouldn't be read.

383
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,448
I noticed.

384
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,492
It did seem like a pretty
drastic departure

385
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,160
from the rest of your work.

386
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,495
[MAKOTO]
Of course it is.

387
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,373
I'm writing an
adventure novel for kids.

388
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,625
A kid's novel?

389
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,918
Although...

390
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,587
I'm fairly certain that's
not what society wants to see

391
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,423
from me.

392
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,841
The truth is...

393
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,969
I've wanted to write something
like this for a long time.

394
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,556
Something I want to write, not
something I'm forced to write.

395
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,807
When we were kids,

396
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,017
they would always
smile at my stories

397
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,730
and tell me how much
they loved them.

398
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,358
Every time I wrote anything,
it was only for the two of them.

399
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,572
[IZUMI] Sounds like you and
Kyosuke have a lot in common.

400
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,366
You both love your brother
and sister very much.

401
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,494
Of course I do.

402
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,247
More than anyone
in the whole world.

403
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,756
[KYOSUKE]
My brother said that? Really?

404
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,883
[IZUMI]
Yes.

405
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,595
[KYOSUKE] This is the first time
I've seen him asleep in a while.

406
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,432
Even when we were younger,
it was a rare thing.

407
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,184
Takes me back.

408
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,227
My sister and I were
obsessed with the stories

409
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,896
my brother would write.

410
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,023
They were our favorite things.

411
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,608
We really loved them.

412
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,573
You big idiot.

413
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:28,996
Are you sure?

414
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,874
I could make something for
him to eat when he wakes up.

415
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,167
Get outta here.

416
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,420
Sadly, he prefers sweets over
something nutritious, anyway.

417
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,088
Oh, okay then.

418
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,340
Well, take care.

419
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,925
Yup, same to you!

420
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,134
Do me a favor.

421
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,928
Tell your brother I take
it back and not to worry

422
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,805
about STAND for now.

423
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,515
I kinda think

424
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,850
he wants you and Sara
to be able to read that book

425
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,061
as soon as possible.

426
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,562
Somehow, you keep
managing to see

427
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,690
the most desperately
embarrassing sides of us.

428
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,067
We are so lame.

429
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,485
[IZUMI laughs]

430
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,445
You care about
your older brother,

431
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,614
and there's nothing
lame about that.

432
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,661
When you gave me that
slightly embarrassed smile,

433
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,038
I felt like I saw
you as a child.

434
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,666
You really don't look
at all like your brother.

435
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,585
He always has such
a serious expression.

436
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,421
Although, his gentle nature

437
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,674
and his rare, kind smile.

438
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,094
They're just as beautiful
as the worlds he creates

439
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,805
for the people he loves
most in the world.

440
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,357
Well, guess I'll be going.

441
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,029
Is everything okay?

442
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,698
[KYOSUKE]
Miss Rei, why not choose me?

443
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,036
I'm one of the candidates
for STAND too, right?

444
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,955
Aren't I... enough?
