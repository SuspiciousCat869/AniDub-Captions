00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,158
[IZUMI]
Yesterday.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,577
They said not to get
involved any further.

5
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,954
Does that mean...?

6
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,247
Yeah.

7
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,624
Considering the timing,
I assume they mean the case

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,209
we've been talking about.

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,835
As for who it could be from...

10
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,881
Omori Pharmaceuticals
handled the original coverup.

11
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,677
It could even be from
Soma Kujo himself.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,471
But why send it to you?

13
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,682
The fact that I haven't
received any threats at all

14
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,850
seems pretty strange.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,687
[IZUMI] Could you do me a
favor and please keep this

16
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,188
to yourself?

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,815
I'm sure the others
would only worry

18
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,191
if they knew about it.

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,779
And I won't quit.
I want to be on this case.

20
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,533
All right.

21
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,578
But look, you shouldn't
take this lightly.

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,455
We don't know what else
they might be willing to do.

23
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,499
So, from now on,
I want you to notify me

24
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,377
before you make a move.
Understand?

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,754
[IZUMI] Yes, sir, and I'll
have Revel take a look into

26
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,339
who might have sent me this.

We have an emergency!

00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,099
There's trouble,
so it's all hands on deck!

31
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,008
[IZUMI] I mean, would we
call this... trouble?

32
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,136
I feel a little misled.

33
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,472
If this doesn't qualify as an
emergency, then what does?

[sighs]

35
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,017
I can't believe we actually
got roped into working

36
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,894
a public event like this.

37
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,688
Not much we can do, though.

38
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,982
I mean, after all,
this is the first joint event

39
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,484
between the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Welfare,

40
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,654
the MPD, and the
fire department.

41
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,614
You never can tell what's
gonna happen when people

42
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,283
come together.

43
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,159
Hey, look.

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,119
There are a couple more
victims over there.

45
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,917
Mr. Seki is out on
another job today, right?

46
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,544
What about Yui?

47
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,588
He sent us a message
saying he was tied up

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,965
sorting through files
so he couldn't make it.

49
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,593
That might be the lamest
excuse I've ever heard.

50
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,012
So, basically, he squirmed
his way out of this.

51
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,388
Well, you know how Yui is,

52
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,307
he's never been a
big fan of fieldwork.

Looks like he's here, Izumi.

Would you excuse me?
Be right back.

57
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,323
Where's she going?
Am I missing something?

58
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,033
[AOYAMA] I assume she
went to say hi to the star

It really has.

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,419
So, you're the honorary
police chief for the day, huh?

That's pretty cool!

Thanks for that.

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,926
When they first
gave me the offer,

67
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,762
I really wondered if I
was even cut out for it.

cleared up.

positive ending, right?

people who supported me.

it's nice to know

something to do with this, too.

to thank them.

00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,283
I'm really looking
forward to your win.

161
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,160
Yeah, dude! Leave it to me!

162
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,914
I'm gonna bring home that
ham as a gift for Mr. Kujo!

163
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,047
I mean, I'm definitely
gonna win,

164
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,550
so you can just sit back
and panic, big guy!

165
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,846
[IZUMI] Doesn't he mean
sit back and relax?

166
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,264
It's hard to say.

167
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,598
But probably.

168
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,436
Is there a reason
you're not going with him?

169
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,232
Yeah, I actually need to go
to that market over there.

170
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,484
The market?

171
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,695
What a coincidence.
I'm going, too!

172
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,989
If you don't mind,
maybe we could go together?

173
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,993
Of course! That sounds great!

174
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,873
[IZUMI] Are you looking
for something specific?

175
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,833
[MIYASE]
No, not exactly.

176
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,586
I just heard they had
a lot of unusual finds here.

177
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,254
So, I wanted to take a look.

178
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,216
So, um, how do you
know Mr. Kujo?

179
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,302
What's your relationship?

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,219
Huh?

181
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,096
Oh, it's just‐‐

182
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,473
Back when I met all
of you at that party,

183
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,267
I just naturally assumed
the other gentleman

184
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,603
was Mr. Kujo's bodyguard.

185
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,814
But I don't know, you seemed
a bit different to me somehow.

186
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,857
I see.

187
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,568
I'm an employee of the Kujos.

188
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,028
An employee?

189
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,822
I basically take care
of their personal needs.

190
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,783
I prepare meals for everyone
who lives at the mansion,

191
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,493
as well as the
cleaning and laundry.

192
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,081
Hey, have you ever gotten
to help Mr. Kujo out

193
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
with any of his work?

194
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,168
[MIYASE]
Hm?

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,211
Sorry, um...

196
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,879
I'd ask more
intelligent questions,

197
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,131
but I don't actually
know what he does.

198
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,175
Heh. I haven't.

199
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,385
I'm not involved in
anything too complicated.

200
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,929
That's not really my job.

201
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,141
Right, of course.

202
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,186
Sorry, I've always been
too nosy for my own good.

203
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,354
It's fine.

204
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,484
Those are so cute.

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,736
Yeah, they're called geraniums.

206
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,613
Are you a big fan of flowers?

207
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,823
I am. Definitely.

208
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,826
I even tend the grounds
at the mansion.

209
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,787
We have some of these out back.

210
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,206
Unfortunately, we don't
have any yellow ones.

211
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,417
But when they all bloom
at once, it's beautiful.

Yeah?

Gosh, that's embarrassing.

Oh, please, it happens
to me all the time.

224
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,953
In fact, my colleagues tease
me about it pretty regularly.

225
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,871
What a thing to have in common.

I guess we walked around
longer than we thought.

But I'm very glad we did,
because I had a really fun time.

Thanks for letting me tag along.

I wasn't expecting
such a gentle soul.

234
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,982
I shouldn't let my
guard down like that.

It's getting cold out here!

C'mon, time to go.

Yeah, I'm fine.

We've gotten no
new information yet.

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,522
Imaoji was looking into
Omori Pharmaceuticals,

244
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,607
wasn't he?

245
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,691
Yes, he is.

246
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,860
But as you might guess, they
have quite a few executives,

247
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,862
so it's taking him a long time.

248
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,113
I can imagine.

249
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,074
We might be able to
stumble across a clue

250
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,410
if we can talk to one of
the employees at his mansion.

251
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,579
But I guess we're not
likely to run into them.

252
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,124
I know, it was such
a crazy stroke of luck

253
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,169
that I ran into Miyase
and Kirishima like that.

00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,545
Huh?

255

Oh, I'm sorry, did I forget
to tell you about that?

256
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,509
Yeah, I ran into them
at the public fair.

I'm so sorry!

00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,685
Well, then? How did it go?

260
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,020
We just...

261
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,772
I mean, we only talked
for a little while,

262
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,734
so I didn't get anything useful.

263
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,987
First impression, neither
of them felt like bad people.

264
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,615
Miyase did seem a
little different, though.

I see.

266
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,370
But remember, if they're
close to Soma Kujo,

267
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,330
then there's a chance
they might also be involved

in the incident.

that you're being threatened?

So, that scary message you got.

We're having some trouble
tracking down the sender.

281

All the info in
the header was fake,

and we can't seem
to trace the IP.

reason I came to you.

what they meant?

not to get involved?

00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,043
So easy‐peasy.

320
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,670
[IZUMI]
Uh...

321
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,298
Admit it, that's all
you're really after, Yui.

322
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,884
[IZUMI] Listen,
I'm perfectly fine, okay?

323
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm sorry for
worrying all of you.

324
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,304
Please keep working.

325
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,934
Izumi.

326
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,227
[IZUMI]
Uh... Yes, sir?

327
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,066
[SEKI] Could you deliver these
documents to Watabe?

328
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,359
You can go home after that.

329
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,735
[IZUMI]
Huh?

330
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,487
Okay with you?

331
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,697
Sure.

332
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,615
[NATSUME]
Sounds good to me.

333
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,741
[IZUMI]
But I couldn't.

334
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,077
It's not so bad
that I need the day off.

335
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,787
Well, you may
feel okay right now,

336
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,831
but we wouldn't want
you to get any worse.

337
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,667
Don't push it.
Go rest and try to get better.

338
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,336
Hey, you heard them.

339
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,339
[IZUMI]
Yes, I did.

340
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,549
Thank you so much.

341
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,056
Maybe it's good that
they sent me home.

342
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,563
[knocking]

343
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,231
Door's open.

344
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,275
[IZUMI]
Pardon me. It's Izumi.

345
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,403
Ah, excellent timing, Rei.

346
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,946
I've been waiting for you.

347
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,869
[IZUMI] Then I guess you know
these documents are from

348
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,662
Mr. Seki.

349
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,789
Yeah, thanks for
delivering them.

350
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,957
Got a cold?

351
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,542
[IZUMI]
Yes. Nothing major.

352
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,253
You sure? Do you have a fever?

353
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,632
I'm totally fine!
Really, it's no big deal.

354
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,633
[WATABE]
Positive?

355
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,259
[IZUMI]
Yes.

356
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,553
Then I think you should at
least take a little break.

357
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,389
Must be hard being on the move.

358
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,600
Coffee's probably a bad idea.

359
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,019
How about if I make
you some hot tea?

360
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,729
[IZUMI]
Thanks, I'll stay a bit.

361
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,401
[WATABE]
Know what I heard?

362
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,987
That the event was
a monumental success.

363
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,656
Man, I love a festival.

364
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,201
Prizes, takoyaki,
candied apples.

365
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,204
Ours was a bit different.

366
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,124
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you seem kind of busy.

367
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,585
[WATABE]
Nah, it's always like this.

368
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,338
Oh, wow, is it really?

369
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,591
Mr. Watabe?

370
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,510
I hope you don't mind, Rei.

371
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,141
Yep, you see, I was right.

372
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,685
You have a fever.

373
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,979
You oughta take care.

374
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,734
Sorry to keep you for so long.

375
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,611
I'd be happy to take you home.

376
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,406
I'll go ahead and message Seki
to let him know what's up.

377
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,658
Um, he actually already
gave me permission

378
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,992
to go home early.

379
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,577
Oh, did he really?

380
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,663
In that case,
I'll finish up my work here.

381
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,582
Feel free to lie down
on the sofa while you wait.

382
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,875
That's a good blanket, too.

383
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,461
[IZUMI] I appreciate it,
but I'm fine right here.

384
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,714
Should I lay down next to you?

385
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,965
No way!

386
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,970
[WATABE] See? That's
what you get for yelling.

387
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,638
Let me take you home.

388
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,682
I'm actually grateful 'cause
you're giving me an excuse

389
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,891
to slack off.

390
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,647
We appreciate how hard you work,
but we all worry about you.

391
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,649
Don't push yourself
too hard, okay?

392
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,486
Yes, sir.

393
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,948
Great, that's settled.

394
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,329
[phone ringing]

395
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,958
[IZUMI]
Mr. Seki?

396
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,296
[IZUMI gasps]

397
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,133
[IZUMI] Everyone's pasts.
Their intentions.

398
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,053
They were all separate before,
but now they're intersecting,

399
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,847
creating a singular flow.

400
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,099
[phone rings]

401
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,068
Don't get swallowed up.
And don't stop.

402
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,323
Reach out with both
hands and find the truth.

403
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,576
Because you've made the decision
to discover it for yourself

404
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,704
no matter what happens,
or what awaits you.

405
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,220
[IZUMI] So this is the
Kujo Family mansion.

406
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,638
Keep your guard up.

407
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,348
Right.

408
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,892
The people coming today.

409
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,895
You know them somehow,
don't you, Koya?

410
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,229
I don't give a crap.

411
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,566
If they're Mr. Kujo's enemy,
then I'm gonna crush them.

412
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,484
Look, it's fine if you do,

413
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,779
but you've got to make
sure you finish the job, okay?

414
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,698
It would defeat the purpose
if they lived long enough

415
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,033
to get treatment.

416
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,121
You guys are terrifying.

417
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,754
[MIYASE]
You seem rather tired.

418
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,130
I'm fine.

419
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,132
You're sure about this?

420
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,052
Having someone from
the DCD come by?

421
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,970
[KUJO] The higher‐ups
at the Ministry of Health,

422
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,680
Labor and Welfare set this up.

423
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,766
I'm just going to
get it all over with.

424
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,188
By the way, don't try to
get involved with the DCD.

425
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,649
Relay that to Kirishima
and the others, too.

426
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,693
Understood, sir.

427
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,280
Okay, then, I'm ready.

428
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,491
Let's see what you've
got, now, shall we?
