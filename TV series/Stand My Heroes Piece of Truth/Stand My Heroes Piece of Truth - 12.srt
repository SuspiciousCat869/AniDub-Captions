[MIYASE] For as long
as I could remember,

3
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,152
she was the only one I had‐‐

my only family.

5
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,242
[MIYASE] My mother
worked for the Kujo Family,

6
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,078
and we lived in a detached
house on their property.

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,457
Thinking back, it may have been
odd, but I never questioned it.

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,044
My mother was always
such a kind person.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,047
But she would only smile
and change the subject

00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,091
if I asked about my father.

[MIYASE] Then as I got
older, something changed.

15
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,191
I began to look like
someone else to her.

16
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:53,822
Gradually, she grew more and
more depressed and lifeless.

17
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,117
Finally, she was
let go from her position,

18
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,953
and she shut
herself in her room.

19
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:04,207
I was just a kid.
All I could do was watch

20
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,961
as someone so precious
to me faded away.

21
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,964
And then, one night...

22
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,299
Either get this to your mother

and hold onto it yourself.

[MIYASE] Even though
the Kujo Family took me in.,

This family has a secret.

[KUJO] It's something
that I can't escape from.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,926
And everyone in this
household is aware of that fact.

But you...

The closer I got to him,

the more I understood
what he was talking about.

55
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,899
The dark rumors that
surrounded the Kujo Family

and the scrutiny
they were under.

The police and the DCD kept a
watchful eye on that household.

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
[MIYASE] I assumed he was
troubled by the knowledge

that he would have to take
over the family someday.

60
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,917

if I could help him,

61
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,045
if I could support him
just by being close to him,

How could he not be?

133

But he was still able
to reach out his hand

to a person in need.

135
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,373
I wanted to be like him.

136
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,043
To be someone who was
always willing to help.

137
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,294
Now here I am.

138
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,046
I'm fighting to

to protect someone, too.

any suspicion towards him.

Despite having such
a powerful father,

155
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,717
he never tried to
join the family register.

156
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,260
He just kept his head down

157

and continued
working as an employee.

158

A mother and her child.

159
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,974
It sounds like the Kujo Family

160
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,268
toyed with them
for years, doesn't it?

161
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,688
[MIYASE]
That mansion is a living hell.

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,899
Soichiro Kujo may be dead,

163
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,486
but if Soma Kujo is free,
the family will never die.

164
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,698
And so... I made a plan
to bring him down.

165
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,077
I wanted to remind you people
of the illegal drug, Plus,

166
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,288
and bring the family's
crimes back out into the light.

167
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,668
Now according to the dealer
that Imaoji was questioning,

168
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,796
the first time this batch of
Plus started to make the rounds

169
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,967
was about one year after
Soichiro Kujo passed away.

170
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,136
It's possible that
Miyase spread rumors

171
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,512
about how the drug was made

172
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,889
after finding out
who he really was.

173
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,684
I doubt he would have
tried anything that risky.

174
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,978
Miyase knew he had
to keep his head down.

175
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,229
You can't take down your enemies

176
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,939
if you're caught
too early, y'know?

177
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,734
Spreading the materials around
was really all he needed to do.

178
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,444
With that info out there,

179
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,280
he knew we were bound
to notice something,

180
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,614
but the leak
couldn't necessarily

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,158
be traced back to him.

182
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,451
The materials?

183
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,829
The signal from the flash drive!

184
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,372
[IZUMI]
Just as you planned,

185
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,542
we followed your trail right
back to the Kujo Family.

186
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,295
I had thought I handed you
everything you needed.

187
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,214
You could gather your evidence
and finally arrest him.

188
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,842
I had laid it all
out so carefully.

189
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,510
I obviously didn't consider that

190
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,764
you would actually try
to enlist Mr. Kujo's help.

191
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,893
That's rather brazen of your
organization, don't you think?

192
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,769
Job well done, STAND.

[ARAKIDA]
Kujo's gone.

198
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,074
He just up and disappeared.

199
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,542
Looks like his phone is off.

200
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,547
Do you have any idea where
Kujo might be headed now?

201
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,758
[HIYAMA]
Mm‐mm.

202
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,928
Although I do know of one
way that you can find him.

203
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,765
I believe there's a GPS
tracker attached to his car.

204
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,516
Anyone from the Kujo Family

205
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,352
should have access
to his location.

You can piss off!

As if I'd ever cooperate

with a frickin' evil
organization like yours!

After all that time you spent
painting Mr. Kujo as a villain,

now you're after Miyase?!

do you guys know anyway?

Nothing! There's no way
he would frame Mr. Kujo!

be right about Soma Kujo.

[MIYASE] To think the only
reason your luck ran out

was because you made the mistake
of trusting someone like me.

all lies then, Miyase?

I have a hard time believing
that wasn't the truth!

What happened to
the Miyase I believed in?

You're right about that.

The one I should point
this gun at is myself.

[IZUMI gasps]

252
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,262

I was going to make it look like

you threatened to kill me
if I didn't sell drugs for you.

And I falsified the
evidence to back that up.

255
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:17,482
The Kujo Family would finally
end with Soma Kujo at the helm,

At least, that's what I thought.

[MOHLW BRASS 1A] This is
a rather grave situation.

337
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,915
Correct me if I'm wrong,

338
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,375
but from all that
I've learned today,

339
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,961
I believe STAND's rampage
was due at least in part to

340
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,130
your lack of control
over them, was it not?

341
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,174
I'll have Senior
Superintendent Hattori

342
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,301
take full
responsibility for this.

343
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,179
But it began with
the DCD's rash actions.

344
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,390
On top of everything, they
even let the suspect escape.

345
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,808
I was also shocked to hear that

346
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,977
there was apparently
a female agent who had

347
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,480
gotten unusually close
to the suspect.

348
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,815
How about we stop this
pathetic display of trying

349
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:14,028
to cast blame and talk
about the real issue at hand?

350
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,696
STAND has always
been an independent

351
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,323
investigation agency.

352
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,242
Hattori should have had
total authority there.

353
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,577
But he didn't listen to you,

354
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,996
so now you're trying
to shift the blame to him.

355
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,956
I think there's something
fundamentally wrong

356
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,957
with that approach.

357
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,835
This thing is still
a project in its trial period!

358
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,629
The reason we're
here is to determine

359
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,215
if it's worth making
into an official agency.

360
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,175
So that's what we're doing.

361
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,551
And as you know full well,

362
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,304
I'm here simply as a third
party to listen and observe

363
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,806
and help ensure
that the two of you

364
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,101
are making the correct decision
regarding this situation.

365
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,395
Why not claim something
new for yourself,

366
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,315
even if only to reap the
plentiful future rewards?

00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,818
I'll tell you what I think.

368
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,403
STAND offers something unique,

369
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,947

save a lot of people.

Hm?

00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,793
I'm very aware of that.

373
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,671
I was just sitting here,
and thinking about the past.

374
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,048

[HATTORI]
Yeah.

376
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,348
But I think maybe I've dwelled
on it enough at this point.

383
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,620
[IZUMI gasps]

385
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,957
[IZUMI]
Huh?

386
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,546
[IZUMI] So now you're going
to officially join STAND, right?

387
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,339
Congratulations!

388
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,759
[AOYAMA] Is it really
worth congratulating?

389
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,094
[IZUMI] Well, you said you'd
only consider it after your

390
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:06,265
investigation into the cases
you were following was over.

391
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,559
So I guess I figured
that if you were joining,

392
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,103
that meant you
finally found closure.

393
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,315
And what about you
and your closure?

394
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,524
Huh?

395
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,527
Were you able to see it
through‐‐your own justice?

396
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,904
[gasps]

397
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,327
[IZUMI]
I'm afraid the scars that belong

398
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,496
to those people I wanted to save

399
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,040
aren't the kind that
will disappear easily.

400
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,755
[IZUMI]
But something I've learned

401
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,800
is that everyone is trying
to fight in their own way.

402
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,560
[IZUMI] For the things
they consider important.

403
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,231
And for the people
they care about.

404
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,447
So I want to keep
believing that.

405
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,500
[IZUMI] Even now,
I can't help but wonder.

406
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,921
[IZUMI] The reason I was
frozen in place that day...

407
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,925
...was it because my because
my legs felt weak or...?

408
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,306
[IZUMI] I have to figure out
if what I did was right or not.

409
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,517
And in order to do that,

410
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,187
I know that some day
I've got to see him again.

411
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,190
[IZUMI]
This isn't over yet.

412
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,610
The pieces of truth
are still scattered.

413
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,655
So until I'm able to
gather them all together

414
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,782
and see how they connect...

415
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:53,080
