00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,901
[IZUMI] The media has been
reporting that Makoto

2
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,654
was actually arrested.

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,700
The press is being ruthless
with both Makoto and Kyosuke.

4
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,245
I thought... Isn't there any
way you could at least announce

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,829
that he wasn't arrested?

6
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,749
I'm begging you!

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,503
I'm sorry, Damsel, but you
don't get a say in this.

8
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,506
I mean, after all,
this is our job, you know?

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,050
Specifically, it's STAND's job.

10
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,552
Why didn't you‐‐

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,137
[HATTORI]
Why didn't I tell you about it?

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,430
Isn't it obvious?

13
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,891
It's 'cause you're nothing
more than a scout, kid.

14
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,184
You're an outsider.

15
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:10,195
Mr. Hattori got it right about
me and that's the worst part.

16
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,613
At some point,

17
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,576
I think I let myself believe I
could be a real asset to STAND.

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,203
I mean, as more
than just a recruiter.

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,622
I thought maybe my body's
resistance to drugs

20
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,417
would end up being like
a superpower for the team.

21
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,133
You work hard,
and you never give up.

22
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,344
I believe you take
this job seriously.

23
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,431
But, you're dangerously naÃ¯ve.

24
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,350
Anyone can see how
badly you want to be

25
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,853
a real part of STAND,

26
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,230
but right now you
would just be a burden.

27
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,551
[WATABE]
Hey.

28
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,054
I heard that Rei's scouting
duties have been put on hold.

29
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,472
Yeah.

30
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,767
I was only notified
about it this morning.

31
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,853
So, now, the higher‐ups
are going to be the ones

32
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,230
in charge of scouting for STAND.

33
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,691
She's been ordered to go
back to her normal duties

34
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,735
till there's a new
candidate for the position.

35
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,653
Wow, did you tell her?

36
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,029
Yeah, I did.

37
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,656
She just gave me a smile.

38
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,366
Said to give her all
the work that she hadn't

39
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,784
been able to do lately.

40
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,994
Noble as ever.

41
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,789
Well, if that's the case,

42
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,167
maybe I'll go ahead
and ask her out on a date!

43
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,502
I could even use some PTO!

44
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,463
Slow down there, kid.

45
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,548
Why don't you head on home?

46
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,175
Li'l protective, Dad?

47
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,470
Aw, you old softie.

48
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,180
[SEKI]
Please stop calling me that.

[WATABE chuckles]

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,101
Scouting duties put on hold.

51
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,603
That means she must've
done something wrong,

52
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,479
don't you think?

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,565
If it has anything to do with
her going to the MPD yesterday,

54
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,526
then I feel totally responsible.

55
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,030
I keep thinking that maybe
I should've stopped her.

56
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,241
But, she honestly
seems to be doing okay.

57
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,035
I thought she'd be
more visibly upset,

58
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,704
but she looks pretty normal.

59
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm sorry, but are you
two completely blind?

60
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,250
Look!

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,170
Her shoulders are bent
six more degrees than usual.

62
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,422
The sides of her mouth
are also 2.2 millimeters

63
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,548
lower than normal,

64
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,468
and her conjunctiva
are slightly bloodshot!

65
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,763
Curse all of you! What if
Izumi's insanely rare DNA makeup

66
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,390
ends up changing from all
of this emotional stress?

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,101
I mean, seriously, what if
all her hair falls out?

68
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,146
[NATSUME] Any chance I could
get you to stop being a weirdo?

Well, this is interesting,

00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,567
who would've thought
you'd ever bother

71
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,611
to give me a call about work.

72
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,572
So? What brought this on,
then, Asagiri?

73
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,407
Look, don't even worry about it.

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,409
You can rest assured that
my feelings toward you

75

haven't changed a single bit.

What a coincidence.

[ASAGIRI]
Well? How is she doing?

Why are you asking me?

00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,921
She can tell you herself.

your department's doing.

me to say? We're doing our job.

If that's the case, then what
are you so concerned about?

Rookie or not, she'll be
able to understand that.

I'm not concerned about it.

They won't go away just
because you ignore them.

If you want to move forward,

106
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,250
you'll need to face

No control.
Not being able to help.

I mean... I couldn't
do anything about Makoto.

I couldn't even help Kyosuke
out when I wanted to.

I may have this
unique condition,

but it doesn't make
any difference.

Mr. Arakida saw
through me completely.

Everyone was only humoring me,
and I was so oblivious.

00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,093
to cheer you up, did you?

161
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,311
What are all these?

162
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,938
[AOYAMA] Those are the
results of some research

163
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,397
I've been doing for a while,

164
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,733
into an incident
involving a harmful drug.

165
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,819
Harmful in what way?

166
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,196
Well, there was this
certain pharmaceutical company

167
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,240
that was manufacturing
a new drug.

168
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,492
But it was never completed
because there were problems

169
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,327
during the clinical testing.

170
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,248
Those problems were significant
enough not to move forward.

171
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,125
There were participants
in the clinical test

172
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,794
who had some pretty sudden
and terrible side effects

173
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,546
during the trial.

174
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,381
Dizziness, nausea.

175
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,552
In some cases, test subjects
even had seizures.

176
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,929
I can see why it
wasn't completed.

177
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,099
Yeah. Sadly, the company
acted too late,

178
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,643
and the victim list
grew far too quickly.

179
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,396
Just one after another.

180
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
Sixteen years ago.

181
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,654
It was 16 years ago?

182
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,079
Wait a minute.

183
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,291
Then, were those
two car accidents...?

184
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,792
What are you saying?

185
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,419
[IZUMI]
Sixteen years ago,

186
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,171
Kyosuke and
Makoto's little sister

187
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,548
was involved in a car accident.

188
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,466
Apparently, the driver
was under the influence

189
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,428
of some kind of drug.

190
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,554
And also,

191
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,348
I encountered a major
accident 16 years ago

192
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,350
when I was just a little kid.

193
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,895
A nature park.
A car crashed into it.

194
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,482
In the amusement park.

195
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,985
Yes. That's exactly
where it happened.

196
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,446
In the amusement
park in the forest.

197
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,115
I'm familiar.
I know the incident well.

198
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,577
[IZUMI]
Mr. Aoyama...

199
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,998
Why are you doing this?

200
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,167
What made you decide to
start looking into this case

201
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,752
on your own?

202
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,297
Because the Aoyama
Trading Company,

203
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,299
my dad's business...

204
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,468
Turns out, they were
directly involved in funding

205
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,261
that new drug.

206
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,888
Aoyama Trading Company?

207
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,849
That huge... [gasps]

208
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,227
Wait, does that mean you're...

209
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,437
You're actually the son of...

210
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,272
[AOYAMA]
Yeah.

211
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,816
Hold on. There's something
I don't understand.

212
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,153
Neither of those were reported
as drug‐related incidents.

213
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:21,366
Not the park nor the accident
with Kyosuke's sister.

214
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,451
That's because there's
more to this story.

215
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,289
In order to avoid an enormous
amount of reputational damage

216
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,582
to the company,

217
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,752
they put a different spin
on the whole thing.

218
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,504
Both of these incidents
were dismissed

219
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,007
as being mere traffic
accidents, nothing more.

220
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,550
And they made it
look like the new drug

221
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,844
was never created
in the first place.

222
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,598
So that means...

223
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,641
[gasps]

224
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,352
[KYOSUKE]
It was complicated.

225
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,562
They never found
answers for any of it.

226
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,565
The case was left unsolved.

227
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,901
It was a cover‐up?

228
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,611
[AOYAMA] There aren't many
companies who can make it

229
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,114
so an incident never happened.

230
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
Look.

231
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,661
[IZUMI] The Omori
Pharmaceutical Company?

232
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,746
[AOYAMA] The one who
ordered the cover‐up.

233
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,582
It wasn't just a random
Omori employee,

234
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,669
but the top shareholder
and head of the Kujo Family.

235
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,881
The secret's still being
kept by this guy right here.

236
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,342
Soma Kujo, current family head.

237
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,765
[AOYAMA]
That man's got a bad reputation.

238
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,601
Don't go near him on your own.

239
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,272
[IZUMI]
The "Anonymous Case." Wait.

240
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,108
[MAKI] Have you heard
of the "Anonymous Case"?

241
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,488
I overheard the detectives.

242
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,701
It's weird. They kept
saying "Anonymous." Why?

243
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,495
[IZUMI]
Wait. Is all of this connected?

244
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,206
Sara's accident and the
incident at the amusement park

245
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,543
in the forest, and the
incident involving Maki.

246
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,795
They had the same root cause.

247
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,174
They're all drug‐related.

248
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,258
[AOYAMA]
One more thing.

249
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,472
What's this?
The component analysis of Plus?

250
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,932
That drug that was
just confiscated?

251
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,017
[AOYAMA]
Yeah.

252
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,227
And here's the component
analysis of the drug

253
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,565
Omori Pharmaceutical
created all those years ago.

254
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,525
[gasps]
They're the same!

255
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,693
Does that mean...?

256
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,653
This was the
prototype of that drug.

257
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:27,617
And now it's resurfaced again
after ten odd years, as Plus.

258
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,454
Somehow, the drug that killed
all those years ago is back.

259
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,873
Who would have access to data
that should've been buried

260
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,917
in the cover‐up?

261
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,795
The same people who were behind
the drug's initial creation

262
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,882
and who also happen to have
the means to distribute it.

263
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,093
Soma Kujo.

264
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,638
[AOYAMA] The rumors of him
presiding over drug deals

265
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,809
may be unconfirmed, but they're
still worth looking into.

266
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,228
Even though it
wasn't intentional,

267
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,648
if something they unleashed
into the world turned deadly,

268
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,443
they should still have to
take responsibility somehow.

269
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,530
So should I. Both of us.

270
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,323
Wait a minute, what do you mean?

271
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,620
[AOYAMA]
What I saw that day...

272
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,834
Seeing those children
hurt and their parents

273
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,546
screaming in fear
as they cried for help...

274
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,840
All the adults were
in such a panic.

275
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,176
None of them even
saw me standing there.

276
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,429
Even though I was
just a kid, I thought,

277
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,389
"This was all our fault."

278
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,434
I didn't want to face it,

279
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,186
but I knew in my gut that
my father had a direct hand

280
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,230
in making those things happen.

281
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,441
Sadly, though, I knew there
was nothing I could do

282
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,359
about it back then.

283
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,236
But it never sat right with me.

284
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,864
I felt angry and powerless.

285
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,491
I've never forgotten it.

286
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,744
Eventually, I began looking
into this case in earnest.

287
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,998
That got me interested in other
cases involving illegal drugs,

288
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,000
and so, before I knew it,

289
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,669
I found myself
in my current job.

290
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,299
I could've ignored it,
of course.

291
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,508
It's very clear.

292
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,428
Some people would rather keep
this buried and forgotten.

293
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,681
And I'm aware
people will get hurt.

294
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,057
But I don't care.

295
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm moving forward.

296
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,481
My conscience demands
that I settle this.

297
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,609
And until I can do that,
I won't be joining STAND.

298
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,778
[IZUMI] I guess that's your
justice, Mr. Aoyama.

299
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,157
You told me before, remember?

300
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,410
"The other side of justice
is another side of justice."

301
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,912
You're going to see
that it's served,

302
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,166
even if you end up seeming like
the bad guy to someone else.

303
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,503
I wish... I could make
a difference like that.

304
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,087
Every time I try to do anything,

305
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,299
I feel like I'm being told
that my help isn't needed.

306
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,759
And it hurts!

307
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,178
No, that's not right.

308
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
It's just so frustrating!

309
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,895
I want that.
To see my justice through.

310
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,271
The same way you do!

311
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,319
[AOYAMA]
You want to help?

312
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,366
Now that your scouting
duties are on hold,

313
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,951
you have some time, don't you?

314
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,245
But you‐‐
You've already gotten so far

315
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,248
doing all of this
research on your own.

316
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,749
[AOYAMA]
Like I said before.

317
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,918
You have a strong
sense of justice.

318
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,086
I admire that.

319
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,174
I already wanted
to ask for your help.

320
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,426
That's why I told you
this to begin with.

321
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,761
So, what do you think?

322
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,642
[IZUMI]
Well, I think...

323
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,352
If there's anything
at all that I can do

324
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,230
to help the people who've
been hurt by this incident,

325
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,648
especially my friends...

326
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,943
That's what I want to do.

327
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,076
I'd be honored to help you.

328
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,878
[IZUMI]
Hey, everybody.

329
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,673
I'm so sorry that
I've worried you.

330
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,967
Aw, we wanted to go out
drinking to cheer you up,

331
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,510
but now you seem fine.

332
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,682
Huh, looks like your eyes
aren't even bloodshot any more.

333
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,601
You seem to be
in perfect condition.

334
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,893
[chuckles]

335
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,562
Hey, good job, Aoyama.

336
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,689
Guess I won't need
that PTO after all.

337
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,611
I mean, I've got to admit.
This is something.

338
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,862
I'm impressed.

339
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,740
You managed to gather so
much information off the clock.

340
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,534
Seriously.

341
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,536
But now, we might
really be able to uncover

342
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,998
where Plus came from as well
as its main distribution route.

343
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,124
And in the process,

344
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,377
we'll probably find out more
about the Anonymous Case, too.

345
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,754
You know what that means.

346
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,256
We could discover the
reason they created STAND.

347
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,258
I mean, the real one.

348
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,593
Not to be a party‐pooper,

349
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,970
but finding too much could
lead to our destruction,

350
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,013
you know?

351
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,016
Well, I'm pretty sure it's too
late to turn back now, so...

352
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,393
Not to mention, of course,
that our damsel here

353
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,687
has said that she wants
to continue moving forward.

354
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,230
[IZUMI gasps]

355
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,441
Um, please don't call me that.

356
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,277
[SEKI]
Izumi. We're on your side.

357
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,779
That's really the point.

358
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,113
If this is the path
you've chosen,

359
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,115
then we're gonna
walk down it with you.

360
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

361
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,915
Really. Thank you all so much.

362
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,500
[phone chimes]

363
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,876
Excuse me!

364
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,055
I mean, I decided to
help Rei because I liked her

365
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,723
and no other reason than that.

366
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,767
This doesn't change anything.

367
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,769
Right? Kagura?

368
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,812
Who, me?

369
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,064
You know I'll do my job
as long as I get paid.

370
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't care.

371
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,109
Why can't you ever
just be honest?

372
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,151
Shut up, you.

373
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,028
Play the game. It's your turn.

374
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,032
[phone chimes]

375
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,702
[IZUMI chuckles]

376
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,415
[IZUMI]
These good people.

377
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,335
They're all around me, and they
say that they're on my side.

378
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,879
They even claim that
nothing will change that.

379
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,759
It's as if it's been raining
for a really long time,

380
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,803
and I've just been
keeping my head down,

381
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,055
fighting the cold.

382
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,473
But when I looked up,

383
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,101
I was treated to
a different view.

384
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,312
There was light piercing
through the clouds.

385
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,275
And one day, the sky
will be blue again.

386
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,486
I choose to believe that,
and to keep looking up.

387
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,248
[HIYAMA] So the guy we were
wary of apparently has his eyes

388
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,083
on you after all.

389
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,043
And on top of that,
it looks like he's recruited

390
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,255
that scout that I
mentioned to you before.

391
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,549
Listen, now that STAND
is also looking into

392
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,636
the Anonymous Case, you should
probably be more careful.

393
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,097
I know. I really should.

394
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,141
Especially if I want
to see this through.

395
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,105
[KIRISHIMA grunts]
Going to see Mr. Kujo?

396
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,691
Why, is he not
feeling well again?

397
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,360
[SHINDO]
He's been pretty busy lately.

398
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,904
We just need to
make sure he's at least

399
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,573
been taking some supplements.

400
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,867
I'll do my job, no matter what.

401
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,953
[KIRISHIMA grunts]
Of course.

402
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,622
If anyone ever
threatens that man,

403
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,542
I'm good and ready to
protect Mr. Kujo with my life.

404
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,044
But you're the doctor here,

405
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,546
and that means illnesses
are your department.

406
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,299
[MIYASE] Heh. You sound
like you're having fun.

407
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,183
Oh, that sucks.

408
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,061
I totally thought that was food.

409
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,687
[MIYASE] The geraniums
I was growing out back

410
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,690
have bloomed magnificently.

411
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,361
Mr. Shindo. Mr. Kujo
is actually free right now.

412
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,904
He's already off the phone?

413
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,782
Touching base with Mr. Hiyama
as usual, right?

414
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,951
Wonder what they talk
about during their chats.

415
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,203
You're telling me you
actually care about that?

416
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,999
As long as we're in this house,

417
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,461
Mr. Kujo must always be
the most important person

in our lives.
