Hmm.

[IMAOJI]
Are you kidding me?

4
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,800
We still can't get a warrant?

5
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,761
[SEKI] They said we don't have
enough for probable cause.

6
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,264
Even if we're right,
our evidence is circumstantial,

7
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,599
so good luck fighting
that decision.

8
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,018
We'll just have to
catch him in the act.

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,272
We need to confiscate the
goods as they change hands.

Are you sure?

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,734
I'll take responsibility.

12
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,445
First, we need to find out
exactly where this deal

13
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,822
will take place.

Kotaro Yui, with the DCD.

00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,249
We need your assistance
with our current case.

My name is Natsume.

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,460
Hope you can help us.

19
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,046
We're trying to track
down Mr. Soma Kujo.

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,258
Huh? Like we would
let you see him!

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,386
[SHINDO]
Wait. Track him down?

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,096
You mean he's not here?

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,685
What's goin' on?

24
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,290
No luck.

25
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,501
Hiyama still won't answer.

00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,877

[OTANI] If any one of
us gets into trouble,

28
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,217
it's up to the individual
to get themselves out of it.

29
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,010
That's always been
our rule, hasn't it?

30
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,556
If he wanted our help,
he would have said so.

31
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,433
But he didn't,
so he doesn't need us

32
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,892
to go looking for him.

[YUI] Well, we looked through
Soma Kujo's computer.

39
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,289
There's a meeting
with a supposed buyer

Got a location. We have to go.

Mr. Hattori!

In the flesh.

53
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,664
I was under the impression
your warrant request

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,832
was declined.

55
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, plans change.

56
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,211
You know our boss
is incredibly reliable.

57

Oh?

58
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,049
But tell me,
what brings you here?

59
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,676
Really? Do you think we
came here to have fun?

60

I'm sorry, we don't have
time for idle chitchat.

Then go ahead and take

65
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,399
to move freely in
cases such as this.

66
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,153
Does that mean you would
be willing to help us?

67

Yeah, you can count on us.

That's Takaomi Hiyama

taken their positions.

certainly a dramatic entrance.

[KUJO]
How can we help you gentlemen?

82
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,947
[AOYAMA] Start by telling us
what you're doing here.

83
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,241
[KUJO] I don't feel obligated
to explain that to you.

[AOYAMA]
If you want to stay silent,

85
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,995
then I'm afraid we'll have
to search your belongings.

86
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,622
I'm sure you won't mind.

87
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,501
Do whatever you need to do.

88
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,220
Pardon me, please.

89
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,739
[KUJO] I'm not sure what
you're looking for, but...

00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,032
It's not here.

91
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,451
I'm sorry you've
wasted your time.

92
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,953
Is that so?

93
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,246
You realize we're aware of
the drug trafficking route

94
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,374
run by the Kujo Family?

95
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,209
We have evidence that
you were going to conduct

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,919
a deal today.

97
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,212
If that's not the case,

98
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,673
we would like to know
what is going on here.

99
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,216
And you know, with so
many of us involved

100
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,260
at this point, even if we
come up empty‐handed tonight,

101
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,805
we will have to report
this to our superiors.

102
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,682
As I'm sure you're
both already aware,

103
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,184
if you choose not to speak
up and clear your names,

104
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,103
things might get
inconvenient for you.

105
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,562
Oh, I'm sure they will.

106
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,356
You'll see to that.

107
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,567
Very well, then.

108
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,861
Yes, we came here
to meet with someone.

109
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,073
Though he probably
won't show up now.

110
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,742
[AOYAMA] Why set up a
meeting in a place like this?

111
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,285
That was his request.

112
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,662
Who is "he"?

113
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,372
What's the meeting for?

114
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,915
A former attendant.

115
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,628
He was previously employed by
Soichiro Kujo, my predecessor.

116
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,964
I wanted to see if he could
give me more information

117
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,841
about Plus.

118
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,759
The Kujo Family
is not responsible

119
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,761
for its distribution this time.

120
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,681
But its composition is
very similar to a drug

121
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,933
that the former head
was involved with.

122
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,435
So that means...

123
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,895
It's the same formula as before.

124
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,690
My predecessor's
unfortunate legacy.

125
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,900
My goal was to find
the current distributor

126
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,111
and take care of
this problem at once.

127
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,362
"Take care?"

128
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,989
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,616
Do you mean to say you
weren't benefiting from it?

130
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,368
Don't insult me.

131
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,580
I wouldn't stoop so low
as to rely on that trash.

132
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,248
Sorry?

133
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,791
[KUJO] The last person
to care so much about

134
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,918
these drugs was my predecessor.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,171
They are no longer a part
of the Kujo Family's

136
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,964
business dealings.

137
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,550
As the head, I will make
amends for those actions

138
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,010
moving forward.

139
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,679
[HIYAMA]
It's true.

140
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,347
I can confirm all of it.

141
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,349
He's been looking
into his predecessors

142
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,311
and trying to uncover
their misdeeds.

143
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,188
I've been assisting
him with this.

144
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,357
If that's the case,
why didn't you tell us about it?

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,151
If you had just
explained everything,

146
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,361
you wouldn't have been
considered a suspect.

147
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,530
[KUJO] I don't want
the family's former evil

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,157
known to the public.

149
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,494
I sought the truth in order
to protect the Kujo Family now.

150
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,913
That's my responsibility
as head.

151
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,791
I don't expect
your understanding.

152
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,084
Whether or not
you choose to believe

153
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,545
everything I've just told you
doesn't matter in the least.

154
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,381
But, we all know there's
not a single reason

155
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
that I should be
apprehended here.

156
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,097
[IZUMI]
It does matter.

157
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,851
It absolutely matters.
You know that.

158
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,983
[IMAOJI]
Aoyama.

159
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
[AOYAMA]
What is it?

160
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,449
Plus!

161
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,081
I see.

162
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,833
I guess I should have known.

163
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,584
They resented me after all.

164
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,802
[KIRISHIMA] What do you mean
we can't see him?

165
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,972
[NATSUME] We found drugs
in the trunk of Mr. Kujo's car.

166
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,099
That's not something
we take lightly.

167
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,685
He and Mr. Hiyama
are being questioned now.

168
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,603
Unfortunately, we can't
allow you to see him

169
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,063
until that's over.

170
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,732
[KIRISHIMA] Mr. Kujo would
never do something like that!

171
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,069
How do you know someone
didn't try to frame him?

172
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,949
While we can't say for sure yet,
we do think it's a possibility.

173
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,992
You do?

174
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,494
Hey, we're supposed to
keep that on the down‐low.

175
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,745
And if that is the case,

176
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,415
we'll find the true
suspect no matter what.

177
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,042
I understand that you're
worried about him,

178
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:08,918
but please.

179
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,837
Know that we'll get
to the bottom of this.

180
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,466
So we now know how you feel,

181
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,344
but what does the Ministry
think about that theory?

182
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,097
All things considered,
it's hard to believe that Kujo

183
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,974
will get a fair treatment
in this circumstance,

184
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,350
framed or not.

185
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,561
Why should we trust
you to handle this?

186
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,989
So, how'd it go?

187
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,991
[SEKI] I told them that
the way we found the Plus

188
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,785
seemed unnatural. Too careless.

189
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,872
I suggested that somebody else
might have planted the drugs,

190
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,916
but that's not what
they wanted to hear.

191
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,627
Well. That's not surprising.

192
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,338
The Ministry and the MPD
had to agree to let Kujo

193
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,964
skate for a while
so they could watch him

194
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,634
and eventually take
down the whole family.

195
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,344
But they'll have to change
their approach now,

196
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,347
considering how convoluted
this has all gotten.

197
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,683
With an important witness
to the Anonymous Case

198
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,978
like Soma Kujo in custody,
they can cover it all up

199
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,397
and make sure none of
this sees the light of day.

200
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,107
I guess as long as
they get what they want,

201
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,817
how they do it doesn't matter.

202
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,779
At this point, even if he
was framed for the drugs,

203
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,073
Kujo's going to
take the rap for it.

204
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,157
[HATTORI]
So.

205
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,953
What are you guys
going to do, then?

206
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,874
Got the component analysis back!

207
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,338
What we confiscated
from him was Plus.

208
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,881
No doubt.

209
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,552
[IMAOJI] Now the trick is
figuring out if Mr. Kujo lied

210
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,805
and really did have
them in his possession.

211
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,015
Or if he was framed.

212
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,852
[IZUMI] Honestly,
I don't think it was his.

213
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,647
[NATSUME] Yeah, you said
that to the Kujo Family, too.

214
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,358
Be careful. There's no point
in giving false hope.

215
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,360
That's not what I was
trying to do, though!

216
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,653
Now, now.

217
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,698
Okay, so, Natsume, can I
assume from what you've said

218
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,284
that it's your opinion
the drugs were Kujo's?

219
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,827
Hard to say.

220
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,204
On one hand, considering
we've been investigating him

221
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,456
for so long, it seems
hard to believe

222
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,084
he could end up going down
for such a stupid mistake.

223
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,419
Yeah.

224
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,838
And till the trunk opened
at the warehouse,

225
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,507
I'd believed that it was
possible he was in the clear.

226
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,384
And you, Sosei?

227
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,053
I only have a guess,
so I can't say for sure.

228
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,223
So, what do you think?

229
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,811
Well, if he really isn't guilty,

230
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,564
then I guess I'm wondering
who would try to frame him.

231
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,775
The way Mr. Kujo reacted,
he might've had an idea.

232
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,153
Currently, I'd say that
our most obvious suspect

233
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,156
has to be whoever it was
he was going to meet there.

234
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,699
Hey, wait a minute.

235
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,451
You're talking about
someone framing him

236
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,453
as if he's some kind
of victim here.

237
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,621
But even if he's innocent
of this one thing,

238
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,874
the Kujo Family
has a shady history.

239
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,043
[SUGANO] Yeah, Kujo actually
admitted that, too.

240
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,337
Well, then something
is definitely off.

241
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,130
Don't you think it's
pretty dangerous to simply

242
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,050
take his word on
something so important?

243
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,594
I understand what you're saying,

244
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,263
but I still don't think
he's lying about this.

245
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,308
Going with her gut.

246
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,648
We need to make this
decision extremely carefully.

247
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,070
I mean, we're dealing with
the Soma Kujo after all.

248
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,447
Tell me, the car
you were using tonight,

249
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,282
is that how you
usually get around?

250
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,576
Correct, and it wouldn't
be easy for a third party

251
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,537
to access it, but not
impossible, either.

252
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,207
[AOYAMA] Any idea who might've
planted the drugs on you?

253
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,917
There are plenty of
people who may hate me

254
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,877
or hold some kind of grudge.

255
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,802
If you can't be
more helpful than this,

256
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,845
then I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you

257
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,514
tomorrow morning.

258
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,350
That would be pretty convenient
for you, wouldn't it?

259
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,605
[AOYAMA] Good, you get it.
I'll skip ahead.

260
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,606
It's true.

261
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,566
I couldn't care less if
you're actually innocent

262
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,943
or not in this case.

263
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,987
But I certainly don't believe
you're squeaky clean.

264
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,199
I know far too much
to ever assume that.

265
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,326
Even if you're choosing
not to dirty your hands,

266
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,371
personally, you committed
to keeping the family secret

267
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,290
when you became the head
of the Kujo Family.

268
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,084
I'm not going to let
you sit here and claim

269
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,545
to be completely innocent.

270
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,047
You said you'd protect
the family, right?

271
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,216
I wonder if you really
understand what it means

272
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,760
to make amends.

273
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,304
[KUJO]
Do you truly understand?

274
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,682
Do you even have a concept
of how many businesses

275
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,392
and enterprises we have?

276
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,060
If the Kujo Family is shaken,

277
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,937
then there's no doubt it
would have a ripple effect

278
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,481
on this country's
entire economy.

279
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,442
Protecting the Kujo Family.

280
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,402
That really means
protecting everyone working

281
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,237
under that name.

282
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,323
I understand that not
everyone sees it that way,

283
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,494
but I plan to do my job
as the head of the family.

284
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,705
[AOYAMA] Are you saying
that's more important

285
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,625
than trying to make things
right with all of those victims?

286
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,002
Correct.

287
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,379
This is what I've
resolved to do.

288
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,882
It's the justice
that I believe in.

289
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,974
[IMAOJI] So, if we set
everything else aside,

290
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,227
and we keep our focus solely on
what just happened today,

291
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,812
I think all of us
can agree that there's

292
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,023
a high possibility
that he was framed.

293
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,066
A very high possibility.

294
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,652
If we set everything
else aside, then yes.

295
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,404
Should we let him go, then?

296
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,363
Well...

297
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,325
I think keeping him here
would be a good option, too.

298
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,827
It's a chance to find
his other possible crimes.

299
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,954
This could be pretty
beneficial to STAND

300
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,164
in the end.

301
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,750
Yes, I guess that is an option.

302
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,668
[IMAOJI] But then,
wouldn't the truth get twisted?

303
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,795
I don't know if that's
something we want to risk.

304
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,049
[SUGANO] I mean, yeah,
you've got a point.

305
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,468
[ARAKIDA]
What about you, Izumi?

306
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,095
Why are you so intent
on protecting Kujo?

307
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,766
The thing is...

308
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm very aware he could
be involved with the drugs,

309
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,146
and that it would be
beneficial to keep him here.

310
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,190
I do get that.

311
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,860
Mr. Kujo might not be
completely in the clear.

312
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,363
But what I think is
that he has his own

313
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,198
sense of justice.

314
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,491
And right now,

315
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:17,578
I think all he's trying to do
is see that justice through.

316
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,665
I think we can
all relate to that.

317
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,376
Mr. Kujo's sense of justice
comes from a different place

318
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,629
than ours does.
I won't try to argue that.

319
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,550
But if someone's simply
believing in his own justice

320
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,843
and trying to seek
that out for himself,

321
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,720
and then that person
ends up being blamed

322
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,181
for something he didn't even do,

323
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,227
I don't know. I just don't
think I can let that slide by.

324
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,646
My goal here is to
never turn something right

325
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,606
into something wrong.

326
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,692
It's like Imaoji said before.

327
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,152
If the truth keeps
on getting twisted,

328
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,696
then we might lose
something important

329
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,240
along the way.

330
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,451
That's the last thing I wanna
do on a case like this.

331
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,996
[NATSUME] You're earnest
to a fault, aren't you?

332
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,207
You really are, Rei.

333
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,876
[YUI]
But that's necessary.

334
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,838
Especially with this job.
As we know.

335
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,089
Yeah.

336
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,719
Going after a suspect
is a detective's job.

337
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,637
I won't argue with that.

338
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,306
Okay, so basically,

339
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,890
we've decided to go
catch the person

340
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,226
who's actually
behind this, right?

341
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,312
[HATTORI]
Well, aren't you a lively bunch.

342
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,940
[SUGANO]
You!

343
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,568
[IZUMI]
Mr. Seki! Mr. Watabe!

344
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,069
Good work today.

345
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,529
Well, you heard
what he just said,

346
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,948
so you should be able
to guess what's coming next.

347
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,450
You'll clean it up later.

348
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,993
Right, Watanabe?

349
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,369
You mean Watabe.

350
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,623
Did you seriously just
get my name wrong?

351
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,292
But yes, I'll keep the
higher‐ups off your backs

352
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,754
for a while.

353
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,963
Here on out,

354
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,882
STAND and the DCD
will be working together

355
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,051
as a team.

356
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,053
[HATTORI] Our main objective
is to arrest the suspect

357
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,889
who framed Soma Kujo.

358
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,183
You aren't going home
until we catch them.

359
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,268
Just keep that in mind.

360
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,353
[GROUP]
Yes, sir.

361
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
Now, then.
It's going to be a long night,

362
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,982
so how about I grab
us something to eat.

363
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,734
Only thing open now
is a convenience store,

364
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,444
so what would you like?

365
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,696
Hey, thanks, I really
appreciate that.

366
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,449
I'd like a caramel macchiato
with an extra shot, please.

367
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,950
Oh, and make it soy.

368
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,037
Something filling.
Preferably containing glucose.

369
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,331
That I can eat with
one hand, please.

370
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,124
That s'posed to be a riddle?

371
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,293
So, uh, are we allowed
to request anything

372
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,462
we want to eat right now, or?

373
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,673
[WATABE] Yeah, sure. As long
as you remember I'm going

374
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,217
to a convenience store.

375
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,095
So, is this what
the DCD is usually like?

376
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,013
[IZUMI laughs]

377
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,766
No way.
It's never this lively in here.

378
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,477
First, we're going
to need to find whoever

379
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,187
that former attendant was.

380
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,438
Yes, I agree.

381
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,649
That's already
being taken care of.

382
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,072
[KAGURA] Well so far, it appears
that this former attendant

383
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,699
really doesn't want to be found.

384
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,450
There's so little
information that I'm afraid

385
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,245
it's gonna take some
time to track them down.

386
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,872
You know you're happy
they're relying on you.

387
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,833
Well, that goes for you, too!

388
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,959
Sure does.

389
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,678
[phone rings]

390
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,096
Izumi here.

391
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,139
[KANAME]
Miss...

392
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,432
Kaname?

393
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,225
[KANAME]
I'm sorry to call so late,

394
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,977
but have you heard from Go?

395
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,270
He's not at the house.

396
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,024
Ever since we learned
of Mr. Kujo's arrest,

397
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,527
Go's been acting really weird.

398
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,279
Then there's that night.

399
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,281
It's been bugging me.

400
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,116
Okay. I'll be right there.

401
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,750
[KANAME]
Miss?

402
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,588
[IZUMI]
Mr. Aoyama?

403
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,966
Would it be all
right if I were to leave

404
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,634
for just a little while?

405
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,303
[AOYAMA]
What happened?

406
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,889
I found out that
Mr. Miyase is missing.

407
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,016
May I please go look for him?

408
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,726
Well, I don't know,
do you think that should

409
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,437
take priority right now?

410
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,482
[IZUMI] It's just that I'm the
one who asked for his help.

411
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,317
So, if in doing that

412
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,570
it ended up making
him feel trapped,

413
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,822
I can't possibly abandon him.

414
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,575
Please, sir.

415
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,620
[AOYAMA]
All right. Then go ahead.

416
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,123
Thank you, Mr. Aoyama!

417
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,547
[IZUMI]
We wanted to protect something.

418
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,259
And we wanted to save someone.

419
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,221
We hesitated countless
times and we stumbled.

420
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,681
But even then,
we still kept running,

421
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,643
firm in our sense of justice.

422
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,354
I don't always know
the right answer,

423
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,440
but I don't regret the fact
that that's how I got here.

424
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,737
No matter what conclusion
may await me now.

425
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,624
So he's...

426
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,670
[ARAKIDA]
He's dead?

427
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,214
Yes, we just received
word from Revel.

428
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,091
The imposter was
quite convincing,

429
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,385
but definitely a fake.

430
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,221
He disguised himself
as the former attendant,

431
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,142
then used his assumed identity
to get close to Soma Kujo.

432
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,685
That seems like a
really roundabout way

433
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,062
of doing it.

434
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,897
I mean, they went
through so much trouble,

435
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,941
but then if we hadn't shown up,

436
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,069
it all would've
been for nothing.

437
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,695
Wait a minute,
where did we even get

438
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,031
the information about
the deal tonight?
