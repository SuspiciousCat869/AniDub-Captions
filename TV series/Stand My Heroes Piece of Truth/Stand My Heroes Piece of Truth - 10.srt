1
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,682
[IZUMI] I'm sorry for asking
you to meet me so early.

2
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,683
It's all right.

3
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,269
I'm the one who said
I wanted to see you.

4
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,314
I feel bad. You came
so far before work.

5
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,608
No! I'm the one who
asked for your help

6
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,777
with all of this
in the first place.

7
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,487
Thank you so much.

8
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,200
What's the word
on the questioning?

9
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,245
Right now, the MPD's top brass
is still negotiating that.

10
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,789
But we think

11
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,791
this could be the chance
we've been waiting for

12
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,335
to learn more about Mr. Kujo.

13
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,802
[MIYASE] I guess this was
a remote place to meet,

14
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,305
but I suggested it for a reason.

15
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,599
It used to be a little
amusement park.

16
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,601
Did you know that?

17
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,061
Yeah, I'm familiar with it,

18
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,897
but it closed after
that big accident.

19
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes. I was actually
here that day.

20
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,151
[gasps]

21
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,653
My mom brought me.

22
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,365
So this place has always
been nostalgic for me.

23
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,536
Especially since she's gone now.

24
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,540
That's also part of
the reason Mr. Kujo is...

25
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,835
Please don't get the wrong idea.

26
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,878
I haven't given up on him.

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,714
But thank you for being
honest with me.

28
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,383
I appreciate that. Don't worry.

29
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,760
And don't overwork yourself.

30
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,053
Right.

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,557
[AOYAMA] Let's run through
everything we know so far.

32
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,892
First of all, we have SQUARE.

33
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,895
We're fairly certain that this
was the base drug for Plus.

34
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,856
Then there's the Kujo Family.

35
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,816
Given their link to
Omori Pharmaceuticals,

36
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,652
it's possible they had something
to do with its creation.

37
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,072
Finally, we have a key figure
behind the research for SQUARE:

38
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,449
Yuki Hibiya.

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,118
Hibiya was murdered by
an ex‐detective named

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,788
Masayoshi Ida, who can be
connected to Makoto Tsuduki,

41
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,498
currently in STAND custody.

42
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,333
We want Izumi to meet with him

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,335
to see if she can draw out
enough information

44
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,962
to solve the Anonymous Case.

45
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,549
But top brass hasn't allowed
them to speak just yet.

46
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,551
It's a tough case, for sure.

47
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,595
[NATSUME] I know they want to
handle the Anonymous Case

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,681
quickly and quietly, since one
of their own was involved,

49
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,892
but Mr. Hattori is
struggling to negotiate

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,560
a talk that could
actively help them.

51
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,854
I guess all we can do is wait.

52
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,981
Kotaro.

53
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,609
Have you turned up any
new information on Plus?

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,152
Unfortunately, no.

55
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,695
I've gotten pretty
much all the data

56
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,364
I can out of the sample we have.

57
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,240
Moving forward,

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,826
we're going to need details
from outside the lab.

59
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,745
So you're up, Imaoji.

60
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,954
Have any luck?

61
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,998
You questioned the guy
who had it, right?

62
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,959
Oh, yeah, the one
Mr. Asagiri arrested.

63
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,836
He did have a lot of it on him.

64
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,547
He was kinda stubborn at first.

65
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,799
But after a while,

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,552
I got him to open up
about how he came by it.

67
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,305
Apparently, the drugs were
given to him as a sample.

68
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,391
He had also caught wind of a
particular rumor among dealers

69
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,393
about an incoming shipment
of Plus to be sold

70
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,939
on the black market
in massive quantities.

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,483
Which means there's a
huge deal in the works

72
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,485
and someone is about
to close on it.

73
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,695
And if Soma Kujo is
involved with that,

74
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,989
we could get to kill two birds
with one stone, right?

75
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,033
We could expose him on the spot.

76
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,285
That would be a
pretty big win for us.

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,996
[AOYAMA] That's true,
but it's easier said than done.

78
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,458
[YUI] If Mr. Off‐on‐Time would
stake out the Kujo Family 24/7,

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,584
we'd have a chance, but‐‐

80
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,002
[NATSUME]
Yeah, that's not happening.

81
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,797
[IMAOJI] Aw, come on.
I'll bring you some snacks.

82
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,474
[AOYAMA] You sure are
easy to read, you know.

83
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,184
Don't forget,

84
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,937
Miyase is close
to the Kujo Family.

85
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,607
He may be cooperating, but we're
seeking different answers.

86
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,984
We don't know how he'll act

87
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,111
when he gets one
he doesn't like.

88
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,946
So keep that in mind
moving forward.

89
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,030
He's only human.

90
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,365
I know!

91
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,659
But Mr. Miyase is rational.

92
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,912
He understands Mr. Kujo,
likely better than anyone.

93
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,039
When you talk to him
in person, you can tell

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,250
how deep the trust
between them is.

95
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,751
[AOYAMA]
So you'll just blindly believe

96
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,503
what he says about Soma Kujo?

97
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,005
No, I‐‐

98
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,467
[sighs]

99
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,595
You need to hold off
on meeting with Miyase

100
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,221
for a little while, all right?

101
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,806
He's going to
influence you further

102
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,267
and that will skew
your judgment.

103
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,770
[IZUMI] Understand that you're
being biased, too, Mr. Aoyama.

104
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,856
It's just... you're
already convinced

105
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,818
that Mr. Kujo is the one we're
after, but I'm not so sure.

106
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,362
I have a hard time
believing that the person

107
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,075
the entire Kujo Family
looks up to can be that bad.

108
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,328
‐‐That's why I‐‐
‐‐[AOYAMA] I got it.

109
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,913
That's enough. I got it.

110
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,915
[gasps]

111
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,458
Right, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,085
[AOYAMA] You have nothing
to apologize for.

113
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,404
[footsteps]

114
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,739
[HATTORI]
Hm?

115
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,743
Well, well. What
brings you two here?

116
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,581
[WATABE] We just thought we
might bring you a snack.

117
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,418
So, what can I do for you?

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,628
[SEKI]
Izumi told us what you said

119
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,380
about why STAND was established.

120
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,216
And the MPD's motive.
We have some questions.

121
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,093
Yeah?

122
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,427
Most importantly,

123
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
do you approve of the direction
the agency is taking?

124
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,182
[HATTORI]
Hmph.

125
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,851
What, the Damsel didn't
tell you herself?

126
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,812
Of course, I'm not helping
because I have to,

127
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,897
I got involved of my own accord.

128
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,858
The police don't mind sweeping
something under the rug.

129
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,652
Color me surprised.

130
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,903
All things considered,

131
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,281
I'd prefer to keep Rei out of
the filthy affairs of the MPD.

132
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,410
Regardless of how helpful she
might be to your cover‐up.

133
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,454
[HATTORI] Hmph. Do you really
believe that the police are

134
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,541
the only ones engaging
in a cover‐up?

135
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,835
Considering the DCD's goals,

136
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,129
surely you understand
our common interest.

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,630
It's a big one.

138
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,007
Of course I do.

139
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,135
It's why the Ministry joined
STAND in the first place.

140
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,262
The Kujo Family.

141
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,514
STAND is rounding up
anybody and everybody

142
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,684
who was involved with
the Anonymous Case.

143
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,978
Now then, what do you suppose
they're going to do

144
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,440
with Soma Kujo after the case
has finally been put to bed?

145
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,817
I understand.
If they keep him close,

146
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,861
the Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare

147
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,447
can easily keep an eye
on the Kujo Family.

148
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,657
When the MPD is done
with Kujo himself,

149
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,826
they plan to pounce on
the drug trafficking ring

150
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,870
that's being run out of
that household by him

151
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,080
and the rest of the Family.

152
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,249
That explains it, then.

153
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,586
Why they wouldn't rule Kujo
out as a STAND candidate.

154
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,921
There are monsters behind
those heavy doors,

155
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,923
Ministry and MPD alike.

156
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,552
That said, we should all
take a little extra care.

157
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,388
Our bosses set up a shady
agency for shady purposes,

158
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,767
and now we both have
subordinates involved.

159
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,811
The adults really need to start
pulling their weight, here.

160
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,354
But that's partially
why I'm going to have

161
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,356

162

[WATABE, SEKI]
Huh?

163
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm really counting on her.

164
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,033
Wait, are you serious?

165
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,327
Yes. Thanks to Hattori,

166

with you and Makoto Tsuduki.

167

Mr. Hattori...

00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,960
[SEKI] Unfortunately,
we have another problem.

169

They can get you in the room,

but he still won't
speak to anyone.

Mm, yes?

00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,576
Uh? Hi, Kyosuke.

176
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,038
Miss Rei. It's so nice
to see you again.

177
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,086
I had a feeling that
must have been you.

178
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,046
Uh?

179
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,925
I mean the flowers.
They're really pretty.

180
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,843
Here you go.

181
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,553
Thanks so much.

182
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,181
It's no problem.
I should thank you.

00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,558
[IZUMI]
Hm?

184
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,935
The police called me
a little while ago.

185
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,146
You're going to talk
to my brother?

186
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,232
I'll try. But it doesn't really
sound like he wants to.

187
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,318
I hear ya. He can be
pretty stubborn.

188
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,489
It's about the Anonymous
Case, isn't it?

189
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,991

00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,617
Mm‐hm.

191
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,870
Sometimes Makoto
would have moments

192
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,415
where he was sort of
weird and withdrawn.

193
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,419
Like he was waiting for
someone to contact him.

194
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,422
I'm sure he's hiding something.

195
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,801
Maybe he won't talk yet because
he's trying to protect someone.

196
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,054
Although...

197
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,099
Miss Rei, I promised
I would join STAND

It's been a little while.
Good to see you.

00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,050
Kyosuke seems to trust
you a great deal,

although I suppose that really
shouldn't surprise me.

That's nice of you,
but to be honest,

that's not it.

Your brother believes in you
more than anything.

[KYOSUKE]
Listen, meet with Miss Rei.

216
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,026
I want you to talk to her.

217
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,070
I've noticed something
interesting.

218
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,114
The flowers in Sara's
room are always new.

219
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,200
With everything going on,

220
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,161
I haven't been able to visit
her as much as I'd like,

221
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,537
but when I do,

222
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,959
there are always fresh
flowers there in her room.

223
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,669
To be perfectly honest,

224
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,504
I think Miss Rei is
really the only person

225
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,881
who's looking out
for Sara right now.

226
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,634
And for us.

227
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll never ask you
for anything again.

228
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,682
Please, trust her.

229
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,101
Always been a sucker
for requests like that,

230
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,271
especially from him.

231
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,147
Nothing else would've
compelled me.

232
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,482
That's the truth.

233
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,361
This is something I'd planned
on taking to my grave.

234
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,154
So, let's begin.

235
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,915
[MAKOTO] The officer in
charge of Sara's case

236
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,710
was named Masayoshi Ida.

237
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,962
After we were told that
the case had been solved,

238
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,964
and that the cause was
determined to be just some

239
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,301
random person on drugs,
no one seemed to care anymore.

240
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,388
But he still came around
and kept looking after us.

241
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,600
He didn't forget my
sister or our family.

242
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,979
But then, suddenly, Ida
stopped coming by to visit us

243
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,897
and we never saw him anymore.

244
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,191
I was confused by that,
but around that time,

245
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,777
I found out about
the Anonymous Case.

246
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,779
And I...

247
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,907
I had a feeling he might
be the suspect because...

248
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,243
...I gave him something

249
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,537
the last day that
we saw each other.

250
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,539
What was it?

251
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,083
My novel. Unfinished.

252
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,128
[IDA]
A crime novel?

253
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,256
Yeah. It centers on the
confessions of a murderer.

254
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,884
You know, I'm a little surprised
you wanted to show me this,

255
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,261
considering an officer
commits murder.

256
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,890
Oh, I wasn't trying to
imply anything.

257
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,308
This policeman‐‐

258
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,897
he lost someone he loved a lot,
so he's out for revenge.

259
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,650
I also feel like if the person
who did this to Sara

260
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,945
were to appear
before me right now...

261
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,823
And then, if I could think
up the perfect crime

262
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,368
to commit against them...

263
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,453
Then I might...

264
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,955
The protagonist in
the story is me.

265
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,502
So I stopped him because he
was choosing the wrong path.

266
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,880
[IDA]
I wonder about that.

267
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,965
[MAKOTO]
Murder can be justice.

268
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,176
Those who have a convoluted
sense of justice

269
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,470
can believe that they're
doing the right thing.

270
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,431
That's what the novel was about.

271
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,557
I know this might sound like

272
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,185
the ramblings of
an arrogant writer,

273
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,146
but I can't help thinking

274
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,900
that maybe what finally sent
Masayoshi Ida over the edge‐‐

275
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,276
That it was me.

276
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,987
I was the one who had
made him into a criminal.

277
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,492
[IZUMI]
Have you seen him since?

278
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,620
Did he ever contact you again?

279
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,705
Yes, just once.

280
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,958
He apologized for not
being able to return

281
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,752
my unfinished novel.

282
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,171
He even went on to
praise me as a writer.

283
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,840
He said he thought
the conclusion

284
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,217
that I'd come up with
was a good one.

285
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,593
What was it?

286
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:32,098
I mean, what ends up
happening to the protagonist?

287
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,683
He ends his own life.

288

[gasps]

289
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,521
[MAKOTO] In the final chapter,
the protagonist is already dead.

290
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,231
One could kind of
consider the book

291
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,817
to be his last will
and testament.

292
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,402
That was my plan.

293
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,279
So, you mean...?

294
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,784
You guys don't have any new
information on him, do you?

295
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,079
Correct. All we know is
that before Masayoshi Ida

296
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,998
went on the run, he took
something that belonged

297
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,666
to the victim, Mr. Hibiya.

298
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,003
Later, he was spotted at
an unexpected location.

299
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,130
"Unexpected"?

300
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,424
It's a little perplexing,
to be honest,

301
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,634
because I feel pretty certain
he wouldn't have wanted

302
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,597
anything of Mr. Hibiya's
to end up there.

303
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,975
Look, Makoto, do you have
any ideas that could help us?

304
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:20,438
No matter how insignificant
they may seem.

305
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,607
Maybe...

306
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,985
On the phone,
right before we hung up,

307
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,821
I heard him whisper something.

308
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,741
It sounded kind of
like he was relieved.

309
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,202
"Don't worry... I..."

310
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,080
Don't worry. I gave
it to the child.

311
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,374
What does that mean?

To what child?

What're you whimpering about?

317
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,234
[IZUMI]
Huh? Kaname.

318
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,236
Are you here to see Go again?

319
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,738
He said earlier he was
going out today, so...

320
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, no. I came to see Mr. Kujo.

321
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,368
You coming?

322
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,620
Uh, well, I...

323
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,414
He'll probably be out in
the garden at this hour.

324
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,291
So I'll just take you there.

325
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,336
You should really leave
if he's not there, though.

326
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,463
Sure. Thanks, I will.

327
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,550
I have to say, it seems
like Go trusts you.

328
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,594
You're not a bad person,
right? I hope not.

329
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,556
[lock clinks, gate creaks]

330
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,689
Oh, that's right.

331
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,566
I meant to thank you for
looking into those things

332
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,692
for me the other day.

333
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,653
You really did help me out.
Thanks so much.

334
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,947
Looked into things?
What do you mean?

335
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,157
I don't follow.

336
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
You should go ahead and
forget about that night.

337
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,579
I'll forget about it, too.

338
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,888
How are you?
Still not feeling well?

339
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,473
No, I'm fine.

340
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,647
It's beautiful out here!
Do you garden, Mr. Kujo?

341
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,565
[KUJO]
No.

342
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,610
Oh, of course, Mr. Miyase
takes care of this garden,

343
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,696
doesn't he? It seems
very important to him.

344
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,742
That's lovely. It's nice to
have such devoted friends.

345
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,749
[KUJO]
I've never gardened.

346
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,793
But, just once, I did
send someone flowers.

347
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,379
I think they were called...
kalanchoe.

348
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:54,175
[IZUMI] Kalanchoe? What kind
of flowers are those?

349
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,260
I wasn't around
when they bloomed.

350
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,387
I just looked through
an encyclopedia

351
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,599
and I chose the one
that caught my eye.

352
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,773
[IZUMI]
Mr. Kujo,

353
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,736
we've recently uncovered details
about a drug called Plus.

354
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,363
Rumors are flying around.

355
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
Some people are saying
it's about to be sold

356
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,283
on the black market.

357
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,369
Tell me, sir, do you
happen to know anyone

358
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,246
who's going to be
involved with this deal?

359
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,749
Why would you ever ask me
something like that?

360
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,418
I have no idea,
and I assure you,

361
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,088
I have nothing to do
with this drug, "Plus."

362
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,422
Okay, then.

363
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,717
What about... someone else
from the Kujo Family?

364
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,968
For example?

365
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,097
Well, several years ago,
at Omori Pharmaceuticals,

366
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,224
someone named Yuki
Hibiya was working

367
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,809
on an experimental drug.

368
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,894
And there's a very
strong possibility

369
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,271
that that was the
base drug for Plus.

370
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,692
There's also evidence that the
data Omori lost on that drug

371
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,736
ended up right here,
at your mansion.

372
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,159
Now, I see.

373
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,329
And I also understand why
you stopped by today.

374
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,041
But... you're far too careless.

375
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,127
You disclosed all that
information to someone

376
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,878
you suspect might be involved.

377
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,964
I won't admit to
anything, of course.

378
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,383
I'm not as easy as all that.

379
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,884
I'm sure you were
all but convinced

380
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,221
that your magnetic personality
and that strong sense of justice

381
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,640
would've gotten through to some
of the people around here,

382
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,559
but those things
won't work on me.

383
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,727
That's not what I was‐‐

384
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,688
Sure. That might not've
been your intention.

385
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,106
[gasps]

386
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,693
[KUJO] Nevertheless, you're
managing to cause trouble here.

387
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,363
Which is why I described
you as being careless.

388
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,200
[KUJO]
You should take your leave.

389
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,537
I'm sure you don't want
to make Kaname look bad.

390
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,248
[IZUMI]
Please excuse me.

391
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,672
[door opens]

392
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,384
[MIYASE] Hey, I'm back.
Sorry I'm running a bit late.

393
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,429
I'll go ahead and get
started working on dinner.

394
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,432
That DCD lady stopped by.

395
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,475
She did?

396
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,809
[KANAME] Though it looked
like she just chatted

397
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,979
with Mr. Kujo for a bit.
Then she left.

398
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,742
[phone rings]

399
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,535
[IZUMI]
Mr. Miyase?

400
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,078
This is Izumi.

401
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,164
[MIYASE] I'm sorry to call you
out of the blue like this.

402
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,793
[gasps] It's fine.
Is something wrong?

403
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,587
[MIYASE]
Mr. Kujo. He's gone.

404
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,963
He left the house on his own

405
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,841
without taking any
kind of escort.

406
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,261
I wasn't sure if I
should tell you, but...

407
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,306
Listen... I'm begging you...

408
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,268
Help him. Please stop Mr. Kujo.

409
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,313
It's just... he could be...

410
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,985
[IZUMI] I want to find
out more about the man

411
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,949
who had shown me such a gentle
side, for the very first time.

412
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,078
What is he thinking right now?
And who is he thinking about?

413
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,413
There's so much genuine
warmth from those

414
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,291
who care for him
every single day.

415
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,085
I can feel it.

416
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,925
[IZUMI]
But...

417
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,931
[IZUMI] ...I still don't know
what's true, and what isn't.
