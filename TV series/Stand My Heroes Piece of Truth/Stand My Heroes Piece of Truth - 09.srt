[SEKI]
Plus‐0?

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,444
Its official name is SQUARE.

3
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,904
In the sample photo we received,

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,406
there were two tablets
in one set.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,034
Well, the good news is,
we can pretty much confirm

6
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,496
just from the reports Izumi's
gathered that SQUARE

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,790
is what Plus was
directly modeled after.

8
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,126
Which means,
we can be fairly confident

9
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,128
it's the new drug
Omori Pharmaceuticals

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,838
was in the process
of developing.

11
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,467
Wait, if we already
know that the data needed

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,844
to create Plus came
from the Kujo Family,

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,555
then doesn't that mean
we've actually caught

14
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,265
Mr. Kujo red‐handed?

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,475
See, I believe in Mr. Kujo,

16
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,602
and my mind won't
change on that.

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,564
Miss Izumi.

18
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,983
Knowing all of that,
would you still be willing

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,317
to take my hand?

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,655
[IZUMI] All of that is
exactly why I asked

21
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,574
for your help, Mr. Miyase.

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,333
Very well, then.

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,043
I'll help you however I can.

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,882
[SEKI] I dunno what, but the
brass is plotting something.

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,219
And let's not forget the
fact that all the candidates

26
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,680
for STAND seem to be tied
to the Anonymous Case

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,348
in one way or another.

28
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,183
That's right.

29
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,936
I've been trying to figure
out why STAND was created.

30
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,730
Aoyama has, too.

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,608
But we haven't found
anything so far.

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,027
The more we look into
the agency's history,

33
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,529
the more it feels like they're
trying to hide something.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,034
[HATTORI] I gave you
fair warning, didn't I?

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,786
But you still poked your
nose where it doesn't belong.

36
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,423
So you were the one
who sent that threat,

37
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,758
Mr. Hattori?

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,055
[HATTORI] I really thought that
would keep you from getting

39
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,723
too involved.

40
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,350
But I didn't figure
you would join forces

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,518
with someone involved
with the Kujo Family.

42
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,901
And now, you've even started
investigating STAND itself.

43
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,570
Honestly, you just won't
listen to anyone, will you?

44
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,575
You want to find out what
STAND is trying to accomplish.

45
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,535
Is that correct?

46
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
Yes.

47
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,956
Well...

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,958
In that case, you'll
definitely need to learn

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,629
some backstory on the suspect
from the Anonymous Case.

50
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,924
So, pop quiz for you,
Damsel of the DCD.

Tell me, when justice
is taken too far,

52
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,388
how do you know where
it should end?

53
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430

00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,893
I'm going to contact the chief.

65

He all right?
He seems upset.

66
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,778
Well, it's a
drug‐related case now.

67
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,905
Ah, that would do it.

68
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,115
I've heard he's still pretty
bothered by what happened

69
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,702
to the victim in that
car wreck incident.

70
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,080
[HATTORI] Once upon a time,
there was a certain detective

00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,209
in Investigation Section One
named Masayoshi Ida.

72
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,671
He especially resented any
case that involved drugs.

73
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,718
How's he doing today?

It's fine.

and suspect is in custody.

No other pressing
matters for now.

It's closed, huh?

It's hard for you.
Why not let go?

There are people
suffering out there.

82
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,592
I want to protect as many
as are within my reach.

83
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,928
That's what justice is for me.

84
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,305
We should get going.

85
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,018
[HATTORI] Ida's lifelong
ambition was to ensure that

86
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,854
there would be no more victims
of drug‐related crimes.

87
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,107
To that end, he was
working with someone

88
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,985
in a different field
who shared his vision.

89
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,779
His name was Yuki Hibiya.

90
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,281
Hibiya was in the
middle of developing

91
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,033
a new drug at the time.

92
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,996
A drug they thought would
help them achieve their goal.

93
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,249
Apparently, Ida was personally
supporting Hibiya's work.

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,467
[HATTORI] To see them together,
you would think

95
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,719
they were close friends.

96
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,346
Then one night,

97
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,472

You may have made

you're not careless enough

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,842
I doubt you want to
hear that from me, though.

162
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,095
Listen while I smoke.

163
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,513
That's all I ask.

164
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,613
I'll start from the beginning.

165
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
As I know you're aware,

166
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,117
Yuki and I were working on
a solution to rid the world

167
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,119
of drug‐related crimes.

168
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,746
And to make that happen,

169
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,123
we were developing our own drug.

170
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,627
SQUARE. A new tool for justice.

171
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,671
One that would help cure
junkies of their addictions.

172
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,673
That was our dream.

173
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,051
If it had been completed,
it would've been

174
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,470
the first step to limiting
incidents involving

175
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,931
substance abuse.

176
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,308
I always said Yu was
a genius for coming up

177
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,476
with that idea.

178
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,770
So obviously he had my support.

179
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,485
Omori Pharmaceuticals
was on board

180
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,820
to get production
started on the drug,

181
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,447
and for a while it
looked like everything

182
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,449
was going off without a hitch.

183
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,913
But problems arose
during the clinical trials,

184
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,916
and production
was quickly canceled.

185
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,960
Although it appears now
that all those records

186
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,212
have been wiped.

187
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,591
Yu secretly transferred the data
and continued his research,

188
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,135
but then suddenly
said he was quitting.

189
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,471
It was the day of that storm.

190
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,556
Why quit then?

191
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,892
He said that some bad
people were after him.

192
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,519
Watching him.

193
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,063
So then he wanted to destroy
the data on the drug

194
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,774
before it fell into
the wrong hands.

195
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,109
He ran away.

196
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,820
His idea of justice ended
when his own wellbeing

197
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
was threatened.

198
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,241
[HATTORI]
And that was worth killing over?

199
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,659
Like I said before.

200
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,203
This was a sacrifice
for the greater good.

201
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,580
You know,

202
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,208
a former detective shouldn't
say things like that.

203
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,839
I know the MPD is trying
to keep this under wraps,

204
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,882
but at the very least,
I wanted you to know

205
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,259
the entire story.

206
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,514
Well, see ya.

207
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,725
Hold it!

208
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,028
Ida!

209
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,613
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,083
[HATTORI] That was the
last time any of us saw Ida.

211
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,752
Police have kept him, Hibiya,

212
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,380
and the SQUARE incident quiet
to the public ever since.

213
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,132
It's been 15 years.

214
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,388
[HATTORI] And that's
the whole truth of it.

215
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,723
Now that you've heard all this,

216
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,892
I bet you can put the pieces
together and find the answers

217
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,478
you've been looking
so diligently for.

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,646
That means that...

219
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,733
STAND was established
to investigate unsolved cases,

220
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,110
and that much, at least,
is still true.

221
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,364
However, the reason the
Anonymous Case was prioritized

222
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,117
is because the MPD's top
brass needs it gone ASAP.

223
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,037
They would have to make it
so the case never happened

224
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,790
to hide that one of their
own was responsible.

225
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,625
That's their motive?

226
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,669
Imagine the backlash over
a detective being involved.

227
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,047
Can't blame them for wanting
to avoid a public scandal,

228
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,715
I guess.

229
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,175
It doesn't happen
all that often,

230
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,427
but this is actually
pretty standard procedure.

231
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,762
But knowing all that,

232
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,014
how are you still willing
to give STAND everything

233
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,433
they need to close this case?

234
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,851
Are you...

235
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,228
You want to know
if I'm helping them

236
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,771
with their coverup, yeah?

237
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,442
You're still so naÃ¯ve.

238
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,861
Regardless of what
the brass wants done,

239
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,406
I have my own motives here.

240
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,826
I'm gonna find Ida and
make him pay for what he did.

241
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,369
And to make that happen,

242
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,704
I don't mind following
orders from above.

243
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,958
At least for now, anyway.

244
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:22,922
And is that what
justice means to you?

245
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,549
Why?

246
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
Why would you explain
all of this to an outsider

247
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,760
like me?

248
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,721
I wonder... Why would that be?

249
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,432
There's something
you need my help with,

250
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,558
isn't there?

251
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,062
I want Makoto Tsuduki to talk.

252
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,649
[HATTORI] As you know,
we've had him in custody

253
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,736
for questioning for a while now,
albeit somewhat forcibly.

254
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,073
That would be because he's
deeply involved with Ida.

255
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,616
His little sister, Sara,

256
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,245
was the victim of an accident
caused by someone on drugs.

257
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,249
Ida was the detective
assigned to that case.

258
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,668
Even after the investigation
was completed,

259
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,962
Ida continued to make
regular visits to check in

260
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:08,092
on the Tsuduki brothers.
Makoto more often than Kyosuke.

261
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,553
Naturally, we think he
knows things about Ida

262
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,971
that we don't.

263
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,764
He might even have some
idea of where we can

264
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
find him now.

265
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,394
And you haven't been
able to get it out of him yet.

266
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,563
But there's no guarantee
that Makoto would have

267
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,232
that information in
the first place, is there?

268
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,526
He hasn't told us a
single thing the entire time

269
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,320
we've had him in custody.

270
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,654
Not just about Ida.

271
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,283
I mean he hasn't said a word
to us about anything in general.

272
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,285
Do you really think
someone with no information

273
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,871
would intentionally
keep quiet for that long?

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,961
I know Makoto Tsuduki
is hiding something.

275
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,298
Sadly, despite our best
efforts, we're empty‐handed.

276
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,927
And that's where you
come in. Understand?

277
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,763
I don't think I'm
the person you need.

278
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,640
I know you're
investigating Plus,

279
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
and I think this could help.

280
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,769
Why not? It's a win‐win.

281
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,855
Have you figured out
that the base for Plus

282
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,692
was SQUARE, the drug Ida
and Hibiya was producing?

283
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
Uh, well...

284
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,197
[HATTORI] Then you already have
everything you need to know.

285
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,574
If Tsuduki will talk,
we'll be that much closer

286
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,785
to solving the Anonymous Case.

287
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,870
And if you're lucky,
you might be able to dig

288
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,331
a little deeper into
both Plus and SQUARE.

289
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,208
How do you figure that?

290
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,501
When Ida disappeared,

291
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,087
he took some things that
Hibiya didn't get to destroy.

292
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,172
In fact, one of the
items that disappeared

293
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,676
along with him was a flash drive
from Omori Pharmaceuticals.

294
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,471
It contains the research and
clinical trial data for SQUARE.

295
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,515
It's a special kind of device.

296
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,559
Whenever it gets plugged
into a computer,

297
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,603
the location of that
computer is revealed.

298
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,356
A few years ago,
we happened to pick up a signal

299
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,818
from that specific flash drive.

300
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,654
It came from the Kujo household.

301
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,328
[HATTORI]
We followed up on that lead.

302
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,830
We found out that
someone had seen Ida

303
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,082
near the Kujo Family
household around the time

304
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,918
of the Anonymous Case.

305
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,504
The bad guys Hibiya
was so afraid of...

306
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,173
They had to be the Kujo Family.

307
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,425
That's strange, though.

308
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,303
How would they have gotten
their hands on the data?

309
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,637
[HATTORI]
Doesn't matter.

310
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,472
We know right now
that Plus was created

311
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,183
from the data that
was on that flash drive,

312
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,685
and it's thought to
have been distributed

313
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,437
through the Kujos'
personal route.

314
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,566
What you're trying to uncover
is very closely connected

315
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,276
to what STAND wants.

316
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,819
I really don't think
it would hurt for us

317
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,987
to work together.

318
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,952
I do think it's a
tempting opportunity.

319
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,871
But I'm not sure how I can help.

320
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,165
Am I the right person for this?

321
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,417
Oh. Modest, aren't you?

322
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,210
And that's even after you've
managed to tame

323
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,046
‐‐our little Sosei.
‐‐[IZUMI] Huh?

324
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,881
Not to mention it
looks like you've gained

325
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,341
Revel's trust, too.

326
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,009
Especially Maki's.

327
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,302
Maki's trust?

328
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,141
I'm hoping you can
win over Tsuduki

329
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,019
in the same way and
finally get him talking.

330
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm not sure.

331
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,856
[HATTORI]
Just remember from here on out,

332
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,108
everything is extremely risky.

333
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,069
I can't take
responsibility for you,

334
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,029
and your life will be in danger.

335
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,864
Are you still
prepared to do this?

336
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,495
As long as people are
suffering from drugs,

337
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,789
I'll do anything.

338
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,250
I want to save as many
as are within my reach.

339
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,587
I don't know if that's
what real justice is or not.

340
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,340
But, if there's something
I can do right now

341
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,342
to help anyone, anywhere...

342
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,845
...I'll always be ready for it.

343
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,101
Well, all right.

344
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,853
You're definitely not
like them, are you?

345
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,439
Very good.

346
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,817
Then I guess I ought
to make up my mind, too.

347
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,288
[IZUMI]
When justice is taken too far,

348
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,124
how do you know
where it should end?

349
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,543
I wonder how
Mr. Hattori has felt,

350
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,878
having to live with
this case for so long.

351
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,655
You know she is definitely
hiding something, right?

352
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,531
Maybe.

353
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,657
[phone chimes]

354
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,125
Hey, this is huge,
you have to hear this!

355
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,960
What is all this fuss about?

356
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,920
[SUGANO] I just ran into Mr.
Hattori and he said he was

357
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,548
going to negotiate directly
with the upper brass.

358
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,883
Negotiate?

359
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,760
Are they finally going
to address this shoddy

360
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,886
filing system?

361
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,388
It's about time
somebody brought this up.

362
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,598
That's not it.

363
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,350
He's going to have Rei
go talk to Makoto Tsuduki.

364
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,730
[ASAGIRI]
Very well, then.

365
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,232
Are you‐‐? You're not
even a little surprised?

366
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,280
[ASAGIRI] That just means he's
finally taking this seriously.

367
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,954
[NATSUME] What? Mr. Hattori
was the one threatening you?

368
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,916
Izumi, he didn't try
anything weird with you, right?

369
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,959
No. I'm perfectly fine.

370
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,003
Just give me a second
to explain, okay?

371
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,088
[YUI] I insist on examining
you this instant!

372
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,590
Behave yourself.

373
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,509
Do you think Rei
will be all right?

374
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,302
It's starting to sound
like she stuck her nose

375
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,137
into something pretty heavy.

376
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,306
I can't say that I'm
not worried about her,

377
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,974
but I heard from Hattori
and he apparently

378
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,018
has her back in all
of this, as well.

379
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,152
Can't believe the MPD
had something like this

380
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,737
happening behind the scenes.

381
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,405
We're starting to see it now.

382
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,032
The truth about STAND.

383
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,120
[IZUMI]
STAND. SQUARE.

384
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,997
The Anonymous Case.

385
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,916
All the separate little
fragments are starting

386
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,960
to form a clearer picture.

387
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,878
One coherent shape.

388
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,713
And the last few pieces
of the puzzle

389
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,633
are only just out of reach.

390
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,469
We're so close now.

391
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,680
But I'm afraid that once
all of those pieces

392
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,224
finally do fall into place,

393
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,060
a difficult truth is
going to be revealed.

394
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,980
And when it does,
someone is going to get hurt.
