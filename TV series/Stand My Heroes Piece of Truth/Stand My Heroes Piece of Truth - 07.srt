1
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:33,534
Stay calm.

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,160
Remember, this is your job.

3
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,453
Right.

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,666
[MIYASE] You must be
Ms. Izumi and Mr. Aoyama.

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,295
Welcome.
We've been expecting you.

6
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,631
Well, then.
Please, come this way.

7
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,301
What's wrong?

8
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,928
Oh, it's nothing.

9
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,768
[knocking]

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,937
[MIYASE]
Our guests have arrived, sir.

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,146
[KUJO]
Show them in.

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,233
Thanks. Hello.

13
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,536
I do appreciate you coming
so far to see me today.

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,746
I'm Soma Kujo. It's a pleasure.

15
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,228
[IZUMI]
I, um...

16
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,480
I want to apologize for
the trouble I caused you

17
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,190
at that party on the ship.

18
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,191
No.

19
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,820
I should apologize for
inconveniencing you, as well.

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,862
Now...

21
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,365
Lovely to see you again,

22
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,493
but I have a feeling you didn't
come here just to reminisce.

23
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,037
Let's get to it, shall we?

24
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,038
Thank you, sir.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,374
We'd like to discuss you
possibly joining an agency

26
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,667
called STAND.

27
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,711
A joint effort of the
Ministry of Health, Labor,

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,922
and Welfare's DCD,
and the MPD's Investigation

29
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,257
Section One.

30
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,634
First, let me tell you more
about STAND's goals.

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,724
So essentially, STAND's primary
function and objective

32
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,351
is to look at unsolved
drug‐related cases.

33
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,646
We want to solve those cases
in an unprecedented way.

34
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,691
Rather than being held back by
more conventional restrictions,

35
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,403
we're looking for talented
people from various fields.

36
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,321
Quite simply, since you're
the head of a notable

37
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,615
pharmaceutical company,
we feel you'd have

38
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,950
a lot to offer us.

39
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,703
Your knowledge and connections
would be invaluable.

40
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,915
We'd be very grateful if you'd
seriously consider joining us.

41
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,041
[KUJO]
I see.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,461
That's a rather
interesting story.

43
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,421
I understand what you're asking,

44
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,882
but, as you've already
mentioned yourself,

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,468
I have a very
important position.

46
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,220
Not only must I protect
Omori Pharmaceutical,

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,222
but I must also do
everything in my power

48
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,600
to protect the Kujo Family.

49
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,226
So, please.

50
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm going to need you
to give me one solid,

51
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,481
compelling reason why
I should help you out.

52
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,523
Go ahead.

53
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,566
Okay.

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,693
I mean, just like
I mentioned before,

55
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,736
with your knowledge and expert‐‐

56
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,530
[KUJO] You know that's
not what I'm asking.

57
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,657
Let me be direct.
There are plenty of people

58
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
who have high positions in
pharmaceutical companies.

59
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,538
I wouldn't even mind
introducing you to some.

60
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,041
But I need you to tell me
why you've asked me.

61
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,293
I'd like to know why I
personally should help you

62
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,878
with this goal of yours.

63
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,217
[IZUMI]
Well...

64
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,886
The heads of the Kujo family
have been executives

65
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,347
for Omori Pharmaceuticals
for generations.

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,724
Also, I've heard that you're
now ambitiously attempting

67
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,352
to manufacture new products.

68
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,646
There are people in the DCD
who have been studying

69
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,731
drugs for years,
but we don't have an expert

70
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,399
on creating them.

71
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,485
To my knowledge, we couldn't
hope to do any better

72
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,486
than you.

73
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,988
Omori Pharmaceuticals
is our top candidate.

74
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,824
As far as the knowledge
and techniques STAND

75
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,742
is searching for right now.

76
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,619
I understand.

77
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,662
However...

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,791
It sounds like you're asking
the wrong person for help.

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,419
I'm an executive of the company,
not an expert in the field.

80
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,880
From what you've said, I'd
think you'd be far better off

81
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,465
scouting one of my researchers.

82
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,050
But what STAND
needs is much more

83
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,219
than the knowledge
of just one individual.

84
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,054
Omori Pharmaceuticals
could provide‐‐

85
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,681
Another reason I can't.

86
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,559
The company isn't
actually my property.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,060
Would you like me to
introduce you to someone

88
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,603
more suitable?

89
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,522
I'd be happy to do that for you.

90
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,277
[AOYAMA]
If I may interject...

91
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,362
Though she represents
their interests,

92
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,407
Izumi is not an official
member of STAND.

93
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,118
Her sole purpose is
to recruit candidates.

94
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,912
It's not her job
to choose who to scout.

95
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,622
Of course, if you prefer,

96
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,834
we could ask our supervisor
why you were selected for this.

97
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,669
But if that's the case,
we'll have to request

98
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,089
more of your time later once
we've received an answer.

99
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,133
We don't have a
problem with that,

100
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,510
but I know you're a busy person.

101
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,345
Do you think that
will work for you?

102
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,930
Hey! Watch yourself!

103
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,140
[KUJO]
Very well.

104
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,683
Let me cut to the chase.

105
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,519
I have zero interest
in this deal.

106
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,979
You're clearly intelligent,

107
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,857
so I'm sure you
can figure out why.

108
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,859
If that's why you're declining,

109
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,736
don't you think this
will actually put you

110
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,529
in an even worse position?

111
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,325
That's not really for you
to decide, though, is it?

112
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,203
If it's her job to scout people,
then what does that make you?

113
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,415
He's a candidate,
just the same as you.

114
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,709
That means he's a
potential STAND member.

115
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,377
He's not an outsider.

116
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,712
[KUJO]
You're wrong.

117
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,423
If he's not an
official member yet,

118
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,926
he's as much of
an outsider as I am.

119
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,555
However, if he were
here representing

120
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,390
his family's company,

121
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,476
that'd be different,
as they've helped us out a lot

122
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,644
over the years.

123
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,605
I'd have a little more time
to catch up, in that case.

124
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,025
But as it is...

125
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,444
I have quite a few
engagements to get to.

126
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,696
No, please wait!

127
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,407
I happen to agree with Aoyama.

128
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,201
If we end things like this,

129
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,286
it will put the company
in a worse position

130
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,538
and that won't do you
any favors at all.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,749
Okay? I'll come by again.

132
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,336
Please see yourself out.

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,803
[AOYAMA]
Let's go.

134
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,474
[MIYASE]
Thanks for your work today.

135
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,226
So, how did it go?

136
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,937
From all appearances,
it seems at least Mr. Shindo

137
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,480
has had quite enough.

138
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,649
If they're going to stand
in the way of my goals,

139
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,859
then sadly, I can't ignore them.

140
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,779
So that's where
we find ourselves.

141
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,322
I see you haven't changed.

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,451
Ever since that day...

143
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,788
Honestly...

144
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,752
I'm getting pretty sick of all
these additional annoyances

145
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,045
coming up.

146
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,673
If the stress gets to him,
his condition gets worse

147
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,550
and that means more work for me.

148
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,010
[KANAME]
You're probably fine.

149
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,429
I highly doubt that
scout stood a chance.

150
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,681
I'm sure he won't be interested.

151
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,850
[SHINDO]
She might've had a tiny chance.

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,310
[KIRISHIMA] I kinda
like gutsy girls like her.

153
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,645
But the guy...

154
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,398
I didn't like that dude
one single bit.

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,527
The way he was looking at
Mr. Kujo... it pissed me off.

156
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,946
Is that what your
animal instincts say?

157
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,614
Koya's instincts are good.

158
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,366
Surprisingly reliable.

159
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,909
Just forget about them.

160
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,202
[KIRISHIMA]
That's right!

161
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,079
If they show up again,
I'm just gonna pound 'em

162
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,914
and send 'em running
back outta here!

163
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,753
So, you're saying it took
you two and a half hours

164
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,505
to get there and then you
only stayed for 15 minutes?

165
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,675
[IMAOJI]
That must've been rough.

166
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885
Well, look at this this way,

167
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,678
at least you got to
take in some scenery

168
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,930
and tour a beautiful
mansion, right?

169
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,348
[IMAOJI]
Natsume.

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,268
He is the current head of
the infamous Kujo Family.

171
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,313
I guess it's not surprising
that he's got his guard up.

172
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,107
What about the other
residents in that household?

173
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,194
Is there any chance of
getting through that way?

174
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,613
Those four. Is that them?

175
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,365
[AOYAMA] Yeah, we only
got to meet these three,

176
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,243
but they also seemed
rather guarded.

177
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,287
Maybe they aren't
the way in, then.

178
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,330
Huh.

179
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,749
[NATSUME] Rei, didn't you say
you struck up a friendship

180
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,501
with one of the employees there?

181
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,543
[IZUMI]
Mm‐hmm.

182
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,712
But, it was almost
as if we were meeting

183
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,547
for the first time today.

184
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,884
He seemed completely different.

185
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,344
[IMAOJI]
What should we do?

186
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,638
This one's an order from above.

187
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,182
We'll just have to keep trying
until we get through.

188
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,683
Well, her title as
the STAND recruiter

189
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,644
should keep you in
the door and help you out

190
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,104
at least a little bit, right?

191
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,313
That's true.

192
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
And this will put us
directly in contact

193
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,275
with the material witness
in our current case,

194
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,777
which is more than
we had before.

195
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,278
Yes, exactly.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,781
Go ahead and set up our
next appointment with them.

197
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,782
Right!

198
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,158
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

199
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,827
Love seeing that enthusiasm.

200
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,371
And because you
youngsters are so motivated,

201
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,123
I brought you a gift.

202
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,458
Today's snack is
Mille‐Feuille Spécialité

203
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,294
from Mille‐Feuille
Maison Français.

204
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,921
Oh, thank you so much.

205
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,005
[IMAOJI]
I'll go make tea.

206
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
[NATSUME]
Let me help you with that.

207
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,842
[WATABE]
I'll take one, too, thanks.

208
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,760
[SEKI] Don't you need
to get back to work?

209
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,141
[IZUMI] We're still waiting for
our next appointment

210
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,433
with Mr. Kujo.

211
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,644
So in the meantime,
I gathered all the information

212
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,813
I could on the Kujo Family.

213
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,357
I was hoping you guys might
be willing to help me out.

214
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,235
So, you're trying to get
in to scout Mr. Kujo?

215
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
[IZUMI]
Yes.

216
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,575
[OTANI]
Let's see.

217
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,538
Hey, now.

218
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,789
Hatori.

219
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,166
[OTANI]
Hmm.

220
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,584
This is pretty good.

221
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,710
According to this data,

222
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,046
everyone has very different
occupations and backgrounds.

223
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
It's weird.

224
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,049
I can't seem to figure out
why they're so willing

225
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,594
to band together for Mr. Kujo.

226
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,929
I'll take any information
you can find.

227
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,307
Is there anything
you can tell me?

228
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,933
Izumi, we really‐‐

229
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,268
[OTANI]
Yeah.

230
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,105
I'm sorry, but we don't know
much about the Kujo Family.

231
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,107
I think that Hiyama might
be the only one of us

232
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,525
who does.

233
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,111
When the Hiyama Group was
in some trouble in the past,

234
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,947
believe it or not, Mr. Kujo was
the one who helped them out.

235
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,865
Hatori!

236
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,617
She doesn't need to know that.

237
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,077
[OTANI] It's not like people
don't already know.

238
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,998
Mr. Hiyama and Mr. Kujo have
that kind of a connection?

239
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,249
Wait a minute.

240
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,419
Is that why Revel can't give
me information on the Kujos?

241
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,921
Is that the reason?

242
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,964
I'll let you figure
that out yourself.

243
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,759
Apologies.
I'm going to get a drink.

244
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,389
[KAGURA] Hey, could you try
not to look so disappointed?

245
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,558
It makes me feel like
we did something wrong,

246
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,352
and I hate that feeling.

247
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,395
It's exactly like Hatori said.

248
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,897
Sorry.

249
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,607
I really don't think
there's much we can do

250
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,942
for you this time.

251
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,319
Even if you wait,
the answer won't change.

252
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,404
But then, what should I do?

253
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,952
What the... don't look at me.

254
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,663
[IZUMI]
Excuse me!

255
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,015
They live so far
from the bus stop.

256
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
I'm tired already.

257
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,784
[KIRISHIMA yells]

258
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,538
[IZUMI]
Mr. Kirishima?

259
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,081
[KIRISHIMA]
So you're back, huh?

260
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,292
I'm not letting you
get away this time!

261
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,796
Ha. I get it, you take
no sleepers, huh?

262
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,089
Sleepers?

263
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,800
Ya got guts! I respect that!

264
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,430
[IZUMI gasps]

265
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:33,354
[KIRISHIMA]
Oh, no you don't! Bastard!

266
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,647
[KIRISHIMA roars]

267
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,613
That makes 120 wins,
two losses, and one draw.

268
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,367
[KIRISHIMA]
Go.

269
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,787
You're a worthy proponent.

270
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,414
What in the world...?

271
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,583
[KIRISHIMA] How long are
you gonna sit there?

272
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,877
Your butt, it's gonna get dirty.

273
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,003
Oh, right.

274
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,716
Thanks, I appreciate that.

275
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,843
I guess I should also
thank you for saving me.

276
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,970
I won't let you see Mr. Kujo.

277
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,140
I bet you don't even have an
appointamentary thingie, do you?

278
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,475
Oh, no!

279
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,770
You see, I actually came here
to see Mr. Miyase today,

280
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,355
not Mr. Kujo.

281
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,439
Miyase?

282
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,231
Yes!

283
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,359
I have something
I wanted to give him, so‐‐

284
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,778
[gasps]

285
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,113
Oh, no...

286
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,746
Make sure you just
talk to Miyase.

287
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,208
[door opens]

288
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,464
Where's Miyase?

289
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,550
I think he's with Kiyoshi
in Mr. Kujo's room.

290
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,426
Really?

291
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,428
I mean, Mr. Kujo is here today?

292
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,805
You won't be seeing him.

293
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889
That's fine!

294
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,392
It's just that I didn't
think he'd be home, is all.

295
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,267
Well, he's‐‐

296
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,061
He's working from home today.

297
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,354
Oh, I understand.

298
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,397
Hey!

299
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,816
I told you not to talk
to anybody but Miyase!

300
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,775
[IZUMI]
Oh, right.

301
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,026
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,533
[SHINDO]
I'd say it's anemia.

303
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,493
He should be all right
if he takes it easy

304
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,245
for rest of the day.

305
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,539
But he needs a full examination.

306
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,165
Make time in his schedule.

307
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,959
Yes, understood.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,043
[knocking]

309
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,131
Hey, you've got a visitor.

310
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,050
Me? Who wants to see me?

311
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,385
[IZUMI]
Here you go.

312
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,929
I'm really sorry
that I got it so dirty.

313
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,014
But what's inside is still fine.

314
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,268
[MIYASE]
This is...

315
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,604
[IZUMI] I want to thank you for
everything you did for me

316
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,940
at the party that night.

317
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,234
It was bothering me that
I'd kept it for so long,

318
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,236
so here it is.

319
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,696
Well, thank you.

320
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,739
It's kind that you thought
of returning it to me.

321
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,659
I, um...

322
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,709
[MIYASE] I don't like
the look of those clouds.

323
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,294
Let's get you a car.

324
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,420
It's okay.

325
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,796
[KIRISHIMA]
I'll take her back.

326
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,349
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry about this.

327
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,810
It's really all my fault
for not being able to take down

328
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,062
that deer bastard earlier.

329
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,272
[IZUMI]
Not at all!

330
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,566
Thank you for letting
me see Mr. Miyase.

331
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,988
Mr. Kirishima?

332
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,492
You should stop poking your
nose into Mr. Kujo's business.

333
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,869
I admit, it doesn't really
seem like you think

334
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,414
Mr. Kujo's a bad guy like all
the others have before you.

335
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,209
But you still have some
doubts about him, don't you?

336
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,587
Am I wrong?

337
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,843
What are two you doing here?

338
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,513
This is no place for
idle chatter, you know.

339
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,639
[KIRISHIMA]
I know.

340
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,934
Let's go.

341
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,727
[IZUMI]
Is he...

342
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,896
Is Mr. Kujo not well?

343
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,941
[IZUMI]
Um...

344
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,985
Would you please tell him that
I hope he feels better soon?

345
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,238
I'm sure he's incredibly busy.

346
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,490
It must be hard
for him right now.

347
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,210
Well, it doesn't look
like it's going to let up

348
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,670
any time soon.

349
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,006
[SHINDO] There's no way
you'll be able to drive in this.

350
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,007
[KIRISHIMA]
Oh, yeah.

351
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,344
Whenever it rains around
here, it's irreplaceable!

352
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,471
You mean inaccessible.

353
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,890
You should just stay the night.

354
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,768
This place has plenty of guest
rooms that barely ever get used.

355
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,144
[IZUMI]
Wait! I couldn't possibly!

356
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,312
Don't wanna?

357
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,814
Would you rather
sleep in my room?

358
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,023
[IZUMI]
No way!

359
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,568
Uh, Koya, I'm not so sure.

360
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,986
How come?

361
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,363
Seriously, it's not like
Mr. Kujo's so heartless

362
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,282
that he'd just throw
her out in this rain.

363
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,206
Um, so, what am I‐‐

364
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,045
I'll go and let Mr. Kujo know.

365
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,718
[MIYASE] I'm afraid we've
been using it as storage.

366
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,095
I apologize for the mess.

367
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,015
If you need anything else,
please let me know.

368
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,227
This is perfect, but I'm
sorry for inconveniencing you.

369
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,479
It's fine.
Now, If you'll excuse me.

370
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,453
That definitely could
have gone better.

371
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,128
[IZUMI]
Is this...

372
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,927
[IZUMI]
Where the heck is the bathroom?

373
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,388
And why didn't I ask
where it was before now?

374
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,433
[KUJO]
Understood, of course.

375
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,023
Thank you, yes.

376
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,484
We're also looking
into the matter,

377
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,904
but considering my position,
my hands are pretty much tied.

378
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,323
Right. Yes, I know.

379
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,575
I'm not about to get picky now.

380
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,535
I'll go ahead and take
care of the sales records

381
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,537
concerning that drug
as soon as possible.

382
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,538
[IZUMI gasps]

383
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,082
[floor creaks]

384
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,917
[KUJO]
Hm?

385
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,752
No, you can go on.

386
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,800
[IZUMI]
So... Mr. Kujo is...

387
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,218
[MIYASE]
Ms. Izumi?

388
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,185
Huh?

389
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,565
[MIYASE]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

390
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,531
[IZUMI]
Thank goodness.

391
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,573
So, then...

392
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,326
I guess you really are the
person I met the other day.

393
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,580
[MIYASE chuckles]

394
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,873
My apologies.

395
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,296
I can't believe this
awful weather.

396
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,757
So... I guess the storm
woke you up, too?

397
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,595
Tell me, can I help you?

398
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,889
Mr. Kujo...

399
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,308
What kind of person
is he, exactly?

400
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,519
To everyone here, I mean.

401
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,481
Well, it's complicated,

402
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,817
but I guess you could say
that when it comes down to it,

403
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,319
everyone here owes him
a great debt of gratitude,

404
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,071
and we've all made
the decision to be here

405
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,740
of our own free will.

406
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,285
Therefore...

407
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm committed to seeing
my job through,

408
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,082
no matter what happens.

409
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,418
That sounds intense.

410
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,253
Do you mean...

411
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,006
You think something
actually will happen?

412
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,591
Does Mr. Kujo...

413
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,634
Does this household
have some kind of secret

414
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,887
it keeps from the world?

415
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,805
Forgive me for asking,
and please believe me

416
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,807
when I say I don't want
to suspect someone

417
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,477
you and Mr. Kirishima
look up to so highly.

418
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,853
But...

419
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,856
I can't look away from the
truth no matter what it is.

420
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,654
[MIYASE]
Very well.

421
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,575
Why don't you follow me?

422
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,122
[keyboard clicking]

423
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,583
[IZUMI]
So, are you... hacking?

424
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,418
[KANAME]
Yeah, something like that.

425
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,338
I'm only doing it because
Go here asked me to.

426
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,423
But if we get caught, this is
definitely gonna cause

427
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,383
trouble, isn't it?

428
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,553
I'm terribly sorry for
dragging you into all of this.

429
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,554
It's just...

430
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,891
I really want to prove
Mr. Kujo's innocence.

431
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,435
[KANAME] And you think she'll
be able to make that happen?

432
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,315
Well, what do you
think about that?

433
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,650
Can you do it?

434
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,152
[IZUMI]
If I'm honest...

435
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,570
...I don't know yet.

436
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,823
I still have no
clue what's wrong,

437
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,991
or what's right,
for that matter.

438
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,034
The thing is...

439
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,869
...I don't actually
know who holds the truth

440
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm looking for.

441
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,625
Right now, I just need
to see with my own eyes.

442
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,378
I've got to determine
what's really true.

443
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,088
And that's why...

444
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,174
I need more information.

445
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,066
[KANAME]
Here you go.

446
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,068
Looks like data
regarding some drug.

447
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,032
[IZUMI]
Square. Plus‐0.

448
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,409
Could this be the one?

449
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:16,372
The experimental drug that
Omori was manufacturing?
