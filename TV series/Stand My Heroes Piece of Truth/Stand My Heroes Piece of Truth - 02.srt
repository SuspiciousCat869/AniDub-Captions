1
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,325
[OTANI]
You look cold.

2
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,826
Thanks, I appreciate it.

3
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,164
[OTANI]
You okay?

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,541
Do you need a ride?

5
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,917
No, I'm fine.

6
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,044
I'm actually just
waiting for someone.

7
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,088
[OTANI]
Oh, a fellow narc, maybe?

8
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,214
Or a cop?

9
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,176
[IZUMI]
You're with Revel.

10
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,594
You can call me Hatori,

11
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,929
Rei Izumi.

12
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,858
[OTANI humming]

13
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,819
You sure seem to be
in a good mood, Hatori.

14
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,696
I had a sweet little encounter.

15
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,034
[KAGURA]
Again? Must be nice, Mr. Player.

16
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,452
[OTANI]
I told you about her, right?

17
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,537
That strange woman I ran into?

18
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,623
I'll introduce you to
her next time, Maki.

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,626
Please don't bother.

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,050
[AOYAMA]
Hey, we're back.

21
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,093
[IZUMI]
Hi, everyone.

22
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,886
[YUI gasps]
Izumi!

23
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,139
You cut your hair!

24
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
Where is it now?

25
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,142
The part you cut off,
what'd you do with it?

26
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,185
Huh?

27
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,730
You threw it away.

28
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,067
How? How could you do that?

29
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,360
What's goin' on with him?

30
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,237
It looks like he
wanted her hair.

31
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,488
That's not weird.

32
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,782
You threw out valuable
samples we're gonna need

33
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,951
while we're figuring
out your drug immunity!

34
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,911
I think you're trying
to kill me.

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,496
[IZUMI chuckles]

36
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,539
[SEKI]
Hm?

37
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,959
We've finished the report.

38
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,043
Turned it in.

39
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,670
Good work, you two.

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,005
Sounds like you had
a rough time, though.

41
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,133
[IZUMI] I'm sorry to worry
anyone, but thankfully,

42
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,135
my condition ended up saving me.

43
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,387
Otherwise, I know
I would've been in trouble.

44
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,765
So, at least we've
learned that chloroform

45
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,059
doesn't work on Izumi,
which is great.

46
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,770
But, oh, that hair.

47
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,897
I'm... I'm really sorry.

48
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
[NATSUME]
You don't need to apologize.

49
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,653
Totally. Besides,
it suits you like that.

50
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,822
I see you opted
for different shoes.

51
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,948
I did.

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,367
I'm not one to make a mistake
and not learn from it.

53
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,076
Right.

54
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,120
No one could ever ask
for more than that.

55
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,121
[WATABE]
Coming through.

56
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,623
I brought a few treats
in your honor today, Rei.

57
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,669
A tasty little assortment of
pastries from Ginza West.

58
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,005
Thank you! I love these!

59
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,632
Sorry, but do you have the time?

60
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,051
He's right, thanks,
I'll have one later!

61
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,261
Be safe out there.

62
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,181
[WATABE]
Where's she off to, anyway?

63
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,224
A hot date with some famous guy.

64
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,350
What the‐‐?

65
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,937
[IZUMI] You said before that
you were still thinking about

66
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,774
whether you'd join STAND or not.

67
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,151
So, then, why are you
helping me today?

68
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,280
The simplest answer is
I just wanted to, okay?

69
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,699
The short hair really
does look good on you,

70
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,701
but what did your
researcher boyfriend think

71
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,620
when you cut it off?

72
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,206
Hold on, exactly how
much do you know, Hatori?

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,582
That's relative.

74
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,501
But while we're asking
each other questions,

75
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961
how much do you
know about Revel?

76
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,838
[IZUMI]
Hatori Otani.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,008
President of the IT Company,
H & O Holdings.

78
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,844
A truly gifted president who
managed to turn his company

79
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,222
into one of the best in
Japan within just a year

80
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,640
of being established.

81
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,643
Keita Maki.

82
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,647
The vice president of operations
for the toymaker, M‐toys.

83
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,608
He's the second son of
the president, Junichi Maki,

84
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,736
and he's created
countless hit products.

85
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,071
Aki Kagura.

86
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,615
A candidate to be the
next director of the popular

87
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,492
apparel company, Flayage.

88
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,828
He's currently working
as a fashion designer.

89
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,834
And, well, as for
Revel's leader...

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
Thanks for the other day.

91
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,883
[IZUMI]
Takaomi Hiyama.

92
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,511
The president of Hiyama Realty
who also sits at the head

93
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,264
of the world‐renowned
Hiyama Group.

94
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,767
A real estate mogul who not only
overcame the economic crisis,

95
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,186
but strengthened his
influence in the industry.

96
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,316
If I'm understanding correctly,
what you're leading up to here

97
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,819
is an invitation for
Revel to join STAND.

98
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,071
[IZUMI]
Yes. Here's the thing.

99
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,032
STAND's a revolutionary
investigative agency.

100
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,076
It isn't bound by
the same old rules.

101
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,828
It's an exciting time.

102
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,580
[HIYAMA]
I want you to know I hear you.

103
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,041
Unfortunately, I have to get
to an emergency meeting.

104
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,752
Hope it's all right
to stop here for today.

105
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,547
You got it. Let's go, Rei.

106
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,103
[IZUMI sighs]

107
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,062
[MAKI]
Hatori.

108
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,647
‐‐Hm?
‐‐Huh?

109
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,190
Oh, you were here.

110
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,776
Hiyama apparently had
some meeting to go to.

111
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,695
That's what the
receptionist told us.

112
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,739
Is this the one you
were talking about?

113
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,365
The new fresh‐face?

114
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,117
[OTANI]
Yup! This is her.

115
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,952
You heading to the usual spot?

116
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,495
We'll come along and join you.

117
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,956
[KAGURA] Whoa, you're planning
on bringing her with you?

118
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,459
Why not? Let's get goin'.

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,879
Wait. Hatori, come on!

120
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,631
[HIYAMA]
A narc came to scout us.

121
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,382
Her name is Rei Izumi.

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,301
It appears they're
finally making their move,

123
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,053
Mr. Kujo. It's on.

124
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,263
[KUJO]
I see.

125
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,681
[HIYAMA] She doesn't seem
to have caught on

126
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,185
to our connection,
but I'll keep you updated.

127
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,853
[KUJO]
Right. I'll talk to you later.

128
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,399
STAND, huh?

129
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,664
[OTANI]
What's wrong?

130
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,292
I've just never been
anywhere like this.

131
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,379
Let me ask you something,
is everyone here a celebrity?

132
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,214
Give me a break.

133
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,465
Who knows, right?

134
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,217
You should probably ask Maki.

135
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,135
That one never forgets a face.

136
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,681
[MAKI] There's the president
of Wakaba Trading Company

137
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,890
and his guys.

138
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,309
He's the music
producer, Hanabusa.

139
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,062
Over there's Kanako, the model.

140
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,230
That's enough.

141
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,231
Oh, wow!

142
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,775
You really do know everyone
around here, don't you?

143
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,403
[KAGURA] Hey!

144
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,656
Could you not act quite so
friendly with Kei, please?

145
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,159
Hey, there's no reason
to snap at her, okay?

146
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,578
Want a sip? It's good.

147
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,830
I wish I could.

148
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,581
Sorry, but I'm on the clock.

149
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,083
Is that champagne?

150
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,045
Yup, it's Grand Cru,
vintage 1996.

151
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,797
Runs about 500,000 yen.

152
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,674
Holy‐‐! [gasps]

153
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,384
Would you be more careful?

154
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,468
[IZUMI]
I'm so sorry!

155
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,054
Calm down, it's fine,
she didn't even hit you.

156
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,015
Well, it'd be
too late if she did.

157
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,224
Of course.

158
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,976
Can't damage the
famous designer's tools

159
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,060
of the trade, right?

160
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,855
Shut your mouth, Hatori.

161
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,441
[IZUMI] I'm really sorry,
but next time I'll be

162
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,567
much more careful.

163
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,194
[KAGURA]
There won't be a "next time."

164
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,529
Well, uh...

165
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm Izumi, and I'm working
with the Ministry of Health.

166
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,451
Drug Control Division.

167
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,161
I was really hoping
that I could have a word

168
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,287
with all of you today‐‐

169
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,329
[KAGURA]
Not interested.

170
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,540
It wouldn't hurt you
to hear her out, would it?

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,257
[KAGURA] So, you have some
kind of drug immunity, right?

172
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,426
Tell you what, if you can
prove to me that drugs

173
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,971
really have no effect on you,
I'll give you a listen.

174
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,264
Here you go.

175
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,020
Kagura.

176
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,229
What is it?

177
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,856
What kind of drug?

178
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,191
Dunno.

179
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,526
If you're scared,
you can always quit.

180
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,703
[KAGURA, OTANI gasp]

181
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,296
Satisfied?
Now will you listen to me?

182
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,217
[OTANI chuckles]
You lose this one, Kagura.

183
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,885
This is ridiculous.

184
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,097
But you said‐‐

185
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,727
[MAKI]
Sorry about that.

186
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,771
By the way,
it was just a vitamin.

187
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,064
If you're wondering.

188
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,996
I think you prob'ly
realize this,

189
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,915
but you went too far.

190
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,209
That girl is definitely
gonna be a pain.

191
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,711
You should be careful, too, Kei.

192
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,713
[MAKI]
You don't need to worry.

193
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,842
I have no plans to let anyone
get close to me again.

194
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,009
Jeez, man.

195
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,345
I can't believe you
still have that thing.

196
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,764
I could make you a new one.

197
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,100
[MAKI]
No, this one's fine.

198
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,654
Yeah, I just turned the corner.

199
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,948
[OTANI] Good, keep heading
straight that way.

200
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,826
Is this weird? You had dinner
plans for two, didn't you?

201
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,995
Are you sure you don't mind
me joining you tonight?

202
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,621
Oh, no, it's totally fine.

203
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,123
You should be there pretty soon.

204
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,458
It's a place called A Bientot.

205
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,127
[IZUMI]
Ah! Found it.

206
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,504
Oh, and by the way,
I'm not joining you.

207
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,965
Huh? Hatori! What the‐‐?

208
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,386
Why are you‐‐?

209
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,429
[IZUMI]
Uh...

210
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,015
[IZUMI]
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,975
I feel like I'm imposing on you.

212
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,768
No, it's fine.

213
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,562
So, is it true?

214
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,063
What I've heard about Revel?

215
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,523
Have you all really
known each other

216
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,108
since you were in school?

217
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,527
[MAKI]
Aki and I are childhood friends.

218
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,280
And yeah, we've known the
other two since high school.

219
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,365
And then you were informants?

220
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,868
That all began in college.

221
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,662
It started off as just
the three of them at first.

222
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,456
Then I got dragged in, too.

223
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,833
What do you mean, "dragged in?"

224
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,585
[MAKI]
That's how it always is.

225
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,961
Story of my life.

226
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,174
Sorry 'bout that.

227
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,009
You don't need
to worry about me.

228
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,638
[MAKI]
Shall we?

229
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,890
[IZUMI]
Oh! Right! I'm starving!

230
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,437
So good!

231
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,321
We should prob'ly head out.

232
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,698
[IZUMI]
Sure, I'll pay my tab.

233
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
[MAKI]
It's taken care of.

234
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,244
But, you don't‐‐

235
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,745
You can put that away.

236
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,957
Well...

237
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,880
[IZUMI] This isn't much
of a thank‐you, is it?

238
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,966
No, it's good.

239
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,134
I've never had ice
cream like this before.

240
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,552
Seriously?

241
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,222
C'mon, are you that shocked?

242
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,808
Mr. Maki, you're a kind man.

243
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,185
Huh? Where'd that come from?

244
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,854
I thought that while
we were eating dinner, too.

245
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,273
It occurred to me more than once

246
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,610
that you're someone
who's truly kind and caring.

247
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,320
Tell me honestly.

248
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,282
Do you think that you would
ever consider joining STAND?

249
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,327
So, I'm kind. Huh.

250
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,707
Look, I'm sure you're
a very nice person.

251
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,252
But it's best if you don't
get any more involved with me.

252
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,546
I'd rather avoid any trouble.

253
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,760
Huh?! You had dinner with her?

254
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,304
There was nothing I could do.

Aw, look at that.
Now he's all mad.

Hey, so, tell me.
How'd your date go, anyway?

She's really strange, you know?

00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,821

[SEKI]
Interesting.

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,087
I do remember my buddy at
the Community Safety Division

286
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,464
telling me something
about Keita Maki.

287
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,383
He was apparently involved
in a couple incidents

What are you doing here?

So, he got into it with
that man for your sake?

I haven't.

[MAKI] It's an unsolved
case from 15 years ago.

384
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,870
They call it "anonymous" because
the victim went unidentified

You're obviously so
important to all of them.

And you got angry because
they're important to you.

to try to face the part

of yourself that you
dislike the most,

408
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,606
I think they'd want
to stand by your side

409
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,107
and help you do it.

410

We can't do those things alone,

411

but if we have friends,
that changes everything,

412
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,446

Would you be willing to
consider helping out STAND?

415

You've known true fear,

416
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,122
and yet your first
natural instinct

417
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,208
is still to protect others.

418
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,793
And I believe in that.

419
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,091
You know... There's one thing.

420
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,136
I wish you weren't
quite so formal with me.

[MAKI] I don't know whether
or not I'm joining STAND yet.

"Please don't get involved

out for others.

buried in that kind heart.

do it immediately.
