[MPD BRASS] This brand‐new

I expect you'll be responsible

for scouting additional members.

With all due respect, sir,

the department I already
work in is pretty new as it is.

It might be kind of difficult
for me to take that on.

to operate at its
full potential.

We need someone to recruit
qualified members of the police,

00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,671
[ASAGIRI]
Oh, great.

163
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,881
It's our favorite narc
from the DCD.

164
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,508
I don't recall inviting you.

165
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,010
Asagiri.

166
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,429
I see you're still just
as exhausting to look at

167
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,888
as you ever were.

168
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,807
You don't have
much right to talk.

169
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,018
Okay, guys! That's enough.

170
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,269
Let's relax.

171
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,649
So, then...
I guess this is the girl.

172
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,861
Right. Izumi, meet Asagiri.

173
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,404
That's Sugano.

174
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,865
You remember their
names from the list?

175
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,742
They're both
candidates for STAND.

176
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,624
[AOYAMA]
Mr. Hattori hasn't returned yet?

177
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,543
[ASAGIRI] At this point,
I'd be surprised if he ever did

178
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,211
come straight back.

179
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,796
Who's Hattori?

180
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh, he's the chief
of this section,

181
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,177
and he'll be the one
directing STAND, as well.

182
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,219
Yup!

183
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,888
I know nothing's
been decided yet,

184
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,723
but since he's our boss
and everything,

185
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,517
we're pretty much
guaranteed to get the job. Oh!

186
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,271
Actually, here's another
candidate now.

187
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,024
[SUGANO]
Hey, Sosei.

188
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,235
You wanna meet the girl
everyone's been talking about?

189
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,612
Or not?

190
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,866
Hello. I'm Rei Izumi.

191
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,409
I'm with the DCD.

192
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,952
Honored to be working
with you sir.

193
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
[IZUMI]
Huh?

194
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,169
[SUGANO]
Aw, Sosei.

195
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,173
No, wait. Come back‐‐

196
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,054
‐‐Thank you‐‐
‐‐This isn't a game.

197
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,181
If they interfere
with your work,

198
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,183
then don't wear high heels.

199
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,188
I don't have time to babysit
someone who's unqualified.

200
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,314
Do better.

201
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,032
[IZUMI]
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,535
[AOYAMA] Don't worry,
he talks to everyone like that.

203
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,620
Arakida's kind of a lone wolf.

204
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,000
Want to quit?

205
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,085
Of course not.

206
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,505
I decided to do this job,
so I'm going to see it through.

207
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,132
And this time, I‐‐

208
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,927
You already paid the penalty
for your past mistakes,

209
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,720
so you might as well
move on now.

210
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,972
You have to.

211
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,111
[IZUMI] I got distracted
by something else,

212
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,573
and I ended up interfering
with a premises check.

213
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,826
Someone with my experience
should know better.

214
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,911
Arakida may have hurt
my feelings before,

215
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,746
but everything he said was true.

216
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,123
I blame myself.

217
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,458
Completely.

218
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,003
I'm sorry!

219
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,047
This is so unprofessional
of me, isn't it?

220
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,340
I'll stop talking!

221
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,303
Well, we've got some extra time.

222
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,309
What you did that day
wasn't a mistake.

223
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,685
It was right.

224
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,188
If there's one thing we
know about you, Izumi,

225
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,733
then I would say it's that you
have a strong sense of justice.

226
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,819
The choice that
seemed right to you

227
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,780
may not have been best from
someone else's point of view,

228
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,490
but that doesn't make it wrong.

229
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,911
The other side of justice
is another side of justice.

230
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,704
[IZUMI]
"The other side of justice

231
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,415
is another side of justice?"

232
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,791
[AOYAMA] That's a saying
I learned back when

233
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,294
I was a rookie.

234
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,338
I took that wisdom to heart,

235
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,466
and I swore that I would always
do what I believe to be just.

236
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,928
Even if other people
may think it's evil.

237
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,429
That's what this job is.

238
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,100
Right.

239
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,977
[AOYAMA]
So, yeah.

240
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,313
You weren't to blame
for what happened.

241
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,357
Mr. Seki might've said this too,

242
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,485
but if one little rookie mistake
spoiled the whole thing,

243
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,445
then it was doomed
from the start.

244
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,988
[IZUMI]
Is that true, though?

245
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,031
Yes.

246
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,953
We're all a team.

247
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,583
Thanks.
I really appreciate that.

248
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,503
[AOYAMA]
Shall we?

249
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,629
[IZUMI]
Sure!

250
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,013
Here goes.

251
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,560
[IZUMI]
Good morning.

252
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,312
I assume you're
on break right now?

253
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,065
[ARAKIDA]
Obviously.

254
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm sorry, but I haven't had
a chance to introduce myself

255
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,569
properly yet.

256
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,949
No, thanks.

257
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,494
I promise it won't take long!

258
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,667
Wow, harsh! That poor girl.

259
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,669
She seems like
she's trying so hard.

260
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,008
[IZUMI]
Please wait!

261
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,510
Why would I, when you
have no business with me?

262
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,138
Your assignment is to scout
new members to join STAND,

263
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,556
isn't that right?

264
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,100
Well, I'm already
going to join it.

265
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,812
But I plan to keep as much
distance as I can from you.

266
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,522
So quit following me around.

267
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,068
Listen. I intend to
see this job through!

268
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,070
And I don't know if
I'll be able to do that

269
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,739
if I don't have support
from you and the rest

270
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,616
of Investigation Section One.

271
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,038
That's why I need you
to acknowledge me, Arakida!

272
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,500
[ARAKIDA] You know, I heard
you had an unusual condition.

273
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,461
They normally wouldn't
trust a rookie like you

274
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,339
with that position,
but they made an exception,

275
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,092
because your body is
immune to certain drugs.

276
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,386
People around here see
you as a little princess

277
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,846
in need of protection.

278
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,516
And if that's who you
really are, then no,

279
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,185
I can't acknowledge you.

280
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,944
[HATTORI] Oh, you must be
the new Damsel of the DCD.

281
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,696
Hello there, sir.

282
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,952
[HATTORI]
Thanks for the coffee.

283
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,462
[HATTORI] Are you thinking
about what a jerk I am

284
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,630
for letting you pay?

285
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,633
Not at all!

286
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,510
Your face tells me you are.

287
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,512
You're rather easy to read.

288
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,806
So. How'd you like Sosei?

289
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,058
Do you think that
you can tame him?

290
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,394
What? I'm not sure I follow‐‐!

291
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,521
[HATTORI] Well, you're probably
gonna need the qualities

292
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,940
of a lion tamer in order
to get anywhere with him.

293
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,733
That's all I'm saying.

294
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,194
A lion tamer, huh?

295
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,696
They're strict on others
as well as themselves,

296
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,782
but they can be gentle too.

297
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,409
Even if they may seem harsh.

298
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,328
You giving up?

299
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,955
No way!

300
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,039
Good.

301
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,333
I'm glad you're enthusiastic.

302
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,002
While I've got you here,
let me give you some advice

303
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,964
in exchange for the coffee.

304
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
Hey, tell me something.

305
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,884
Have you decided on
who your first recruit will be?

306
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,899
[IZUMI] I don't quite feel
like I fit in at this party.

307
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,278
But still, he's here.

308
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,697
[IZUMI]
Who is this?

309
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,365
[HATTORI]
Takaomi Hiyama,

310
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,950
head of the Hiyama group.

311
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,286
One of Japan's
largest financial firms.

312
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,997
Oh, right,
he's a huge celebrity!

313
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,915
[HATTORI] Well, apparently
there's another side to him

314
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,918
that the public
doesn't know about.

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,672
He leads a quartet of highly
efficient celebrity informants.

316
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,009
It's a team that goes
by the name of Revel.

317
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,552
Informants?

318
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,637
If you can convince
them to join your cause,

319
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,599
then I expect things will

Of course you can.

324
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,358
If you know where to look.

Yes. Pardon my clumsiness.

Go and get her a

Oh, no!

Don't worry.

00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,526
It's my fault.
I'll be more careful.

339

Well, if you ever need
anything, just give me a call.

Mr. Aoyama!

345
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,220
What's wrong?
What are you doing here?

346
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,138
I came to meet up
with another candidate

347
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,641
for STAND named Mr. Hiyama.

348
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,768
What are you doing here, though?

349
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,271
I thought you were working
on a different case today.

350
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,398
Did you say anything to
that man who approached you

351
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,399
just now?

352
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,775
Uh... No.

353
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,986
I just kind of bumped into him.

354
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,154

00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,287
Another one of the
STAND candidates.

357
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,377
That man's got a bad reputation.

358
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,296
Don't go near him on your own.

Sir! Come with me!

Mr. Arakida?

364
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,370
What brings you here?

365
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,706
Where's the client?

366
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,708
He's safe with Sosei.

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,084
There's one problem, though.

368
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,630
It looks like he ran
into the DCD.

369
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
What?!

370
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,674
[ARAKIDA]
What are you up to?

371

What the hell's going on?

373
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,680

as my bodyguards.

375
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,517
You see, the Hiyama group
received a serious death threat

376
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,729
a few days ago, so we're
exercising extreme caution now.

377
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,230
But who would do that?

378
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,649
And why?

379
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,068
Well, when you're in the
business of selling information,

380
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,320
it's not really unheard
of to make a few enemies

381
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,529
along the way.

382
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,406
It's possible that whoever
sent the death threat

383
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,409
could be responsible for
starting the fire, as well.

384
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,036

Anyone would have thought
that I looked like a disaster.

But, for some strange reason,

instead of being embarrassed.

I was kind of proud of that.

I felt like I could do my
best again tomorrow, too.
