like him help this kid?

Does he know Joshua killed me?
Does he even care?

Morning, sunshine.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.787
You have some sweet dreams?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.665
[NEKU]
The worst.

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.553

Oh, please. For better
or worse, we're partners.

Clearing the missions
and winning the game

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.486

That isn't true, Neku.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.221
For the record,

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.514
as any other Player's.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.974
Being alive doesn't make me
immune to the rulebook.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.811
The Realground me dies, too,
if I get erased here.

[gasps]

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.148
So then... you're here

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.527
Why put yourself in that danger?

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.571
Beats staying in the
RG, that's for sure.

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:22.577
[KITANIJI] So, the Taboo Noise
were Minamimoto's doing?

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.330
This act is grave treason, sir.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.249
[KITANIJI] Which is why I'll be
discussing his punishment

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.251
with the Composer.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:33.839
I hope your verdict
is reached posthaste.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.426
By the way, a second‐time
Player, Neku Sakuraba,

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.011
is proving
exceptionally resilient.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.764
I'm curious what your thoughts
are regarding this matter.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.599
Heh.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.309
So that's how it is.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.938
The Composer does have
a mischievous streak.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.567
[JOSHUA]
The bosses of 0 and 5.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.695
What's the decimal in the Grim
Heaper's equation refer to?

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.321
Think it's a code?

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.616
I've got a pretty good guess.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.290
[NEKU]
Oh, great.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.549
[gasps]

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.307
[JOSHUA]
Predictable.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.066
Nicely done, Neku.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.869
I thought so. It seems Route
Five is the only one open.

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.913
And what tipped you off?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.874
That long decimal in the text
is the square root of five.

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.667
There's even a mnemonic for it.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.712
So I had an inkling Route
Five would be involved.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.799
[NEKU] Screw Pi‐Face
and his lame jokes.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.925
You know Shibuya.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.260
This particular path
starts at the Scramble,

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.386
then Center Street,

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:07.474
followed by AMX, Tipsy
Tose, and Tokyu Hands.

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.976
Udagawa's the final stop.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.813
'Kay, then assuming
the crosswalk is zero,

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:18.902
Center Street, AMX, Tipsy Tose,
Tokyu Hands, and Udagawa's five!

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:22.072
Precisely! The Noise we faced
was the first area's boss.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.324
So if we defeat whatever's
waiting for us in Udagawa,

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.368
we'll be sitting pretty.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.624
Damn! They've increased their
numbers by, like, tons!

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.710
Well, generally speaking,
there are two types of Noise.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.296
So there are strays that
emerge as a natural product

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.174
of the negative emotions
Realground people give off,

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.385
then there's a second kind
created by Reapers

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.053
to erase Players in the game.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.056
Does that make these
a third kind?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:51.977
That one Reaper called Kariya
referred to them as Taboo Noise.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.187
These don't abide by missions.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.398
They're after Reapers
and Players alike.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.483
Well, I'm one Player that
can't afford to lose!

They may be gone,
but you and I aren't.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.750
What happens to the ones who
don't make it through the game?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.632
I know all of us Players
are strangers to each other.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.675
I also know it's
not only the UG,

it's the same for both
sides of Shibuya.

Everyone has different values
and ways of thinking.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.475
And that's okay.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.352
'Cause talking with people
and learning about them

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.811
is how we grow.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.730
It wasn't much,

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.399

Why's that?

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:19.864
It's where Shibuya's drifting
thoughts and emotions collect.

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.784
They come flowing into Mark City
and shoot up into the sky,

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.369
then that same energy
turns around

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.372
and comes barreling back
down again‐‐always building,

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.123
never lessening.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.629
[NEKU] If we can take him out,
it'll all be over.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.507
Sit tight, Shiki. I'm coming.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.512
Seems this is the only way.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.643
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.314
[NEKU]
I can't even see the steps.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.275
[JOSHUA] Well, please watch
yours as best you can.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.610
I'd hate for you to fall and
break your slender neck.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.697
[NEKU]
Heh. Look who's talking.

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.282
[BEAT]
Yo, get your head in the game!

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.741
Wha‐‐?!

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.243
Oh, crap!

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.710
Great! Can't anticipate attacks

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:17.255
'cause the only lights we
have are their laser beams!

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.257
I can't get closer!

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:27.265
[JOSHUA]
That's convenient. How's my aim?

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.153
Get ready to hurt,
'cause you gonna bleed today!

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.951
What do you know,
the lights came back on.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.454
They saved our skins,
we saved theirs.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.371
Good grief.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.914
Everyone's entitled
to be awkward,

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.125
but Skulls is takin' the cake.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.461
I think I've got his
"special op" figured out.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.171
He picks pretend fights
with those boys

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.881
while simultaneously
protecting them

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.091
from Noise and other Reapers.

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:06.846
The UG really needs to
start making sense again.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.809
What the‐‐? I rest my case!

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.144
Hold up!

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.606
It's warping!

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:23.529
Could be the imaginary number
plane Mister H spoke of.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.490
[NEKU]
Imaginary what?

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.492
[JOSHUA] A parallel world
that's a fraction away

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.077
from the one Noise inhabit.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.538
But as long as our psychs work,
who cares where we're fighting?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.833
Dodge, Beat!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.756
I do believe that's our cue.
Gettin' too hairy.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:52.934
Take this. You dropped it.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.394
[gasps]

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.483
[BEAT]
I owe you one.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:17.500
Again? Is it Pi‐Face?
Or something else?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.376
This is his base,

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.462
so I imagine he's the
one pulling the strings.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.548
[NEKU]
We can't get careless.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:35.977
You two? How'd you find me?
An inverse matrix, perhaps?

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.687
[NEKU]
He hurts my brain.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:41.149
Ah, well, you guys
saved me the trip.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.151
Heh.

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.945
I was kinda hopin' the three of
us could meet up in Udagawa

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.489
and have ourselves
a little reenactment.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.199
Reenactment?

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:52.952
Yes. That's right.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.162
[gasps]

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.920
[gunshot]

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.934
[chuckles]

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.186
[gasps]

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.024
[gunshot]

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.029
[JOSHUA]
You okay?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.698
You're the one who put a
bullet through me that day!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.117
You stole my life!

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.328
Come get derived!

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:39.081
I'll eradicate you from
my spatial coordinates!

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:48.007
[MINAMIMOTO] Get ready to drown
in the sea of imaginary numbers!

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.726
Are you seeing this?

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:05.691
[NEKU] Taboo Noise!
It's a whole army of them!

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.151
[JOSHUA] You know all
that emotional energy

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.153
I told you pools at Mark City?

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.573
Seems he's been using it to
manufacture these things.

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:23.960
[roars]

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.586
Remember, safety first!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.296
[JOSHUA]
I never forgot!

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.634
[yells]

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:32.760
[NEKU]
What?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.637
[MINAMIMOTO]
Zetta slow!

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:37.974
[JOSHUA]
Neku!

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.897
[MINAMIMOTO]
So zetta slow!

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.367
[NEKU]
Get down!

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.834
[MINAMIMOTO]
You're out of your vector!

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.674
[MINAMIMOTO]
Where's your beauty?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.607
How did this trashy human
calculator get to be so strong?

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.442
[laughs]

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:33.112
[MINAMIMOTO]
Somethin' not adding up for you?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.822
We're screwed.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.326
O ye of little faith.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:46.542
[NEKU] I've never felt so much
power pass between us before.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.962
Feels like another world awaits.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:52.214
[JOSHUA]
And you're going.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.103
[NEKU yells]

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:16.447
[screams]

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.956
Zetta persistent.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.044
Thought you'd kill us
at the speed of light.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.300
[laughing]

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:37.301
[NEKU]
'Kay.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.427
[MINAMIMOTO]
Don't you know?!

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.471
The entire world's
made of numbers!

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.514
I've been off the grid

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:45.309
reverse engineering my desired
solution all this time!

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:52.650
And here it is.
I am victorious!

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.568
A Level i Flare!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.867
[NEKU]
What the‐‐?

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:09.375
I thought you couldn't
afford to lose, Neku.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.839
[JOSHUA] Give up on yourself
and you give up on the world.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:24.473
[NEKU]
Why? Why did you cover me?

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:29.437
I constantly doubted you.
So what were you thinking?

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.732
[NEKU]
Joshua!

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.150
[gasps]

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:39.238
[clapping]

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.614
[NEKU]
You're...

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.283
[KITANIJI] Please allow me
to congratulate you

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.326
on yet another game well won.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:47.747
I'd also like to thank you
for your assistance.

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.957
And just how did I "assist"?

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.626
By ridding us of the rebel.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.088
That final mission was
issued by yours truly.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.800
Minamimoto unleashed Taboo Noise
that killed countless Reapers,

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.178
but you neutralized the threat.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.305
So thank you.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.932
[NEKU]
You used Joshua and me.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.685
Yes, your partner's
fate is regrettable.

00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:12.897
I didn't expect him
to shield you.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.857
[NEKU]
Is he...?

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.150
It's just as you saw.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.861
Both the boy and
the lion are gone.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:25.284
He died protecting me.
But I... never apologized.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.036
We were partners all week,

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:30.331
but I was too freakin' paranoid
to put my trust in him!

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.958
I'm the worst.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.002
No need to grieve.

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:38.506
That boy was guilty of
a very serious offense.

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.424
So being alive's a crime?

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.009
[KITANIJI]
It is when you play the game,

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.470
which is why you, too,
must be punished.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.138
For acting as his
partner and abetting

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.891
his grave transgressions,
you will be erased.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.684
[NEKU gasps]

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.729
[KITANIJI] At least, were I
to go strictly by the book.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.231
But we repay our debts,

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.233
so I will permit you to
enter a third round,

00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:58.526
albeit with a penalty.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:01.111
You may not refuse.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:04.740
[NEKU]
Wait, what about Shiki?

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.075
[KITANIJI]
As I was saying,

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:10.287
your penalty is disqualification
from all future games.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:14.416
Regardless of the outcome, this
next game will be your last.

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.461
[NEKU]
Really? This is it?

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:21.924
Now, as for your third
and final entry fee...

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.175
[gasps]

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.723
[NEKU]
Well, here I go again.

00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:34.854
Seven more days. One last game.

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.863
[NEKU]
Next time: "Emergency Call."
