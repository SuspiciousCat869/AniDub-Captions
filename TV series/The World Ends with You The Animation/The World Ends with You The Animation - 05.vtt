WEBVTT

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.932
Why, Beat?

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:17.434
[NEKU]
Those wings! Beat, no.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:19.436
I'll wipe the floor
with your face!

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:20.604
[gasps]

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.982
[BEAT]
You're weak.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.778
I'm fighting to bring
Shiki back to life!

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.989
[JOSHUA]
Question.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.617
How long are you
planning to mope?

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.370
Till I have a new
mission to focus on.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.831
[NEKU]
It's a new day, but...

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.627
[JOSHUA] No sense waiting
for that which won't come.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.964
What's with the smirk?

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.007
There's someplace
I'd like to go.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.343
What do you say we play hooky?

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.638
Surprised I have
to spell this out.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.265
Walls go up around
different areas

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.850
depending on the
day's objective.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:00:59.726
Your point?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:03.063
The places Players
can go are limited.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:06.775
Tower Records doesn't
appear to be blocked off.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.195
And what if that's nowhere
near the mission?

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.780
Why not ignore it?

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:15.742
Let some other capable
Players get the job done.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.495
I can't screw around
and "play hooky."

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.455
We take what Players value most,

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.458
and what currently holds
that place in your heart...

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.545
...is Shiki Misaki.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.965
[NEKU] She was almost out,
and I pulled her back in.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.301
There's only one way
to save her now,

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.303
and that's by winning this game,

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.681
which is what I
fully intend to do.

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:40.684
So I have to clear
the missions myself.

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:42.394
Uh‐huh.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.230
Did you hear a thing I said?

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.940
Every word.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.277
[NEKU]
Keep your cool.

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:54.072
[phone buzzes]

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.574
[NEKU]
It's here!

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.494
Cat Street in 15 minutes?

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.872
It's on the other
side of Shibuya!

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.959
Hey! Partner!

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.170
You called?

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.796
Let's hustle!

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.401
Are we safe
or did we fail?

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.239
What gives? I told
you to run faster!

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:03.118
True. But I'm a "work
smart, not hard" guy.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.829
Anyway, this is the place.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:07.289
What?

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.794
Wildkat café. It's where I
wanted to go from the start.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.422
Try the house‐blend
coffee and pancakes.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:18.216
The donuts aren't bad either.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.178
That wasn't a real mission?

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.556
Took you long enough
to catch on, but yes.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.517
And it worked out even
better than I imagined.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.352
You serious?

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.898
Coming here was crucial.
For you and me.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.942
[JOSHUA]
How goes it, Mister H?

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.403
Hey! Been waiting for ya, Josh!

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.114
Huh? You run this shop?

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.826
Phones? Don't tell me you've
been playing two weeks in a row!

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.205
I see. That young lady
must've been revived.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.167
Not quite.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:55.921
She was taken before
she could. As my fee.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.217
That a fact?

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:03.512
Buck up, kid.
What's done is done.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.223
Wait here a sec.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:10.101
Small world. I had no
idea you knew Mister H.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.314
Not really. He, um, saved
our butts a lot last week.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.818
He's been saving my
butt a long time now.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.528
Just how long?

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.446
I should preface this
by saying I can see things

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:24.074
most people are blind to.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.494
Reapers. The Noise.
Players in the game.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:30.413
Which, of course,
includes you, Neku.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.541
When'd that start?

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:33.917
I really couldn't say.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.127
What I do know is, once
I discovered the fame,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.921
I was hooked.

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:41.466
Then I also discovered there
was one other person like me.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.593
Mister Hanekoma.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:44.594
[JOSHUA]
Correct.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.847
Reapers would try and trick
Players into self‐destructing,

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.766
and Mister H would come
dashing to their rescue.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.438
And the more he told
me about the UG,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.066
the more I came
to see its charm.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.652
The UG's full of dead people
fighting for their lives!

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.237
You somehow find that charming?

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.573
[JOSHUA]
I do.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.868
People racing across the city
in a life‐or‐death struggle?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.245
You won't find a rush half as
stimulating in the Realground,

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:13.456
I guarantee you that much.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:17.419
So then, you volunteered
to play the Reapers' game?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.296
If something in life
continuously remains

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.798
boring and unchanging,
then it might as well be dead.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.384
Who needs it, right?

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:28.263
It's your call if you wanna
be here. Not me, though.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.974
I don't know why I died,
but I do know that.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:34.728
I'm gonna do what I want,
how I want, whenever I want.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.232
I just...

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:48.992
Care for a cup? It's coffee
I'm genuinely proud of.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.662
Thank you.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.128
Be careful, Neku.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.546
[HANEKOMA chuckles]

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.716
[HANEKOMA] You want a
donut, too? They're good.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.843
I'll pass.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.720
So is it ready? Or not?

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.348
Yeah. Gimme your phones.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.390
[NEKU]
Hm?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.142
That was plural.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.687
Okay, but what do you
even need it for?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.689
[HANEKOMA]
I'm adding a new feature.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.984
I asked for an upgrade before
my first step into the UG.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.320
It's been quite a wait.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.657
[HANEKOMA] I expedite your
order, and this is my thanks?

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:33.495
So Mister Hanekoma's the
person you've been calling.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.956
As sharp as ever, I see.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:39.167
[NEKU] Maybe I've been
too suspicious of him.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.251
[HANEKOMA]
What were you kids talkin' about

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.504
while I was fixing your coffee?

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.173
[NEKU] Just how he could see the
Underground from the Realground.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.717
And how he's playing
the game by choice.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.845
[HANEKOMA] J's been comin'
here to talk about that stuff

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.764
since the day we first met.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.934
Can't say I blame him since
my café's got Reaper approval.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.687
Makes it pretty ideal.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:02.107
[JOSHUA]
Let's change the topic.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:06.736
Well, you're partners now,
so try to get along.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.823
Ah, I messed the thing up!

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.200
Please tell me it's fixable.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.203
It's no secret that I'm
a supremely talented man,

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.247
but meddling with Underground
tech from the RG

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.250
is more complicated
than you might think.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.293
[NEKU]
How complicated?

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.587
I just can't do my
best work, is all.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.755
[phone dings]

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.968
There. New apps
officially installed.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.889
Thank you. Our little
hunt can commence.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.850
And what are we hunting?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.561
I'll tell you that
when we find it.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.729
You kidding me?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.188
[HANEKOMA]
Don't let little quips like that

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.149
rile you up so much.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.526
Enjoy every moment
with all you've got!

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.986
Those words!

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.362
[HANEKOMA]
What about 'em?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.698
Oh. Nothing.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.034
There's this artist.
Goes by "CAT."

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.369
He has that very
same philosophy.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.664
Y'know that giant wall
of graffiti? In Udagawa?

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.125
Sure. It's kinda
famous, right?

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.586
Yeah, and it features
some of CAT's best work.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.922
Can't help but respect someone
so talented at everything.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.258
Shibuya's chock‐full
of his designs.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.845
In fact, you could say CAT's
very existence is art.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.389
Sounds like he's had
a big impact on you.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.725
[HANEKOMA]
Listen up, Phones.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.602
A new phrase I think you
should take to heart is

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.772
"the world ends with you."

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.399
If you want to enjoy life, then
you gotta push your horizons out

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:29.402
as far as they'll go.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.655
This place is a melting pot
of all kinds of emotions,

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.532
both good and bad.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.701
And whatever that last
emotion or thought is

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.163
when you hit rock bottom,
hold onto it.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.083
It just might change
you for the better.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.167
What if it's not for the better

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.295
and things that
shouldn't change do?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.588
I like to believe
that everything

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.216
has the potential to be good.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.509
[JOSHUA chuckles]

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.178
[HANEKOMA]
Any change on your end?

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.554
No.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.350
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.354
My phone has this
"hunting" app, too?

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.064
Along with a camera app.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.399
Never know what kind of missions
they'll throw at you kids.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.276
Best to be prepared
for anything.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.862
[NEKU] Speaking of,
we didn't get a mission today.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:17.575
Welp, only reason for that
is the GM's slacking off.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.411
This Minamimoto guy is as
cruel as he is inconsistent,

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.497
and that's a very
dangerous combo.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.290
Just be smart.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:27.627
[JOSHUA] We're leaving now!
The tracker got a hit.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.218
What qualifies as a "hit"?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.429
Something with enough
energy for it to pick up on.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.182
So the thing you're
looking for has high energy?

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.518
It does, indeed.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.272
I'm detecting one in Udagawa and
another at Scramble Crossing.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.691
Udagawa's the closer of the two.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.735
[JOSHUA] No. Let's scope
out the crossing first.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:56.030
The size of this
signature is a bit odd.

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.084
Red Skull pins again. Huh.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.544
I noticed that
eye‐catching crimson

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.088
on just about every person here.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.508
[OJI] I proudly present
Red Skull pins!

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.517
[JOSHUA] The signatures
appear to be moving

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.644
with the pedestrians.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.939
I wonder if their accessories
are the source.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.775
[PEDESTRIAN A] I can't believe
how popular they are!

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.068
CAT's the one behind the design,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.404
so they were bound
to be awesome.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.449
[NEKU]
They look like Player pins.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.119
According to Mister H,
the Composer's the one

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.621
who makes and controls those.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.999
Is this person a lead
Reaper on a power trip?

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.002
Oh, Neku, the Composer's
leagues above any Reaper.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:54.005
He could erase this entire
dimension if the mood struck.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:58.509
So then, does that mean
CAT's the Composer?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.429
Certainly food for thought.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.641
Well, hopefully it's
the one in Udagawa.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.060
Just what is it
you're trying to do?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.356
[JOSHUA] I want to
properly guide Shibuya.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.154
You'll come to help me
in my endeavor soon enough.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.787
[NEKU] I'm gonna do what I want,
how I want, whenever I want.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.750
[gasps]

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.678
No! It's already on day five?

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.429
[JOSHUA]
So it would seem.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.728
We haven't gotten a mission.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.564
Soon as we do, it'll come first.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.565
Where to, then?

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.443
The Udagawa district.
Where else?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.612
Now you're getting it.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.865
Not trying to "get"
anything. It's just...

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.284
[NEKU] Going there might
trigger something

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.703
in my broken memory to click.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.086
Currently, 14 players have
been erased. I confirmed it.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.422
Leave it to a genius
to get results.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.216
I doubt the game
will last the week.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.467
About that.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:25.346
Both today and the day before,
the GM failed to issue missions.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:28.057
Then how do you explain
the rate of erasures?

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.642
Minamimoto?

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.437
[KONISHI] AWOL. He broke
off contact yesterday.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.816
But his so‐called "works of art"
have been sighted around the UG.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.777
Those breadcrumbs suggest
he's still in the Underground.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.362
[KONISHI]
Most likely.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.740
[sighs] Let's leave
him be for now.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.285
He prefers to have a
little breathing room.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.078
If that's what you wish.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.039
[KITANIJI]
Any other problems?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.915
There have been reports
of Taboo Noise.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:56.502
They're attacking Reapers
all across Shibuya.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.672
The dwindling Player count
suddenly makes a lot more sense.

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.674
How are we holding up?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.092
As well as we can.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.552
I've already set about locating

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.180
and identifying the
perpetrator, sir.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.057
I'm also investigating
any correlation

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.100
between the two incidents.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.564
I'd expect no less.
It's in your hands, Konishi.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.524
I won't let you down.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.656
That crafty man.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.409
His numbers only come second
to Mister Kitaniji's.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.243
What's more astounding

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:32.205
is he's the youngest officer
in Reaper history.

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.165
Minamimoto.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.335
Not even I can grasp the
methods to your madness.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.093
Of course the path's sealed off.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.053
Shall we look for
an open route?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.889
[777] What? You can't
be serious right now!

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.475
This isn't an ordinary mic
we're talkin' about here!

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.228
Oh, no. It's Death
March's heart and soul!

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.481
And because of that fact,
we should report it to the cops.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.483
We'd lose all our cred
if we got them involved.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.027
Not only are we Reapers,
we're friggin' metal!

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.612
[BJ] But we looked everywhere
we could think of

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.240
and it's still
nowhere to be found.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.158
We can use this.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.951
[NEKU]
Hm?

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:11.077
[BJ]
Whatcha wanna do?

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.662
[TENHO, 777]
Uh...

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:16.249
[JOSHUA] My trusty partner and I
can find that mic for you.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.043
Hey! Maybe consult
your partner first!

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:22.964
[JOSHUA] All we ask in exchange
is you open that wall for us.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:26.634
That's a pretty sweet deal,
wouldn't you say?

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:31.681
[PLAYERS yelling]

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.892
Like, what now?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.352
I can't even pretend to know!

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.147
We're in way over
our heads this time!

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.483
If there was a mission today,
nobody thought to tell me!

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.902
That's Taboo Noise.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.280
C'mon, Nao! Let's amscray!

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.282
Keep your guard up, Uzuki.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.200
And why on earth
would I do that?

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.035
Noise don't attack Reapers.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.745
[gasps]

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.586
Gonna cost some ramen!

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.840
Hey, I can fight my own battles!

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:10.887
[NOISE roars]

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.440
That's the last I saw it.
I only left for a minute, tops.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.900
Probably just forgot it.

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:24.901
I didn't!

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:27.111
Is there a possibility someone
brought it to the police

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.488
as a lost item?

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.448
[click]

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.784
There's no need.
It isn't there. Look.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:34.952
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.497
[MINAMIMOTO]
Oh! This mic's zetta sexy!

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:40.666
It'll make a perfect
addition to my opus!

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.586
Minamimoto jacked it from us?

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.671
[TENHO] And tossed it on
one of his trash heaps.

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.840
[BJ] He'll get pissed if
we mess with his "art."

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.217
Maybe enough to kill us.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:50.718
True, but you know
where to find it now,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.346
which means we've held up
our end of the bargain.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.389
[777]
Hm? Fine.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.900
Who'd've thought it'd
come in handy so soon?

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.902
A camera that shoots the past.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.404
Didn't think Mister Hanekoma
could get much cooler.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:13.824
The only downside is, it drains
the battery insanely quick.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.535
A limit of two shots a day.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.703
I suppose there's always
room for improvement.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.621
‐‐[phone dings]
‐‐[gasps]

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.082
That's the strongest
signal it's picked up yet.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.459
[SOTA]
Hey! You're both Players, right?

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:24.502
Um. Yeah.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.046
Then you guys should turn
around. That way's bad news.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.923
Bad how?

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:31.300
These freaky Noise are,
like, everywhere you look!

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:33.719
Reapers showed up, too?
We just ran like hell!

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.264
Name's Sota.
The cute one here's, Nao.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.558
You can, like, call me Nao‐Nao!

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.811
I'm Joshua. And
this here is Neku.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:45.106
[SOTA] There were more of us,
but they were annihilated.

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:46.691
All of them?

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.236
[SOTA] Did you not hear
what we said, bro?

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.322
There's no mission, so you gain
absolutely nothing by going!

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.325
We should stick together
and, like, all win this!

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.452
[JOSHUA]
Don't you know?

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.080
Not everyone who wins
gets to come back to life.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.582
Hey, man!

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.208
What?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.711
[JOSHUA]
Your partner's also a rival.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.921
So, if, like, two people survive

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.214
and only one gets
their life back,

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.466
what happens to the
Player who doesn't?

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.302
They try their luck
at the game again.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.512
The same way that Neku is.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.889
[NAO]
You've played before, Nekky?

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.391
Yeah.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.893
So then, your partner came back!

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.980
Shiki should've made it back.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.482
But since I decided
to play again,

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.359
she was taken as my entry fee.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.903
You're kidding.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.239
It's my fault
she's trapped here.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.073
[NOISE roars]

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.241
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.284
Come on.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.078
Hopefully we'll see
you two around.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.788
Don't overdo it!

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.292
What now?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.180
Another abnormal Noise!

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.516
You know it's bad when Reapers
are getting attacked

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.727
by their own monsters.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.728
Now's our chance.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.021
We can sneak through
while the big one's

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.898
occupying their attention.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.904
You optimist. They won't
make it that easy.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.465
[NEKU]
I won't make it!

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.596
Are you okay?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.099
Risky. Too risky.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.726
That's no way to fight
these things, partner.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.731
Don't you wanna win?

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:52.066
Yeah.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.442
[KARIYA]
It's slower than molasses,

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:56.487
but one solid hit and
that's all she wrote.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.447
It also can't dodge
ranged attacks

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:01.117
to save its life, literally.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.457
Stubborn, isn't it?
Like, just die.

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:10.918
It's a heavyweight. No doubt.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.547
A joint attack might be the only
thing that works against it.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.133
[JOSHUA] They're powerful,
to say the least.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.593
[NEKU] We can't afford
to take a single hit.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.055
[JOSHUA]
Neku, concentrate.

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:24.890
[NEKU]
Worrying won't do me any good.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:28.018
If I want to win, I've
gotta trust my partner.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.983
[NEKU]
I'll erase them all!

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.588
It would appear Phones
and Pretty Boy

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.006
managed to pull off the win.

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.175
Am I supposed to care?

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:03.262
We need to report this
to Konishi A‐SAP.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.931
Plus, I wanna gripe to her
about how infuriating it is

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.683
to work under Math Man.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.728
Ugh. What a waste of a week.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.029
That's some first‐rate graffiti.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.698
Yeah. Straight from the
brilliant mind of CAT.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.035
My favorite place in Shibuya.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.913
[NEKU] It's also the place
I saw myself lying in blood

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.499
when I accidentally scanned him.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.211
But why? I don't know.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:39.340
Still with me, Neku?
Or did you space out?

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.301
Oh. Sorry.

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.386
You're giving me déjà vu.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.554
[gasps]

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:50.976
All right! Cut the cryptic crap!
Have we both been here before?

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.728
[chuckles]

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.403
Heh.

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:03.656
Huh?

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.581
[gunshot]

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.126
[NEKU groans]

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:20.965
[NEKU yells]

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.927
It happened right here!

00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:34.812
[NEKU] I died in this very spot.
And he killed me!

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.822
[NEKU]
Next time: "Turf."
