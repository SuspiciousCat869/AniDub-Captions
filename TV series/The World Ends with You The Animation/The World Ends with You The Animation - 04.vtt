WEBVTT

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.648
[NEKU]
Round two. Day one.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.899
Hm?

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.194
This isn't the end.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:31.156
We'll put this Reaper in his
place and get our lives back.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:36.620
Once we're alive, let's meet.
In the Realground.

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:37.955
But you know Mister Mew!

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.582
I'll be sure to
have him with me.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.917
Cool.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.211
[PEDESTRIAN A]
Sorry I'm late!

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:45.462
[gasps]

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.506
Shiki, you‐‐

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.883
[PEDESTRIAN A] So, what stores
did you wanna hit up?

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.220
[PEDESTRIAN B] Hmm...
How 'bout Modi and Parco?

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:54.972
Can we also swing
by Tokyu Hands?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:55.305
Ooh, yeah...

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:58.433
[NEKU]
That should be Shiki right now.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.979
But because of me...

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.773
I'm... sorry.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.658
[NEKU] All I gotta do is
survive seven more days,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.785
and they'll set Shiki free.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.091
[phone buzzing]

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:54.925
The first mission!

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.967
[microphone buzzes]

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.844
[MINAMIMOTO]
Attention, all Players!

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:02.349
You are nothing but pawns,
so do exactly as I say!

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:07.187
Game one: Calculate the
square root of 10,816.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.815
Once you have,
seek out the solution!

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.150
You have 60 minutes
to crack this code,

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.611
and I'll only spare
the ones who show up!

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:19.658
Incompletes get destroyed!
Destroyed! Destroyed!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.993
[NEKU] They're giving out
Algebra homework now?

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.413
Then again, we did beat
the GM last week,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.748
so this guy must be
his replacement.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.630
Ha! This the best they've got?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.674
I can't use psychs!

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.303
[NEKU yells]

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.308
[JOSHUA] Week two already
too much for you?

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.983
All right. I'll be your
partner this round.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.825
[NEKU]
Sweet!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.459
[yells]

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.718
[JOSHUA]
I knew you could do it, Neku.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.558
I've had my eye on you
for quite some time now.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.270
And I must say, the way you
fight is very impressive.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.483
Okay. Have we met
before or something?

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.276
[chuckles]

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:40.781
Hi, I'm Yoshiya Kiryu.
But call me Joshua.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.408
[NEKU] Was he a Player
in the last game?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.370
No. Shiki and I were
the only survivors.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.081
Jeez, loosen up
a little, will ya?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:54.252
No point in being stressed
when it's just the first day.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.504
Wait!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.176
[NEKU]
Enjoy every moment.

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:02.511
[NEKU gasps]

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:08.350
[NEKU] What was that?
Did I just scan him?

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.227
Something wrong?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.186
[NEKU]
No.

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:14.314
Players aren't supposed to
be able to scan each other.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.903
Oh, dear. Seems my new
escort's suspicious of me.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.238
If you don't trust
your partner, though,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.907
you can kiss winning goodbye.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.160
[NEKU]
Not yet. No way I can trust him.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:30.205
But the mission's
already started.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.126
Let's get going, team.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.964
And what a splendid team
the two of us will make.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.800
Thankfully, 104 is close.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.385
[NEKU]
Yeah. So?

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.846
Still stuck on
the mission, huh?

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:51.560
[JOSHUA] The square root
of 10,816 is 104.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:56.398
Meaning 104 is the place we
should be seeking out. Shall we?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.619
A game two weeks in a row.
Now there's a first.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.372
Nah. It happened
before way back when.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.125
Spring chicken like you wasn't
around to see that, though.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.003
"Spring chicken"?
I'm two years into this.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.214
Tell me, just how long
have you been a Reaper?

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:24.801
Please, details are
so inconsequential.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.597
Anywho, I'm glad we get to take
it easy and play standby.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.516
It's orders like these that
make me hate working for him.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:34.019
I can't rack up any points.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.855
I'm positive he's thought up
some crazy‐intricate scheme.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.442
Something our pleb minds
could never grasp.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.402
[KARIYA] He is the type
of genius headcase

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:45.030
who made that
stunning work of art.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.072
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
What is it?

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.491
[SCHOOLGIRL B] I think
it's called "guerilla art."

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.245
'Kay, that wasn't here.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.332
[NEKU] Not even amnesia could
wipe an eyesore like that.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.417
We've got company.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:06.217
Come on! Really?
You are so zetta slow!

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.303
You can't even crack
a crack a Z‐class code?

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.096
You factoring hectopascals!

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.640
[NEKU]
Hecto... what?

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.018
I take it we've completed
the mission if the timer fades?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.731
Uh. Yeah. That's right.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.818
The name's Sho Minamimoto!
AKA the new Game Master!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.695
Strutting your stuff on day one?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.114
You're not a fan of
tradition, are you?

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.325
[MINAMIMOTO]
Tradition is garbage!

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:34.871
Crunch! Ha! I'll add
it to the heap! Huh?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.835
[MINAMIMOTO] Didn't expect to
see you playin' this round.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.129
You actually know who I am?

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:47.217
Well, yay for happy errors.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.720
I'm that much closer
to my desired solution.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.890
What? "Your solution"?

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.602
I only allow two things
in the games I run!

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.231
Flawless calculations
and beauty!

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.775
I see the rumors were true.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.360
[MINAMIMOTO]
Some Old Horses Can Always Hear

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.570
Their Owner Approach.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.991
[MINAMIMOTO]
Pop quiz time!

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.243
How much weight will I
let you Players carry

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.494
in the Underground?

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:18.581
Time's up! It's one yoctogram!

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.709
Which would put us
on the atomic level.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.877
I'm confused right now.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.342
Tried opening it, but
as we thought, no dice.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.886
Which leaves Route Four
as the only route open.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.472
One and Two are
also sealed up tight.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.976
Routes Five and Six
are also dead ends today?

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:41.980
Told you he had a plan.
And, man, did he work fast.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.150
His plan should've filled us
in on what areas were open.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.568
Does he not care
about the Reapers

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.028
toughing it out on the ground?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.196
I can't stand that jerk!

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.157
It's not that big a deal.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:56.369
I say we sit back and see what
the mastermind has in store.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.747
The message said we
just had to get to 104!

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.291
And you'd spare
everybody who showed!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.168
[PLAYER N] Is there something
else we're supposed to do?

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.836
[PLAYER P]
All I want's my life back!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.421
[NEKU]
I know them.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.257
[NEKU]
Don't tell me...

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.260
[MINAMIMOTO] You worthless
000s have no value here.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:16.931
So I have one simple request:
I want you to die!

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.149
[NEKU gasps]

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:32.280
[PLAYERS screaming]

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.287
[chuckles]

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.124
[MINAMIMOTO] Listen up!
There's a new mission!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.919
Player versus Player,
to the death.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.130
Yoctograms who win
make it to day two.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:53.510
[PLAYER D screams]

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.056
[PLAYERS gasp]

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.351
Don't listen to a single
word that Reaper says!

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:05.146
What you need to do is
trust your partners!

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.316
'Cause if you can't,
you'll get erased!

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.123
[JOSHUA]
That was a close one.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.210
The weakest point on
those types is their back.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.255
You heard that kid!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.882
Let's work together
and fend them off!

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.761
Hey! I'm not Noise!

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.932
The GM told us to fight!
I don't wanna die!

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.101
[PLAYER A] Stop, dude!
You're not thinking straight!

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.520
[laughs] Excellent!

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.063
Here's an idea!

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.233
The Players who take out those
Reapers get a free pass.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.442
[gasps]

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:56.030
[PLAYERS yelling]

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.740
Come on.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.035
Now!

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.923
It's our time to shine.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.342
Let's show these nasty Noise
who they're dealing with.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.262
Work for you, Neku?

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.139
[NEKU]
What do you think?

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.108
You're gonna love this.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.359
[gasps]

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.977
This power. Where'd
it come from?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.562
Had a feeling we'd
make a good team,

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.024
but I didn't know
we'd be that good.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.735
Looks like the next seven
days will be a breeze.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.111
At least, they should be.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:20.573
If we can maintain this
beautiful partnership, that is.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.327
I hardly know
anything about you.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.536
[chuckles]

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.372
If you wanna survive
any more Reapers' games,

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.958
then all you need to know
is that you need me.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.586
You have to put your trust in me
in order to win, understand?

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.673
[MINAMIMOTO laughs]

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.925
One day in and
I can already tell

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.386
this is gonna be zetta fun!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.430
[MINAMIMOTO laughs]

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.392
I mean, surely some
of you think so, too.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.068
Hey. It's me.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.199
Another day back at Hachiko.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.579
[JOSHUA] The whole area's
sealed off? Hmm.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.206
Huh?

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.958
[NEKU] Who could he
possibly be talking to?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.917
I see.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.253
So if the wall on Route
Three were to open up,

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.589
then I could slip under
the Miyashita Park guard.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.091
[NEKU]
Miyashita Park?

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.676
If I had to guess,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:25.221
I'd say he's trying to find
a way to Cat Street.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.347
[gasps]

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.350
[NEKU]
I remember!

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.770
I know Shibuya!

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.231
I know where I am.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.609
And I can name every
street connected to it.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.819
This time last week,

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.863
someone could've said
Shibuya's a type of ramen

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.531
and I would've believed 'em.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.576
So then, what changed?
Of course!

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:49.120
I told you there's a price
for entering this game.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.164
They find out what's most
important to you at the time

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.540
and take it.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.125
That's the rule.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.210
So, the other day, Rhyme
said she didn't know

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.047
what having a dream
actually felt like.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.090
I'm guessing she had dreams,

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.509
but they were taken
as her entry fee.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:07.805
She forgot. Her mind got wiped
the same way that mine did.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.474
[NEKU]
My memory's back!

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.476
So that was my first entry fee.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:15.605
Now, I... I remember
when I was alive!

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.565
[NEKU]
Enjoy every moment.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.526
If I'm gonna live by that
motto with all I've got,

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.863
I'm gonna do what I want,
how I want, when I want.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.032
[gasps]

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.326
[NEKU] The wall of graffiti
I saw when I scanned Joshua

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:32.288
is in the back streets of
the Udagawa district.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.791
But how was I able to
scan him to begin with?

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:36.459
He's a Player.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.087
[JOSHUA] Then just give me
a call when it's ready.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:44.008
Huh? Why so grim? Someone die?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.135
Ha, ha, you're hilarious.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:52.642
But since we're on the subject,
sorry 'bout your last partner.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:56.229
Spill it! Just how
much do you know?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.689
You think you're the only one?
Well, think again.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.775
Every Player in the Game has
something special at stake.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.861
[phone buzzes]

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.407
[NEKU] "Square root of three."
Like Route Three?

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.325
Perfect. You know
all about that.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.952
'Scuse me?

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:14.455
See? Route Three?
You mentioned it on the phone.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.998
[chuckles]

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.254
[JOSHUA]
Fun fact for you, Neku.

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.215
Reapers refer to these
streets by numbers.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.592
There are Routes One,
Two, Three, and so on

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.511
that lead throughout Shibuya.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.138
You know a lot.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.641
Just thought of another
fun fact for you.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.644
This is a Reaper decal, see?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.604
Does it mean anything?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.605
[JOSHUA]
So clever.

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.441
It means if a store has
this plastered on it,

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.608
we can shop there.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.609
[NEKU]
Wait, what?

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.069
[JOSHUA]
Be right back.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.698
[NEKU gasps]

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.032
They could see you?

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.201
But Players are invisible to
people in the Realground,

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.703
so how does that even work?

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:56.956
Magically. Here.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.542
We're given visible forms
inside stores with decals

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.461
so clerks can interact with us.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:02.920
[NEKU]
Why?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:03.963
Right?

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.423
Reapers can materialize at will

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.759
and Players
materialize in shops.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:12.096
And Route Two is
sealed. Too bad.

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:21.272
Aw, Skater‐Brain.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.690
[JOSHUA]
Having a moment?

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:26.694
It's nothing. Besides, Route
Two's not the one we want.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.197
May I present
Reaper Route Three.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.325
It's the street that cuts
through from Modi to Parco.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.663
[NEKU]
The countdown's still going.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.751
Up for a little stroll?

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.758
And the Grim Heaper
strikes again.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.393
They seem strange.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.104
Gonna have to agree
with you on that one.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.696
Try harder!

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.954
Damn, that didn't even faze it!

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:35.179
We could try that teamwork
thing. You game, pal?

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.806
[gasps]

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.140
All right.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.856
[NEKU]
Focus. Open up your senses.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.741
Now!

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:06.002
It worked! One down, one to go!

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.878
[yells]

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.764
[NEKU] My first impression
of black Noise. Not a fan.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:21.267
[JOSHUA] I'm just glad we
thought to use joint attacks.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.020
That was the only effective
way to damage them.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.230
[NEKU]
Oh. Was that what did it?

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.524
[JOSHUA] Did you not put
two and two together?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.152
Neku, as your partner,
I'm both offended and concerned.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:34.488
[NEKU] I'm still processing
what that Noise even was.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.449
[chuckles]

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:42.288
True. They were odd.
Taboo Noise, perhaps?

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.748
Did you say something?

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.458
It must've been the wind.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.336
Good news is, we completed
the mission for today.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:55.718
Oh, whoa. Shiki's friend?

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.812
You always get the white lilies.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.815
My friend really liked them.

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:13.319
I don't want her to be
lonely, so I visit daily.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.780
Oh...

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.491
I mean, leave offerings daily.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.078
Be right back, okay?

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.211
The one who's lonely is me.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.005
[NEKU]
Sorry.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.467
It's all my fault.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:43.099
I... just miss her.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.726
[CLERK A]
Please take these, too.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:46.894
What?

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.646
[CLERK A] I put it in the
back because the flowers

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.440
finished blooming, but it's
still a very pretty bouquet.

00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.275
I think your friend
will like it.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:56.112
Thank you very much.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.614
She'll like it. You're right.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.501
She worked hard,
honed her craft each day.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.254
But now she's...

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.880
[SHIKI]
I'm right here.

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.466
You and I still have
the same dream.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:21.512
I am gonna win! So we can
live our dream together!

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.222
But me...

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.943
[gasps]

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.529
[NEKU] I still don't know
anything about my death!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.531
It's just blank!

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.909
It feels like my other
memories are intact,

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.537
so why can't I
remember how I died?

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.039
[JOSHUA]
Does it matter?

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.249
I don't think so.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.002
Simply do as I say and
you'll be sure to live again.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.754
What is it you're
not telling me?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.964
I know you know something!

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.801
[gasps]

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:05.055
[NEKU] That's me.
But why am I lying there?

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.978
[NEKU]
And that's... Udagawa.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:18.277
[NEKU]
Blood. Is this my death?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:23.866
So then... is Udagawa
where I died? But why?

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.579
[JOSHUA]
Neku?

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:32.958
Just curious, but did you
scan me by chance?

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.674
[rustling]

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.807
Hold on. Those wings!

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.142
Beat, no.

00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:52.561
[BEAT]
So, you his new partner?

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:54.480
That's right.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.689
Well, big whoop.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.734
I'm here 'cause Mr. Kitaniji
told me to find ya.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:01.028
And wipe the floor
with your face!

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.369
[BEAT]
You're weak.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.912
How can you take another
day in this game

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.331
when you can't even
take a punch?

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:19.380
Listen... Shiki was my new
entry fee, so I have to play.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:22.258
I'm fighting to bring
Shiki back to life!

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.552
The same way you
fought for Rhyme!

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:27.429
You ain't even worth
the beat down, dude.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:33.185
Hang on! Come back! Beat!

00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:08.656
[NEKU]
Next time: "CAT."
