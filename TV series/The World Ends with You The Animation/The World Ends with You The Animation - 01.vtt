not much further.

Were you also aware the
more Players we erase,

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.687
the higher we rise
in the ranks, or no?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.482
Wait! What does that mean?

Oh. It's Scramble Crossing.
The same as yesterday.

Didn't they explain
when you joined?

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.922
Nope. I know I woke up
in traffic, but that's it.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.632
Wow.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.511
[SHIKI] You can think of
this place as Shibuya,

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.513
but also not Shibuya.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.598
It's basically a parallel world.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.351
We refer to it as the
Underground, or UG.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.602
Looks like the same city,

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:43.064
but it actually exists on a
completely different plane.

The plane those people are
in is called the Realground.

'n' hear everyone,

well be invisible.

but we have the power
to read their minds.

One‐way street communication.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.429
The bottom line is, we don't
have to talk to anyone.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.638
I don't feel like
dealing with people,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.807

Your scan was blank

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.675
'cause Players can't read
each other's minds.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.052
Remember when you
tried scanning me

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.428
and you couldn't get it to work?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.222
It's the same thing for them!

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.015
[BEAT]
Hmm. Oh.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.683
[RHYME sighs]

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.937
Call me Beat, you guys.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.189
And this? This lil' voice
of reason is Rhyme.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.690
Charmed, I'm sure.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:08.525
My B.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.026
This pink‐haired
chick set us up,

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.361
so I was out for some payback.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:12.946
[SHIKI]
She messed with us, too!

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.406
No joke? Small world.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.075
But thanks to Neku,
we cleared the mission,

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.743
so it all worked out.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.621
Huh. Must be tougher
than you look.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.501
The headset, like, is it
permanently attached?

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.585
Don't read into it.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.462
He's kinda confused,
so let's just leave him be.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.463
[phone buzzing]

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.133
Oh, our mission.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:37.595
[BEAT] "Set the cursed sculpture
free. Fail, and face erasure."

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.055
All right.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.187
Well, that was fast!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.106
Hey, wait!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.274
Yo!

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.408
Neku! Hang on!

00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:59.826
Come back!

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.754
Trashin' Noise ain't a
one person job, y'know!

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.715
We really should try
and fight them together!

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.258
[NEKU]
Shut up!

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.679
You jerks are nothing but
strangers! Who needs you?

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:22.515
[YASHIRO giggles]

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.393
Higher caliber Noise would
make this more interesting.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.853
There's no need.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.188
And why is that?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.107
That hothead is bound to
self‐destruct on his own.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.652
He's a giant Noise magnet
with all that negativity.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.613
And humans who get
possessed by Noise

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.574
are as dangerous as
they are unpredictable.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.744
[NEKU] Damn! That sound
grates my ears!

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:48.374
Why? Why am I suddenly...
angry at everything?!

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.004
That's sick, yo. Huh?

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.756
We cleared it already?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.300
[SHIKI]
Neku! You okay?

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.595
[YASHIRO]
Yawn. Boring!

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.972
What's this?
Back for round two?

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.683
You the one responsible for
sending us these missions?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.978
What would you do if
I am, Neku Sakuraba?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.647
Did you say Sakuraba?

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:13.775
Is that... Is that
really my last name?

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:18.404
It is indeed. And I have
a new mission for you.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:22.742
Mister Sakuraba, if you kill
Shiki Misaki here and now,

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.453
I will personally release
you from the Game.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.413
What? What the hell
d'you just say?

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:31.167
Yo! You're not takin' this hag
seriously right now, are you?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:36.589
However, if you fail this
task, you face erasure.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.259
Don't listen to her!
Please, Neku!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.180
But I... I have to.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:52.939
[SHIKI]
Neku.

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.693
Please. Don't kill me.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.867
You... don't want this.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.578
Yeah, I do.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.830
There. That's it.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:11.040
Yes, give into your
heart's deepest desires,

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.333
and it'll set you free.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.378
[HANEKOMA]
That's enough of that.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.963
Down, boy.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.426
Are you all right?

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.136
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.887
Just now, what'd I...?

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.973
[BEAT]
Hey! How dumb can you be?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.975
Try 'n' keep a lid
on the bad mojo.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.270
It takes complete control
when Noise possesses you.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.064
[YASHIRO]
Do me a favor and butt in

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.984
after the best part's
over next time.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.112
C'mon, lady, you gotta
play by the rules.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.947
What? You some kind of referee?

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.366
For real. Who are you?

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.493
[HANEKOMA] The rules state
it's one mission per day,

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:51.122
and only the Game Master has
the authority to send 'em out.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.249
Said Game Master's
also the sole person

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.210
who can directly attack Players,
and that's on day seven.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.588
Well, aren't you well‐informed?

00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:59.630
And in case you're wondering

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.759
if the GM's stronger
than Noise, they are.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.677
Teamwork really makes
the dream work

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.847
when it comes to
the Reapers' Game.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.433
It's possible to survive, but
you gotta trust your partner

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.477
in order to make that happen.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:16.898
Trust my partner?
And I'll survive?

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.068
[gasps]

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.405
[NEKU]
Guess another day went by.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.326
That girl!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:35.875
She's not here. Of course not.
I mean... after what I did?

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.633
[BOTH yelp]

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.176
Oh. Whoopsie!

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.804
We should come up with
a new greeting, stat.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.889
I panicked when I came to
and you weren't nearby,

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.558
but luckily, you're fairly
easy to spot in a crowd.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.603
I'm so sorry. What I
did to you was awful.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.814
Ah! No! It's cool! Honest!

00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.774
Anybody could tell that
you weren't yourself!

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.859
It was just a crummy mishap!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.029
And, know what?
We should talk more!

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.657
You agreed to be my partner
in the heat of the moment,

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:11.411
but you don't know me‐‐
I'm still a stranger to you.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.454
Not exactly fair for me
to ask for your trust

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.081
when you're not sure
who you're trusting.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:19.836
[NEKU] No. The person I'm
clueless about is myself.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:24.340
I remember I'm Neku,
but that's all I remember.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.635
I didn't even know
what my last name was.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.138
Not until that Reaper used it.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:37.437
Oh, gosh. This entire time
you've had amnesia. I see.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.229
[phones buzzing]

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.730
The mission's here.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.901
[NEKU]
"Defeat the master of O‐East."

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.946
Ah. O‐East is a
local concert hall.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:50.992
Should be... in that direction.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.288
[SHIKI]
I've been here a lot.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.832
The most popular band
right now is Death March.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.709
They're great.
My friends like 'em, too.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.878
Man, what a drag.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.088
He gripes and moans
at me every single day.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.008
They can cancel his
concert for all I care.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.718
The mark of Noise.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.179
He's emitting negative
waves like you were.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.138
[NEKU]
Sorry.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.891
Gah! That's not what I meant!

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:18.269
But hey! At least we know how
to get rid of those bad vibes!

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.272
Really? But why?
That's not part of the mission.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.275
[SHIKI] I can't stand by
and ignore him, though.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.613
[roars]

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.032
[NEKU] Yeah, ignoring
it's definitely out.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.927

[gasps]

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.770
Wow! You and I totally
brought the heat just now!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.064
Like the two of us were
perfectly synced up!

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:04.065

Ya think?

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.150
'Scuse me, a few seconds ago,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.818
I wasn't possessed
by the Noise, was I?

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.071
Yeah. A pretty big one, too.

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.032
How weak! Need to
get my act together!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.034
Pretty dope of you to rescue me.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.911
[SHIKI]
Heh. It was our pleasure.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.496
[NEKU] Cool, now that
that's out of your system,

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.748
can O‐East go back to
being our main objective?

Oh! You guys are
headin' to O‐East?

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.336
That makes three of us.

Hey. 'Sup?

[777]
You're late!

Well, these fans of yours
also saved my life.

in with some Noise.

I better show my thanks.

being will depend on you.

Of course!

the way to the end.

for a master Noise.

Wait! Neku!

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.424
Damn! There's too many of them!

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.801
Careful!

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.890
[NEKU]
At this rate...

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:02.767
[SHIKI yells]

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.228
[SHIKI]
Neku!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.023
Please let your partner
help you fight them off!

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.233
[SHIKI]
You can rely on me!

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.526
[NEKU]
Watch out!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.539
And that would have
to be the master.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.419
[BEAT] Wanna see a
real master in action?

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.341
Let's light these
suckers up right!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.511
Two heads are better than one,
and we have double that now!

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.513
Oh my gosh! You came!

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.934
[NEKU]
Incoming!

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.022
Yo! Me 'n' Rhyme'll
distract the small fries!

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:52.608
You take out the big
boy while we do!

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:55.528
[NEKU]
Hey!

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.779
Yes?

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:03.619
You know that move we pulled,
against the other Noise?

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:07.039
Mhm. If you trust me,
I think I can give it a try!

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:09.917
[NEKU]
Worth a shot.

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:14.004
Okay then!

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.340
On your mark... Get set...

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.591
[NEKU]
Go.

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:33.482
[yells]

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.575
Neku!

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:45.953
Ready?

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.246
Yeah!

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.388
[BOTH]
Let's go!

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.363
[NEKU]
We cleared it.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.949
[SHIKI]
Neku! You good?

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.284
Yeah.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.915
You trusted me. Thank you.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:38.047
[NEKU] I don't need a crutch.
I'm fine on my own.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:42.885
But, uh... Thank you, too,
for havin' my back.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.848
You're very welcome, partner.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:52.019
[BEAT]
Yo! How you holdin' up?

00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:57.066
Great! Better than great!
Though, only 'cause of you!

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.526
Gotta give a little
to get a little,

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:01.362
and you gave just as much!

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.113
Hey! Here's a thought!

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.114
How would you guys feel about

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.242
doing our missions together
starting tomorrow?

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:07.868
For sure! Count me in!

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.121
I'm down if Rhyme is.
That's a given, no matter what.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:12.915
The only wild card
here is Phones.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.041
'Cause of before?

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.709
Neku was affected
by Noise yesterday,

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.753
so what he did wasn't his fault.

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:20.005
Besides, he's had it
hard enough as it is

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.715
since he can't
remember his past.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.384
[BEAT gasps]

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:25.469
Bruh, that's rough.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:26.595
That guy with the
shades said that

00:22:26.637 --> 00:22:28.347
"teamwork makes
the dream work,"

00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:30.099
so if we wanna survive
all seven days,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.142
we're gonna have
to band together.

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.649
[HIGASHIZAWA] Over half the
Players have been erased.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.860
We're entering into
the final stage.

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.571
The choicest bites
shall soon be savored.

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:44.321
[KITANIJI]
Mh‐hm.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:45.489
[MINAMIMOTO]
Let's kill the remainders

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.157
and subtract them
from the equation.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:51.662
Minamimoto, you're 9 minutes
and 42 seconds late.

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:55.040
Yep! Ten minutes without you,
if you round up.

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.375
Huh?

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:59.086
Someone wanna introduce me
to the bulldozer over there?

00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.381
Hold your tongue.
You're being rude.

00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:06.176
[KITANIJI] This is Higashizawa.
He's the current Game Master.

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.220
I'll take that insult
with a grain of salt

00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:11.640
and use it to season the feast
I prepare with this game.

00:23:11.682 --> 00:23:13.267
What a suck‐up.

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.435
Not at all.

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.770
He's a capable worker
who plans to deliver.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.647
That, and he's far
more compliant

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:20.816
than a number‐punching
nuisance I regrettably know.

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:21.984
[MINAMIMOTO laughs]

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:23.444
Why, who could you mean?

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:26.864
The Composer give me permission
to promote you, Higashizawa.

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.157
Should you continue to impress.

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.327
I am grateful and
delighted to hear that.

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:34.830
[KITANIJI]
But there is one condition.

00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:41.170
Erase all the Players.
Every last one.

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.630
What a cool concert!

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.257
That dude was all, "The music
world ain't ready for me!

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:45.841
Too bad!"

00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:48.218
[SHIKI, RHYME laughing]

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.261
You know what's weird?

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:53.474
777 was able to see us, but we
should've been invisible to him.

00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:56.268
It's not weird. It's obvious.

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.438
Both those guys...

00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:03.734
[NEKU]
...are Reapers.

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.906
[NEKU]
Next time: "Shiki."
