00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.350
[NEKU] Day four of
the Reapers' Game, huh?

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.980
[NEKU]
What happens if I survive?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.024
Will anything change?

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.610
[SHIKI] I think that really
depends on the person.

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:29.988
All I know is I don't
wanna give up.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.740
On what?

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.494
My dream.

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.215
It's crazy here.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.469
So many people from
so many walks of life.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.055
I hate this ward. It sucks.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.765
It's full of
self‐absorbed try‐hards

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.683
just screeching at each other.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.602
They're the real Noise.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.649
'Sup? We've been
lookin' for you two.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.359
Have you guys checked
out 104 today?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.318
The walls over there are gone!

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.487
Oh, wow! That's great!

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:37.074
[BEAT] Be greater if everywhere
else wasn't blocked.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.618
What kinda trouble
you kids gettin' into?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.246
You besties now, or what?

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.623
[NEKU]
That's a no.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.000
We just took a time‐out
to people watch.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.420
Ah. I'm not a big
fan of scans, myself.

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.255
It's freaky hearing all
those different thoughts

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.049
going through everybody's heads.

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.010
[RHYME] Yeah, like listening to
a radio where everyone's values

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.012
are trying to come
in the loudest.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.097
Straight trippy.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.640
There's a gazillion
people around,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:04.434
but not a single one
ever notices us.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.396
Yeah. Makes you feel
kinda sad, doesn't it?

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.439
[NEKU]
Not me.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:13.902
Thanks to the Underground,
nobody notices me,

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.029
so nobody bothers me.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:20.033
I don't have to talk
with anyone. Ever.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.077
Ya know, you say some
really depressing stuff

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.078
every now and then.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.162
You good?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:28.834
Yeah. Talking with people
is just pointless.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.505
Scanning tells me exactly what
they think. It's nice and easy.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:37.759
True, but...
it's also very lonely.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.802
Better to talk things out

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.054
so you can learn to
understand each other.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.682
I think so, at least.

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.766
You do?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.268
[SHIKI]
Mh‐hm.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.812
I love your plushie.
It's super cute!

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.689
Oh, Mister Mew?

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:51.773
[RHYME]
That's his name?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.651
[SHIKI] Uh‐huh. Stitched
him together myself.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.069
You wanna feel?

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.321
Sure!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.448
[RHYME squeals]

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.451
He's so fluffy!
You're amazing, Shiki!

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.661
And I also made the
clothes I have on.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.662
[NEKU, BEAT gasp]

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:06.663
I'm impressed.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.082
‐‐Same.
‐‐Thanks.

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:13.003
One day, I wanna become a
professional fashion designer.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.589
That's awesome.
You have a dream.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.217
I'm not entirely sure what that
feels like, but I bet it's nice.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.845
You're not sure?
Just say you don't have one.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.138
[gasps]

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.473
Phones! Can it!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.434
Beat, dial it back! All right?

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.356
[BEAT] Listen, Rhyme,
there's no time limit.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.900
You just keep doin' you.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.819
Before you know it, a dream'll
land right in your lap.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.529
Doesn't matter if you
don't have one now

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.698
'cause one day you will.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.287
Like mine. I wanna be the
world's best skateboarder.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:51.750
Right! I'll keep on moving
forward and find my own dream.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.044
[SHIKI] That pendant you're
wearing is, like, super rare.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.171
My friends and I stood in line
for hours trying to get one,

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.089
but never did.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.509
Oh, this thing was actually
a birthday present

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.718
from my older brother.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.304
Aw. I like him already!

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.723
Yeah?

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.936
He's such a nice guy. I hope
he knows how proud I am.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.731
[WOMAN C] I hear they're
having an event at 104!

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:15.649
[NEKU]
What?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.650
Love that store!

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.026
Let's go!

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.320
Hold up. Why's everyone
gettin' excited?

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.865
Looks like something's going
down at the 104 building.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.992
Well, we still haven't
gotten a mission.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.911
You wanna check it out?

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.747
If it ain't a part of a mission,
then I ain't interested.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.084
Wait! Then where are you going?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.586
Bye! Hope to see you soon!

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.300
There they go.
Do you not care either?

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.635
[NEKU sighs]

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.804
[NEKU]
I'll go if you want to.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.768
Whoa! The size of
this crowd is insane!

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.021
Yep! A typical day for 104.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.607
Oh! Those outfits are brand new!

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.486
Wow! These are like
the definition of cute!

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.447
Kind of inspiring, huh, Eri?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.116
[NEKU]
Eri?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.827
Sorry. My friend and
I used to come here.

Eiji!

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.165
Marry me!

Who's that guy?

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.920
[SHIKI]
Eiji Oji.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.339
People can't get enough of his
don't‐give‐a‐damn attitude,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.717
and now he's a star.

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.427
Ahh!

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.221
[CROWD screaming]

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:32.267
Come on! All he did
was drink water!

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.102
[SHIKI]
They say, "The Prince sells."

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:38.106
Everything he compliments flies
off the shelves in seconds.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.068
You know that bell
pendant that Rhyme has?

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.820
It took off 'cause
Eiji blogged it.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.364
That why you wasted hours
of your life in that line?

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.451
Yeah. He's def influenced
my personal taste.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.660
The guy just really
knows his stuff

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.330
when it comes to fashion,
and I respect that.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.499
That's right. You said
you made your clothes.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.002
They look like what you'd
buy in a store, though.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.754
Thanks, but I just sewed 'em.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.423
They were designed
by my friend, Eri.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.218
It'd be nice to earn a
living by making clothes.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.597
To see tons of people
decked out in our creations.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.809
We'll make clothes that
make people happy.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.394
Huh. That so?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.812
[SHIKI]
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:20.607
Anyway, would you mind if
I window shop a little more?

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.233
Nope.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:31.409
[NEKU] You're trying so hard,
and I think I know why.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.120
If you survive these seven days,

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:37.207
will your dream
magically come true?

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.642
We're not even making a dent!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.853

attracting them here.

[NEKU]
Jeez! It's never‐ending!

What did they do to make
it this bad anyway?

No idea. But they're
definitely the source!

[AI] I can't believe she has
the nerve to call me a liar

when I know for a fact she's met
up with Makoto behind my back!

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:59.748
[MINA] Okay, I'm 99% positive
she's got the wrong idea.

Trying to surprise her
might've backfired.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.045
Right. I'm going
to use Imprinting.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.088
[NEKU]
What's "Imprinting"?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.632
It's an ability the
Player pin grants.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:10.967
It allows us to use telepathy

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.595
and speak directly
to their minds.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.722
Please be honest
and communicate.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.599

You still wanna go

I hope so. Makoto thought it'd
be the perfect b‐day gift.

that was why.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.177
Oh, gosh! I'm so sorry!

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.554
Heh. I think that these
tickets are more trouble

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.264
than they're worth.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.184
I'm such an idiot. Thank you!

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.144
[MINA chuckles]

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.647
Okay! That should stop
them from appearing!

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.066
[NEKU]
Cool!

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:12.529
Which means...
they're all that's left!

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.451
Let's move!

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.225
We did it!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.726
[NEKU]
Yeah.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:44.602
I'll treat you somewhere...

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:48.106
I'm happy those two managed
to patch things up in the end.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.190
Always.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.775
Friends are such a pain.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.570
Gonna have to disagree.
People need friends.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.612
They make the world brighter

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.072
when dark clouds
start rolling in.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.032
[ERI'S FRIEND]
What're you doing later, Eri?

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.742
[ERI]
Not sure yet.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.703
Let's get outta here, ASAP!

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.874
Wha‐‐? Hey!
What's gotten into you?

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.418
I just really wanna leave!

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.962
[ERI]
Oh. You mean Shiki.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.340
[gasps]

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.093
That girl, she could
pass for your twin!

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:19.429
It's, uh, complicated.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.640
[ERI'S FRIEND] If you wanna
talk, I'm happy to listen.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.518
[SHIKI]
That girl is Eri.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.689
I look like her
because here, I am her.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.741
[NEKU]
Day five.

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.118
Hey. You okay?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.997
Sorry. I, um, might
not be helpful now.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.916
Why is that? What happened?

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.168
[phone buzzing]

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.047
[NEKU] "Dominate the Scramble
Crossing view at three o'clock."

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.298
Dominate the view?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.218
[MAKOTO]
By three PM today?

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.929
I‐I'm sorry, but that
just isn't enough time!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.640
If anyone can make it work,
it's you, Makoto.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:04.891
The ad'll show here!

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:05.683

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.269
an exclusive viewing

Make it so everybody's eyes
are glued to that screen.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.024
Cool? You've got this, Mick.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.192
I‐‐ Wait.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.401
Scramble Crossing's popular,

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.528
but nobody pays attention
to that screen!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.615
Is what they're saying
connected to our mission?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.034
Hey.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:23.952
[SHIKI gasps]

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.163
My bad. I guess I zoned out.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.249
[NEKU] Thinking of your
identical twin, I take it?

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.669
Huh? Yeah.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.506
Remember? I told you
'bout Eri yesterday?

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:39.008
She's cute and smart.
Everybody likes her.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.469
And I'm no exception to that.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:45.640
Deep down, I wished that
I could somehow be her.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.521
[NEKU] Well, that makes
zero sense to me.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.858
Before, you said it's your
dream to make clothes.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.654
You want 'em to make
people happy. Don't you?

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.447
I do.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:05.076
[NEKU]
Shiki, from what I've gathered,

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.579
I think you're fine
the way you are.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.707
Let's go clear this mission.

'Kay.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.300
So, any bright ideas
about what we should do?

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.884
Find that Eiji Oji guy.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.554
Since everyone and their grandma
will listen to whatever he says.

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.764
[NAO]
This water is totes refreshing.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.891
Like, how does the
Prince always know?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.185
[NEKU] That's the brand he was
splashing around yesterday.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.354
Yep. So I think I'm gonna
try scanning them.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.523
It might give us a hint
to Eiji's whereabouts.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.858
[SOTA]
Oh. Sure thing.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.277
Thank you, hun! Love ya!

We're in luck, Neku.
He's gonna hold an event at AMX.

And we're giving
all of these out?

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:48.745
That's right.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.371
I'm under a buncha
pressure from the boss

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.415
to make these things big.

[OJI] This design, it looks
like a shiny little red skull.

[NEKU] Damn it! Why put
a wall here of all places?

We're already
running low on time!

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.598
Wonder what we have to do
to make it break down for us.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.642
There's no Noise to defeat.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.270

The requirements have been met.

Something about taking
care of a certain pin,

whatever that means.

the second I touched the wall!

You've got most of the pins.
What do I have that you don't?

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:44.467

you got from that band Reaper.

Oh! I bet that's it.

It's weird. 777 was
really approachable.

but are some also friends?

two Player pins?

I could've sworn
all participants

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.527
were only supposed to have one.

You tell me.

I'm still clueless as to why
I'm even playing this game.

Well, uh, maybe...

Oh, I know how that second
pin can come in handy!

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.789
Yeah! Keep it somewhere
close to your heart.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.417
That way it can stop a bullet,
like a miniature shield!

Last night, I was relaxing,
sipping Aquan,

lost in an ocean of
thoughts... when it hit me.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.533
I proudly present
Red Skull pins!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.953

yourselves with these beauties?

Well, it would be the birth of
a glorious trend, for starters!

Get the pins, put them on,

the crowd really grow?

warned us about this!

we cleared the mission.

So I guess we're safe, for now.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.867
I haven't known you for long,
but you've already changed.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.160
[NEKU]
You think?

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.996
If I have...

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:29.085
...it's because I never wanna
screw up like that again.

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.963
I wouldn't worry.
Give yourself more credit, Neku.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.676
[ERI'S FRIEND]
You seem so down, Eri.

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.386
Is everything okay?

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:42.264
Oh. Today was meant to be fun,
but I'm spoiling it.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.224
[ERI'S FRIEND]
Could still salvage it

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.850
if you tell me what's wrong.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.103
[ERI]
Uh. Yeah, okay.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.896
Though I'm still on the fence,

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.981
I think I'm going to
give up designing.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:51.691
[SHIKI gasps]

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.943
You'll quit something
you're that good at?

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:57.154
Eri. How come?

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.365
You can find out right now
if you give her a scan.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:03.327
I could never! Not for
such a petty reason.

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:06.622
Invading my friend's private
thoughts just feels wrong.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.999
She's oblivious, so it's
not like she cares.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.334
It'd be a cinch.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:14.213
No, it wouldn't. I can't.
I don't want to!

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:19.552
Learning what Eri thought of the
girl I was before scares me.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:20.428
[ERI'S FRIEND]
So, what?

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.472
You're throwing your fashion
designer dream out the window?

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:26.100
It won't happen without Shiki.

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.977
[gasps]

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:30.020
She was so talented.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:34.233
Even my small ideas were turned
into ensembles. Always.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:37.570
She worked hard,
honed her craft each day.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.114
She was ten times
more gifted than I am.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:40.906
Eri.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:43.826
But I couldn't find
a way to tell her,

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.036
and wound up hurting her.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:47.455
I saw her getting frustrated

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:51.208
because she didn't think she
was good at designing clothes.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.671
I said, "Maybe you're not meant
to design" to downplay it.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:59.258
Sewing was her strength,
and I thought she'd agree.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.219
The way I phrased it could've
been better, though.

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.306
[ERI]
I regretted it instantly.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:09.143
I was going to apologize as soon
as I saw her the next day.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:13.189
But now... I can't.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.066
I'll never, ever see her again!

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:21.238
Yes, they may have
been my designs,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.532
but Shiki was the one
who made them all real.

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.326
We were a team.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:31.457
That's why... I can't do it.
Not without Shiki.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:34.627
All this time... she thought
that highly of me?

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.378
[ERI]
It was our dream.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.381
We wanted to brighten the world
with the clothes we made.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.801
We always talked
about the future.

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.720
But now she's...

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.347
[SHIKI]
I'm right here.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:49.016
You and I still have
the same dream.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.646
Neku, I don't have any doubts.

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.941
I wanna come back to life
and fulfill our dream.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.860
Um, I'm sorry.
That some kinda code?

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:03.656
[SHIKI] Oh, right. You don't
remember that either.

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:06.492
The game that we're
playing isn't free.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.453
And my appearance was
the entry fee I paid with.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.790
Since I still needed a body
to play, they gave me Eri's.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:16.001
So, yeah, I don't really
look like this.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.003
What the heck are you saying?

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.630
[SHIKI] The Reapers' Game
is an examination

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:22.758
to see who's worthy of
a second chance at life.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.927
I died in an accident.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:29.557
[NEKU]
Wait... How?

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.433
When did I...?

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.310
I'm dead?

00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:08.864
[NEKU]
Next time: "Erased."
