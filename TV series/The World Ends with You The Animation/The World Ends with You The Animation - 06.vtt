WEBVTT

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:14.806
Neku? Everything all right?

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.558
[NEKU]
I'm sure of it.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.478
I was shot dead and
he pulled the trigger.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.106
What's wrong? Are you
not feeling well?

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.403
You jerk! How can you
look at me like that?

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.491
Ah, your memory click?

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.700
Something else you
should remember

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.703
is you need your partner
to win the game.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.498
Do you not care about
that Shiki girl?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.958
Could've fooled me.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.460
[growls]

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.003
Damn it!

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.422
[JOSHUA sighs]

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.675
[JOSHUA] I've got your back
until the game's over.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:54.221
Rest assured. All I want
in return is your help.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:56.723
What's your ultimate goal here?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.893
I wish to properly
guide Shibuya.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:01.853
I still don't know
what that means.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.855
Care to elaborate a little?

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.524
[JOSHUA] It'll go faster
if you can recall

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.276
who controls this ward.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.445
The Composer, right?

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.949
That's what you've been hunting?
So you can meet face‐to‐face?

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.163
[JOSHUA] There's a high‐energy
signature down this alley.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.040
You think it's the Composer?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.917
One way to find out.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.714
Be nice to have some
backup, just in case.

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.806
[MINAMIMOTO] "Sir,
I bear a rhyme excelling.

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.976
In mystic force and
magic spelling." Heh!

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:43.020
The GM? That's weird.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.105
Quiet. He'll spot us.

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:50.319
There. I do believe it's ready.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.365
[laughing]

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:59.077
What's going on?

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.205
[JOSHUA] Not sure what
these scribbles are,

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.750
but my phone's
responding to them.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.545
And they're emitting
absurd energy.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.472
[KARIYA]
A Taboo Noise Refinery sigil.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.058
Looks incomplete, though.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.102
Something's rotten in
the ward of Shibuya.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.414
[NEKU]
Another day bites the dust.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:10.876
[JOSHUA] Hello, Mister H.
It's me. Yeah. I would...

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.252
[NEKU]
We're almost there.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:16.047
But I'm really starting to doubt
if we'll be able to win.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.842
My partner killed me.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.763
Trusting him isn't
even an option.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.767
But I have to clear this
game, no matter what.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:31.146
For Shiki's sake.
Losing's not an option either.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:32.606
[JOSHUA]
Daydreaming?

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.610
In this nightmare?

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.653
[JOSHUA] Hey, I'm going to
pay Mister H another visit,

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.072
and I'd prefer if you came, too.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.117
Look. The tracker's a dud.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.535
It's getting hits
all over Shibuya,

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.746
so let's make fixing
it today's mission.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.122
Any objections?

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.415
No.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.213
[NEKU]
That's a wall.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.757
And I'm not seein' a way around.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.718
Well, we'll just have
to open it, then.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.345
Is there a Reaper?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.638
Uh!

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.849
I, uh, don't think that's
your average graffiti.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.226
It's Noise!

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.741
Bet you anything beating
them unlocks the wall.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.136
[PLAYER A screams]

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.346
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.989
[JOSHUA]
He's too far away.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.157
Gotchu punks now!

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.703
[BEAT]
Yo, Phones!

00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.498
No, Neku!

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.422
[BEAT]
You best get on your feet.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.092
So I can knock you
down again and again!

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.011
Why, Beat? Tell me.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.346
What do you gain
by doing this, man?

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.099
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a Reaper.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.768
I noticed. But I still
don't wanna fight you.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.688
Why? You a chicken‐wuss?
Talk about a letdown!

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.065
[YASHIRO] Hey, Freshmeat!
Slow your frggin' roll!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.651
Gotta respect the rules
if you're gonna play the game.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.527
Still a bit of time

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.613
before Players can be
attacked directly.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.782
And even then, only the Game
Master gets that privilege!

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:51.036
Tch. Well, the Conductor's got
me runnin' a special op, yo.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.954
[YASHIRO]
Wha‐‐? Why'd he pick you?

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.414
I have seniority!

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.958
Hope you fossils got your
hearing aids turned up for this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.294
Get lost!

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.212
[phone rings]

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.340
Duty calls. Unless you
let it go to voicemail.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.091
Oh, fine!

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.261
Yes! I'm here! Miss Konishi?

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:14.184
Uh, yes. Right.
I'll get it taken care of.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.268
[YASHIRO sighs]

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.895
What? Taboo Noise again?

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.104
Bingo.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.398
That's the king of all drags.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.525
Oh, well. Let's go.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.819
Listen, you, the next time
you mouth off to me

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.113
you'll go from being
fresh meat to dead meat!

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.907
Tch. Keep dreamin'.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.408
[KARIYA] Tough guy
like you could take out

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.869
some Taboo Noise, no prob.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:33.954
What the hell?

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.499
Hands off, Lollipop!
I ain't done here!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.293
Bye, boys. Be seein' ya.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.672
[BEAT]
This ain't over, yo!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.511
Is he really all Reaper?

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.891
[NEKU]
This pendant.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.560
Looks like a bell.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:01.856
It's Rhyme's. She and
Beat were partners.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.276
[NEKU]
He's no genius,

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.821
but he must've had
a reason to join them.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:11.908
Good news.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.619
The wall's gone thanks
to the delinquent Reaper.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.997
Let's not keep Mister H waiting.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.711
Anybody home?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.963
[HANEKOMA]
J! 'Bout time.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.091
[JOSHUA]
Here. I need this fixed.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:31.052
You use it to fight Noise?

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.139
Hey, Phones.
Don't be shy. Come in.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.600
I'm good. I'll
just chill outside.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.233
[NAO]
Heya, Nekky!

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.235
So we meet again.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.029
Seems that way.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.197
Josh‐Josh around?

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.617
Sadly, he's in
the Wildkat café.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.328
Real talk? You should stick
by your partner's side.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.207
Especially since the four of us
are, like, all that's left?

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:05.670
Yeah, well, I wanted time alone.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.467
[NEKU]
Hm?

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:13.053
[SOTA] Been thinkin' 'bout
what you said yesterday.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.387
How the last partner
you played with

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.598
got taken as your entry fee.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.807
Yeah?

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:18.850
It's kinda cool.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.810
Shows how much you really
care about this girl.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.562
She's your most precious thing.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.980
[NAO]
Like, totally!

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.273
I'd gladly be Sota's entry fee

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.733
if it meant he
got another chance

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.777
and we could both be revived.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.736
Oh, for sure!

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.822
If it were for Nao, I'd play
the game a million times!

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:36.409
Thanks, but...
I'm the one at fault.

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.746
Do you think Shiki blames
me for trapping her?

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.664
[SOTA]
Forget blame, man!

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.125
How's caring about someone
the slightest bit wrong?

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.003
Too true! That's,
like, so sweet?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.673
And besides, what's important
is we all make it back, right?

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.385
"All make it back"?
It's easy as that, huh?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:00.517
No. No. You're right. Thanks.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.102
[NAO, SOTA chuckle]

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.437
[SOTA] No reason
for you to feel guilty.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.773
[NAO] Yeah! It's, like,
totally not your fault?

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:07.524
Straight up facts!

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.567
[NEKU]
All of us.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.487
So many people from
so many walks of life,

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.656
living in Shibuya and working
through their issues

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.784
as best they can.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.661
[JOSHUA]
Till next time.

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.703
Try not to break it again...

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.791
[NEKU] I wonder...
Does he have his reasons, too?

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.918
And what does that mean, J?

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:32.841
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.220
[NEKU] That used to be a store,
but I guess it's gone.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.389
It was a pretty cool place.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.642
Wow, you know a lot about
Shibuya, don't you?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.311
Well, I did grow up here.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.606
This ward was my
afterschool playground.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.150
[JOSHUA]
Any playmates?

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.570
I never found people
I could talk to.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.197
Just me, myself, and I.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:59.200
Thought so. You're
wearing the proof.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:02.036
Those headphones scream,
"Leave me alone."

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.623
Where'd this come from?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.208
Just thinking out loud.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.338
You know, the Underground
is a lot like you. Cut off.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.134
All these walls put up
to keep others out.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.846
The UG is actually divided
into multiple areas, Neku.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.598
Shibuya, of course, is one.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.225
The Shinjuku Underground
is popular, as well.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.019
They each have their
own unique rules,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.022
and you can't travel
between them.

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.107
Sound familiar?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.027
[NEKU]
Touché.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:38.323
In life, I thought the only
world I needed was mine.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.909
Then I heard CAT's philosophy.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.787
"Enjoy every moment
with all you've got."

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:48.208
It blew me away. Such freedom.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.836
Do what you want,
how you want, when you want.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:55.215
I wanted to live that,
but never thought I could.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:59.427
Acting on the values I believe
in and nothing else.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.263
I felt like CAT understood me.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.183
[JOSHUA]
You make an excellent point.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.269
Who needs the values of
others weighing them down?

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.730
People aren't meant to figure
each other out, are they?

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.649
Talking's a waste.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.570
Huh. Actually...

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.615
You know my last partner, Shiki?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:24.619
She had a fight with her best
friend and never talked it out.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:28.581
But then, when she heard
how her friend really felt,

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.084
it made her so happy.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.796
I didn't think too much
on it at the time,

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.925
but you should've seen it,
how big she smiled.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.845
Goodness, Neku.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.224
You've had quite the change.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.351
How fascinating.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.482
Huh?

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.818
That one's brand, spankin' new!

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:57.902
[JOSHUA]
The whole of Shibuya

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.072
is practically CAT's
personal canvas.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.699
Must take a ton of time.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.410
I'm surprised he keeps
that silly café open.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.329
CAT has a café?
Somewhere in Shibuya?

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:11.499
You realize you've been
there twice now.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.501
He's Mister H.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.877
Wait. Who is?

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.337
CAT is.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.547
Huh?

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.550
Yup. Moonlights as
a graffiti artist.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.263
Mister Hanekoma
is actually CAT?

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.681
You can't be serious!

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:27.932
As a heart attack.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.978
Whoa! Calm down, Neku!
Just breathe! 'Kay.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.480
For real?

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:40.111
I can totally see it.
Like, whoa.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.405
From the first moment we met,

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.575
I knew there was something
different about that guy.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:48.369
This is awesome!
I've hung out with the CAT!

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.246
Oh, man. That's crazy!

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.706
Yeah, it's crazy.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.917
Crap! I didn't say anything
offensive to him, did I?

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.337
No! I did much worse!

00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:02.050
I tried to tell CAT
about CAT. Ah!

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:05.261
I'm such an idiot!

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.305
[NEKU yells, grunts]

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.724
Do me a favor and
keep this between us.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.476
[NEKU]
Uh. Sure.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.147
Okay!

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.196
I could use a snack.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.989
French fries sound pretty good.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.325
Is this still considered
a game if there are no missions?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.285
[phone dings]

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:32.330
This energy signal
is off the charts.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.749
So it's that direction.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.460
I hope we find the source
before today's over.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.004
Hey. Wait a second.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.424
Your goal‐‐you're aiming to
challenge the Composer.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.593
Guess you could
put it that way.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.388
In that case,
you can count me out.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.516
Maybe I haven't made it clear,
but I'm in this to win.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.268
I can't afford
unnecessary risks.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.104
Neither can I.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.773
Tell you what: If you accompany
me on this last errand,

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.566
I won't do anything but look.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.818
Scout's honor.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.862
Afterward, we can lay low
and do what you want.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.407
You better mean that.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:10.284
I won't involve you any further.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.036
[NEKU] Just gotta get through
these last few days

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.663
without trouble.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.167
All we're doing is looking.
That's literally it.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.920
You got it, boss.

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.547
It's a hop, skip,
and a jump away

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.383
on the other side of
the station underpass.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.059
[NEKU]
Talk about creepy.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.354
Hey. Are you sure this
is the right way?

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.730
[JOSHUA]
Positive.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.442
It's in here.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:48.364
Cool, we checked it out.
You satisfied?

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.492
Relax. I know what I told you.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.953
There's a wall blocking
our path anyway.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:58.624
Huh? You sure?
It's so dark I can't tell.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.085
[JOSHUA]
That one's a bit different

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.879
from the others we've seen.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.673
Removing it's gonna
take some innovation.

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:19.896
Hold up. Does something
feel off to you?

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.401
It does now.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.195
More of those black kind.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:30.114
They're like the Noise from
Tokyu Hands, but uglier!

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.959
Team attacks really are
the only things that work.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.544
Follow my lead on this one.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.046
Screw that!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.262
[BOTH yell]

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.019
[gasps]

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.105
Neku!

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:07.985
[yells]

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.153
[gasps]

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.077
Are you still in one piece?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:16.661
Yeah.

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:19.038
[growling]

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:24.794
Hate to say it, but I believe
that we may be outmatched.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.421
If we can't win,
we've gotta run!

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:32.218
No. I don't think we can.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.387
Not good.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:38.140
Damn! I can't give up now!

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.601
[sighs] Guess I have no choice.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.271
I was hoping to
avoid this, but‐‐

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.791
What? Holy‐‐ Dude!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.085
Since when can your
psych powers do that?

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.796
Since always, but ya know
I hate working up a sweat.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.841
[KARIYA]
Bravo!

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:12.466
[NEKU]
You're that Reaper‐‐

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.718
[KARIYA]
Save your breath.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.597
As fun as your drama is, kid,
I came for Pretty Boy.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.934
I knew something was up.
You're alive, ain't ya?

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.770
Huh? What's he talkin' about?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.480
That was one hell of a blast.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.149
I've been in the UG
for a long time,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.692
so I know what Players can do.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:33.654
And such an OP attack
wouldn't come from a pin.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.824
You know, living folks
aren't allowed in the game.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.075
But, with that said,

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.995
those Taboo Noise were a
pain in the you‐know‐what,

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.205
so I'll let you rebels slide.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.540
[NEKU gasps]

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.083
[KARIYA]
Not next time, though.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.587
You'll be erased before
you even see it coming.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:53.883
By Uzuki, of course. Later.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.677
[JOSHUA sighs]

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.014
[JOSHUA] Since all manner of
Noise are gone, well, shall we?

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.433
[NEKU]
Hang on.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:05.144
You're... alive?

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.563
Was that a trick or was
he telling the truth?

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.274
[sighs] Cat's out of the bag.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:15.446
Yes. I have a pulse,
but I'm still playing the game.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.908
Because you think... it's fun?

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.952
Every set of rules that
exists has a loophole or two.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.454
Though, since
I entered illegally,

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.873
I didn't receive a Player pin.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.125
But you have nothing
to worry about.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.252
I assure you, the pact
we formed was valid,

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.129
which makes us the same
as any other pair.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.048
[NEKU]
The same?

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.758
Like hell you are!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.344
You honestly think you're
the same as the rest of us?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.846
Well, I think you're
full of crap!

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.724
You joined of your own free
will‐‐it was your choice.

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:48.020
But... The actual Players
don't wanna be here!

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:51.357
We didn't ask for this!
Who in their right mind would?

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.150
You're nothing like us.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.320
We aren't playing
the game for kicks!

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.572
Of course not. You're playing
to come back to life.

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.658
You still get
something out of it.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.535
Something you took from me!

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.121
You're the reason I'm dead
in the first place!

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.623
Say that were true.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:10.167
What would you do
to me? Get revenge?

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.210
[NEKU
Wha‐‐?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.753
[JOSHUA] If I were the
one who murdered you

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.630
and forced you to
play this game,

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.341
would you actually do
something about it?

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:19.719
Perhaps choke the life out
of me with your psychs?

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.138
Like you did to Shiki?

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:23.848
How do you know that?

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.559
Don't recall your smarmy
face being there.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.521
Suppose you wouldn't,
but I told you, day one:

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.899
I've had my eye on you
for quite some time.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:36.235
You've been watching?
Since when?

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.989
And what for? And why me?!

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.076
[chuckles] Simply put...

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:47.329
...everything I do is for
your salvation as well.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.126
From Taboo Noise
Refinery sigils?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.919
As if a living Player
weren't a giant headache

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.713
of a problem by itself.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.673
The silver lining is
the Refinery we found

00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.967
hadn't been used.

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:01.886
So all these Taboo
Noise must be crawling

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:05.347
out of the depths
from someplace else.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.892
I heard another Reaper
got smoked by Black Noise.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.518
[SUPPORT REAPER B]
In Dogenzaka, right?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.271
[SUPPORT REAPER A] They showed
up by Tokyu Hands before that.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.774
[SUPPORT REAPER B]
Is nowhere safe in Shibuya?

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.943
You think Minamimoto is
making them attack Reapers?

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.488
As horrible as that
prospect is, I do.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.157
Saw him drawing a Refinery
with our own eyes.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.825
That's pretty solid proof.

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:29.079
I'm no detective by any means,
but he's my number one suspect.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.123
Insufficient evidence.

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:34.710
But we should act before any
more of us get taken out!

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.796
It's scary.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.799
For the first time since
I became a Reaper,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.385
Noise saw me as their prey
instead of their master.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.849
[YASHIRO]
It pains me to admit it,

00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:52.186
but if I had been on my own,
I doubt I'd be here today.

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:56.148
[KONISHI]
I'll make a full report

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.025
to Mister Kitaniji tomorrow.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:01.570
You both are to continue
your investigation.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.780
Right.

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.410
[KARIYA] Tomorrow might
be too little too late.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.085
[MINAMIMOTO laughing]

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.172
Zetta fun times are here!

00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:22.716
I'll inverse calculate
the world over.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.927
I've nearly reached my solution.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.639
Please, look forward to it!
All you hectopascals!

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:34.728
[laughing]

00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:08.781
[NEKU]
Next time, "Joshua."
