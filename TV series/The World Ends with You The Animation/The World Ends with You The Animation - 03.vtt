00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.765
[horn blares]

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.316
[NEKU] So the Underground
is a special Shibuya

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.817
used to run the game,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.570
and all the Players come
here for a common reason.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:29.947
Death.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.950
[NEKU]
We both died somehow.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.535
And now we're wrapped
up in a contest

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.955
where the prize is a
second chance at life?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.124
Question is, how did I die?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.254
[SHIKI]
Huh? Neku?

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.341
[NEKU] It's no use.
I can't remember a thing.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.553
[SHIKI] I don't think you
randomly got amnesia.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.639
It probably has something
to do with your entry fee.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.391
My entry fee?

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.977
I told you, there's a price
for entering this game.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.478
They find out what's
most important to you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.480
at the time and take it.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.106
That's the rule.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.776
[WOMAN A] It's been 20
minutes. I mean, honestly.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.029
So, the other day,
Rhyme said she didn't know

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.323
what having a dream
actually felt like.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.368
And then Skater‐Brain snapped
at me outta nowhere.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.620
I'm guessing she has dreams,

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:21.331
but they were taken
as her entry fee.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.291
She forgot.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.835
Her mind got wiped the
same way that mine did.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.088
As for me, I didn't
like myself at all.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.756
So you can imagine
how confused I was

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.009
when they took my appearance.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.219
But now I know why.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.638
When I first got to the UG
and saw I looked like Eri,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.140
I totally freaked.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.936
But not in a bad way.
It made me happy.

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:45.147
I've always wanted to change.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.567
And suddenly I was the
ever‐adorable and capable Eri.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.112
Then, I realized
I was still me inside.

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:54.489
I could never be Eri,
even like this.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.075
I just didn't want to
accept my shortcomings.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.828
So I got jealous and played
the victim card instead.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.374
I used it as a shield
to cower behind.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.500
Deep down, though,

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.254
the thing I truly value most
in the world... is me.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.341
That's why it cost me
my appearance to play.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.301
It took me a minute,

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:18.096
but I finally understand
the person I am.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.598
Oh, yeah?

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.225
If we make it
through seven days,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:26.021
we'll come back to life and
get our entry fees back.

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:28.565
Five days down, two to go!

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.069
Right.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.449
Oh, know what? I haven't seen
Beat or Rhyme in days. Gosh...

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.453
[NEKU] If I survive, do I
have anything to live for?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.634
I see you're doing quite well.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.345
[HIGASHIZAWA] Yes, sir.
We're down to the last four now.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.682
Before tomorrow's out, I shall
personally have them iced.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.601
That's excellent news.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.395
I will not fail you,
Mister Kitaniji.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.772
[KITANIJI]
That unwavering loyalty

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.024
is why you'll be promoted
by this game's end.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.027
So close I can almost taste it.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.742
[SHIKI]
Oh! Beat! Rhyme! Over here!

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.118
Ya don't hafta shout so loud.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.662
We heard. Just like
half the town.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.289
Sorry 'bout that.

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.334
Players are the only ones who
can hear us, so who cares?

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.378
Oh, yeah. Keep forgettin'
we're invisible.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.508
Anyway, Day Six, peeps!
Don't let your guards down!

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.513
It's cool.
Nothin' but a mission.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.766

[BEAT]
Says, "Reach Tower Records."

[NEKU]
No time limit? The heck?

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.273
Seems a little too easy.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.359
That's like a ten‐minute walk.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.527
[BEAT]
Bet!

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.070
I say we make it a race!

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.113
Phones 'n' Shiki
versus me 'n' Rhyme!

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.240
[NEKU]
Really?

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.160
We clear the mission either way,
so might as well make it fun.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.703
That's "fun"?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.664
[BEAT]
Oh, and no cheating.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.332

Uh, patience is a virtue!

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:37.796
Here we go!

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.508
Explain how that isn't cheating.

Ugh! Hey! What gives, Kariya?

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.099
Who made today's mission
for ages three and up?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.934
Like, are we working overtime?

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:54.104
Deep breaths. Stress
is bad for the skin.

Ah! There they are!
You two are pretty quick!

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:06.449
'Cause it's a race! So you
slowpokes best pick it up!

Tryin' to win a race
I never agreed to?

So you're a loser?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.416
The question is, why haven't
you cleared the mission?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.625
Huh?

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.669

the two of you catch up.

[BEAT] No, Rhyme! Why you gotta
say that in front of him?!

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.096
You're a big softy
underneath, huh?

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.890

Don't get weird on me now!

salty Phones' face was

Think about it for a sec.

It's Day Six and
it's a cakewalk.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:46.239
Get in their shoes.
Still sound all that sweet?

Ugh. He's trying to get
them to drop their guards.

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.995
And we've got orders straight
from the boss to carry out.

Don't we?

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:58.668
Hm. Guess we do. Let's
see how this plays out.

we're the champs!

Aww.

to get you all in one bite.

you do with Rhyme?

Were you not watching?
Your partner's gone. Erased.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.580
[KARIYA] Yep. Turned into Soul
and scattered across Shibuya.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.459

This is your fault.

is done. Later, Skulls.

this Noise first!

Just the big one.

Unless we cut off its food
supply, it'll only get bigger.

to take on the Noise?

Yo, mind your own business!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.168
Players that lose their partners
only have a couple minutes

before they're toast, too!

[yells]

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.421
[NEKU]
You're good as gone!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.474
[SHIKI]
We did it, right?

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.934
[NEKU]
Yeah.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.442
We're the last Players standing.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.904
Of course we are.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.115
Can't make clothes with
Eri if you get erased.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.241
Right.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.911
[NEKU]
Just one more day.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:46.539
We'll win and live.
Whatever it takes.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.755
[NEKU]
Finally made it to Day Seven.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:57.091
"Defeat the Game Master
at the Shuto Expressway."

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.677
If we do, is that it?

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.722
[NEKU]
Think so.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:06.851
Let's win. For Rhyme and Beat.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.353
We can't give up.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.688
[phone buzzing]

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.607
A call?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.402
[HANEKOMA] Hey, it's Hanekoma.
Beat left when I was out.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.070
What?

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.239
Just finish the game up
as quickly as you can.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.449
Beat's still sans partner,
which means he's Reaper‐chow,

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.202
but if the Game's brought to an
end, so is their little hunt.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.411
Okay.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.330
[HANEKOMA]
Remember, it's Day Seven.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.124
And the GM,
Higashizawa, is tough.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.377
You kids better not die on me!

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.461
Wait a sec.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.714
Um, why do you even care
what happens to us?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.800
Someday, you'll know.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.265
Right! Let's put an
end to this game.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.643
Yeah. Let's win it all.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.483
Day Seven is such a yawn.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.318
Well, yeah, 'cause it's
the Game Master's time

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.279
to take the spotlight.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.906
We worked hard this week;
on the seventh day we rest.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.907
[YASHIRO sighs]

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.659
[YASHIRO] I'd rest a lot
easier if I'd scrapped

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.035
those last three Players.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:09.330
Two Mexican hotdogs.
Fresh off the grill.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:12.458
[KARIYA] Perfection.
'Preciate your service.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.334
Of course, sir.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:17.505
Great service for great
customers. No rush, so enjoy.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.590
[KARIYA]
I'll certainly try. Uh.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.760
Hey! Uzuki, dear, that
particular dog is mine!

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.345
Yes, I'm well aware.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.472
What? You harassing me now?

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.516
[BEAT]
Yo.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:32.729
You should relax a little bit.
At least until our next job.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.816
You two took everything,
smiling the whole time.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.362
Now you're making small
talk? Scarfing hotdogs?

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.156
[KARIYA, YASHIRO chuckle]

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.626
What's up?

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:56.878
Oh, nothing much.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:01.424
This week's been crazy.
Sad days and happy days.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.802
I've felt more alive than I
ever did when I really was.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.637
Weird how that works.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.597
This isn't the end.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.892
We'll put this Reaper in his
place and get our lives back.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.811
[SHIKI]
Neku.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.813
[NEKU]
Hm?

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.232
Thank you. For everything.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:22.362
I wouldn't have made
it here if not for you.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.072
Save it for when we win.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.115
Guess I should.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:31.162
Once we're alive, let's meet.
In the Realground.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.042
[NEKU]
I'll think it over.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:41.464
The problem is, you won't
recognize me after this.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.759
[SHIKI]
But you know Mister Mew.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.428
I'll be sure to
have him with me.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.807
Cool. It's a date.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.114
The table's set, so let's
serve the main dish.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.699
Sorry, we're not on the menu!

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.577
Oh? What happened
to my special spice?

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.287
You were begrudging
to a golden brown,

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.165
but that delicious envy is gone.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.708
I have those feelings.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.211
But now, I've learned
to accept them

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.505
'cause they're part of who I am!

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.676
Learned to accept the jealousy
you feel towards that girl?

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:27.593
[SHIKI]
That's right.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.346
Because it takes an amazing
friend to make you jealous.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:33.391
And that same amazing
friend is waiting for me!

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:37.311
I am gonna win! So we can
live our dream together!

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:40.440
It's apparent that
you've gone quite stale.

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.692
But a true chef such as myself

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.861
can use the basest
of ingredients

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.655
to make a toothsome meal!

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:54.036
[yells]

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.460
[roars]

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.923
Allow me!

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.265
Eat this!

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:27.403
[yells]

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.530
[roars]

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.752
[roars]

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.754
‐‐That's new.
‐‐Stay on your toes!

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:51.761
Dodge it!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:56.891
[NEKU screams]

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.518
No!

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.686
How's that?

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.021
Shiki!

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.733
I'm not out yet!

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.445
[NEKU] We can't take
another one of those,

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.572
so let's wrap this up quick.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.158
Right.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.909
You ready?

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.202
[SHIKI]
Mhm.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.083
[yells]

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.260
Bullseye!

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.470
[roars]

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.186
[yells]

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.814
Neku! Break his fall!

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.360
Thanks, Piggy.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.789
[roars]

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.668
Game over!

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.840
[yells]

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:15.886
[HIGASHIZAWA roars]

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.193
[HIGASHIZAWA]
To think that I could lose.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.117
Sorry, Mister Kitaniji,
it appears that I failed you.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.292
[SHIKI]
So... is that it?

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:50.338
[NEKU]
Yeah. We actually won.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:54.175
If that's true, we get
our second chance.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.178
This must be what being
blessed feels like.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.013
[SHIKI]
It feels good.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.275
[gasps]

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.319
[SHIKI gasps]

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.905
What now? Where are we?

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.658
Are we alive,
or are we still dead?

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:21.035
[KITANIJI] The latter,
I'm sorry to say.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.244
Who're you?

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.289
I am but a loyal servant
of the Composer.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:29.168
Also, Conductor of the
Reapers' Game, Kitaniji.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.380
Congratulations on your
hard‐earned victory.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:37.051
And no, I'll bestow the coveted
gift of resurrection...

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.719
...to one person.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.887
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:43.349
Only one of us? I thought all
survivors got to come back.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.809
[KITANIJI]
This rule was established

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.686
by the Composer himself.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:49.146
It cannot be overturned.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:54.443
The Player eligible for revival
this game... is Shiki Misaki.

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:58.656
What the...? It's me?
Why is it me?

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.408
Well, we assess each
Player's growth

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.076
throughout the course
of the game.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.411
You got the best score.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.996
Confronted and
overcame your flaws.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.833
That act alone makes you
the worthiest of revival.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:09.750
Hang on!

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:11.001
If scores are based
on our growth,

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.295
Neku should be the
one that you pick.

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:17.466
On Day One, he pushed
everyone away‐‐even me.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.094
But then he started to change.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.097
He listened to me.
Encouraged me.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.808
He told me I'm fine
the way that I am.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.731
Neku cheered me up.
Made me happy.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:34.024
Look, I want you to live.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.068
No. I can't.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.820
Besides, I want you to live!

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.281
[KITANIJI]
If you still cling to life,

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.825
you're more than welcome
to enter another game.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:47.788
Or if you enjoy the chaos,
you may even become a Reaper.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.915
Keep your Reaper wings.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:54.253
I died, but I don't have
the faintest idea why.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:58.299
If I got a second shot,
would I want it or waste it?

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:00.760
So, yeah,

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:04.388
I'll take another crack at your
game and try to find out.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.056
Neku.

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.769
Come on. Don't cry.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.688
I'm not.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.317
[KITANIJI]
Your decision's final?

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.818
Yes.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.158
[NEKU gasps]

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.411
Shiki! What's wrong?

00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:33.125
You're fading!
How is this revival?

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.128
You made it so I can't
even hold her!

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.213
You're mistaken.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:40.341
I collected your fee
for entry into the game.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.175
[NEKU]
What?

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.844
Don't act shocked.
It only makes sense.

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:46.847
A game with such great
rewards isn't cheap.

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:50.768
To play a second round you
must first pay a second price.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.895
Oh, no.

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.063
Oh, yes.

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.940
We take what Players value most,

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:59.235
and the thing currently holding
that place in your heart...

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.778
