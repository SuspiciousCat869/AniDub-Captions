[NEKU]
We're back at the Scramble?

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.698
Another day's gone by.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.411
Dude, how can you
be so laidback?

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.997
We just have three days
left, including today!

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.708
Not only do we still have to
get Rhyme back from Ironface,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.293
we also gotta get
into the Shibuya River

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.671
and beat the Composer!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.422
Calm down for a sec.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.967
[BEAT] There's nothing
calming about this, yo!

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:53.887
Let's just take things
one step at a time.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.931
First, we should check
and see where exactly

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:58.016
our new keypin gives us access.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.436
Oh. Let's see.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.274
I think he said it's basically
like an officer's keypin, right?

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.860
[PASSERBY A] What a wonderful
world such would be.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.878

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.558
What a freak show. Why are
everyone's thoughts the same?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.686
For real.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:09.147
[CROWD] ...that this place
may become as paradise.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.067

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.485
[NEKU]
The heck's going on?

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.904
Shibuya's normally full
of all kinds of people

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.198
doing and thinking
all kinds of things.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.373
[NEKU] I didn't want
others in my space,

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:31.002
so I tuned them out
by covering my ears.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:36.341
But now, I think I get
it, what's happening.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.261
[CROWD] ...we shine this

What a wonderful

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.687
Those pins are brainwashin'
'em, yo! Straight up!

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.607
I knew it. The Composer is CAT!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.026
'Cause these things are
just like Player pins!

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.778
Why else would CAT be
makin' gear for the game

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.864
if he wasn't in charge of it?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.282
He's not.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.285
And what makes you
think I'm wrong?

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.246
CAT is Mister Hanekoma's alias.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:10.292
Wait. Do you mean
the king a' coffee?

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.836
The same guy who
saved me 'n' Rhyme?

00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:16.256
That's right.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:22.471
Okay. Things just got ten
times more confusin'.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.972
How would you even know that?

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.642
Because Joshua told me,
and I believe him.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.354
Last week, he was
tracking the Composer.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:34.566
And Mister Hanekoma
helped him do it.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:38.111
I can see him being CAT.
That part makes perfect sense.

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.281
But no way he's the Composer!

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.033
He taught me to
expand my horizons

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.452
and to always enjoy life.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.914
He would never create
such a monotonous world.

where we should start
looking for Ironface today.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.482
So, where haven't we been yet?

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:17.359
I know where we have been.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.655
Hachiko, the underpass, 104,

Marui, Parco, Tokyu Hands,

Which leaves not
a whole lot left.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:42.175

[NEKU] Hard to believe even the
Reapers have been affected.

is messing with all sides of it.

Nah.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.330
Up until I came to the UG,
I was the opposite.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.791
Really?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.003
I wasn't crazy 'bout
anything at all.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.464
My folks, they kept
expectin' results

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.674
'n' then always got let down.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:05.926
Not Rhyme, though.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:09.012
Yo, I could rob a bank and
she'd still be by my side.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.848
Her faith in me
was somethin' else.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.558
She'd say, "The whole
reason we're alive

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.896
is so we can find our dreams
and turn them into our future."

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:20.106
And eventually I found mine:

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.734
To be the world's
best skateboarder.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.865
But that's the past 'cause
I got a new future in mind.

back Rhyme and Shiki

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.429
[NEKU]
Let's just move!

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:46.975
What?

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.360
We thought the
walls were busted.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.237
Coffee Man musta
flipped his lid.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.114
Come on, dude. Get real.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:04.617
What reason would he have
to wreck his own café?

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.035
Then who?

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.704
[groans]

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.250
I think I've got a
pretty good guess.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.294
The same thing that
destroyed those walls

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.212
came after Mister Hanekoma.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.172
So, a hit and run?

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.175
Yo! Sounds right up
Ironface's alley!

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.096
[NEKU]
Maybe.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.765
Oh. Why don't we take
more special photos?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.852
I mean, we're bound
to get some kinda hint!

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.855
I've only got one
more shot left.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.982
It can only take two per day.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.651
Useful, but it really
drains the battery.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.117
Yo!

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.286
We got lucky!

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.372
[BEAT] Whachu tryin'
to hide, Mister Beans?

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.082
Let's find out.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.757
[NEKU]
An envelope?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.136
Yeah, there's somethin' inside.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.351
[BEAT]
Yo, it's a Reaper keypin.

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:13.644
[NEKU]
Awesome. Know what it opens?

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:17.273
Nah. I ain't ever seen
one like this before.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:20.693
[NEKU]
That design looks familiar.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.323
[NEKU]
Talk about creepy.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.200
It's in here.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.496
Cool, we checked it out.
You satisfied?

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.374
[JOSHUA] There's a wall
blocking our path anyway.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:36.292
[NEKU]
You sure?

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.210
[JOSHUA]
That one's a bit different

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:39.295
from the others we've seen.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.006
[gasps]

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.592
Hey, did you remember where?

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.511
Shibuya River.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.595
Maybe he left that on purpose

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.390
'cause he knew we would
come here and look, y'know?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.605
Something else is
inside. A letter?

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.359
"It seems Shibuya
has really changed,

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.195
but if you're hoping to survive
it, there's one simple trick."

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.196
[NEKU, HANEKOMA]
"No matter what,

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.865
enjoy every moment
with all you've got."

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.492
[HANEKOMA]
Watch out for shadows.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.161
Konishi tends to operate
in them, after all.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:16.332
And once you find her,
the real battle will begin.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.794
Aw, yeah! Couldn't've
asked for a better clue!

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:23.881
Ironface has gotta be at
the Shibuya River, man!

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:24.966
[NEKU]
Why?

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.217
[BEAT]
Huh?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.177
I don't get it.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.973
Why does Mister Hanekoma
have a keypin for that wall?

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:35.143
Joshua had his sights
set on the river.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:38.855
Surely Mister Hanekoma
was aware of that.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:44.444
But instead of giving the keypin
to him, he gave it to me.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:48.823
What does he want me to do?
What's his angle?

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.368
[BEAT] Yo, we ain't got
time to waste wonderin'!

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.328
Let's find Ironface
and save Rhyme!

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.498
And then we'll introduce
the Composer to my fists.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:03.504
What the heck?

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.089
What kinda punk piled
their garbage up

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.966
in the middle of the street?

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.801
Oh, no, don't tell me.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.888
[MINAMIMOTO laughing]

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.098
You haven't been erased.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.602
Ha! Hollow‐skulled
hectopascals!

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.270
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.730
Hecto?

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:23.357
[laughing]

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.860
I've been calculating
this from square one!

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:29.113
You're still here?
But how? I saw you die!

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:35.244
I am victorious!

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:38.456
That move did more than
just bake your partner.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:41.626
I erased myself with
"Resurrection," a Taboo Psych,

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.879
then returned to the
world from a Refinery.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.005
[NEKU]
So you're the wrecking ball

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.341
that crashed through Udagawa.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.347
Zetta duh!

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:58.100
Since you're here, behold
my latest masterpiece.

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:01.771
I call it: "Myself."

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.689
Then your body is‐‐

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:06.275
[MINAMIMOTO]
Officially Taboo.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.194
This number‐cruncher's
back with powers

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.988
that rival the Composer's.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.782
You're bluffin'.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.705
[chuckles]

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.250
[MINAMIMOTO]
Convention is just garbage!

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.336
Crunch! I'll add it to the heap!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:29.257
Sit back and watch as I become
an imposing new Composer.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:32.176
Because all that
matters is my beauty!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.678
Why did you kill me, though?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.932
All the changes in this ward,
are they because of you?

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.935
The UG started shifting
long before now.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:44.981
Kitaniji making the O‐Pins
mandatory just sped it up.

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:47.358
If you wanna point fingers
at the one changing Shibuya,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.944
then the Composer's your man.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:53.364
My turn for questions.
Where's Hanekoma?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.866
Screw you!

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.451
[MINAMIMOTO]
I wanted to thank him

00:17:57.493 --> 00:18:01.539
for making a Taboo
conversion worthy of me.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.374
[NEKU] So that picture
was Mister Hanekoma

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.543
turning him Taboo?

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.378
Why, though?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.548
Come on! Where'd coffee boy go?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.219
Ah. I know you two know!
His usual haunt was empty.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.638
You tore his café apart!

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.603
Heh. Zetta!

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.360
I could use a warm‐up
before the grand finale.

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:37.366
Attention, 000s!
You get to die 4 my cause!

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:39.243
Let's drop this jerk!

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.703
Yeah!

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.253
[yells]

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.428
[chuckles]

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:02.683
[MINAMIMOTO]
Sine. Cosine. Tangent!

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.024
[NEKU]
Beat!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.614
What?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.290
[NEKU screams]

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.797
This guy, he ain't playin'.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.966
You binomials should've
done the math.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:44.058
The one most fit to rule
this world is me!

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.936
Now zetta die!

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.113
I'd say I aced the practice
test with flying colors.

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.657
That's enough calibration.

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:05.621
Composer, you're done for.

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:16.966
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:19.135
[BEAT]
What the‐‐?

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:22.096
[NEKU]
Scramble Crossing?

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:26.475
Which only means one thing,
we're on day six!

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:31.021
I bet Number Nerd
headed to the river.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.023
Then we best get goin'.

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.361
[NEKU] Joshua said the wall
there isn't like the others.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.364
He'll need a key to
get ahead of us.

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:44.910
You know, Pi‐Face thinks he's on
the same level as the Composer.

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:47.163
Yeah, so?

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:50.166
[NEKU] That means the
Composer's as strong as he is.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.251
Maybe even stronger.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:59.091
[BEAT] Rhyme...
She's waitin' for me.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.427
I ain't gonna wuss out now.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:02.678
I'm doin' this!

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.055
And nothin' anyone says
is gonna stop me!

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.476
[yelling]

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.019
Really?

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:18.402
[NEKU] The Shibuya River.
The Composer. Mister Hanekoma.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.494
[yells]

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.497
[NEKU gasps]

00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.930
[NEKU] He broke through
this barrier, too?

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.390
Guess he didn't need a keypin.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.936
Honestly think you're ready?

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.480
You kiddin'? I was born ready.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:06.992
Let's go.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.494
Yeah.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.090
[chuckles]

00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:53.766
[NEKU] Next time:
"The Hour of Reckoning."
