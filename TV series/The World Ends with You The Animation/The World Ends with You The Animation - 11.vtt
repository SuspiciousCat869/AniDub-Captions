WEBVTT

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.723
[NEKU]
Not much of a river.

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:20.771
But still, Joshua was
bent on coming here.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.524
Because it's where
the Composer is.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.152
[BEAT] I knew it.
The Composer is CAT!

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.946
Why else would CAT be
makin' gear for the game

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.906
if he wasn't in charge of it?

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.575
Enjoy every moment
with all you've got.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.579
Pi‐Face musta tore that wall up

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.165
'cause he knows the
Composer's down here, too.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.792
Yeah.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.879
I ain't lettin' him win.
Gotta save everyone!

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.589
For sure.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.010
[NEKU]
Guess we made it.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.404
[NEKU]
Well, look who it is.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.369
We ain't got time for you!
Outta the way, Taboo Breath!

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.829
It appears we've been foiled.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.998
Why's that?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.501
[MINAMIMOTO] There's a
barrier even I can't break.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.503
Compliments of her
Iron Frostiness.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.130
Which would imply she's
somewhere up ahead!

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.715
[MINAMIMOTO]
Typical hectopascal.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.968
She's not "somewhere up
ahead," you zetta moron.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.761
What?

00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:59.763
But there's no place
else she could be!

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.724
Ha. What, you haven't noticed?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.477
Noticed?

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.772
[KONISHI] Heh. I've been
with you the whole time.

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:09.648
[BEAT gasps]

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.774
You good?

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.819
Yeah. Thought I heard a voice.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.370
I wasn't expecting
to reveal myself.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:26.123
You should've been erased.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.542
The hell were you doing
hidin' in my shadow?

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.127
[MINAMIMOTO]
Heh. You picked the wrong place

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.712
to put one of your barriers up,

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:36.091
so be a good girl
and take it down.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.176
'Cause if you don't...

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:48.061
...you'll be river sludge
before you can count to three.

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:55.402
Very well. I'll comply under
one condition. Just one.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:58.029
If you're able to
become the Composer,

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.199
I would like for you to
make me your new Conductor.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.701
Does that sound fair?

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:06.204
Heh! You double‐crosser.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.039
[KONISHI]
After analyzing the situation,

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.586
I have concluded Shibuya is
progressing toward a full stop.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.839
There's no denying
revolution is upon us.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.843
[KONISHI]
As such, who has the best odds

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.846
of surviving the ensuing chaos?

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.974
Why, a free spirit such
as yourself, of course.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:30.562
[laughing]

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.856
Well, please excuse
my dear Aunt Sally!

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:36.026
Fear 'n' mercy are
nothin' but garbage!

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:39.738
I zetta dig your style!
You've got a deal.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.991
[KONISHI]
Oh? Then no more barrier.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.785
[MINAMIMOTO laughs]

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.244
[MINAMIMOTO]
Listen up!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.581
Attention of every last binomial
here in the Underground!

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:57.839
You have a brand‐new Composer.
And his name is me!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.092
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.471
Move!

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:07.390
[KONISHI] I can't allow
you boys to ruin things.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.768
Not when my promotion's
all but assured.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.395
Never mind who my
boss happens to be.

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.314
You bitch.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.444
Rhyme, fly away!

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.073
Any and all disruptive elements
in my path shall be obliterated.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:28.620
Thus, I predict...
this is the end for you!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.456
[NEKU gasps]

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.793
What? We're floating?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.295
[BEAT]
Weren't we just under ground?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.047
[NEKU yelping]

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.549
Grab on!

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.097
Okay.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.352
[KONISHI]
Over here!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.687
[gasps]

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.784
[chuckles]

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.953
Like what you see?

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:14.875
[yells]

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.960
[chuckles]

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.503
Nothin' works on her!

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.880
Stay focused!

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.090
As if that will help.

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:30.056
[BOTH scream]

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.065
We won't last.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.820
I'll act as a decoy
and buy some time.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.655
While she's busy
comin' after me,

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.825
let 'er have it with the
strongest psych you've got!

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.494
If I don't make it outta here,
take care a' Rhyme for me.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.412
Okay, Phones?

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:53.997
Yeah, screw you.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.042
I'll snag Rhyme if
I can. That's all.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.127
Only you can bring
her back to life!

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.797
Heh. Then let's do it
to it, partner!

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.760
Yo, Ironface! Check what
your future boss can do!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:11.848
Vexatious worm. The only thing
in your future is defeat.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.099
[BEAT]
A'ight then.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.351
And when exactly do you figure

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.020
you're gonna put the
final nail in my coffin?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.650
I'd love t' know!

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.360
Right now.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.903
[BEAT grunts]

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.164
[KONISHI]
How stubborn you are.

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.334
Say good‐bye!

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.183
Know your place!

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.060
Not a scratch?

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.771
No!

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.526
[KONISHI] No sense in
hastening your death.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.735
I'll take my time!

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.237
[NEKU yells]

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.077
They set me up to
fail this week,

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.246
but you still helped me.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:20.458
Dumb move. Yet I trust in
those idiotic instincts.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.168
Now let's go get Rhyme back.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.838
For sure. And don't
forget about Shiki!

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.733
[BEAT]
Never again. Never!

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:49.029
[yells]

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:57.871
[yells]

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.584
That light.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.713
I already decided we're not
gonna let anyone else die!

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:11.801
So you won't be killin'
a dang thing today!

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:19.100
[yells]

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.777
Hey, Rhyme.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.701
Now that Rhyme's back in our
corner, we've all but won!

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.328
[KONISHI]
You're far too presumptuous

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.039
considering this isn't over!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.130
Yo, we need to concentrate!

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.299
You're the one telling me that?

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:58.515
[BOTH yell]

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.224
Feel that?

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.435
Yeah! Best not take
my lil' sis lightly!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.564
[NEKU yells]

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.702
[KONISHI screams]

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.748
Her shadow's her weak point!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.959
Sweet.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:30.046
[KONISHI screaming]

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.122
What now?

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.500
Yo, no clue. I can't even see.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.337
Whoa! Easy!

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.464
I'm sorry.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:17.677
You got caught 'cause of me,
but never again, I swear!

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.891
[KONISHI]
This is impossible.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.643
My projections
are always correct.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.979
Sucks to be you, I guess.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:32.108
You anomaly. How were you
able to summon a Noise?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.319
You lost your status
as a Reaper!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.488
Because I'm Rhyme's older
brother, that's how.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.740
[chuckles]

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.410
It all boils down to a
bond between siblings?

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.163
How odd, since it's not genuine.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.873
Huh?

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.585
Because I was made the
Game Master this week,

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.295
I was also made
aware of everything

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.590
that was taken as
your entry fees.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.508
And your sister's memories
were your payment

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.344
for the first round.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:05.892
What? Rhyme's memories
were my entry fee?

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.395
[NEKU] Don't listen to her,
Beat, she can't be trusted!

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.398
[KONISHI] Your precious sister's
entry fee was something else.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.487
Meaning, you must not have
been very dear to her.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.405
[KONISHI chuckles]

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.700
[KONISHI]
Oh, that look of utter despair.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.329
It's just as I predicted.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:33.711
Hold on.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:37.507
If she's right, what'd Rhyme
pay to play the game?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.845
[SHIKI]
Her dreams. Most likely.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.389
[NEKU, BEAT gasp]

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.142
[NEKU]
Shiki?

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.519
When dreams got brought up,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.605
Rhyme admitted she didn't know
what it felt like to have them.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:53.898
[NOISE RHYME cooing]

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.191
[gasps]

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.736
[chuckles]

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:03.283
No way. Is that
really you? But how?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:07.328
I'm honestly not sure since I
only came to a few seconds ago.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.040
So, where are we?
And who's this cutie?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:17.046
Yo! We did just beat Ironface.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:20.174
[NEKU]
And it made the timer disappear.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.843
Which means we won the game!

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.512
So they returned our
entry fees to us.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.681
Uh, guys? No, they didn't.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:29.309
'Cause I wouldn't look this
way if that were true.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.437
[NEKU] I think it's because
we're still in the UG.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.274
What I mean by that, well,
was you got returned.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.442
You were my fee.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.612
Uh. Wait! So they
took me as your fee?

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.656
Oh, gosh! That would mean...

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.825
Wait! Really?

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:46.617
Yeah.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.620
They take what you value most,
and for Neku, that was you.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.081
I... I'm sorry.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.710
I just wanted for you
to have another chance.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:59.130
Honestly, I wanted
to see you smiling.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.508
Being happy and enjoying
Shibuya with your friends.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.890
Wow. You've sure changed.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.935
All thanks to you.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.938
Uh. Me? But...

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.109
C'mon! I didn't do
anything special. Did I?

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.403
Plus, you and Beat
are the amazing ones!

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.821
You guys survived again!

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.240
So hopefully now we
can all come back.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:30.119
No. I don't see that happening.
That guy would've shown.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.496
Are you talkin' about Shades?

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.831
So we don't win
till he says we do?

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.249
Huh?

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.713
Over there. What's that?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.718
Let's find out.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.602
[NEKU]
It's Pi‐Face.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.735
[ALL gasp]

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:14.539
[gasps]

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.090
Welcome to the final stage.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.515
You all stand in the
Room of Reckoning.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.766
Who cares?

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.310
Not me unless the
Composer's here.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:39.355
The Composer is a noble being
that shepherds the human race

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.858
toward a brighter
and happier future.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.820
He is on a far different plane
from egoists such as yourselves.

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.488
Like any of that matters!

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.031
It won't stop me from
takin' his place

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.867
'n' bringin' everyone
back to life!

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.453
[KITANIJI]
There it is.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:57.331
That self‐serving rubbish
is the root of all suffering.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.834
You, you're no different.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:00.918
You wear those headphones

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.963
to block out
interpersonal connections.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.717
I was convinced I didn't
need anybody else.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.137
[KITANIJI] All the world's ills
can be traced to individuality.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.431
That's what corrupted Shibuya.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:17.226
The only way to salvage
this ward is if it's reborn.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:21.355
Our purpose of this game was
to bring about that rebirth.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:27.820
Shiki!

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.198
[KITANIJI] Interference
will not be condoned.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.159
[NEKU] You bastard!
What did you do to her?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.120
To right the countless wrongs...

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.122
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.834
[SHIKI] ...we shine this
light of true redemption.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:42.835
Oh, man.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.295
Shiki!

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.547
[SHIKI]
That this place...

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.426
She's like the other
mindless zombies we saw.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.137
[chuckles]

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.182
...may become as paradise.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:59.727
[KITANIJI, SHIKI] What a
wonderful world such would be.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.563
[KITANIJI]
Almost too wonderful, and yet...

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.982
[KITANIJI, SHIKI]
...it's almost in reach.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.991
[KITANIJI chuckles]

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.451
[screams]

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.744
[gasps]

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:29.674
[yelling]

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.425
Damn it!

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.803
[KITANIJI laughs]

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:37.682
What gives? What are you
hoping to achieve from this?

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.560
We ain't got time for all
these questions, Phones!

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.022
[SHIKI yells]

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.442
Don't hurt her!
She's not the enemy!

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:51.404
Look closer. In her pocket!

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.446
[NEKU]
It's glowing red.

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.532
[BEAT]
Yeah. From a Skull Pin.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.825
No way.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.077
[BEAT] Shades must've planned
this from the start.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.495
If we got rid of it...

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.871
[BEAT]
Watch out!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.964
[KITANIJI] Do you honestly
believe your mediocre skills

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.467
could contest both me
and the Composer?

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:23.644
[yells]

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.364
Yo. Brace yourself.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.075
[yells]

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.880
What?

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:54.717
Take your dumb game
and shove it!

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.571
[NEKU]
Shiki!

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.622
[NEKU]
These pins caused everything.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:28.459
The Composer's pins...
Mister Hanekoma's!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:44.308
I should be long gone,
but you all saw me through.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.645
Leave the rest to me.
I'll end it.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:54.276
No. I can fight.
Shibuya must be preserved!

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:02.868
[gasps] A timer? I thought
only Players got those!

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:07.581
The clock's still ticking.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.129
This world is like an
orchestra, in many ways.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.797
Huh?

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:18.384
The key to most divine music
is a skilled conductor.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.887
If a leader were to orchestrate
us under one ideal,

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.682
all could coexist in harmony.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.017
Your ideals are twisted.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.187
Take a look at all the Noise
swarming around you.

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.400
[KITANIJI] Shibuya's full
of negative emotions, too.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:41.073
Rage. Hate. Misery. Envy.
Fear. Self‐deprecation.

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:45.494
A dissonance of countless
selfish wants will collide.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:51.417
And swell into greater threats.
Crime and warfare are made real.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:56.088
Remove the noise and I
remove all differences.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.091
The world will
become as paradise.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:03.721
Making everyone think alike?
You think that is paradise?

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:07.808
It is, indeed! Skull Pins
are making it real!

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.226
You were behind those?

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.436
[KITANIJI]
I did get the design

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.855
from the Composer's
Player Pins, I'll admit,

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:17.276
but the idea of using them
to save mankind is mine.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.277
Because what I'm seeking

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.696
is to right the countless
wrongs of our day.

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:24.033
I wish to shine a light
so that every soul,

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.578
both living and dead,
may find paradise.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.705
What a wonderful
world such would be.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:31.040
No!

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.334
[NEKU] I've always been bad
at dealing with people.

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:36.378
I shut my ears to shut them out.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.173
But if you don't clash,
you don't change.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.759
Your world will never grow!

00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.930
You can't enjoy the moment!

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.059
I've learned so much just
from clashing with people

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.019
in the Underground.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.730
There were times I was
angry or anxious.

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:57.608
But I shouldn't be forced
to stifle my feelings!

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.444
Being passionate's a good thing!

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.072
I knew that you were the one.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:12.206
Shibuya should stay as it is!

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.250
But you can go!

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:53.641
[NEKU]
"It's a Wonderful World."
