WEBVTT

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.307
You think she got 'im? Or nah?

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.892
Beat, look.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.314
This is 777's choker.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.871
[gasps]

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:04.416
This place, it's an underpass.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.294
Is it Miyashita Park?

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.547
Where did Beat go?
Can't be too far.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.887
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.393
Was there some kind
of accident here?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:24.269
Anybody home?

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.771
[BEAT gasps]

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.898
[BEAT] Sorry. Didn't
know you were awake.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.193
Well, now that we're both up,
let's sort out a game plan.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.987
Maybe we'll find her today.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.656
That'd be nice.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.618
Okay, you're acting
really weird. What's up?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.288
Heh. That obvious?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.790
Guess I can tell you.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.584
Probably won't get
a better time to talk.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:51.588
[RHYME]
Beat, wait!

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.091
Come on! Don't be like this!

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.843
He'll understand if you explain
where you're coming from.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:57.928
I ain't gotta explain nothin'

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.472
to that hard‐headed,
close‐minded old man.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.431
Haste makes waste!

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.308
And you're acting
way too hasty here!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.852
[BEAT]
Can it! Just leave me alone.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.646
Beat, please.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.023
[WOMAN A]
Watch out!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.608
[crash]

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.278
[gasps]

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.532
Rhyme!

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:29.418
Me and Rhyme were both hit
by a car and died here.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.752
Wha‐‐?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.422
[BEAT] I ain't strong
enough to stop a car, yo.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.842
And that was our ticket
to the Underground.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.136
I am so sorry, man.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.846
Rhyme wasn't like me.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.307
She had a future
and plenty of dreams.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.351
If I'd listened to her
and turned back,

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.187
she never would've died.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.649
But 'cause she had to have a
stupid loser brother like me...

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.610
Brother?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.990
Yeah. Rhyme is my,
or was, my little sis.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.242
No way.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.202
It's nice to meet you.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.752
Wait. Have we met before?
Don't think so.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.797
Every memory she had
of me was suddenly gone.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.592
Bet that was because
of her entry fee.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.011
Said she remembered having
a brother when she was alive,

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.596
but that's it.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.807
Details like his face and
name were just one big blur.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.685
I mean, talk about
sick jokes, man.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:32.022
But still, I agreed to make
a Partner Pact with her.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:32.981
I psyched myself up

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.860
thinkin' that I might
actually keep her safe.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:40.781
Then, Rhyme bein' Rhyme,
wound up savin' me.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:46.453
She's felt the pain of death
twice‐‐both times were my fault.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.704
Come on, man.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.374
Beat, you jumped in
front of a car for her.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.001
And when she talked
about her brother,

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.421
it didn't sound like she held
any resentment for him.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.839
You want more proof?

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.593
Your entry fee is something
you really care about.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.220
Think it's fair to say
she cares quite a bit

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.181
if they took her
memories of you.

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.350
I dunno 'bout that.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.480
[BEAT] What I do know is she
was too nice for her own good.

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:15.607
Lookin' out for others
was just what she did.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.485
Even helped stubborn
dumbasses like me.

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:21.571
Ahh. I see.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:26.284
Can't fix dumb. And that's
no doubt what you are.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.120
This really the
time for insults?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.039
Just saying I'm lucky is all.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.251
You told the Reapers to shove
it and made a pact with me.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.962
Not the smartest move.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.923
Before I got to the Underground,
I couldn't care less

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.509
about what people thought
of me or did for me.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:45.053
Not anymore.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.431
Now, when I see someone stick
their neck out for my sake,

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.726
I feel like I've got no
choice but to trust them.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.895
They set me up
to fail this week,

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.022
but you still helped me.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:00.110
It was dumb. Yet I trust in
those idiotic instincts.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:04.281
Heh. There has gotta be
a better way to put that.

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:07.659
It's a compliment. Honest.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.329
You do you.
Dumb Beat is best Beat.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.128
I'm smart enough to know this:
You're absolutely right.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.796
I am feelin' pumped!

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.590
Ain't no one gonna stop
me from savin' Rhyme

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:25.927
and bringin' her back to life,
and I mean nobody!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.056
Yo, Neku! I owe you yet again!

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.353
[NEKU]
No worries, yo.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.063
Now let's go get Rhyme back.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.025
For sure! And don't
forget Shiki!

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.651
We got this!

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.737
Yeah.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.739
[BEAT] Our "game plan" can be
to take out all the Reapers

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.490
that get in our way while
we look for Ironface!

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.826
That's a horrible game plan!

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.620
Way to ruin the moment!

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.123
We're gonna have to try and be
more stealthy going forward.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.043
[NEKU]
We're the sole two Players,

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.378
and the Reapers are out
for blood this week.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.215
If we make a scene and they call
for backup, it won't be pretty.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.635
We'll stick to using keypins.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.972
Think of 777.
Let's not waste his gift.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.807
[BEAT]
Yeah, good point.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.898
This way.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.109
Huh. The crowd's usually
much bigger here.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.196
Maybe there's an event
goin' on somewhere else.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.199
Well, so much for our
blending‐in strategy.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.951
Hide!

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.786
[SUPPORT REAPER A] I haven't
seen 'em anywhere. Have you?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.496
[SUPPORT REAPER B] I thought
I saw a kid with a headset

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.581
a second ago,
but then I lost him.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.667
I'll check over on Route Three.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.001
[SUPPORT REAPER A]
Gotcha.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.755
We're gettin' nowhere.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.299
Yo, the Reapers are bound to
know where she's holed up,

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.760
so I say we grab
one and scan 'im.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.595
Reapers are immune
to that power.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.516
We can only scan people that're
in the RG. Nice try, though.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.519
[NEKU gasps]

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.359
It's gonna be rough
without any clues, yo.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:08.029
Plus, how're we s'posed to
seek if we're also hidin'?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.490
That felt... interesting.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.535
What's wrong?
Get a quick case of gas?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.042
I can't scan. It's not working.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:25.755
Wha‐‐? Try again, yo.
Everyone here's alive.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.757
They were probably
spacing out, man.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.719
It wasn't like that.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.349
Kinda hard to explain.
She was just... empty.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.648
Any luck?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.567
It didn't let me read a thing.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.819
I figured.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.070
What gives?

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.905
[NEKU]
I'm not sure.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.160
Hey, yo! Check it out!

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.161
Check what out?

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.414
Over there! Her hat!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.625
[NEKU]
A Red Skull pin.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.585
Now that I'm lookin' around,

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.504
I'm seein' a whole
lot more of 'em.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.132
It's like an army
of red polka dots.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.385
Is it the pins?

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:16.222
Hey, I ain't positive, but they
were designed by CAT, right?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.515
Uh‐huh?

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.435
So then, CAT's
most likely the one

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.937
who made the Player pins, too.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.774
All that's different between
them are the colors.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.485
And Player pins have the
same scan‐stoppin' power.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.696
I remember that from
the first day we met.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.032
Which means, if the Red
Skull pins are the reason

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.659
we can't scan any
of these people,

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.370
they must've been created
by the same guy.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.582
According to Mister H,

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:45.668
the Composer's the one who
makes and controls those.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.672
Who is CAT? Why's he
gotta be analogous, yo?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.467
Yep. Mister H is really CAT.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.722
[NEKU] That's ridiculous.
It can't be him.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.768
If it were, Joshua wouldn't have
been looking for the Composer.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:07.190
Let's leave it. Finding
Konishi comes first.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.067
[BEAT]
Yeah, good call!

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.196
[sighs]

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.948
Why the long face?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.367
Konishi's "special mission"
bumming you out?

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.410
That's what you get for being
such an overachiever.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.787
Will you just shut your face?!

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.331
There's nothing wrong
with wanting a promotion!

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.750
Who cares if you're
a big shot or not?

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.128
They don't do anything
but lounge around.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.547
Not exactly what I'd
classify as "fun."

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:31.965
Unlike you,

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:35.051
I am on the edge of something
much bigger here!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.220
Hmm... I dunno.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:38.388
I wouldn't count your
chickens before they've‐‐

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:42.142
Anyway, the last thing I'm gonna
do is let Miss Konishi think

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.519
I bit off more than I can chew!

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.648
It's time to go to work,
so get it together!

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:58.575
[NEKU]
You see that?

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.369
Looks like a new Noise
emporium just opened.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.332
[MAN A] C'mon, man.
All I want's a Red Skull pin!

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.917
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:11.129
We already finished
giving them out today.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.380
What're they gripin' about?

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:15.341
Makin' Noise in more
ways than one.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.926
They keep multiplying
because they're feeding

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.387
on all the negative emotions.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.097
[BEAT gasps]

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.765
Yo! Dude, look!

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.434
At what?

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:28.730
[BEAT] Ain't that Shiki? What's
she doing in the Realground?

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.483
[NEKU] Oh, no.
That's actually her friend.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.860
Shiki only looked like her

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.487
'cause her appearance
was her entry fee.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:40.408
That is so confusing,
but let's help her anyway.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.089
There's no end to them!

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.550
Phones! Pick it up!

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.802
Where you at, yo?

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.346
I'm there!

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.438
Yeah! Gimme some skin! Up top!

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.648
[BEAT chuckles]

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.649
[MAN A]
Guess that's that.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.442
[WOMAN C]
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.153
There might be another place in
Shibuya that has them for sale.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:18.112
You never know.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.490
[MAN B]
Very true.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.243
Have to come back another day.
Hopefully they'll be in stock.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:26.913
These pins're so popular
it's weird to not have one.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.831
Maybe next time.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.337
[YASHIRO]
Ugh, what's with you losers?

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.588
Huh?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.049
Must be confident if you boys
are having erasing sprees

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.592
in your free time.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.552
Instead of fighting against
the Noise, though,

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.264
I think you should be
fighting for a Noise!

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.348
[BEAT]
Rhyme!

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.849
[YASHIRO]
We have a bonus round mission,

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.353
and I expect you
both to play along.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.814
If we participate in your
little "bonus round,"

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.692
you'll return Rhyme
to us unharmed?

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.777
Happy to see you catch on quick.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:01.322
So what do you guys want us
to do? Spit it out already!

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.702
[BOTH]
So glad you asked, Freshmeat.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:13.960
[phone buzzing]

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:17.422
All right, let's go!
Bring it, assholes!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.589
[NEKU yells]

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.633
Jeez. Why'd you scream?

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.218
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.471
I was stoked 'cause our bonus
round mission came in.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.641
[KARIYA] Our mission
for you is to fight us.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.935
All we gotta do is beat
Pinky and Lollipop,

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.854
then Rhyme's as good as saved!

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.856
Wow, it's so straightforward.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.983
[BEAT]
Lollipop's one tough customer,

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.609
so be ready, aight?

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.321
Don't get cocky 'cause you
won two games in a row.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:45.533
The only reason he's a small fry
is 'cause he likes it that way.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.244
You're too nice. Who are you?
What've you done with Beat?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.662
[BEAT]
What the heck?

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.873
Look, man! Just be vegetant!

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:52.749
Sure.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.792
Nice! Then let's get goin'!

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.296
Wait! Where?
The text didn't specify.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.964
[BEAT]
It didn't have to.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.966
Every Reaper in the game
has a place they hang out

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.093
and watch Players.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.721
[NEKU]
And their turf is?

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.806
[BEAT]
Scramble Crossing!

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:12.977
[NEKU]
What now?

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.687
Where are they?

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.650
Huh?

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:22.779
You finally showed up.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.155
Good thing I stretched.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.532
Been ages since
I actually tried.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.410
Then let's make
this extra special!

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:41.381
[NEKU]
The people and cars.

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:44.300
Here we go!

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.301
[BEAT]
Bring it, yo!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.844
[BEAT laughs]

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.099
Shred this!

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.816
If you only focus on her,
you're gonna lose.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.571
[BEAT]
Quit hoggin', Phones!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.990
Ready or not, here I come!

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:16.833
[BEAT yells]

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.838
[KARIYA] Ah. That was almost
too close for comfort.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.757
I think you might've grown
in the last few days.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.559
Uzuki.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.354
Bye‐bye, Freshmeat.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.781
Seriously? You ruined
the best part!

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.910
Ugh! Stay still
so I can shoot you!

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.954
It's not that hard!

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.124
[gasps]

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.212
[NEKU, BEAT scream]

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.925
Unfriendly reminder:
Keep your guards up!

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:12.013
Damn. You good, Phones?

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.182
Yeah.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.518
They're strong,
but then, so are we.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.061
Right.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.903
Is that water?

00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:28.696
Refreshing, don'cha think?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:29.989
Yo, let's start it up!

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.575
No. Let's end it!

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.585
That attack wasn't
in the report!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.213
Maybe next time don't
take us for fools!

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.840
I'd hold my breath
if I were you!

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.561
Now give Rhyme back to me.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:06.651
[KARIYA] Bravo. Let's have
a big hand for the winners.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:07.944
We both surrender.

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:11.322
And what's more, here's
your prize, as promised.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:15.201
Uh! Hold on!

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.285
You're okay!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.954
[RHYME NOISE chirps]

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.416
She's gone!

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.460
Hey! What the hell?

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:25.962
Thought that would happen.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.881
'Course you did! You planned
this from the start!

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.466
[YASHIRO]
No! That wasn't a trick!

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.052
I swear, Miss Konishi
herself entrusted us

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.929
‐‐with your entry fee!
‐‐[KARIYA sighs]

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:38.349
I would say the ones who got
tricked here are Uzuki and me.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.602
She used us to buy time. We're
just disposable in her eyes.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.688
Are you for real?

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.274
Oh, well. That's
what minions are.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.276
[YASHIRO]
Not this minion!

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.611
I'm sick of always
being treated like this!

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.531
Being on the bottom rung
of this ladder sucks!

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.490
And another thing!

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.908
I know they were
going to promote you,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.285
but you turned them down!

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.162
Is it 'cause you felt bad
for me or something?

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:03.249
Being an officer is
a fate worse than death.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:08.254
I like the field. Shibuya's
really grown on me over time.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:13.092
You can feel the pulse out here.
People changing with the city.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.386
I like to view those changes
from the audience.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.472
Being a stargazer, if you will.

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.641
And besides,
if I were an officer,

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.143
how would I go
about suckering you

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.937
into buying me the best
cuisine in this ward?

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.481
Our mealtime means a lot to me.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.317
Like, whatever.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.068
Are you two done?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.946
Yeah. Start telling us where
Rhyme is right the hell now!

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.240
My guess? In the Iron
Maiden's grasp.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.325
Well, I'm sorry
we put you through

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.659
all that stress for nothing.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.329
Here, this should
make up for it.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.705
[BEAT gasps]

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.666
[BEAT]
A Reaper keypin?

00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:46.542
Have fun.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:50.129
You officially have access to
the same things as a bigwig.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.673
Good luck getting
your friends back.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.552
[BEAT]
Yo, Mister Kariya.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.430
"Mister"? Why'd
you get so formal?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.807
Ironface might have
it out for you!

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.851
The last Reaper who gave
us a keypin got earsed,

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.686
so don't wind up bein' next!

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.730
He has a point. Be careful.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.900
Heh. I appreciate
the advice, guys.

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:14.153
We'll be sure to keep our
eyes peeled. Right, Uzuki?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.071
[YASHIRO]
Hmph!

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.657
Not that we need
them to tell us.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.536
[KARIYA]
Welp, see ya later.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.247
[BEAT]
Tomorrow's the day

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.750
we give Ironface
her crust desserts!

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.543
[NEKU]
Just desserts.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:32.380
Dude! You ain't psyched‐up
enough! Get loud!

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:36.217
Really pull from deep down
in your gut! Like this!

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:40.596
We... will... win!

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.682
We'll win...

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.229
[YASHIRO]
Hey.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.524
Why'd you let them have
that keypin, Kariya?

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:55.444
Miss Konishi will slash more
than our salaries if she knows.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.533
Uzuki, don't you feel it?

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:01.659
Feel what?

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.121
How this ward is breaking.

00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:07.665
It's turning homogeneous.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.209
Now that you mention it,

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:14.839
Shibuya's usual cacophony of
thoughts has quieted way down.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.631
[KARIYA]
Yeah.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:18.551
The jumbled ideas of the
people are slowly but surely

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:22.054
focusing into a single
point in the city.

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:26.934
I just hope that point isn't a
period marking this as the end.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.853
[YASHIRO gasps]

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.187
What's wrong?

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.691
No clue. I just‐‐

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.236
Uzuki! Hey! What's hurting?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.779
[groans]

Konishi.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:56.505
[KONISHI] I see the O‐Pins' side
effects have begun to show.

00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:59.175
It appears more good men
will be killed in action.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:02.803
So then, was this
one of your forecasts?

00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:06.223
What's going on in
Mister Kitaniji's mind?

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:10.102
Why is the Composer choosing
to leave those on the loose?

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:12.480
I need more data.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:16.650
Every good strategy
demands hard facts.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:22.239
Shit! I won't!

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:27.870
[KARIYA screams]

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:50.059
[HANEKOMA] The fundamentals
of the design are no good.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:56.065
[HANEKOMA]
Looks like this is all I can do.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.484
We'll see what happens.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:05.407
[HANEKOMA]
God only knows what comes next.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:14.250

Wrongs of Our Day."
