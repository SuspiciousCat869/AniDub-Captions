WEBVTT

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.305
[KITANIJI]
Neku Sakuraba.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:17.518
Of course someone like
you would be his pick.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.650
What do you mean?

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.406
[KITANIJI] I owe you
no more explanations.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.875
[KITANIJI]
The void awaits!

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.420
[gasps]

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.094
[KITANIJI]
What's this?

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.347
Don't go forgettin' that
every Player has a partner!

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.102
[BEAT]
You hit all three of your heads?

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:04.189
'Cause you also forgot about
me bein' the next Composer!

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.867
Thought you were past this
fightin'‐on‐your‐own crap.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.453
We're both right here with you.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.292
[gasps]

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.587
[KITANIJI]
I'm running out of time.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.549
[BEAT]
Neku.

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.842
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.892
C'mon!

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:52.571
[KITANIJI]
Let the light save you!

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:53.655
Go, Mister Mew!

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.240
[NEKU]
Get 'em, Piggy!

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.505
This attack's got your
name written all over it!

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.300
[BEAT yells]

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:18.305
[KITANIJI]
I must not fail!

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.482
[roars]

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.364
Chew on this!

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.294
Let's sync our psychs
and end this!

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.712
[SHIKI, BEAT]
Right!

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.608
[yells]

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:22.703
[KITANIJI groaning]

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:27.999
[screams]

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:43.014
[KITANIJI] Am I so powerless
to defend Shibuya?

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.527
We really pulled it off.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.863
[NEKU]
No. Not yet.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.869
[NEKU]
We have to face the Composer.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.764
What an awesome place!

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.058
Graffiti central.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.352
[NEKU]
It's CAT's.

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.813
Really? Every single piece?

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.523
[NEKU]
That's right.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:03.530
[NEKU] Your art. All of
your pieces motivated me.

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:08.201
Each new design seemed to say,
"Enjoy your life more!"

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.411
And I did.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.998
Going to Udagawa to bask
in your work fulfilled me.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.416
Simple, right?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.544
Just standing there
looking, it was fun.

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:21.923
I thought I'd finally met
someone that I could respect.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.552
Man, I sure know
how to pick 'em.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.933
[NEKU]
But I won't falter anymore.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.064
Show yourself! Hanekoma!

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.817
[BEAT] Come out!
I'm sick a' hide 'n' seek!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.949
Hey, Neku. It's been a while.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.621
Joshua? Is it really you?

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:57.876
It is. Congrats on
a job well done.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.211
I thought for sure
you were dead.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.631
If you hadn't pushed me out
of the way of that attack,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.550
I wouldn't be here.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.218
Thank you.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.973
[JOSHUA]
I should be thanking you.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.100
With your help, I was
able to pull off a win.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:18.980
Yeah. 'Bout time. We actually
won the Reapers' game.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.231
[JOSHUA]
Not quite.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.608
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.196
[JOSHUA] While we were playing
a game, it wasn't the Reapers'.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.198
What?

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.075
[JOSHUA]
Kitaniji was our opponent.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.244
He and I were competing to
determine the fate of this ward,

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.872
along with you.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.751
For you see, Shibuya's
Composer is yours truly.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.846
[JOSHUA] Shibuya is plagued
with selfish desires,

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.723
thus I've decided to end it.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:57.227
End it? Sir, please reconsider!

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.188
[JOSHUA] I've actually given it
quite some thought already.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.524
Best to just wash our
hands of it at this point.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.150
[KITANIJI]
Now wait a moment!

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:04.985
You would erase something

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.654
that still holds so
many possibilities?

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.656
[JOSHUA] Since its denizens
have grown too dull

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:13.201
and clouded to see
that potential, yes.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.704
Shibuya exerts a
powerful influence.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.541
If I don't act soon, the ripples
could spread to other districts.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.210
I swear, Sir!
I'll reform Shibuya!

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.795
[JOSHUA]
How so?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:28.258
[KITANIJI] Uh. I'll find
a way if given time.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:32.137
So, please! Please allow me
a chance to save it!

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.556
[JOSHUA]
A game, then.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.682
[KITANIJI]
A game?

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.560
[JOSHUA]
Yes. You versus me.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.061
The rules will be simple.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:45.066
If you manage to fix this broken
ward, you win. Shibuya stays.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.943
[KITANIJI]
And if I fail?

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.737
[JOSHUA]
Then you lose, Kitaniji,

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.991
and both you and
Shibuya will be erased.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.744
You have one month,
starting now.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.081
Use your time however
you see fit. Good luck.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:08.590
For real? This kid,
he's the Composer?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.092
[JOSHUA] I found Kitaniji's
talk of a "reformed Shibuya"

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.053
a little intriguing.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:17.849
You bastard. That mouth's
just beggin' for a beating!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.726
[yells]

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.604
Huh?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.981
[BEAT grunts]

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:28.234
[BEAT]
Shit. I can't move.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.445
What'd you do to me?

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.700
[JOSHUA] Apologies, but may I
ask you to stay out of this?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.124
Shiki! Beat!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.959
What's happening?

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.463
Yo! My body ain't listenin'!

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.006
Let them go!

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.760
I know how precious your
friends are to you, so relax.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.260
They're fine.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.470
[BEAT]
The hell did you do?!

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.306
Fine, but very noisy.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.813
In order to give Megumi
a fair chance of winning,

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.190
I had to play with a handicap.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.317
It would've been over
before it began otherwise,

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.821
so I sealed most of my powers
and retreated to the Realground.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.949
Challenging him directly was
still out of the question.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.869
Which is why I sent a proxy
to the UG to represent me.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.746
No way.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.542
[JOSHUA]
Oh, yes. That proxy was you.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:29.504
[NEKU] Then everything
I've done, all of it...

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.967
Helped achieve my goal of
erasing Shibuya. Go team.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.469
[gasps]

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.014
[NEKU] But Pi‐Face killed me.
I saw him shoot!

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:43.017
Minamimoto has found
numerous ways to interfere.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.062
Nearly spoiled the climax, too.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.231
Served him the same
dose of humility today

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.275
as I did when I
went to fetch you.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.526
So then...

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.069
[JOSHUA chuckles]

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.029
Winners deserve to be rewarded.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.698
How 'bout I give you
your missing memories

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.659
I've been holding on
to as your prize?

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.619
Work for you?

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:09.544
[screams]

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.923
[gunshot]

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:23.808
[chuckles]

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.268
[gunshot]

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.730
[chuckles]

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.400
[gasps]

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.580
[MINAMIMOTO]
I blew it.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.637
[gunshot]

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:22.367
[NEKU] It was you!
I'm dead because of you!

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.077
That you are.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:27.038
You lied! And I've
been blaming myself.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.083
But you, you never
deserved my trust!

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:32.794
Both Pi‐Face and I
were just your pawns!

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.714
He's been after my seat for some
time, so he had it coming.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.675
He followed me to the RG,

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.843
believing he could
terminate me there.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:44.347
You'd think a math whiz
would have calculated better.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.434
I'm not like Reapers.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.603
They lose their powers
when they go to the RG,

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:54.732
but as the Composer,
I retain some of mine.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.651
After Minamimoto
botched his shot,

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.195
he fled back to the UG
and turned himself Taboo

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.073
in attempt to bridge
the power gap.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.745
[JOSHUA]
Mister H will be punished

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.080
for helping him succeed.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.457
Should've left it alone.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:15.086
Heh. Speaking of, I take
it you like this room?

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.255
Who cares what I like?!

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.174
It's the perfect
setting for a game.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.634
The winner gets to
be the Composer

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:26.097
and Shibuya is his to
do with as he pleases.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.932
If you win our duel, well,

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.810
you can create a
place of your dreams.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.895
Reviving your
friends'll be easy.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.398
Not a bad trade, right?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.443
I'm going to count down from
ten and on zero, we shoot.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:42.071
That's all there is
to it. Very basic.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.660
No more games.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:50.038
Then don't think
of it as a game.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.998
Instead, consider it a fork.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.376
The roads of life are
chock‐full of 'em.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.421
Ten.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.257
Nine.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.760
Eight.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:05.553
Seven.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.224
[JOSHUA]
Six.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.185
[NEKU]
I'm gonna...

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.062
Five.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.898
Four.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.942
[HANEKOMA]
Trust your partner.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.028
[JOSHUA]
Three.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.155
[NEKU]
I‐I survived for this long

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.116
because I put my
faith in everyone.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.868
[JOSHUA]
Two.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.790
[JOSHUA]
One.

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.838
[NEKU]
I trust you, Joshua.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.051
[gunshot]

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:10.368
[gasps]

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.255
[NEKU]
Why? What the hell?

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.174
Am I really back in Shibuya?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.219
[MAN A]
Oh, excuse me.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:32.807
[NEKU]
Wha‐‐?

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:42.358
It's still here. But how?
It should be gone.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.823
[NEKU]
Did I come back to life?

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:51.701
[gasps]

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:03.129
[BEAT]
Yo!

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.131
[RHYME]
Over here!

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.802
[NEKU]
Beat! Rhyme!

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.762
Sure took your sweet time.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.265
Was startin' to think you
forgot about our meet‐up.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.977
He was too cute,
counting the seconds.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.062
[BEAT]
I was not!

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.648
Nice to see you both
alive and kickin'!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.651
Ditto. No clue how that
worked out, though.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.653
It must've been because
you, Neku, and Shiki

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.364
went above and beyond
for the games!

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.700
[NEKU]
Where is Shiki?

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.202
[RHYME chuckles]

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.788
Huh?

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.628
[chuckles]

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:50.551
I'm Neku Sakuraba. Call me Neku.

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:54.263
[SHIKI] I'm Shiki Misaki.
Please call me Shiki.

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.974
Shiki.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:01.562
[SHIKI] Thanks for keeping
your promise, Neku.

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.819
[HANEKOMA] And just like that,
everything's back to normal.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.404
You know, this enitre mess

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:13.783
is gonna have
repercussions upstairs.

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.618
Kitaniji still had
Reaper status,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.119
yet you let him run the show,

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.705
which was
unprecedented till now.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.290
And while it's great
you suppressed

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.667
your powers in the RG,

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:26.837
it's not so great you wound up
using them to aid Neku.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.132
You're just full of
surprises lately.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.593
Do you not think it was
that big of a risk?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.720
You already had one crazed
Reaper that figured out

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:38.349
who you were and tailed you
across every side of Shibuya.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.934
No Reaper can kill me.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:43.312
They may try, but they
won't ever succeed.

00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.189
Although I will give
Minamimoto points

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.483
for discovering
my true identity.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.653
Not even my Conductor knew that.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:54.198
Wonder if a coffee‐loving
birdy told him.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.329
[HANEKOMA]
And what makes you say that?

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:04.000
[JOSHUA] Because you also
wanted to preserve Shibuya.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.751
Nice design, by the way.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.837
What? Whoa.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:11.048
[JOSHUA] Megumi asked you to
make those for him, right?

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.758
[HANEKOMA]
Yeah.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.344
So I complied with the
acting Composer's request.

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:18.556
One hundred percent
in the rulebook.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.474
And under the guise
of a trendy new fad,

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.644
Kitaniji imprinted
his will on folks.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.480
[JOSHUA]
It's a decent idea in theory,

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.649
but unless you were actually
wearing a Red Skull pin,

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.568
he couldn't imprint on you.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.486
[HANEKOMA] That's why he used
a game mission as a cover

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.697
to distribute them,
though I guess that was

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.450
an abuse of his power.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.785
At least it got him results.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.705
[BEAT]
Get this.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.665
People have been gushin'
about some new graffiti

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.917
over in the Udagawa district.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.295
They're saying it
appeared overnight.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.172
[SHIKI]
Yeah, I heard about it, too.

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.423
[NEKU]
CAT strikes again.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.634
[BEAT chuckles]

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.636
Didn't know your
smile got that big!

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.596
I'm not even smiling, man.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.848
[HANEKOMA]
Art isn't just a pastime.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.101
There's a reason my
stuff's all over Shibuya.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.813
Unlike the pins, my work
is accessible to anyone.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.232
And I'm then able to imprint
on every single person

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.652
that comes into contact with it.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.946
There's a secret code‐‐

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.533
a little command I've
infused in all my graffiti.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.162
[JOSHUA] "Enjoy every moment
with all you've got," right?

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.997
[HANEKOMA]
I'm astonished you knew.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.209
[JOSHUA] Neku was positively
thrilled to explain it to me.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.879
[HANEKOMA] He is the one I've
had the most influence on.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.173
I thought that you were
dead‐set on erasing Shibuya,

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.759
so what happened?

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.136
[JOSHUA]
Neku happened.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.097
A boy who lived his life alone,

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.057
shutting his ears
and refusing to listen

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.267
to a word anybody else said,

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:48.854
dropped his gun and
extended his hand in trust.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:52.233
[JOSHUA] His change of
heart inspired mine.

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.818
[HANEKOMA] It's pretty amazing
what three straight weeks

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.446
of Reapers' games
can do to a guy, huh?

00:19:57.488 --> 00:20:00.116
Nothing short of a miracle.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.122
I've been thinkin'.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.707
So, like, how were
we able to pull off

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.459
that killer move against Shades?

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:13.045
I know. It was CAT.

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:16.132
He was like our own
guardian angel.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:18.676
Remember that pin he left us?

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.387
[BEAT] Guess it was good for
a lot more than openin' walls.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.055
[JOSHUA]
That in the rulebook, too?

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:24.598
[HANEKOMA]
You hypocrite.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.100
I seem to recall
a certain someone

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.560
dropping a certain pin on him

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.020
that nullified
Kitaniji's brainwashing.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.398
So I'd say we're even.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.191
[JOSHUA]
I'm willing to let it slide,

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.318
but only if you divulge
why you chose to tamper

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.572
with Minamimoto's
Refinery sigil.

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.949
[HANEKOMA] I had high hopes
for that mathematical madman's

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.076
attachment to Shibuya.

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:46.078
I guess you could
consider him my "Plan B"

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.749
or wild card in the event
that Kitaniji lost.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:51.959
[JOSHUA]
You wanted him to defeat me

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:56.255
and become the new Composer
so Shibuya would be spared?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:59.091
And I'm fully prepared
to fall from grace.

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.426
[JOSHUA]
As you should be.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:03.512
Though, as traitorous
as that was,

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:07.057
your words are what spurred
Neku's metamorphosis.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.479
[JOSHUA] But I suppose a few
other things contributed

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.439
to his drastic change.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:18.068
My month‐long Game with Megumi.
You turning Minamimoto Taboo.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.112
And of course, the touching
encounters he had

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:21.655
with his fellow Players.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.824
I'm starving! I've been looking
forward to lunch all day!

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.452
[JOSHUA] Perhaps that means
everything was necessary.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.995
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:28.704
Hello, Shibuya!

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:30.206
[HANEKOMA]
Perhaps.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:35.419
[777] If you're ready to rock,
lemme hear you scream!

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:36.337
[HANEKOMA]
I will admit one thing

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.922
those kids definitely proved

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:41.383
is that nothing in this
world is pointless.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.225
[JOSHUA] So basically,
"enjoy every moment."

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.605
Aww. Do I detect
the sound of loneliness?

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:01.070
Same old same.
Always puttin' up a front.

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.953
[HANEKOMA] It's a
wonderful world, huh? Heh.
