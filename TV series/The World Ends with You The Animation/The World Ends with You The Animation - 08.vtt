WEBVTT

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.224
[NEKU]
This is it. My last game.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:20.687
Shiki... Joshua...
I'll win this for you.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:25.317
It's just seven more days.
And I'm gonna survive 'em!

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.610
[phone buzzes]

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.779
Right! Here we go.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.408
[KONISHI]
Game one: Reach 104.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.163
You have 60 minutes.
The cost of failure is erasure.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:12.215
[YASHIRO]
Is it me,

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.886
or have the games been
uber weird lately?

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.596
Weird, but still legal.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:18.764
They're finding every loophole

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.515
and then threading
them perfectly.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.810
Consider the area we're in
dark grey, not quite black.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.271
[YASHIRO sighs]

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.608
[KARIYA] Welp, either way you
slice it, a job's still a job.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.695
If you ask me, this game is
more of a joke than a job.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.740
I mean, they've only got one
Player in the running this week.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:39.534
And the GM's none other
than Miss Konishi.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:43.205
I wanna show off for her,
but I don't know how!

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.041
The Iron Maiden, huh?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:57.844
[NEKU] Damn it! I can't
go anywhere like this.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.222
I need to hurry up
and find a partner.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.766
[phone buzzes]

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.938
[NEKU] "PS. This game
only has one Player"?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:13.485
No way! I'm the only one?
That means I can't make a pact!

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.028
[NEKU]
What now?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.240
I could try running for
the next seven days,

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.243
but the second I get a
mission to slay some Noise,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.829
I'm guaranteed to fail.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:26.498
[growls]

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.959
[YASHIRO]
Found you!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.460
[NEKU]
Reapers!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.508
Nothing personal, kid.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.844
Just doing what we're
told, that's all.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.805
I'll even give you a countdown
for your touching finale.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:43.640
Ready?

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:50.480
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six!

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:54.401
Screw it! This is
taking too long! Zero!

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.446
Oh, man!

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.783
[YASHIRO]
Toodles, you little twerp!

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:08.248
[NEKU] No! This can't be
how it ends! I won't let it!

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.332
[YASHIRO]
I'm holding back.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.878
Mister two‐week champ.
At last, put up more of a fight.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.630
[NEKU]
I'm not gonna lose!

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.678
Sorry, but you are.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.848
[BEAT]
Yo, yo, yo, yo! Not so fast!

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.270
[NEKU]
Beat?

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.982
[BEAT] You guys are
playin' way too dirty!

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.108
Ugh! Not you!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.944
Oh, to be young
and foolish again.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.404
First you jerks tell
me to go take down

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.282
my bro like Phones
"just 'cause!"

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.035
And now you guys
are havin' a game

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.662
where the one Player
can't even hope to win?

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.877
That's messed up!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.052
[BEAT] Maybe the Composer's
down with that,

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.763
but I ain't the type to
let shady stuff slide!

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:08.141
So, hope you're hungry
for some pavement, yo!

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.602
Does that mean that you're
resigning from the Reapers?

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.436
[BEAT]
Damn right!

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.105
You sure? Skulls,
switch on your brain.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.526
You're leaving us for
a team bound to lose.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.611
That's treading on
some pretty thin ice.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.864
[BEAT] It ain't cold
enough for ice, stupid!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.199
Whaddaya say, Phones?

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.575
Huh?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.912
Let's make a pact so you
can stand a chance.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.331
Us against all them.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.749
Okay!

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.634
Well, we gotta bounce for now.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.010
Right!

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:44.970
Get back here!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.557
[KARIYA]
Whoa, Uzuki! Stop!

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.267
Reporting to the
brass comes first.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.353
You don't wanna look
unprofessional, right?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:57.357
After all, the real party
hasn't even started yet.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.905
[NEKU]
Mission cleared.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.200
Thanks a lot.
You saved the day.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:11.788
Wait, did you just smile
and thank me for helping you?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.250
I was kind of a jerk before,
so why'd you join me?

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:17.168
[BEAT] 'Cause you were
hung out to dry, man!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.629
Anyone could see those Reapers
were doin' you wrong.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.423
It hurt to watch.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.427
Oh, and... I owed you.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.762
Pretty cool of you
to give me this.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.764
[NEKU]
Rhyme's pendant?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:35.061
You know, all I did was pick
it up and return it to you.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.023
I really hope that's not the
only reason you helped me.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:42.235
Don't they, like, erase Reapers
for partnering with Players?

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.906
Ah! Dude, quit complainin'!

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:49.993
Our partner pact worked, so who
cares about the details, yo?

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:50.827
Uh‐oh.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.620
[BEAT]
What?

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.455
You don't have your
wings anymore.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.331
[BEAT]
Hm?

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.999
Oh, I guess I don't.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.834
Is that a problem?

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:58.835
Nah.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.631
That Reaper crap was lame.
I was gettin' sick of it anyway.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.676
This is more my speed,
so they can keep their wings!

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:10.096
But forget me, man,
why're you in the Game again?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.641
What happened to that
prissy kid you were with?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.978
[NEKU]
His name... was Joshua.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.523
[BEAT]
That majorly sucks, man.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.735
I can't believe they gave
you such a shitty penalty.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.320
[NEKU]
Yeah.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.322
[BEAT] I mean, sure,
you were his partner,

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.823
but lettin' a livin'
Player in the game

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.576
was the Reapers'
screw‐up, right?

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.329
That Shades.
He's such a snake!

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.289
[NEKU] They've still got
Shiki as my entry fee

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.083
for the last game.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.253
Then we've got no choice
but to win this!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.380
Right.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.382
C'mon! Follow me, Phones!

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.134
Beat! Wait! Where to?

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.137
Someplace I've been meanin'
to check out for a while now.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.347
Let's book it!

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.557
[NEKU]
Hey! What's the rush?

00:07:56.768 --> 00:08:00.939
I'll take down this wall down
like, "Shika‐pow! Ba‐ba‐bam!"

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.316
Do you even understand
yourself when you talk?

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.194
Heh. Yeah, I used to trip
Rhyme up a lot, too.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.446
[NEKU]
That Noise.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.907
Cute, right? She's made
up of Rhyme's soul.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:11.992
[NEKU]
Huh?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.660
[BEAT]
Hanekoma picked up the pieces

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.246
and turned her into
a Noise to save her.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.458
[BEAT] I thought I could bring
her back by becomin' a Reaper,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.127
but you know how that went.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.379
And turns out only the
Composer has the power

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.048
to do that stuff, anyway.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.885
Keep this under your headset.
The next Composer's gonna be me.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.304
Can a human even do that?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.516
[BEAT] Yeah. Mister Hanekoma
broke it down for me.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.184
Said whoever takes down
the one in charge

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.395
gets to call the shots after.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:44.566
[NEKU] Wow. Is there anything
that guy doesn't know?

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.859
So no worries!

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.235
Bringin' dead people
back to life

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.821
is just one of the
Composer's specialties.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.031
Soon as I get the job,

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.659
I'll save you 'n' Shiki, and
anyone else who wants to live!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:59.205
[NEKU] I actually have an idea
of where the Composer might be.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.833
[BEAT]
So do I.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.420
[NEKU, BEAT]
The Shibuya River.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.174
Heads up!

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.595
[yells]

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.227
You're openin', like it or not!

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.398
[BEAT]
Aw, yeah!

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:29.277
[NEKU]
Jeez! What are you, part rhino?

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.531
[BEAT]
I just used a Reaper keypin.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.576
[NEKU] Well, this'll
definitely come in handy.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.495
Thing is, it only opens up walls

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.581
that are in the area I ran
when I was a Reaper.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.291
If you get on Ironface's level,

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.211
you get keys to
everywhere in Shibuya.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.004
Ironface?

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.881
[BEAT]
She's this week's Game Master.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.633
Name's Konishi.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.929
I've been informed that another
rebellion has taken place.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.181
It's one of our newer recruits.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.102
[KONISHI]
Him. Daisukenojo Bito.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.269
You gave him special orders,

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.272
though he's only been
with us for eight days.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.857
With your permission, sir,

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.485
I would like to address
this issue personally.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:14.364
No. Treat him as a
Player from now on.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:18.284
Shouldn't that be my decision?
I am the Game Master.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:24.666
[KITANIJI] Konishi talking back.
Will wonders never cease?

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.209
I have a plan to erase

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.504
both Daisukenojo Bito
and Neku Sakuraba,

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.757
but it requires Reapers to
equip their Outlet Pins.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.676
Conductor. You're sure?

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:38.638
[KITANIJI] Unless you wanna see
more good men killed in action.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.142
The clock is ticking.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.185
I'm officially putting
the Shibuya Underground

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.563
on Emergency Call.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.941
[gasps] Is that necessary?

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.693
[KITANIJI] I trust you'll
make the arrangements

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:54.028
like the pro you are.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.950
Yes. Of course. Right away, sir.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.368
[KONISHI]
Something's wrong.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.288
Why such alarm over
two mere Players?

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.169
[KONISHI] I'll act once
I acquire more data

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.088
and can better
assess the situation.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.466
Every good plan starts
with hard facts.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.972
[YASHIRO] Three weeks of
fun‐filled Reapers' games

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.557
in a row.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.560
[sighs] I'm just so burnt‐out.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.854
[KONISHI] If you request leave,
I'll be sure to approve it.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.773
Uh! I didn't see you there!

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.942
Please don't get the wrong
idea about what I said!

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.652
What Uzuki was getting
at is she's looking

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.945
for more of a challenge.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.448
[YASHIRO]
Yes! Exactly!

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.658
Then I have a
special assignment.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.118
[YASHIRO]
We'd be honored!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.286
[KONISHI]
I've seen your work.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.622
It's evident you're quite
the capable Reaper.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:49.459
If you can get results, your
promotion is assured, Yashiro.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.587
Hear that?
She thinks I'm capable!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.005
Woot‐woot. Go, girl.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.007
[KONISHI]
As for you, Mister Kariya.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.967
With your strength
and years of loyalty,

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.677
you should already be
an officer candidate, yet‐‐

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.888
[KARIYA]
Anywho.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.683
What I'm more curious about
is your current strategy.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.270
[KONISHI] I'm going
to hide. Simple, right?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.565
But it'll be in a place from
which I can attack at will.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:21.241
Y'know, Beat, Josh was
hunting the Composer, too.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.701
And his search eventually
led us to the river,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.787
but a barrier kept us out.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.831
Yeah, I know. You're lucky
you two backed off.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.250
Woulda been a Taboo Noise snack

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.252
if you tried to
force your way in.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.254
That how that works?

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.463
[RHYME NOISE grunts]

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:35.880
What's up?

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:39.384
[RHYME NOISE growling]

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.428
How do you do?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.764
It's Ironface.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.100
Actually, my name's
Mitsuki Konishi.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:49.686
Game Master to you,
Daisukenojo B‐‐

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:55.191
That's... "Beat"... to... you!

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.905
You received specific orders,
but alas, you ignored them

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.533
in favor of guarding
Neku Sakuraba from Noise

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.952
under the guise of combat.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.370
[BEAT chuckles]

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.705
You saw through that?

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:09.789
Even I saw through that.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.791
[BEAT yells]

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:14.252
Though you're deserving
of instant erasure,

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.796
you're locked in a pact
with Mister Sakuraba.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.425
Thus, you'll be treated as a
Player instead of a traitor.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:24.470
[BEAT] Heh. You here to swipe
my entry fee or somethin'?

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.098
[KONISHI] Precisely. And the
thing you care for most is‐‐

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.309
[BEAT]
None of your business, lady!

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.689
[BEAT yells]

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.442
[NEKU]
Beat!

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.375
[BEAT]
Let her go.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.502
[BEAT grunts]

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.547
I think this little Noise will
suffice as your new payment.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.593
If you want her returned,
I suggest you do as you're told.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.396
[BEAT]
Give her back.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.359
She's already suffered
enough as it is!

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.658
[gasps]

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.661
Rhyme!

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.294
I will now assign the mission
for all of this week's Players.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.506
I'm going to hide somewhere and
you are to find and defeat me.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.841
I'll throw down with you
right now, Ironface!

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.301
Easy!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:48.096
You have six days to
complete this task.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.097
[gasps] Six?

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.015
[KONISHI] I shall remain
in the same place.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:53.142
I won't move from
that spot all week.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.769
If you don't wish to be erased,

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:57.021
you should find me as
soon as you possibly can.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:15:00.400
Hopefully, you boys won't
perish before you do.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.695
Attention, Shibuya Reapers.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.866
This is your current
Game Master speaking,

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.662
and I'm initiating
an Emergency Call.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.122
Should you encounter the rebel,

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.833
show no mercy and
erase him on sight.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.334
The same goes for his partner.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.962
Do not take either
of them lightly.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.380
Should you encounter the rebel,

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.799
show no mercy and
erase him on sight.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.342
The same goes for his partner.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.137
Do not take either
of them lightly.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:30.763
[NEKU]
Not good.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.265
Let's move.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:40.273
An Emergency Call for two
plucky kids is one thing,

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.900
but they want us to
equip O‐Pins, too?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.112
They're secret weapons that give
us Reapers a gigantic boost.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.947
What's not to like?

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.283
[KARIYA] Having unchained
power is great and all,

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:53.411
but ever wonder why the chains
have stayed on till now?

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.330
Because of how much
strain it puts on the users.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:15:59.292
[YASHIRO]
Hm...

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.671
They look like the pins that are
taking the town by storm lately.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.299
Hang on. It is the same pin.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.426
The Composer dig
the style, or what?

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.678
Can't believe they're really
breakin' these puppies out.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.054
What is it that's got
the higher‐ups

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.182
this level of spooked?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.444
Oh, shit!

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:32.575
This bites! Ironface ain't gonna
make it that easy, is she?

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:34.702
[NEKU]
Nope.

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.162
[BEAT]
Good one, man!

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:40.708
[NEKU]
We need to find her, stat.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.169
We can't hold out forever.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.587
[NEKU gasps]

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:47.048
Aha! Thought I smelled a rat!

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.800
[BEAT] Psh, I don't smell
anything like a rat!

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:53.554
Don't fight like one either.
We go, then you lose.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:54.847
Big talk!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:55.765
But with this O‐Pin,

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.476
the only place you're axing
me is in your dreams!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.436
Now, sic 'em!

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:16.994
[NEKU]
Look out!

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.749
[growls]

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:22.625
Damn it.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:26.087
You clowns and your mutts are
wastin' time that we don't have!

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:27.547
Don't get sloppy on me.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:28.756
[NEKU]
Ditto!

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.927
[yells]

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:42.562
[NEKU yells]

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.651
Come back when you grow a pair!

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.195
Yeah. Or maybe never.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.910
We're comin' for you, yo!

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:05.251
My gut's tellin' me she's
hidin' in there, bud.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.169
Where? O‐East?

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:13.718
[BEAT] This place kinda brings
back memories, doesn't it?

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:16.929
[BEAT]
S'barely been two weeks,

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:20.391
but it somehow feels like
a lot more than that.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.811
[NEKU]
Yeah. Better times, huh?

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:26.772
[777]
What're you guys doing here?

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.899
[BEAT, NEKU]
Hm?

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.526
[NEKU]
Oh, hey.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.780
[NEKU] Did you ever find
your missing mic?

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.407
[777]
Nah.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.410
Well, here's hoping it turns up.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:45.249
[777] At least we had a stroke
of luck with our ticket sales.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.626
That's awesome!

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:47.793
Right?

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.504
Well then, looks like you should
be preppin' for your show.

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:54.258
Stop wastin' our time
'n' quit wastin' yours.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.385
Sorry, we're looking
for Konishi.

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:59.472
Oh, are you?
Haven't seen her.

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.224
Looks like my hunch
wasn't so good after all.

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.060
Guess we're done here.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.272
There's an Emergency
Call on, y'know.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.858
And we would crush you, y'know.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.443
If I wasn't so fond
of the double life

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.780
I lead in the RG and UG,
I would've turned a blind eye.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.989
And though I don't
know what you did

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.074
to put a price on your heads,

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.118
I intend to collect if it keeps
the peace in the Underground.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.496
We ain't the bad guys here!

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:27.166
[777]
You are to me, Daisukenojo Bito!

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.834
Wait. Who?

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:32.630
[BEAT] Argh! Don't you dare
call me that, you porcupine!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.340
Is that your real name?

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.259
[BEAT] I know it's lame, man!
So don't rub it in!

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:38.844
Just call me Beat
and be done with it!

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:41.097
[NEKU]
S‐Sure.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:44.308
Let's rock! Daisukenojo Bito!

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.359
Yo! The beat is on!

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.902
Let's bring it!

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.463
[BEAT] There's more
where that came from.

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.090
Get wrecked!

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.852
And there ya have it!

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:33.816
Not half bad.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.818
'Least you admit it!
But know what?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.237
Instead of "not half bad,"
just call me "Mister Beat."

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.238
Does it matter?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.324
That cost us some time, yo.
Let's try 'n' make up for it.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.745
[777]
Wait. You aren't gonna end me?

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.496
You've got a sold‐out concert.

00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:49.039
What would your fans
and bandmates do

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.875
if you weren't there?

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.963
That would, um... suck. Yeah.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.343
Here, take this.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.553
[NEKU]
A keypin?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.597
[777]
My personal keypin.

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.265
Beat can open a few
walls with his,

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:09.727
but mine'll give you
access to much more.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.188
‐‐Dude!
‐‐Are you sure?

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:15.357
Being indebted to
people is so not metal.

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.235
[BEAT] If you insist.
'Preciate ya, Porcupine!

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.947
[777] I'll be in trouble if
this gets out, so get movin'.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:26.994
What good's a sold‐out concert?

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.456
None of my bandmates are
around to perform it with me.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.549
I noticed you held back.

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.968
Miss Konishi!
Where'd you come from?

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.013
You were ordered to equip your
Outlet Pin, were you not?

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:49.767
Yet you fought that
entire battle without it.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.977
I tried to play fair.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.065
Besides, there's no
time to for this crap!

00:21:56.106 --> 00:22:00.402
Reapers, my friends, are getting
slaughtered by Taboo Noise!

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.280
Shouldn't that take priority
over a couple teenagers?

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.075
What are you
and Kitaniji thinking?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.287
Well, if you can't
obey orders...

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.039
[gasps]

00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:15.042
[777 screams]

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:19.672
[KONISHI laughing]

00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:53.724
[NEKU]
Next time: "Rhyme and Beat."
