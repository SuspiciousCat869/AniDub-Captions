Uh, why is Shizuku
on fire? Is she okay?

Yeah, the Nine

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center

Shizuku into beast mode.

by herself to watch it.

We don't want you or any other

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center

already made it very clear

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
that they don't want me.

Seriously, how stupid
can those guys be?

have made some kinda difference.

that's already
unprecedented as it is.

as more than enough proof

[THIRD HIGH GIRL 06B]
That's a ridiculous match-up.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
You'd think the
tournament committee

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
had something against us,
you know?

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
Makes you wish First High

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
had withdrawn after their
bus got into that accident.

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center

That's enough, you two!

even if you were only
saying it as a joke.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
As magicians, we need
to be role models.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
That means elevating
your standards.

[THIRD HIGH GIRL 06B grunts]

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
Right. Sorry...

Your opponents are
formidable, yes,

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
but I know you have
it in you, Ms. Mizuo.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
I wish you luck.

[HONOKA] Ms. Watanabe is going
head to head with Seventh High!

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
Just like she did
in last year's final.

[MAYUMI]
They said with a day of rest,

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
you'll be able to resume
your normal routine, but...

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
No more strenuous activity for
at least a week... Sorry.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.263 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Come on, none of that.

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
We're grateful neither you
nor the Seventh High student

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
were seriously hurt.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
But for right now,
we have to contend with the fact

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
that we're no longer a shoo-in

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
for the official
Mirage Bat Event.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
You're right.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
For the time being, that match
is still ours to lose.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
But we're probably going to
have to change our strategy.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Thank goodness Ms. Watanabe

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
wasn't seriously injured!

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center

Gotta go!

[MIYUKI]
Oh.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I think she's worried
about the Rookie Event.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Right.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
And considering she's in
the Battle Board event, too,

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
I can't blame
her for being anxious.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
[JUMONJI] Speaking of which,
regarding Watanabe's accident,

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
we have Shiba
looking into it, right?

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
Under normal circumstances,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
Mari shouldn't have had
any trouble riding out

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
an accident of that nature.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
So something must've happened.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
Interference?

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Most likely.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
When it happened,

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
it felt as if a spell had been
cast on the water's surface.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
[JUMONJI]
It appears our upcoming matches

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
aren't the only thing
we have to worry about...

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Ms. Chiyoda won the official

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
Women's Ice Pillars Break,
so there's some good news.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
We are now half way
into the Competition,

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
meaning they'll be kicking
off the Rookie events

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
starting tomorrow.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
As of today these are the
most up-to-date scores.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Third High has been
making greater gains

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
than we'd thought,
so our lead is razor-thin.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
We don't have much left.
As far as Official events,

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
there's the
Women's Mirage Bat

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
and the Men's
Monolith Code, right?

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
[SUZUNE]
That's correct.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
So depending on how well we
perform in the Rookie Events,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
there's a real possibility
we could be overtaken.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
This is my fault. I was pathetic
and we're paying for it.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
[SUZUNE] The accident was not
your fault, Ms. Watanabe.

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
Though to be frank,
it would be better for everyone

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
if you'd stay in bed,
so you could recover.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Please don't treat me
like an invalid...

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what now?

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
I assume we're going to need a
comeback strategy, considering

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
I had to withdraw from
Mirage Bat, so what's the plan?

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
We focus on the
Official Events.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
It goes without saying that
this plan could come at the

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
expense of the Rookie matches...

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
But it's our best
shot at the moment.

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
And to that end,
for the Mirage Bat Event

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
we'd like you to
take Mari's place, Miyuki,

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
and compete in
the official match.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center

I guess it's hard to feel proud

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
considering how
that match went down.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I don't
really feel like I earned it.

have underestimated her.

Airi, I'm counting on you
to win against that girl,

no matter what.

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
Okay? And I'm not
just saying that

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
because she's
