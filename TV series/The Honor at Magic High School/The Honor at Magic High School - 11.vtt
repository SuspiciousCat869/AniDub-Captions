[KAZUMI]
Morisaki!

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] What? What was that?
What is going on?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
Battering Ram--that's
a Rank A Lethal Spell.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
And it was cast early.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
They shouldn't be using
that in the first place!

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.406 position:50% align:center
They better not be allowed
to get away with that!

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
What happened? Oh, no...

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother!

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] First High were the
victims of another accident?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
They certainly are
disaster-prone, huh?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
Whattaya say? Do ya think
an exorcism is in order?

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] If everything
is according to plan,

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
First High will now
have no choice

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
but to forfeit the
Monolith Code event.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
[NO-HEAD DRAGON EXEC A] Let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
The fact of the matter is,
in spite of our machinations,

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
First High is still
the frontrunner.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
[HUANG] I don't need
to tell you how important

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
the Nine Schools Competition is.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
The amount of global
interest this event garners

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
cannot be overstated.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.738 position:50% align:center
Need proof?

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
Just look at the considerable
prize pool that we've amassed.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] As it stands, if First
High wins the competition,

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.163 position:50% align:center
our losses will exceed
100 million dollars.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
[NO-HEAD DRAGON EXEC A]
If that happens,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.832 position:50% align:center
it will no doubt mark the end

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.752 position:50% align:center
for No-Head Dragon's
Eastern Branch in Japan.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
Not one of us here
will die an easy death.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
[HUANG] You understand now
why we have to stop

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.386 position:50% align:center
First High School from
winning at all costs.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Um, so...

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Honoka. Satomi.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
--Uh. Yes?
--Yeah?

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
Just because it's
the final match

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean anything has to
change as far you're concerned.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
Just keep doing
what you're doing,

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
pace yourselves,
and you'll be fine.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
--Right!
--Sure!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
He's amazing.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
My brother is acting
like his usual self

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
so they won't get any more
nervous than they are.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
There's still so much
I can learn from him.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
My brother is absolutely right.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
Mirage Bat is a test of stamina.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
Anything else?

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
One thing, think about
how you can maximize

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
your natural
abilities out there.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
That's it. Now go get First
High that one-two finish.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA, SUBARU]
Right!

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A] Welcome to the
Mirage Bat Rookie Event final!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
Competitors, on your marks!

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Very nicely done, Honoka.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
The next one goes to me!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Honoka and Subaru
are in fine form.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
You can tell that they've
got their eye on the ball.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
Literally!

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
And since Tatsuya
adjusted their CADS,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
they're both processing
their magic sequences

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
so fast it's crazy!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Which means that either one of
them has a chance to win it all!

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
"Maximize your
natural abilities."

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya said that before.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
And the more I think about it,

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
the more I realize how
much he's helped us--

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
each of us in our own way.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Honoka's come a long
way and so have I.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
I mean, if it weren't for
all of Tatsuya's great ideas,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
I don't think I would've
gotten this far!

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
Same here. I guess we
owe a lot to Tatsuya.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
[ALL giggle]

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
You know what I think?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
You should all share
that with my brother

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
the next time you see him.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A]
And that's the match!

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
The winner is Honoka Mitsui
of First High School!

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
And the runner-up
is Subaru Satomi,

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
also of First High School!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
We did it!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU]
Congratulations, Honoka!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
It looks like Tatsuya's
prediction came true!

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:24.032 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Tatsuya! We did it!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
What?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
Since when is Tatsuya
competing in Monolith Code?

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
Well, after the accident,

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
we thought we'd be withdrawing
from Monolith Code completely.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
Apparently, Mayumi
had other plans.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
Seems she's intent on winning
the Rookie Event, regardless.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. So she's sending
Tatsuya in as a substitute?

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] This isn't to
downplay your talent.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
I know that you'll be
more than capable

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
of holding your own as a player.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
But, Brother, why does
it have to be you?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
I argued the same
point with them.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
I'm an engineer--why pick me?

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
There are plenty of students
available to choose from.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
And we can agree Morisaki
wouldn't want me there, right?

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
But...

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
You're in. Clear?

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
Shiba, you're as much a member
of this team as anyone else.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
And our leader, President
Saegusa, is counting on you.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
Do think it's a good look?

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Second-guessing our leader
after she's made a decision?

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
We don't have time
for excuses or losses.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
So get out there and
do your job, got it?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] They were clear
about how they felt,

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
so I didn't press the issue
any more with them.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
If it were just a matter of you
competing in Monolith Code,

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
there'd be nothing
for me to worry about,

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
but it's not.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
You're worried we'll see another
act of sabotage, aren't you?

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
I have to know!
Who on earth is behind it?

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me!
Surely you know something!

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
They're a crime syndicate
based out of Hong Kong:

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
No-Head Dragon.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
As far as I've been
able to uncover,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
they're the ones
behind everything.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
Was it just an accident?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
Or could something else
have caused that cave-in?

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
You're saying it
wasn't an accident,

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
but an act of sabotage.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
I... wouldn't go that far.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
But still, it's just too
crazy to be a coincidence.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] When you
consider the false start

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
and that a Rank A
Lethal Spell was used

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
resulting in numerous injuries?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound like an
accident. It sounds deliberate.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
Wait, didn't they
disqualify Fourth High

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
after the match was over?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
So what was the point of
doing that in the first place?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's possible that
Fourth High was a scapegoat?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
As in, the real culprit
is someone else?

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
Someone that has it in for us

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
and doesn't care who else
gets hurt in the process?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Yeah.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya's taking part in
Monolith Code tomorrow.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
She's right. If something else
were to happen tomorrow--

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
Stop!

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
We can't do nothing!

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make any sense.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
What does No-Head
Dragon want with us?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
Why are they targeting
First High?

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
I don't know yet,

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
but one thing has been
made crystal clear.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
Their objective is to prevent
first high from winning.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
So... if I'm not mistaken,
you're saying there's a chance

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
they'll come after you again
and you're willing to risk

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
putting yourself in
the line of fire?

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Thing is, if we forfeit, we'd be
playing right into their hand.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
At least if I'm their target,
I have the means to fight back.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Still...

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I know that
you'll be fine, Brother.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
I really do believe that, but it
doesn't stop me from worrying.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
I wish there were something
I could do to help you, somehow.

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Miyuki!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
So, long story short,

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
we all wanna help
protect Tatsuya together.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Pardon me?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
Real talk.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
We're startin' to think that the
accident today was a sabotage,

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
and if that's the case, it means
that someone or something

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
is targeting our school.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
It also means there's
a very real possibility

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
both Tatsuya and his team
are going to be targeted

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
during tomorrow's events.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya's gone above and
beyond for us again and again

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
throughout this Competition.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
And we've been thinking
about what we could do

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
to repay him for everything
he's done for us.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
Which is beautiful
segue into "the plan"!

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
We all know how hard Tatsuya's
been working behind the scenes.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
Well, now he's the one
taking center stage,

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
which means it's our
turn to support him!

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
So these are the three possible
scenarios for sabotage

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
that we can think of!

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] The Tournament
Committee has been very careful

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
about safeguarding
and checking the CADs,

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
so I'm not sure we can do
anything about that last one.

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
But we have come up with
some countermeasures

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
for the other two.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Security's supposed
to be really tight

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
during these matches, but
judging by what happened today,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
it still hasn't been enough.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU] They do a sweep
of all five stages

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
in advance of the event,

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
but if we're dealing with
sabotage, it makes sense

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
that the perpetrator
would cover their tracks.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Hence the plan.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
Basically, before
a match starts,

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
we'll be doing our own safety
check on each of the stages.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] And then we'll
be patrolling the venue

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
while the match is in progress.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
And that about covers
how we're all planning

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
on spending our day tomorrow!

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
Well? Thoughts?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
Thank you all, truly.
On behalf of my brother.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
And for what it's worth,
I'm happy to do my part.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
However, I have
two favors to ask.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
Firstly, I'd like to keep this
a secret from my brother

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
if we can.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
If he found out we were
putting ourselves at risk

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
behind his back, there's no
doubt he'd be concerned.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
And two... Please try not
to do anything dangerous.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
If any one of you
were to be injured,

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
my brother would be heartbroken.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
Substitutes?!

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[NO-HEAD DRAGON EXEC A]
Well, what do we do?

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
If First High is the only
school to experience

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
another "accident,"
it'll invite suspicion!

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
The only thing that matters
is that First High doesn't win.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
And there are other ways
for us to accomplish that.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Eimi?
Didn't sleep well?

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Oh... Sorry...

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
I got up early 'cause we needed
to check the stage befo--

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Uh. Nothing! Pay no attention!

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI, EIMI giggling]

00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Hm.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
Good luck out there.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
Welp. Guess we'd
better get out there.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
Substitute or no,
we've got a job to do.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
Mikihiko, let's roll.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
I'll be right behind you.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
All right, ladies.
Let's get to work.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
[FUJIBAYASHI]
Oh! Hello, Miyuki!

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
Ms. Fujibayashi! I didn't
know you'd be here.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm here on work.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50% align:center
It has its perks.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
For instance, it looks
like I'll be watching

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
your brother's match
with the Crimson Prince.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
Crimson Prince, you say?

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean the heir
to the Ichijo Family?

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
He has some powerful spells.
Especially his Rupture.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
Heh. But I'm sure Tatsuya
won't have any problems!

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No matter what he's up against,

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
I know there's nothing
my brother can't overcome.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
Still, stay safe.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
[horn blares]

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A] Match complete!
The winner is First High School!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Congratulations, Big Brother!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
Wow! This all look delicious!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
Let's do 91 Ice Cream.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
They have a number of flavors
you can only get here,

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
so you should give them a try.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
You've really got
the inside "scoop"

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
on all the best snacks here,
don't you, Shizuku?!

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.208 position:50% align:center
Hey. Thought I
recognized that butt.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Rude! It's not okay that
you keep doing that to me!

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry 'bout that!

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
Next time, I'll give
you a big 'ol shout

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
before I make with
the butt grabbin'.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna
make it any better!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
You know, earlier,
we had the pleasure

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
of watching Tatsuya Shiba's
Monolith Code match.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised. To think he's
capable of Gram Demolition.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
His teammates also
acquitted themselves well.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
So much that it
begs the question:

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
Why are the three
of them reserves

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
when they possess
that much talent?

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] May I ask...
is that fencing gear?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was using it to practice
for tomorrow's Mirage Bat.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
Airi.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
Even if they knew my
strategy front and back,

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
there's nothing that they
can do to counter my speed.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
I'm going to win tomorrow.
It's already been decided.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
Ugh. Ya feel that?

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
This place just got weird.
Whattaya think that is?

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you not
able to sense that?

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
The spirits in this place
are strangely restless.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
It's coming from below us.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
Put those eyes of yours to use

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
and tell me if you can
see anything down there.

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Are these... spirits?

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Yeah, but they
sure aren't behaving

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
the way normal spirits do.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
What I'm sensing feels
like Ancient Magic

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
from the Asian Continent.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
Ancient Magic from
the Asian Continent?

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
Seems like. Call it a hunch,
but whoever set this up

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
probably has somethin'
in mind for these spirits.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?
Is this sabotage?!

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
Who said anything about that?

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
What aren't you telling us?

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
You say you found spirits?
Along the ley lines?

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Yeah, but we haven't been able

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
to figure out why, yet.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] I'm not all that
sure what they were hoping

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
to accomplish with this.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
The spirit power here
is pretty weak.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
The most you'd be able to do
is let some of the water escape.

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
What would be the point?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
Generating mud or fog wouldn't
cause much of an interference.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
In any case, would you
really go out of your way

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
to use Ancient Magic
just for that?

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
Huh... Water.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
Introducing water,
for what? Unless...

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
Ichijou!

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] The ichijo
Family's Rupture Magic

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
vaporizes any liquid,
causing powerful explosions.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
If these ley lines
seeped into the arena,

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
