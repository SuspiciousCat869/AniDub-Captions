00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
It's overcast today.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.642 position:50% align:center
This bodes really well
for your match, Miyuki!

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
It should be easier for you

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
to see the Mirage Bat
holograms this way!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
How lucky is that?

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
I doubt Miyuki's
all that nervous.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
After all, Ms. Kobayakawa's
competing today, too.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
I am nervous.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
I may not be alone out there,

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
but it's still a
lot of pressure

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
knowing I'm filling
in for Ms. Watanabe.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Come on! You're gonna
be just fine out there!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
After all, you have your
brother on your side!

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Well, I mean, I didn't
wanna say anything, but...

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] There are only two
days left in the Competition.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
We have the Mirage
Bat event today

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
and Monolith Code tomorrow.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
If we win either one of them...

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
Will lock us in as
the overall winner.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
It's not your job to worry
about the rest of the school.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
Just focus on the match in front
of you and you'll be fine.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.941 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I appreciate it, Shizuku.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
It's easier said than
done, I'm afraid.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
Everyone's worked hard in
order for us to get this far,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.408 position:50% align:center
especially you and Honoka,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
and it's up to me to make
sure it was worth it.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I know you're
all counting on me.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I'll be up against
students of all grades

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.090 position:50% align:center
in the Mirage Bat
Official Event.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
And that includes...

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.562 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Airi Isshiki, I have
no intention of losing to you.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
I'm going to do
whatever it takes

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
to lead First High to victory.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Of course. I understand. Thanks.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.282 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.453 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO] It must be hard,
being so important.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Ms. Mizuo.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.874 position:50% align:center
I take it that was your family?

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
It was. How did you guess?

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
I think we've known
each other long enough.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] They see Ichijo's loss
yesterday as an opportunity

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.426 position:50% align:center
and they expect me to
make a memorable showing

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.136 position:50% align:center
as a demonstration of power.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
No doubt a bid for
a spot in "the Ten."

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
Really?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.891 position:50% align:center
A power struggle between
clans at a time like this?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
Can't they just let you focus
on what you came here to do?

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
That's a lot of extra
pressure to pile on.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
My mother has aspirations.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
It's why she moved to Japan.
And I'm a part of them.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
So I can't afford to lose.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
My family is counting on me.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
But make no mistake,
I have my own ambitions.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
Got it. Well, guess
we'd better win then.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
Guess so! We'll take this
Mirage Bat event by storm.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
Let's get that one-two finish.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A] Welcome to
the Mirage Bat official event!

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
Our first match
is about to begin!

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
Be sure to feast your eyes
on the elaborate costumes

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
as our competitors
take the field!

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Well, that's my cue!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Good luck, Ms. Kobayakawa.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
We'll be rooting for you.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
Mmh. Likewise!

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Let's take a little
pressure off of Shiba.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
You can do it, Keiko!

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[KOHARU] Her CAD's been
fine-tuned to perfection,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
and Keiko's in great
physical shape.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine she'll have
any trouble qualifying.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
Right on!

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
You're doin' great!
Just keep it up!

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
So far so good!

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
Time to reset and
make another jump.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
No, Keiko!

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
Keiko, talk to me.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
Keiko! What happened out there?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
I'm coming with you!

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
Brother, was this--?

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
I think so.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
Mizuki?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] I guess Ms. Kobayakawa
had to forfeit the match.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
Do we know what happened?

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
My brother suspects it
might've been her CAD.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
That it must've been
tampered with in some way.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
I thought the Tournament
Committee checks them

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
before every match!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
What do they want with us?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
Well, my brother went down
there to try and get answers.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU]
We have a problem!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
It's Tatsuya!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
You've underestimated me.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50% align:center
Did you think I'd stand by
as you target Miyuki next?

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 12-C] Did you hear
about that engineer?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
One of the boys from First High

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
wandered into the
Committee's tent

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
and attacked them
out of nowhere.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 12-A]
I heard he really did a number

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
on one of the officials.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 12-B]
What a psycho.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
And all because they lost.
Can you imagine?

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
You don't know him.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
My brother would never get
angry without a good reason.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
I just know it.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki!

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?
Sorry to make you worry.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
You only ever get angry
when it's on my behalf,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
and then you end up
suffering for it.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.266 position:50% align:center
Oh, Brother, you can't
keep doing this.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
Um... Hey, guys.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
Silly boy! What were
you thinking?

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
What must I do to make
sure you behave?

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Miyuki,
I'm at your mercy.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
Uh, excuse me?
What are you doing?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Imagine my surprise being told

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
one of my <i>kohai</i> 's
went on a rampage.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
And wouldn't you know,

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
it turns out to be everyone's
favorite obsessive big brother.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
All because someone dared to
mess with his precious sister.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
So he has a sister complex.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
Mh-hm. Makes sense.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
I get it...

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Well, at the very least,

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
the temperature has
lowered, so that's good.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
Another First High accident?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
Airi, what are you
thinking about?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] I'm thinking that it
sounds like more sabotage.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
I don't get why they're
singling out First High.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
Like, whatta they stand
to gain from this?

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that makes
Ms. Shiba their next target.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO] Thanks for waiting.
I'm all set to go.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
Ms. Mizuo,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
I understand you're sticking
to the basics for this match?

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
Yup! My thinking is this:

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
It's the fundamentals that got
us here in the first place,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
why fix what ain't broke?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
Regardless, with your
training, you'll be fine.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
[MARI] Who would've thought
that a tournament official

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
would be the one tampering
with our CADs?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
If it hadn't been for Shibata's
eyes and Tatsuya's intervention,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
we might've been
in some serious trouble.

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
I feel guilty for having
put Shiba's little sister

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.646 position:50% align:center
in this position.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
Not only did she have
to take my place,

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
but now the burden
of First High's destiny

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
is on her shoulders.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not worried
about her one bit.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
It's only a matter of time.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
Someday she'll be carrying all
of First High on her shoulders.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Whattaya think she's
wearing? Any guesses?

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
She said it would be
fairly ordinary.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I call shenanigans.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
I mean, she said it
would be "orthodox"

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
for Ice Pillars Break,
and just look what she wore.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A] Our Second
Match is about to begin!

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
Competitors,
please take the field!

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
She's so gorgeous!

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
Truly. What a costume.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
Is it the costume, or the
girl who's wearing it?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
I'll never get over
how beautiful she is!

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
That's her. The girl
from Ice Pillars Break.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
So what? So she's good
at Oscillation Magic.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
Doesn't mean she can do this.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
She's up against
third years now.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Let's see how she holds up.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
She's fast.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Even so...

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
Huh. Not bad.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Ms. Shiba is
something else, isn't she?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
She's only a first year,

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
but she's holding her
own against Ms. Mizuo.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Sure, but the rest
of the students

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
are all right on their heels.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
I'll tell ya, the finals really
are a different animal.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A] That does
it for the second period!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
Every one of them's formidable.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
But I can't lose. I refuse to.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
Is it all right if I use it?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
You can do anything
your heart desires.

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I believe in you, Miyuki.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
She's finally going to use it.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] The spell I tried so
hard to master, but couldn't.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Keep your eyes
on me, Big Brother.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
I will fly!

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
But that's--!

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Is this... Flying Magic?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI]
Sh-She's flying!

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
She's really flying!

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
It's been called impossible.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard of a single
success story. Till now.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
If I recall, Taurus Silver
only just announced

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
a breakthrough last month.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya suggested Honoka
and I try to learn it, too,

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
but there was no way we were
ever going to master it in time.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Yet here she is,
flying like it's second nature.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
She really is incredible.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
Cutting edge doesn't
even begin to describe

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
how new that spell is,

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
but from the look of it, her
magic breathing is quite stable.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] It would seem she's
made it completely her own.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
No good. There's just no way
I can keep up with her!

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
Even so, I won't let myself
go down without a fight!!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
Airi.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A]
The winner of the second match

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
is Miyuki Shiba of
First High School!

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
Big Brother!

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] So not only does she have
overwhelming magical talent,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
she's also mastered the
unthinkable power of flight.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't this fun?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
I admit, I wasn't
ready for that.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
But it's not as if we can't
reach the holograms

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
with Jump Spells.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
Students from every school
have been doing it for years.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
We're going to be fine, Shiori.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] We'll defeat her
by working together.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
We have more than enough
talent between us.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
I can't stand that I'm the one
here getting a pep talk.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
I need to do everything
I can to help her.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Right on!
You can do it, Shiori!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
Ms. Mizuo.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I tried.
But I let you down.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
I'm so pathetic.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
No. Watching your
battle helped me.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
It actually gave me
a lot to work with.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] If I'm going to compete
with Shiba's Flying Magic,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.072 position:50% align:center
I can't hope to stay in
the air as long as she can.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Uh! How?

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
So fast!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] But I'll surpass
her nonetheless!

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
With my speed and
sheer force of will!

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A]
Match over!

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
The winner is Airi Isshiki
of Third High School!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Thank goodness.

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
I'm relieved I was able to
present my brother with a win.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
There was a lot riding on that.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
Flying Magic is very
important to him.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
So I'm thrilled that I was
able to make its unveiling

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
such a huge success.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
I'm so proud of him.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
What about our CAD?

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
You'll have to forgive us.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
We're been receiving
a lot of inquiries

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
from the other schools
regarding Flying Magic.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
And?

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
We're completely
within regulations,

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
and we're using publicly
available technology.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
No one on the committee is
arguing that, Mr. Shiba.

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Those sound like
tournament officials

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
he's speaking with.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
I suppose I can't blame
them for being suspicious.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
Though when they
see how streamlined

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
that CAD and all
its sequences are,

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
perhaps they'll all be stunned
and impressed with his work!

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] Our target
from the second match

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
managed to make it
to the finals.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
Moreover, she won
by a huge margin.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
[NO-HEAD DRAGON EXEC A]
They've gotten wise

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
to our CAD tampering, too.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
The way things are going,

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
if we don't take decisive
action, we will lose everything.

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
We have no choice.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
We're employing
our ace-in-the-hole.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] Good. Let's shut them
down once and for all.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
We have a Generator
standing by.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
If we indiscriminately kill

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
a hundred or so people in
the audience, it'll suffice.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm removing
the limiter. Get to work.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.878 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Right.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
I understand. Thank you.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Brother, is there
something wrong?

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
No. Not at all.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
We have a long break
before the Final.

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
You should try
and get some rest.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
If there's anything you
want me to do for you,

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
just say the word, okay?

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
Anything at all.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Anything? Really?

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.735 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki?

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Uh. U-Um... How about...

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
I-If it's not too much trouble

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
would you stay by my side
until I fall asleep?

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
You are so adorable, Miyuki.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Well, is it so wrong?

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
That I want to be spoiled
by my big brother?

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Very well.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Really?

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] However, I won't
be singing any lullabies.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Heh. Fine, I'll just
have a dream where you do.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
My dear little sister...

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50% align:center
Protecting you is more important
to me than anything else.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
I will exterminate anyone
who threatens you with harm.

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
You are all that matters.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
I'm flying, Brother...

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI laughing]

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
I'm flying, Brother!

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
You finally did it!

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
Your Flying Spell
works perfectly!

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
My brother is special.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
No one else could've given
form to such a beautiful spell.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
In any other life,
he'd be famous.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
His name would be known
all over the world.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
But instead...

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
...he lives bound by our family.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
They strip him of any
sense of accomplishment

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
and leave him with nothing.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
I hate myself for
being so helpless

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
in the face of their control.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
But I promise...

00:18:55.927 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
I promise that someday soon,
I'll save you, Brother.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
I'll do everything in my
power to set you free,

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
once and for all.

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
Everyone is using
Flying Magic, now?

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 12-A]
Yeah.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
The tournament staff
instructed First High

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
to disclose their
CAD information.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
So now that it's public,

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
it's safe to assume
that every school

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
is going to be using
it in the Final.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
If Ms. Shiba were
the only one flying,

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
I'm confident I
could hold my own.

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
But if I'm going to have to
contend with everybody...

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
Even if you decide to use it,

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
that doesn't
guarantee we'll win.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
Shiba's got an advantage over us

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
because she's
already mastered it.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
You'd be out of your
element up there.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Flying isn't some cure-all
that supersedes skill.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I don't
know what to do.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
If I change strategies this
late, it could backfire.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Still!

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
I have not come this far just to
lose because I played it safe.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
That settles it,
I have to take the risk,

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
and bet on my own potential.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
And to that end, I need you
at the top of your game.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
We need to reconfigure for
flying. Can you pull it off?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
Um... Yes. I'll do
everything I can, but--

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Shiori, know that
I believe in you.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
You're my engineer for a reason.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
Now, let's talk about
my other idea.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07-A]
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
thank you for waiting.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
The Mirage Bat Official
Event final will now begin!

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
What fortunes await
our finalists

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.947 position:50% align:center
in these star-studded skies?

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
In the qualifying rounds,
it was Miyuki Shiba

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
who captivated us
with her Flying Magic!

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
But each competitor
on the field tonight

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
is a world-class magician!

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
In the end, only one
may emerge victorious.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
Remember, Airi, where there's
a will, there's a way!

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
Just focus on what you can
control, and you got this!

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
Trust!

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO] You're the pride
and joy of Third High.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you
can't overcome.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
Thank you all so much.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Airi.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
Know that I believe
in you, too, okay?

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Wish me luck!

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
Thank you for waiting.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.660 position:50% align:center
You look stunning, Miyuki.

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
If Mirage Bat awarded points
for style, you would get a 10.

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
Brother, you're making me blush.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
You look well-rested.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
Yes. I feel energized and
ready to get out there.

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:40.175 position:50% align:center
I'd like to start with
using your Flying Magic.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Of course. Go fly
to your heart's content.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Big Brother!

00:21:55.774 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
