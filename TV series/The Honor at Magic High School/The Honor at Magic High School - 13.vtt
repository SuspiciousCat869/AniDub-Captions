[MASAKI] Would you believe that
Mirage Bat is supposed to be

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
the crown jewel of the
Nine Schools Competition?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
This feels anticlimactic.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
Well, if First High is
able to win this event,

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
they'll walk away with
this entire competition.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
For the other
schools involved,

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
this is already
a throwaway match.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center

It's my fault.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
If only I'd won the
Monolith Code Event!

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
I'm just as much
to blame for that.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
[MASAKI] My dreams of us
winning the tournament...

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
Of getting to dance
with Miyuki Shiba...

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
Of holding her close and
confessing my feelings to her!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
I can feel them all
slipping from my grasp!

Huh?

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center

last chance, George!

You have to win this thing!

You good?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] I guess she couldn't
make it after all.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.131 position:50% align:center
Sorry, baby.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.717 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I'll be able
to come out and see you.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.052 position:50% align:center
That's all right, Mother.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
Even if you can't attend
the competition,

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
I promise that I'll
acquit myself well

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center

That doesn't need to be
your burden, sweet girl.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.692 position:50% align:center
You should be striving for
what matters most to you

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.236 position:50% align:center
and no one else.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
What matters to me?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] The only thing
I care about right now

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
is that I give this match
everything I've got.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
And win.

Are all of the students
using Flying Magic now?

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I was worried about this.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
From the moment my
brother handed my CAD

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
to the tournament officials,

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
I just had this feeling.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
How reckless.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
This is not the kind of magic

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
that you can simply
master on the fly!

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that
they're prioritizing victory

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
over their students' safety!

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
They're going to be fine.

[AZUSA, MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
they seem to be using
the Taurus Silver sequence,

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
and as far as I can tell,
they haven't modified it.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
Which means,
if anything happens,

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
the safety mechanism
should kick in.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
Look at us!
We're actually flying!

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center

You've gotta be kidding me!

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
Aren't we using the
same magic? What gives?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] At this rate, I don't
stand a chance against her!

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
Not if all I can do is fly!

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
So is that...
the safety mechanism?

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
Yes. If your psions dip
below a threshold,

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
it automatically activates.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
That's a big relief!

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] This event is
shaping up to serve

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
as some good publicity
for Taurus Silver.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
All in all, I couldn't have
asked for a better debut

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center

than this, so thank you,

This ensures a Top 3
finish for First High!

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
That alone may be enough

Am I just going to
trail in her wake

as she claims this match, too?

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
Why am I failing?

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
Is it because
she practiced more?

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
Or is she just more talented?

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
No. No, I refute that!
That can't be it!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
Can it...?

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
If First High's already won
the overall Competition,

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
then is there any reason
I'm even bothering to try?

Yeah. Using a Jump Spell on
top of the Flying Magic?

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center

a recipe for exhaustion.

all the stops out there,

sat out the rest of the match,

it'll be in his name!

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
I don't think so!

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Miyuki!

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
Miyukii!

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
Let's go! Just a little more!

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Airi, you can't...

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki...

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelling]

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Members of No-Head
Dragon East Japan Branch,

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
it's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
[EIMI sighs, chuckles]

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
There's nothing like a hot bath

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
after a long and grueling match!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure Miyuki was the only
one competing in said match.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Brother,
please be safe out there.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
Well, hey! Look who it is!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
[TOKO chuckles]

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on
winning, Ms. Shiba.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
Why, thank you, Miss Isshiki.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS chuckle]

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[NO-HEAD DRAGON EXEC B yells]

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
No! Hang on! We'll leave!

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
We'll cease all
operations at once!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
If you want us out
of the country, fine!

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center
Just please--!

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
I don't understand!
Why would you do this?!

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
We haven't killed anyone!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] I don't give
a damn how many people

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
your organization
may have killed,

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
or how many you've spared.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
You sealed your fate

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
when you chose to mess
with something dear to me.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
none of you are
worthy of any mercy.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center
Y-You... You're a demon!

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Yes. Yes, I am.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
A demon you summoned

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
when you drew out my
one remaining emotion.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
And as this demon's
power consumes you,

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
know you brought
this on yourself.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
Wait... When you say
"demons power"...

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
...do you mean Demon Light?!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
The spell from three
years ago in Okinawa!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
Just who are you?!

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I'm someone who's never

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
going to let anything
like that happen again.

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I don't know
what I should say.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
This is awkward.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm worried
that my words or demeanor

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
could come off as arrogant
to her if I'm not careful.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
I suppose I'll go first.

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
I wanted to thank you
while I have the chance.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] Our match brought
something into focus for me.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
Truth be told, I was
reluctant to accept

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
that there's an overwhelming gap

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
between your abilities
and my own.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
Even so...

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd be devastated,

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
but it helped me
realize something.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
I still have a lot of
untapped potential.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Potential?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
For instance,
using my Jump Spell

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
simultaneously
with Flying Magic.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
Without you in the picture,

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
I might never have
thought to try it.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
And I bet if I practice more,
I'll be able to fly even faster.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
I may have lost
that match today,

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
but I gained a powerful new
understanding of myself.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.758 position:50% align:center
And so, getting
back to my point...

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Miss Shiba.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
It means so much that
you would say that to me.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
You're just as amazing
as I had hoped!

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] Oh, come now,
you're the amazing one.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
I'm very fortunate to
have had the opportunity

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
to meet someone like you.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
Someone my own age,
but with such formidable talent.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Oh, likewise!
You were quite a challenge.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
You had me worried
there for a moment.

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Is that so?

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, I'm honored.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
I'll be working non-stop
to improve by next year,

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
so I hope you enjoy being
worried, Miyuki Shiba.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Challenge accepted,
Airi Isshiki.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Me, too, Ms. Kitayama. Me, too.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother!

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI giggles]

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for you!

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you
made it back safely!

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
Thank you... Miyuki.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI]
Please don't do this!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
[MASAKI]
You're <i>what</i> ?!

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
How long have you been
brother and sister?!

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
You only now realized that?

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI]
Masaki!

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
Let me get this straight.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
that my brother and I

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
don't look like we're related?

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
[MASAKI] I-I never thought for
a second you were her brother!

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
You don't look a thing like her,
so how could I have known?

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI] Masaki!
They're both named Shiba!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
[MASAKI] Wait! Ms. Shiba!
May I have this dance?!

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Where are you taking me?!
Let go! Unhand me!

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
Something really doesn't
add up about this win.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
We kind of owe this whole
competition to Tatsuya, right?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
More or less.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine things
turning out the same way

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
if we hadn't had him
as an engineer.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
Right, that's what I'm saying!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
So explain to me why
he's in Course Two.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA] He is literally
more talented than I am.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
He outshines me in both
knowledge and technique,

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
yet he's the one in Course Two?

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
How does that make sense?

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
It makes me question
the validity of our system

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
Consider the fallout.
Forget "weeds" and "blooms,"

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
why are we even okay
calling people "irregular"?

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No, that's a sound argument.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
magic engineering

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
and technology know-how,

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
no one I know comes
even close to Tatsuya.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
[MARI] The difference between
Course One and Two

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
comes down to practical skills
test scores, and nothing more.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Sure, but we can't
overlook our uniforms.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
Considering the whole
"embroidery debacle."

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
standardizing a design error
instead of correcting it.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
Really? Neither of you knew?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
A while back, there was a
push to train more magicians,

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
so they expanded enrollment in
the middle of a school year,

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
which is where
Course Two came from.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
There was a shortage
of instructors,

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
so the new students
were limited to theory.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
The plan was to get them
into practical courses

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
the following year.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
I suspect the real
trouble started

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
when someone made a mistake

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
while putting in an order
for additional uniforms,

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
so the Course Two students
ended up with jackets

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
that had no emblem.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
It... was all a mistake?

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.538 position:50% align:center
Trust me, it gets worse.

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
The teacher shortage
never got remedied,

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
so what started as a
simple misunderstanding

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
became the new status quo.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
And that's the
embarrassing truth.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Know what I can't get over?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
They'd rather custom-order
two separate uniforms

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
than address the problem.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
You know, that is an
astonishingly stupid excuse

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
for years of systemic
discrimination.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
Well, sure, I imagine
that's how it all started,

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
but let's not forget
that a good portion

of our Course One student body

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
has been more than happy
to run with it.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Well, at any rate,
I wanna do what I can

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
to try and move the needle
forward while I'm here.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Oh. And none of this gets
back to Miyuki, understand?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA] Y-Yes of course!
That goes without saying!

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
I don't even want
to think about

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
what she'd do if she
ever were to find out!

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Find out what?

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Nothing important, dear Heh.

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
By the way, I don't suppose
any of you happen to know

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
where my brother's hiding?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm pretty sure
he's out in the courtyard.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
Jumonji said something
about having

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
a really important
question for him.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.978 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI, AZUSA squeal]

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] May I have this
dance, Tatsuya Shiba?

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
Anything for you!
Jumonji- <i>senpai</i> !

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
As if that would ever happen!

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't!

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
Or would he?!

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] It's Mr. Jumonji.
That must mean...

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother!

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
Hey! Whoa!

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be running at
night like that, it's dangerous.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
But... um, what were you
talking with Jumonji about?

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Nothing to warrant
that kind of concern.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
We were discussing
what will happen

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
after his class graduates.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
They really want Tatsuya

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
to marry into one of
the Ten Master Clans?

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Seems that way.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
The fact that he soundly
defeated the Ichijo Family heir

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
created quite a stir
at the clan meeting.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
Still, guess it makes sense.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
After all, you can try to
pass a jewel off as a pebble,

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
but the truth is
bound to come out.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
Very true. A time will come

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
when they'll each have to make
a choice about their future.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
Taking into account their
respective positions and talent,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
Some may find that
the more gifted they are,

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
the more the world
bears down on them

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
as they venture
into adulthood.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
Then again, who knows
with those two?

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I think this might be
the last song of the evening.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
Big Brother...

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
Would you do me the honor of
spending the last dance with me?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
With pleasure.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Did you enjoy
the Nine Schools Competition?

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Yes! It was perfect.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful,
with my whole heart,

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
that we enrolled at this
Magic High School together.

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
We've made such
wonderful friends,

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
including upperclassmen
I can look up to

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
and worthy rivals
to compete against.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
Magic brought all these
amazing people into our life.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
And getting to know
them has helped me realize

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
how much more there is
to look forward to

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
than we ever imagined!

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Which is when it occurred to me.

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
If magic is re-writing the
world we know, then in a way,

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
maybe friendship is its own
special kind of magic.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
I think you're right.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Do you suppose
our meeting was magic, too?

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps...

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
I wonder...

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:15.311 position:50% align:center
Do you think Shizuku's
having fun in America?

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.938 position:50% align:center
I really miss her!

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.732 position:50% align:center
Are you still going on
about that?

00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:21.651 position:50% align:center
It's just a foreign exchange
program for three months.

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.278 position:50% align:center
It's time you got used to it.

00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:26.031 position:50% align:center
Veto! I say we should
call her right now!

00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.615 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] I think it's
evening over there!

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
That's a great idea!

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.870 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS whispering]

[LINA]
Hi there!

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, KAZUMI]
Huh?

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
[LINA]
Would this be the classroom

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
for First Year, Class A?

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hello there!

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
You must be the new
foreign exchange student!

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.510 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:50.430 position:50% align:center
Allow me to welcome you
to First High School!
