[EIMI]
A toast!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
To Shizuku's victory in the
Speed Shooting event,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
to Kazumi and I for placing,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
and to Honoka,
for making it past

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.313 position:50% align:center
the qualifying round
in Battle Board!

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
To First High!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
Hey, not too bad for our first
day in the competition, right?

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
I'm off tomorrow,

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
but you all have
matches, don't you?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
Well, Shizuku,
Eimi, and I are all

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
going to be competing
in Ice Pillars Break.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
Nanami and I are both
scheduled for Crowd Ball.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
Say, isn't Isshiki from Third
High School also in Crowd Ball?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She's bound
to be a challenging match.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU]
You have nothing to worry about!

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
For I shall be
there to oppose her,

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
and I guarantee you a flamboyant
victory for First High!

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.972 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh...?

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
Whoa, don't tell me
this is your first time

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
seeing Subaru do that!

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI]
Her Awareness Block,

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.228 position:50% align:center
makes her pretty easy to miss
even when right in front of you,

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
so she tends to speak
and act in a way that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
will leave a lasting impression.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
Oh! How very curious...

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
I wish I was competing
in Ice Pillars Break...

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya's gonna be your
engineer in that one, right?

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He's really good.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
Wasn't he the one who

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
developed your Active Air Mine
spell for Speed Shooting?

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
He also came up with my Flash!

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.626 position:50% align:center
Wait! You mean that
one was his, too?!

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
Man, I wish he could've been
my engineer for Crowd Ball...

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
Sadly, my brother
only has one body,

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
so he can't possibly work
two events at the same time.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
True, but I do get where
Nanami's coming from.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
For the time being,
he's been undefeated

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
in every event he's worked on.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.310 position:50% align:center
That feat that would entitle
anyone to some swagger.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
Although, I hear he declined to

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
have his name recorded
in the Index for some reason.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] He did. It's
a very bad habit of his...

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.198 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Can I ask you something?

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
Why did you choose not to be

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center
credited in the Index for
the spells you designed?

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.539 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me; did our aunt
have anything to do with it?

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.332 position:50% align:center
She did.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I knew it...

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.253 position:50% align:center
So, that's why you declined.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.798 position:50% align:center
Brother, you've given up your
life because of the Yotsubas,

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.300 position:50% align:center
and it's all my fault, isn't it?

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
If only I had the power
to free you from all this...

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki...

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
It should never have been

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
your burden to worry about me.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.856 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother...

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
I'll always be on your side,
no matter what happens to us.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
Even if the whole
world turns against you

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
and becomes your enemy.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
I'll face it down with you.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
You look like you've
been through the wringer.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
Was facing Isshiki
really that bad?

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
They weren't kidding
about her speed.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
That girl is superhuman.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
 And I've had it
dialed all the way up

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
to the human threshold limit
during my virtual training!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU] I won't deny,
that sounds formidable.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
But against me, Ms. Isshiki's
speed will fail her.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
After all, my special
skill was made for this.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center

[ANNOUNCER 07A] The Rookie

[ANNOUNCER 07A]
Representing First High School

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
is Subaru Satomi!

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
Challenging her for the title
is Third High's Airi Isshiki!

[buzzer sounds]

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A] In this
event, competing athletes

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
vie to land the most balls
in their opponent's court

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
within the time limit!

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center
And what a match!

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
The balls are flying so fast,
you can barely make them out!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Something's wrong.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
I've been aiming my shots
for wherever this girl isn't,

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
and yet...

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] An illusion? No.
She's actually there.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
So why is it that I'm unable to
sense her presence at all?

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU] Awareness Block is a
type of Born -Specialized magic.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
It allows me to conceal my
presence even in broad daylight.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
Meaning, even if you can see me,
there's nothing you can do.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] It's obvious she's using
some kind of unique spell

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
to throw me off.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
But what kind of
magic is it, I wonder.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
No time...

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] Instead of trying
to gauge her movements,

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
I'll focus only on the balls.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
Amplify my speed and return
every single ball I sense.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center

This-- This is impossible!

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] If it's a contest of
raw speed, no one is my equal.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
That is why they
call me Lightning!

[HONOKA]
Subaru...

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
That was a rough match.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Tell me about it!
That's our Airi for you!

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's the nervous girl who
swept the qualifying rounds!

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
How are ya?

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
 Uh, fine?

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that the
runner up in that last match

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
is a friend of yours?

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
Gotta hand it to her.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
She may have lost by a lot,
but getting double digits

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
against Airi is
nothing to sneeze at!

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
Sure, but how'd
she pull so far ahead?

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
Did it have something to do
with that light at her neck?

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
Whoa... For real?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
You telling me
you could see that?

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
Wow, if that's the case,
then your Flash Spell

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
from yesterday makes
so much more sense!

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
So you must have some kind of
hyper-sensitivity to light then!

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess what you saw
was probably the necklace CAD

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
that Airi wears.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
It's a specialized unit pared
down for one specific function.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
So the amount of light
it generates is minute.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you
were able to see it!

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
But it's a really neat trick!

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
First, she has a spell
to immediately process

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
sensory input subconsciously,

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50% align:center
and then another spell

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
directly commands
her body to return shots,

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
run, and even control her CAD,

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
all without ever having
to think about it.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Uh, wait so, you mean

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
her body starts moving
before she can even think?

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Before she even
knows what she's looking at

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
to be more accurate!

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
That is the secret that earned
her the title of Éclair!

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
Wow, what an ability...

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
But why are you
telling me all this,

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
considering I'm on a rival team?

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
Sure that's a good idea?

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Sure!
As powerful as Airi is,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
it really wouldn't
make a difference

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
whether I told you or not!

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA chuckles]

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
Real talk, though.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
Are you up here 'cause
you're planning to watch

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] How 'bout you
come find a seat with me

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
and let's watch them together?

I let her talk me into it...

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50% align:center
I can't believe
I'm such a pushover!

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
I've got to be more
careful.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
You sure got that right!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
A cute thing like you?

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
You really gotta learn
to keep your guard up!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
What? Did I say that out loud?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's about to start!

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Hm?

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
The Ice Pillars Break Event!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
Participants will try to
destroy their opponent's pillars

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
while simultaneously defending
12 pillars of their own!

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
And don't forget
about the costumes!

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
Always a highlight
of this event!

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Shiori decided to go
with her fencing outfit I see.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
That look in her eye...

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
If I use a data
fortification spell,

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I can prevent her from
breaking anything else!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
Futile.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
No!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
Wait, but that ice was all
fortified. How did it break?

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. That counter
magic's never gonna work.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
Shiori's magic
triggers in midair,

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
sending oscillation
waves down from above,

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
so you can't block it by
fortifying the ice itself.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
And not only that,
since she's generating

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
multiple oscillation waves,
every time they intersect,

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
they create additional waves
that are many times stronger!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
How about this?

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
[SANO] Try using that
magic on moving pillars!

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
Now for the counterattack.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
You had to disable your
data fortification spell

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
before you could
move your ice pillars.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
Meaning they're
no longer protected,

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
so a mundane attack
is more than sufficient.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
You're finished!

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
All right! Shiori's
back in full force!

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] She has such a
confident look in her eyes.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
And so should I!

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A] Next up is Eimi
Akechi of First High School!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Oh, look! That's one
of your friends, isn't it?

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Hey there! I'm Eimi.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I'm a smash your
hearts and yer ice!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
Bang!

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
Okay, Eimi, I understand that

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
your specialty is
moving structures?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
Right! I move really
big stuff really fast!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
My activation speed
is second to none!

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
I see. Okay...

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center
So what constitutes a structure?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
Could you move one of the
ice pillars in the competition,

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
for example?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
You bet I could!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to brag,

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
but when I was a kid,
I used to spend all my free time

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
moving giant stone pillars
around in my yard for fun!

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
And those ones were
as big as Stonehenge!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Well, that sure is

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
impressive in more
ways than one.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
I know, right? But my grandma
always got so upset over it.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
Either way, that experience
works in our favor.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
I think I've got an idea for
a spell. Give me just a moment.

simple and streamlined!

now that I think about it,

if First High keeps

that were to happen,

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
Knowing him, probably.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Hm? Why? It's not
an especially unusual outfit.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
It's all fairly
standard magical garb.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
It's been used in Japan
since ancient times.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
It's like talking to a
walking almanac, you know?

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure...

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
First, I must calm myself.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
If I let my thoughts wander,

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
it could cause my magic to
interfere with phenomena.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
A false start would
cause unthinkable trouble

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
not only for our school,
but for my brother.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
I won't let that happen.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
[SHIMIZU gasps]

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
[SHIMIZU]
Wh-What is this?!

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't tell me that's--!

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
Midrange Area Oscillation Magic.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Inferno!

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
No way! But how? That's insane!

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
Indeed...

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
She engulfs her opponent's ice

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
in a blazing hellfire,
all the while shielding her own

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
within an ultra-low
temperature shell.

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
It's unthinkable for a
high-school student

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
to be capable of this!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Miyuki Shiba, just who are you?

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
And that's the match!

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
The winner is Miyuki Shiba
of First High School!

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
Miyuki was incredible!

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
How is she that powerful?

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grunts]

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Oh, man!
That was a sight to see!

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
[TOKO giggles]
Ya wanna get some tea?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
What has you in
such a good mood?

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] You two are lucky,
you know that?

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
Seeing as one of you
might get the opportunity

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
to go up against her!

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
You want to take her on?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
Yes! Are you kidding me?

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity!

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
Come on, a chance to put it
all on the line against

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
a magician of her caliber?

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
Who wouldn't wanna jump
at a fight like that?

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
You're right.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
It's become clear
that Miyuki Shiba's

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
a woman of immense magical
power.

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.639 position:50% align:center
For that reason
a triumph over her

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
would be especially
meaningful to me.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
But it can't just be
a contest of raw power.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
It needs to be by the book
and rely on mastery.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
In that arena, it doesn't
matter how talented you are.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
Anyone can be bested,
and I'll prove it.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
I vow we're going to win
this for Third High School.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI chuckles]

00:17:58.203 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
So we will.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Couldn't of
said it better myself!

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
It's one thing to hear about it.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
But, wow, Miyuki is next level!

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
Even the thought
of possibly having

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
to face off against her is
enough to give me a stomachache!

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
--[HONOKA] Oh, hey.
--[EIMI] Uh!

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
Are you doing okay, Eimi?

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
I've never seen you
look so nervous before...

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Hey, cut me a break, okay?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
I'm allowed to freak
out once in a while.

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
No, I get it.

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
I'd be scared too with who
you're up against next.

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
Y'know, that crazy
Speed-Shooting girl,

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kanou of Third High School.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I was watching her match--

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
she utterly dismantled her
opponent in the blink of an eye!

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
[EIMI yelps]

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
I totally forgot!

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
I've been so wrapped up
worrying about a

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
hypothetical match with Miyuki!

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
What am I going to do?

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
everything, Tatsuya!

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
[FIRST YEAR GIRL 08A]
Thanks to you,

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
I somehow made it
into the Top Ten!

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI]
Miyuki!

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
That Inferno you cast--
It was mind blowing!

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
So was that another
Tatsuya special?

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.072 position:50% align:center
I never could have
accomplished it

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
without my brother's
incredible talent.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] That's amazing!
I'd had a feeling, but still!

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
--[FIRST YEAR GIRL 08B] Awesome!
--[FIRST YEAR GIRL 08C] So cool!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
As it should be.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
My brother deserves to have all
of his hard work acknowledged.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
Our first-year ladies seem
to be in high spirits tonight!

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Well, they did dominate
the podium, more or less.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
The events Tatsuya handled
in particular were remarkable.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.513 position:50% align:center
And of course the boys who
chose not to work with him

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
are probably regretting
that decision at the moment.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
Talk about night and day, huh?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
Just my luck.

00:19:58.156 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
All I needed was one more win,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
and I would'a been
moving up into the finals.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
How are you still
moping about that?

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
You've got Tatsuya
engineering for you.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
You know you're gonna be fine.

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know! All of that makes
sense on paper, sure...

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
...but just thinking
about tomorrow

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
is killing my
confidence and appetite.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
Some loss of appetite...

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA, EIMI gasping]

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Well, well, would
you look who it is?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
Hello, First High.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
Did you enjoy your dinner?

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
We just finished a moment ago.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
I take it you're on your way in?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
[AIRI grunts]

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
Yes. What a shame we
didn't get here earlier.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad I was able
to catch you before you left.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
[EIMI grunts]

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] Miyuki Shiba...
when you and I last spoke,

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
I treated you in a manner
that was insulting.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
However I've come to realize

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
that my perception
of you was wrong,

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
and I shouldn't
have acted as I did.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I'd like
to apologize to you.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
It's abundantly clear to me now

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
that you're a magician
of the highest caliber.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
And for that reason alone,

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
you'll get no quarter from me
during our inevitable showdown.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
I am going to defeat you,

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
and Third High School will leave
this competition victorious.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What's this?

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Oh, time for another standoff?

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
You're enjoying
this way too much.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
Do as you must.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, I have no
intention of losing, either.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
So let's agree to give it our
all when we finally compete.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
[AIRI chuckles]

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Those two are unbelievable!

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
They're each
completely confident

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
in their ability to win!

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
I should be taking notes!

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
There's no reason to assume

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
I've already lost this thing!

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.823 position:50% align:center
I'm just gonna give it
everything I've got!

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
I owe myself that much!

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yeah!

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50% align:center
Just watch me! Yippee-ki-ya--

Go to sleep already!
