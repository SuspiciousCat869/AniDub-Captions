[ANNOUNCER 07A]
Welcome to the women's

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
Ice Pillars Break
Rookie Event final!

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
Competitors to your places!

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
Well, Miyuki,
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
I made a promise,
so I gotta win this.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
The place is packed, isn't it?

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
I hear the military
even has representatives

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
observing the match.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.390 position:50% align:center
Those two have attracted
a lot of attention.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
And it's well deserved,

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
but let's not forget our
brilliant engineer!

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
If only the military
knew that the real prodigy

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
is sitting right
here between us!

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
Of course, we all know he'd
much rather be with his sister.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
Yes. I would.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.197 position:50% align:center
Wow, talk about
having zero filter.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
Let me ask you, have
you ever heard of something

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
called a "sister complex"?

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
How does rooting
for a family member

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
equate to my having
a sister complex?

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.331 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, did you hear that?

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center
Our little Tatsuya's
in denial! How cute!

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
It's not looking too good, doc.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.421 position:50% align:center
We've done everything we can,
but the boy's a lost cause.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
It would be one
thing to talk about me

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.802 position:50% align:center
behind my back; must you do
so right in front of me?

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
The final match
is all First High.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
Moreover, you-know-who
is engineering both sides.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
Could be useful.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
This'll serve as a good showcase
of his abilities, don't y'think?

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
The only thing
I'm thinking about

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
is the dance on the last night.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ms. Shiba.
How I want to dance.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.906 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
should be on your feet?

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.243 position:50% align:center
Yes. I wanted to be here
to see this match in person.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.828 position:50% align:center
Need I explain?

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.996 position:50% align:center
Miyuki Shiba.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.001 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later, I'll be facing
her in the Mirage Bat Event.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:09.671 position:50% align:center
This match will be a good
measure of what's to come.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.089 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center
Why does Shizuku wanna
compete against Miyuki so bad?

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.300 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
Gonna be honest with ya--

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'd ever wanna
compete against Miyuki.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
I don't think it would go well.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
It's possible that means

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
Shizuku thinks she has
a shot at beating her.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.270 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50% align:center
Well, let's think
about it for a second.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.607 position:50% align:center
No one knows better than her
how powerful Miyuki is.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
So if Shizuku has
her heart set on a match,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
it must be 'cause she
thinks she can win.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.072 position:50% align:center
Shizuku.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.576 position:50% align:center

[TOKO, MIZUO chuckle]

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
Big Brother.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Would you do me the honor

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
of putting my
hairpiece in for me?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.871 position:50% align:center
If you're allowed to, I mean.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
I don't want to
compromise your neutrality.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
I'll understand if you can't.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] As long as I have this,
I can overcome anything.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
All right, Shizuku.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
I'll honor your challenge
and give it my all.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Miyuki.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
I'm putting everything
on the line to beat you,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
and I'm not going to hold back.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grunts]

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
Resonance Destruction!

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
Isn't that Shizuku's
mom's specialty?

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
So Miyuki's using Inferno again.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
They've wasted no time
in going in for the kill.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
This is the move you used
to end your last match.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you,

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
I've already shielded my pillars
using Data Fortification.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you can do
to change their temperature.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
I'm familiar with this one.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
Resonance Destruction is an
area-wide oscillation spell.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
If I can counter it fast,
I'll avoid losses!

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
You disrupted the oscillation

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
before it could reach
the resonance point.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
As expected, Miyuki.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Oh, so you cast data
fortification on your pillars.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
No wonder this isn't working.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed you were
able to cast that

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
alongside Resonance Destruction.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
You've come a long way, Shizuku.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
However, that won't be
enough to defeat me!

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
Even if she's able to block
the direct effects of Inferno,

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
that won't stop her
ice from melting.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
If the air around them
becomes superheated,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
she's in trouble.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
I imagine this was
part of Shiba's plan

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
from the very start.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] So what will
you do now, Kitayama?

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
Shizuku's done for!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
For real.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
Too bad. I guess she really
didn't stand a chance, huh?

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
I'd hoped we could avoid this,
but you've forced my hand.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
Get ready.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shizuku! But how?!

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tatsuya, I need some help.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about my odds
of beating Miyuki.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you think I'm an idiot

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
for so much as contemplating
a match against your sister.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Still, if I can even the playing
field, I might have a shot.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
But that means
mastering a technique

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
that's on par with Inferno.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that you were
taking this match so seriously.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
Very well. In that case,
I may have just the thing.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Is that...?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] A specialized
CAD for you to pair

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
with your generalized one.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
You're going to use
them in tandem.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps]
You can't be serious, can you?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
If I were to use two CADs
at the same time,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
the psions would
interfere with one another,

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't be
able to cast at all!

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] I didn't say
that it would be easy.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
And I don't believe that
just anyone can pull it off.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
But...

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
...I think you can.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
I believe in your
potential, Shizuku.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
I can understand why
Honoka gets so carried away.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Hm?

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Here we go. For Tatsuya!

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
Is she planning to use
two CADs at once?

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE gasping]

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
Kitayama.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
When I use Spirit Magic,

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
I'm more or less
operating on autopilot,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
so I'm able to give my Modern
Magic CAD my full attention.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
But hers are both
Modern Magic units.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
How can that even be possible?

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
You're serious
about this, aren't you?

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
What you're about
to try is impossible

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
without absolute psion control.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
So does that mean
what I think it means?

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Shizuku, have you mastered
my brother's technique?

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Shizuku,
you've been pushing yourself

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
so hard day in and day out.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
Don't give up now.
You're so close.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
Phonon Maser?!

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
I've seen Miyuki's ice

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
take any damage!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
No one else was
able to scratch them

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
in any of the previous matches!

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Shizuku!

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Come on, Shizuku!
You can do this!

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
It's already a feat to
be operating two CADs,

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
but to couple it with
a spell like that?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
It's unthinkable.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
Either demonstration
alone would turn heads.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
I'm certain she's been
working with Tatsuya Shiba.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
Her determination to prevail

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
is something to be
admired, isn't it?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
As Shiba's classmate, she must
have known her chances,

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
but she didn't let it deter her.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
She refined a technique
that would give her an edge.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Just a little more. Come on!

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Shizuku, that look in your eye--

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
is this the "resolve"
my brother spoke of?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Shizuku said that?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There's no
denying her resolve.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
What could be so important
to her about beating me?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
It's only natural to wanna
take on challenging opponents.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
I suppose you could call it
a "magician's instinct."

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
You're the same age as she is,

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
but you're on a
whole other level.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
so it makes sense to me

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
that she'd want to try
her hand at besting you.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
So I'm going to
work hard to help her.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I want her to have
the best chance possible

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
when she faces you.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Why would my brother
be telling me this now?

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
Is it his way of
warning me about Shizuku?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I hope it goes without saying,

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
but I'll be doing
what I can for you, too.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
Though I'm warning you now;

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
you won't be able
to beat Shizuku

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
the way you have the others.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
You'll need to go all out.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I understand.
It didn't need to be said.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] I'm afraid I may
have given Shizuku false hope.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
I should have known that two
weeks would never be enough.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Brother, you've done
so much to support Shizuku.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
I can only imagine
just how important

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
this win must be to her.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
I know you're putting
your heart and soul

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
into this match, Shizuku.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
So it's only right
that I respond in kind

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
and give it everything I've got!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I'm jealous of the
attention Brother's given you.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
Of your new powers
and techniques!

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
And that's why, Shizuku,
I don't want to lose to you.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
I refuse to!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grunts]
What's this?

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
Wide-range Freezing! Niflheim?!

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
What kind of
a demonic realm is this?!

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
That's liquid nitrogen mist!

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
She's gonna neutralize the
Phonon Maser with that!

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
I won't let you do that.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
If I data-fortify before
the effects are reversed,

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
I'll preserve my lead.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
This won't be for nothing!

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Shizuku.
It's not going to matter.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
She's completely stopped
the ice from melting.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
But why would she bother
with a spell like Niflheim?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
It's overkill as defense,
so she must have another motive.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You don't
think she'd...?

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
Your pillars may be
protected from my Inferno,

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
but I can still
re-write the Eidos

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
of anything outside of them.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
Your Data Fortification won't
apply to anything new.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
So the liquid nitrogen deposits
left over from my Niflheim?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
They're all fair game as far
as my spells are concerned.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
his match is over.

[SHIZUKU gasps]

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Any liquid nitrogen
on the surface of your ice

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
will vaporize thanks
to Inferno's heat.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
And when it expands,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
it will be at a
rate of 700 times!

about your event, Shizuku.

Yeah. Me, too.

keep our promise.

I never really thought

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
I had a chance of
winning, anyway.

I'd be humiliated...

this is a good idea?

right that we celebrate

I wanted to say I'm
grateful for all your help

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't have won
my match without you.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
So, thank you! I mean it!

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
Come now, you earned it.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
However, I feel
like I failed you.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
How do you mean?

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
Under normal circumstances,

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
that would have been
a much closer match.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
It was a bad judgement
call on my part.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have pressured
you to master Phonon Maser

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
in such a short amount of time.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
Not true. You were only
doing what you felt was right.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
And let's face it,

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
that move was
the only thing I did

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
of any consequence
during our match.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Really, I should be the
one apologizing to you.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
I wish I'd been a more
worthy opponent, Miyuki.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
It was wrong of me
to waste your time.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
You didn't waste my time.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
Truly, I was inspired
by what you did out there.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Though I wonder...
Why does it feel like

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
you were intentionally setting
me up to lose that match?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
I did the best I could

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
to set each of you up for
success, and nothing more.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
How cruel. And here I thought

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
a brother's job was to
look after his sister.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
Miyuki, if I'd cut any corners,

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center

let me hear the end of it.

What do we have here?

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
Thought you could
celebrate without us, huh?

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
Invite us to help
you eat that cake!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
--[HONOKA] Huh?
--[SHIZUKU chuckles]

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Shizuku, you were so amazing!

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
I'm super jealous!

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Even though I didn't win?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Forget about winning or losing!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
Seeing you go all out in battle
like that was a sight to behold!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
You got my respect!

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Eimi.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, I'll be
counting on you, Tatsuya,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
for my match tomorrow.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
You and Honoka are
at the top of my list.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
Your CADs will be
ready in the morning.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] At long last,

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
I can reap the benefits
of your expertise.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
My expectations are high.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Honoka and Subaru!
Gettin' us that one-two finish!

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to have
cake again tomorrow!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, KAZUMI, SUBARU]
Yeah!

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A] Welcome to
day seven of the competition!

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
We'll begin with the
Mirage Bat Rookie events!

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
In this event holographic
balls are projected in midair

00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
and competing athletes
utilize magic

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
to leap up and smash them!

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
Whoever scores the most wins!

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[buzzer beeping]

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU grunts]

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
What is going on here?
My body has never felt so light!

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
This is too easy!

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
That's the same girl I took
on in the Crowd Ball final,

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
but somehow, she's far
more agile than I remember.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
And look who the engineer is.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
It seems anyone
Tatsuya Shiba works with

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
exhibits a sudden and
dramatic improvement.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
Which means, when I
face Miyuki  inMirage Bat,

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
it's a guarantee
he'll be there, too.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
[AIRI chuckles]

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Subaru's already made it

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
through the qualifying rounds,
so now it's my turn!

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya's counting on me,
so I can't let him down.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
But I've got a good
feeling about this.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
[FIFTH HIGH 20A]
Wha--? She's jumping already?

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
[SEVENTH HIGH 20A]
But they haven't projected

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
any holograms yet!

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA grunts]

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
[SECOND HIGH 20A]
What?!

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
[THIRD HIGH 20B] That ball just
appeared right in front of her!

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
Uh! I can't jump if
I can't see anything there!

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
How is she predicting
where they'll be?

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Wow, talk about using
your natural-born talents

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
to your advantage!

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
Since Honoka can
sense light emissions

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
before anyone can see 'em,

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
she might as well
be playing by herself!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Well, Mitsui and Satomi
both seem to be on track.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Yes.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that they'll
both make the final.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
We've made it to the podium

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
in every one of the women's
Rookie events, haven't we?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
We have such a remarkable
group of first years.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
That's kind of you
to say. However...

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have
done it without Tatsuya.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
As much as it pains me to admit,

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
the Nine Schools Competition
could have turned out

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
very differently were it
not for him. [chuckles]

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
I suppose he deserves
another thank you!

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Even if the Yotsuba
family refuses to acknowledge

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
my brother's value,

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
at least here, people
know how special he is.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
Attending this
high school together

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
truly has been
a blessing for us!

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Yes! I did it!
Hey, Tatsuya! I won!

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
And now,

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
the Men's Monolith
Code Rookie Event

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
between the students
of First and Fourth High

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
is about to get started!

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
In this event,
teams of three compete

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
in non-lethal magical combat!

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
The objective is to
secure the monolith

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
and transmit the
code hidden within!

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI]
I'm so sick of this!

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
All anyone cares about
is how the girls are doing!

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
So we need to win
this thing, got it?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Yeah, now that you mention it,

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
the girls have gone
undefeated in every event

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
that Tatsuya Shiba's worked on.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's insane.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
Dammit, this has
nothing to do with him!

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
The girls are talented!

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.195 position:50% align:center
That's all that's going on here!

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.156 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
Let the countdown commence!

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five...

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI gasps]

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI screams]
