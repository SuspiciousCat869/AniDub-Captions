Honoka, ready?

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Uh-huh.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Honoka? Shizuku?

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh? Hi! What's up?

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
Both of you seem like
you're in quite the hurry;

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
you going somewhere?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Uh, you could say that!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll see you later!

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Okay...

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Miyuki, but trust me;

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
we're doing this
for you and Tatsuya!

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I apologize.
I wasn't able to learn anything.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] You don't
need to apologize to me.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
I'm positive that
they're hiding something,

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
but I can't very well
go questioning them

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
without any proof.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
Still, I can't help
but be worried about them.

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
It'll be fine.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
Those two are
your friends, right?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
They'll open up to you
whenever they're ready.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
My friends?

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
[SAYAKA]
Mr. Shiba...

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
[SAYAKA]
Good to see you.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps it would be
more appropriate to say

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
nice to meet you.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.737 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I guess so.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you. Ms. Mibu
if I remember correctly?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.869 position:50% align:center
Sayaka Mibu, yes.
I'm in Class E, the same as you.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
I wanted to thank you for
saving me at the dojo.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to
thank you properly,

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
as well as talk to
you about something.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
Mind if we went somewhere
to chat for a bit?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.553 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I wonder... What could Ms. Mibu

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
have possibly wanted to
talk to my brother about?

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
[SAYAKA] U-Um...you see,
ever since we first met...

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
I've been in
lo-- l-lo-lov--

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
Stop it, Miyuki! What are
you doing to yourself?!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
I mean it's no surprise;

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.930 position:50% align:center
my brother is good looking,
so I suppose it only follows

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
that women would be
attracted to him...

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
But is it so much to ask

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
that when we're at home,
he belongs only to me?

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
I need to work harder

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
to become the kind of sister

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
who is truly worthy
of belonging to him.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
But...

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
I do want to make
his heart flutter a bit.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
Is this too cliché?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
No, this won't do at all!

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I look like
I'm on my way to a resort!

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
This is a bit much to
be wearing at home, isn't it?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
Now this looks like
something Erika would wear!

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Uh! Stomach!

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
Now, this is sure to
give him a jolt, right?

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for waiting, Brother.

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] What's going on?
It's not even New Year's.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
Oh, but, Big Brother,
just getting to be near you

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
and to spend time
alone together like this

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
is enough to make any day
feel like a holiday to me!

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI giggles]

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
That's laying it on too thick!

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
Talk about a disaster!

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
I'd only be subjecting him

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
to unnecessary
psychological pressure!

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is awful!

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to do?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps, yelps]

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
What happened? You okay?

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki...?

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI squeals]

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI whimpers, screams]

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
So, Tatsuya.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
I understand that you
met with Sayaka Mibu.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Is it true that
you verbally abused her

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
yesterday at the café?

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT COUNCIL]
Verbally abused?

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Details, Mari! More details!

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
Incorrect.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Oh? Is that so?

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
Because I have witnesses who say

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
they observed Mibu
blushing bright red

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
and looking embarrassed.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Verbal abuse?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Brother.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
What happened
between you and Ms. Mibu?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
Magic?! Without a CAD?

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
Wow, your interference power
must be awfully potent.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
I'm sorry! I was only teasing!

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
Relax, Miyuki.
I'll explain everything.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.782 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'm so sorry.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
As to your question,

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
it seems Ms. Mibu
reached out to thank me

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
for keeping her
safe at the dojo.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
But from what I could gather,
she's also extremely biased

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
against the
Disciplinary Committee.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
What is her problem with us?

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
She said the reason we came

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
down so hard on them
was to score points

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
and to make the
Committee look good.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
So that's how it is.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
I guess she really has it in
for us then, doesn't she?

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
I told Ms. Mibu she was
mistaken about our motives

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't
get her to listen me.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
For students disgruntled
with the status quo,

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
I suppose that a conspiracy
theory is comforting.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
Even if at the end of
the day it isn't true.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
The way she said that...

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Am I imagining things?
Or does she know something?

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
She also expressed that

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
she was disappointed
with the way students are

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
discriminated against on
the basis of magical ability.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA gasps]

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] She feels
non-magic-oriented clubs

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
are looked down on.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center
So they've united
and are planning

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
to present their
argument to the school

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
that magic isn't
the be all, end all.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
There is one thing
I'd like to ask you

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
if you'll permit me.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
So you present your
argument to the school.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.568 position:50% align:center
What's your plan after that?

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
She never ended up
giving me a direct answer,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
but all things considered,

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
she strikes me as someone too
far gone to change her mind.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
You may be right.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
But it's also possible

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
that Mibu could be under the
manipulation of someone else.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Now Ms. Watanabe
seems uncomfortable...

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
There's no question about it!

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
They know more than
they're letting on.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
So that must mean

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
Ms. Nakajo is feigning
ignorance to help sell it.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
By "somebody else,"
I assume you mean

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
an organization like
Blanche, for example?

00:07:58.728 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
How do you know that?

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's "Blanche"?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI, MARI]
Uh...

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
So she wasn't faking it!

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
No use keeping it
from you then I guess.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Our school has been infiltrated

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
by the international anti-magic
political organization

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
known as Blanche.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother, you knew!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
When I tried to get you to
open up about the attacks

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
and everything that's
been happening,

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
you were quick to
change the subject.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
You didn't want to talk to me.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
And I can't shake this thought
that I know the reason.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
My brother cherishes me.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
He would do anything in
the world to protect me.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
Even if it meant

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
allowing himself to
be hurt in my place.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I'm sorry.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
I can see now
that not telling you

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
only ended up worrying you more.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
Cabinet Name, open Blanche.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
"Blanche, an international

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
anti-magic political
organization."

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
On the surface,
they seem to help out

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
with grassroots campaigns,

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
but underneath the veneer,
they're terrorists.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
They advocate against
discrimination

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
and decry the fact
that competent magicians

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
receive superior
social standing.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
And yet they attacked you and
also attacked our school.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
Those unable to wield magic,

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
as well as those
of lesser skill,

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
become the organization's prey.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
They're mislead by propaganda--

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
radicalized against
the status quo.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
That's their modus operandi.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] So then, the reason
they targeted First High is...?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
Because they have
inferior grades in magic,

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
they're looked down upon
and regarded with contempt.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
And that's not just
the case at First High.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
It's a microcosm
of society as a whole.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
Blanche seeks to take
advantage of that.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
Whether for good or for evil,
magic is a power

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
like financial or
military might.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
But that power can never grow--

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.602 position:50% align:center
not in a society
that openly rejects it.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
In other words, you're saying
that by rejecting magic,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
they mean to make it obsolete,

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
thereby draining the country
of its power and influence.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
Could that actually be
Blanche's ultimate goal?

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Probably.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
But it goes without saying

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
that the Ten Master Clans
won't ignore this.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
Especially the Yotsubas.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Worst case,
they'll launch a purge

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
and it's not unlikely
we get dragged into it.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
No, dragged into it
would be an understatement.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
The Yotsubas... Our aunt...

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] It's very possible
that they'll use us as pawns

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
in whatever action they take.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
Revealing us to the Clans,

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
including the Saegusa
and Jumonji families.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
If that were to happen...

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
We wouldn't be able to remain

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
high-school students, would we?

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
We'd have no choice but to go
back to being Yotsubas. [cries]

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
You don't have to be afraid.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
No matter what,

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
I won't allow anyone to take
away the life we've created.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
Brother...

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] I mean it.
If push comes to shove,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of it all
myself before they can.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
The life we've built,

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
that you're working
so hard to protect

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
is important to me, too,
and I want to help.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
And when the time comes, I will.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
All right, ladies! We may
have different birthdays...

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
But our times of
death will match!

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
I'd like to abstain.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] The captain of the
Kendo Club, Kinoe Tsukasa.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
Although there's no question

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
that he's the one who attacked
Tatsuya the other day...

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] He still hasn't
shown his true colors.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
But today's gonna be the day!

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
We're gonna get our hands on
some proof that's irrefutable!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
Ready, Girls' Detective Club?

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
Mobilize!

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] We're acting more
and more like stalkers.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, HONOKA]
No, we're not!

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
Isn't that...?

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
It won't be long now before

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
we're out of the school's
surveillance camera range.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
Is it possible he's
heading home for the day?

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
I saw him coming to school

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
from the station this
morning, so I doubt it.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Very suspicious!
He's definitely up to something!

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
If I'm honest, I'm starting
to get a little worried.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
[EIMI chuckles]
Actually, I am, too!

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
Wait. You are?

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Needless to say,

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
our safety on this
mission isn't guaranteed.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
But we're all in this together.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, HONOKA]
Mm!

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
[KINOE] I've lured them
to the specified location.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
He's onto us!

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I guess we're going after him!

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, HONOKA gasp]

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center

you just made a big mistake.

Go!

[THUG 04A]
Grab them!

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] If you think we're just
normal high-school girls,

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Well, we...

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
It was your brother.
We saw him get attacked

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
at school the other
day out of nowhere.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] And we were
worried about telling you

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
because we didn't
know how you'd react...

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
So we thought it would be better

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
to try and catch the
attacker by ourselves...

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
We're sorry.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center

Thank you for trying
to help my brother!

I want you to know how grateful
I am to have you as my friends!

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] Was it a good idea to let
Miyuki take care of everything?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] She said she wanted
to handle it discreetly.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
To be fair, those guys
aren't really a match for her.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
She sure was amazing,
wasn't she?

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
All that Cast Jamming
and Miyuki didn't even flinch!

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
Her interference power
is totally out of this world!

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

Truly unbelievable.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
Like a Ten Master
Clans member...

[HONOKA]
Huh? Did you say something?

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
No, nothing.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Thank you for coming.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry to trouble
you like this, Mr. Yakumo.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
I have to admit,

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
it's a rare thing to
receive a call from you.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
If my instincts are correct,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
you'd like me to clean up,
and interrogate these thugs

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
before the police show up.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
You can see right through me,
can't you, Mr. Yakumo?

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
Are you so surprised?
I am a ninja.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
Or so I like to say.
Alas, I'm a fraud.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
After all, try as I might,
I can't find a shred

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
of information on you
or your brother...

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
Damn monsters!
You arrogant magicians

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
are gonna destroy
the whole world someday!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
But we've vowed to stop you
no matter what!

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
Would y'look at that?
Quite the fanatics, aren't they?

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
My, my...

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Defiant until the very end.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
I must say,

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
you have an awful lot of nerve
speaking like that to a monster.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
[THUG 04A] No! Stay away
from me, you monster!

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO] It looks like
that might have been

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
a little too potent.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn that
mental interferrance magic

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
was supposed to be your forte.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I have
no time to practice.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
I didn't hold back
as much as I wanted to.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
What's done is done.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
You can leave the rest to me.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
But get out of here
while you can.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
There's dirty work to be done.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
You know, I don't intend to stay
innocent through all of this.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
I'm sure Tatsuya would prefer

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
that you remained innocent.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
Mr. Yakumo, that's not fair!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
Why would you bring up my
brother's name like that?

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO chuckles]

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Mr. Yakumo? If you don't mind

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
there's one more thing
I'd like you to look into.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
Hm?

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
Regarding the perpetrator
who attacked my brother.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
He's a student
named Kinoe Tsukasa.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I'm guessing
those four never returned.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
No, they may have been captured.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
By the police?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
Were that the case,
we'd've heard about it by now.

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
Brother, I'm so sorry.
I'm in your debt.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Kinoe...
You don't need to apologize.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
However, we may
be at a crossroads.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
They won't listen to reason,

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
so we've no choice
but to change tactics.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
Then it's time?

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
Get the word out to all
our comrades at First High.

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
[COALITION MEMBER 04A]
Attention, students!

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
We represent a coalition
seeking to abolish

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
discrimination
within our school!

[GROUP gasps]

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
[COALITION MEMBER 04A]
As I'm sure you're well aware,

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
discrimination based
on magical ability

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
is a serious issue
at First High.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
Discrimination? What a moron!

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Blanche is making their move

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
a lot sooner than we thought.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
We need to do
something and fast.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
[COALITION MEMBER 04A]
It's no secret that

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
students of this school aspire
to become magicians.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
However, at the end of the day,
we are still students!

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
And our talent should
have no bearing on

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
whether we deserve respect!

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] They're going
about this the wrong way...

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
We'll never change this school
if they tear it down first.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
We demand a forum
with the Student Council

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
to discuss ending the
systemic discrimination

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:50.148 position:50% align:center
of half this
school's student body!

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center

[STUDENTS chatter]

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMO]
I looked into Kinoe Tsukasa.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
His family hails from
a line of <i>onmyoji</i> .

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
Turns out our actual person of
interest is his brother-in-law,

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
Hajime.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
Y'see, Kinoe's a puppet.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
The only reason he's enrolled at
First High is because of Hajime.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
And as for Hajime,

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
he happens to be in
charge of Blanche in Japan.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
This coalition may have
been formed by Kinoe,

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
but it's his brother-in-law

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
who's been pulling the
strings at every turn.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Be on your guards tomorrow.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
They may attempt
to provoke unrest.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Suppose it's time.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[MARI] My team'll be
watching your back out there.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hey, Miyuki...

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Take what I say to heart, okay?

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I'm sure you all heard
the broadcast two days ago,

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
and I am not here to deny
the allegations that were made.

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
Despite efforts on
the part of the school,

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
Student Council, and
Disciplinary Committee,

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
there remains a culture of
prejudice at this school.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
"Blooms" and "Weeds"...

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
"Weed" in particular is a slur

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
we've let become commonplace.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
There are Course Two students

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
who've resigned themselves
to that derogatory term

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
and have learned to accept it.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
And by doing nothing,
our school has been complicit.

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
Unless we acknowledge that,
we cannot move forward.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.358 position:50% align:center
So as First High's
Student Council President,

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
I want us to find a way to
break the stigma and be better.

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
So that every student can enjoy
three invaluable years here.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
And so we can build
a culture of compassion

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
to pass on to
the next generation.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
I pray we can.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
