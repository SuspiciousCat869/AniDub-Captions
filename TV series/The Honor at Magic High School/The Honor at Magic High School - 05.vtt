00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
We know the truth.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
You weren't the mastermind
behind today's incident.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
You were only a
pawn in their plan.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
If we can apprehend
the ringleaders,

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
we may be able to overlook the
actions of you and your cohorts.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're not suggesting...?

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
That that we try to
take on Blanche ourselves?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
That would be too reckless.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
We'd be going up against
an organization!

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
Shiba... Do you think
we'd have a chance?

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Jumonji, no way!

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
I think we have to.
This involves us now.

Whether we like it or not,

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
we can't just leave
this to someone else.

to destroy the lives

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
that Miyuki and I have created,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
I'll tear it apart
with my bare hands...

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center

Impossible!

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
Why isn't my Evil Eye
doing anything?

[MIYUKI] Hypnosis is
a gimmick and nothing more.

Whatever gave you the impression

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
it would have any
effect on my brother?

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing to bet that's
the same trick you used

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
as when you manipulated
Ms. Mibu's memories.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center

Yes.

The reason she hates our school

is Hajime Tsukasa.

would even

consider laying a hand
on my brother is an affront

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
you'll come to regret.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center

it's too much to ask

at all how it feels

to protect the life
that we've created.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
And so if he has the
will to stand and fight

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
for what he believes in,
then so do I!

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
[ERIKA] Oh! Hey! Have you
heard the news about Saya yet?

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
Saya... who?

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
You know, Ms. Mibu, right?

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we know she was let
off the hook after the incident,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
but afterwards...

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
With Mr. Kirihara?

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
Turns out they had a little
more in common than Kendo.

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Guess all that competitive
energy finally has an outlet.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Hey, Brother, you know what?

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
I want to follow you,
no matter where you go.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
Even if you were
to take to the sky

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
like a bird and soar
away into the great beyond.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
Or pierce through the heavens

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
and sail across the
stars like a comet.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't matter. I never want
to be away from your side.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
I think it would
be more accurate

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
to say that I'm the one who's
at risk of being left behind.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
But right now we need to
keep our feet on the ground.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
The heavens will have
to wait a little longer.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
If it means preserving
the life I share with you...

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
I would do anything--
anything at all for you.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing
that matters to me.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
And that, Miyuki, is that
you're always smiling.

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Always! I am so lucky
to be your sister!

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
And if that's what
truly matters to you most,

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
then I'll go on smiling forever,

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
and I promise I'll always be
right here beside you.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
We'll savor every
waking moment together

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
as we journey, hand in hand,
toward a hopeful tomorrow.

00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:25.261 position:50% align:center
[FENCER 05A gasps]

00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:27.138 position:50% align:center
That's our Airi.

00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:29.015 position:50% align:center
No surprise really. After all,

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:32.852 position:50% align:center
Éclair Airi is a member of the
distinguished Isshiki family.

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.521 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Hmph.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.651 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Uh, first place!
And it's a First year!

00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:41.986 position:50% align:center
Toko Tsukushiin!

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.533 position:50% align:center
[giggles] What do you know?
I win again!

00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:52.956 position:50% align:center
Is she for real?

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
She not only perfectly
targets the clay,

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.584 position:50% align:center
but all of the fragments, too?

00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:59.295 position:50% align:center
That girl's awareness
of space is off the charts!

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:01.089 position:50% align:center
How do you even...?

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:03.383 position:50% align:center
Shiori Kanou!

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.136 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Of course I'll be tapped for

00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:08.888 position:50% align:center
the Nine Schools Competition.
That much is a given.

00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:11.266 position:50% align:center
Why they make such
a big deal out of it?

00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:13.935 position:50% align:center
Just strikes me as
shallow, honestly.

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:15.603 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
That just means they envy you.

00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:17.522 position:50% align:center
Let's face it, girl,
you're talented.

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.315 position:50% align:center
Take it as a compliment!

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:20.859 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] It's painfully
obvious there isn't

00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:24.029 position:50% align:center
a single student here at
Third High who can beat Airi.

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:27.032 position:50% align:center
Nor at any other magic
high school, I'd wager.

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.326 position:50% align:center
It's not that surprising.
I am an Isshiki.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.412 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] So there's the
three of us, obviously,

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:34.456 position:50% align:center
and then for the boys,
we've got Cardinal George

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
and Ichijo, the Crimson Prince.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] I don't see any factors
that would cause us to lose.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] You wanna know who's
gonna defeat First High

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
and win this year's
Nine Schools Competition?

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.217 position:50% align:center
We are. Third High School!
