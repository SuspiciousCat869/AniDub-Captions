Okay. Thank you, Big Brother.

[MIYUKI] I guess he's
just not that interested

in looking at me.

I'm starting high
school in the spring,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.718 position:50% align:center
but he still sees me as a child.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
And here I thought that
I'd filled out enough to notice.

it's almost my--

almost your birthday, isn't it?

be special to me, I promise!

Nope. Where's the fun in that?

...that we aren't
boyfriend and girlfriend.

we're nothing more than
two ordinary students.

only be the case

until my brother's birthday.

To hope for something
more between us...

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center

Would it be inappropriate of me

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
to show off this much skin?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center

for my brother...!

Of course, but that was a meal.
That wasn't your present.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
I've got something
else in mind for that.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
Oh, but if there's
something you'd like,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
don't be shy to tell me.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
More than what you've
already done for me?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
Miyuki...

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Miyuki, would you
mind if we stopped in here?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hmm?

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.883 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI sighs]

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'm a disgrace.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
What an indecent,
awful mind I have...

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki?

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
What's this?

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
Ya like it?
Why don't you try it on?

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
[SHOPPERS murmur]

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
It looks beautiful on you!

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
I have to say, it looks
like it was made just for you!

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll find us a mirror.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Oh, that won't be necessary.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
The only thing I care about is
how you feel about it, Brother.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
I think it looks
great on you, Miyuki.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
Well, would it be all right if
I asked you to buy it for me?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Of course. I was the
one who asked you to try it on.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
But are you sure that
this is the one you want?

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Of course I'm sure.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
After all, you picked
it out for me yourself.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Right.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Getting to spend
this time with my Brother

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
and do so many special
things together...

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
Today truly has been
the happiest day of my life.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI giggles]

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, If you don't mind
I've been wanting to ask;

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
Why did this particular hair
ornament catch your eye?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
Well, from the standpoint
of Magic Geometry,

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
it struck me as having
been very well made.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
All things considered,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
it's possible that it was
designed by a renowned Magician.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
Do you really think so?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
I can't say that I'm able to
sense any magical power from it.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
I would never let
you wear something

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
if I thought that
it was dangerous.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
As we both know,
magic can be quite volatile.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Yes, it can...

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Is everything
all right, Brother?

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
S'the head family.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]
The Yotsubas?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
[EXPERIMENTAL SPECIMEN 01A]
They all look down on me...

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
So I'll burn them to ash.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
Every last one of them!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
I'm being summoned by
the Magicians' Association.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Of all possible days, why today?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Well, the Association
is in the same building...

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
It's out of your control.
I understand.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
So don't worry
about me--just go.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I'm sorry.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
I'll try not to be long... Just
wait for me here, all right?

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Sure.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
I'll be waiting for you.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] My brother was
summoned by Maya Yotsuba,

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
head of the Yotsuba Clan,
part of the Ten Master Clans.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
She's our aunt.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
A member of the Ten Master Clans
can never refuse the call.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
But to see Brother used
as a pawn like this...

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
[HAYAMA]
Master Tatsuya.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for summoning you
here on such short notice.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
Mr. Hayama.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
It's no trouble at all.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
But still, why would my aunt

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
choose to involve
her head butler?

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Is the matter that important?

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
A political inconvenience
and nothing more,

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
but one that is suited to
your particular skill set.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
In any event,

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
I've been dispatched
to tie up any loose ends

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
and clean up after you've
completed your task.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
A political inconvenience

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
that requires cleanup, huh?

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
In other words, the SDF.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
The target is a magician

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
that's undergone
reinforced experiments?

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
See for yourself.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
Serious enough we're
using hard copies?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
Oscillation-type...

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
So it looks like he's a magician

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
whose Heat aptitude
has been reinforced.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
Although he underwent
reinforcements when he was 15,

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
his skills proved to be useless

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
outside of a combat situation
and so he was abandoned.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
And while he languished
for more than 30 years,

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
it seems he finally snapped.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] A failed experiment
who could have been a hero.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
All right. Where did
the target escape to?

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
I didn't see any sort of action
predictions in his file.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
He's here... as we speak.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
What did you say?!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
As luck would have it,

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
the subject sought
payback for what he sees

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
as having had his life
ruined by the Association.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
We anticipate in an
attempt to garner attention,

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
he'll cause a scene,
somewhere in Bay Hills Tower.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.745 position:50% align:center

He's planning something here?

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center

If there's a fire,

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
the sprinklers should
turn on and extinguish it.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

Not good...

this is no ordinary fire.

There's no question.

someone using their magic

[MIYUKI]
It's unforgivable.

The duty of a magician is to
wield their gift responsibly.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
Preserving that trust
is what allows us

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
You just picked a fight
with someone who's

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
undergone reinforcements!

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
That's right! You're looking
at an upper-level Magician!

What's with that look
in your eyes?!

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA cries]
Mommy, where are you?

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
[sniffs] I want my mommy!

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No!

You're safe now.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
We'll find your mother.

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
Just be brave a little
longer, all right?

How?! Don't tell
me that this is

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
area interference?!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
Using your magic for arson,

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
and attacking an innocent child.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
And now, you filth...
How dare you?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
You destroyed the hair ornament
that my brother gave me!

Even if magic doesn't

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
work on you, this will!

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
[gun clicks]

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Did you think that
bullets would work against me?

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
I've already suppressed
all flammable phenomena.

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
Explosives cannot
be ignited now.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
[EXPERIMENTAL SPECIMEN 01A]
Wait, are you--?

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're a real
upper-level Magician?!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
We're done.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
[EXPERIMENTAL SPECIMEN 01A]
Stop! Please!

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
--[TATSUYA] Miyuki!
--[MIYUKI gasps] Brother!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.220 position:50% align:center
Miyuki, we're getting
out of here now.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
Even for an emergency,
that was too much of a display

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
this close to a Magicians'
Association branch.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
The magic surveillance
network around here

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.356 position:50% align:center
is a lot more dense
than it is in the city.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
We'll talk later. Come on!

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I've dissembled the footage
from the surveillance system,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
and while as far as I can tell
there weren't any witnesses,

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
we'll have to ask our
aunt to monitor the internet.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Don't worry about it.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
Aunt Maya won't
give us any trouble.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
But--

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
Turns out my summons today

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
was so that our Aunt could
assign that man as a target.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
So if we ask her to cover it up,
we won't owe her anything.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
At any rate,
Mr. Hayama's already here.

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
But if he's here, then...

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Hey, you did well back there.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] The fact that you were
willing to use your magic

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
to save everyone,

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
even if it meant possibly
blowing your cover--

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
as your brother, I couldn't
be more proud of you.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
Big Brother...

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
[FIREFIGHTER 01A]
All right, we're clear!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER 01A]
Momoka!

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Mommy!

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
[MOMOKA]
Big Sister!

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Bye!

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI chuckles]

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
Is that--?

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
We don't know who's listening.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
But you're not supposed to--

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
It's an inorganic
object, it can't suffer pain.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
So there's nothing
wrong with rewinding it.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
Let's try again.
Happy Birthday to you, Miyuki.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
Oh, Brother... Thank you!

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
Imagine receiving such
a beautiful present twice...

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
I promise you
I'll treasure it forever!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
A Co-conspirator?

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
[HAYAMA] Yes. It seems
the man in question

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
was radicalized by an
anti-magic organization.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] If I recall, they refer
to themselves as "Blanche."

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Master Tatsuya
was able to take care

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
of the situation
before it escalated.

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
[MAYA]
Come, let's not kid ourselves.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
We both know that it was
Miyuki who did the actual work.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
And I suppose, since the
results were satisfactory,

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't benefit me
to go voicing any objections,

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
now would it?

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
I will delete
any footage I find.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
We need to keep Miyuki's
identity safe, after all.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Keep a close eye on any
video sites for uploads.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
I will see to it at once.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
Incidentally, will you
be admonishing Ms. Miyuki?

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
That won't be
necessary this time.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
[HAYAMA]
Hm.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
[MAYA] However, if she continues
to be a cause for concern,

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
I don't care if
she is my niece--

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
I'll have no choice but
to do something about her.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI giggles]

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Say hello to First High's

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
most promising new freshman.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[MARI] I can't believe you
spotted her in that.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] For some reason,

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
the only images available
were heavily obscured.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
I doubt anyone other than me
could have picked her out!

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
It is reassuring, isn't it?

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
Knowing that a girl like her

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
is going to be attending
high school with us soon?

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
You're going to have her join
the Student Council, aren't you?

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
Traditionally,
all the top freshmen do.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a shame.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
I was kinda hoping
I could recruit her

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
to join the
Disciplinary Committee.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
You know, I hear there's going
to be a boy joining us, too,

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
who is right
around the same age.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
If he's at all as
impressive as she is,

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
you know I'm dragging him into
my committee by force,

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Magic--the stuff
of fables and fairy tales.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
At the start of the 21st century

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
it was systemized as
an actual technology.

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
Every nation in the world

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
is engaged in a race
to develop magicians.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
And here in Japan,

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
nine magic high schools
have been established.

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
The very fact

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
you've been permitted to
enroll at one of these schools

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
means you have a rare talent for
magic and incredible potential.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
However...

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
Miyuki.

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
Good luck with your class
representative's speech.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
Thank you! I'll do my best!

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
At the National Magic

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:05.575 position:50% align:center
University Affiliated
First High School,

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.828 position:50% align:center
the school my brother and I
are going to be attending,

00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
from the moment you enroll,

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
you're either a "Bloom"
or you're a "Weed."

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.045 position:50% align:center
This is unacceptable!
