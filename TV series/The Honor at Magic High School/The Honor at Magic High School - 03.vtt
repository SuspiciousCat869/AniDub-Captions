00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
That Tatsuya's
a Course Two student?

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
Bother me? Why would it?

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
That custom is completely
ridiculous if you ask me.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
The whole "Bloom
and Weed" thing?

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
Stereotyping people based on a
single test score is idiotic!

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
Just think about it!
We're all First High students!

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
--[HONOKA chuckles]
--[SHIZUKU] Mm.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] A first-year Course Two
on the Disciplinary Committee.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
He's talented,
and if I'm honest...

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] ...quite handsome.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
Uh, Eimi!

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
Wait, I've got it!

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Whoever is behind this crime
must be jealous of him!

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Someone blinded by their envy,

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
who will stop at nothing until
he's destroyed!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
Well, what do ya think?
Doesn't that make sense?

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
Launching a surprise attack
out of jealousy is cowardly!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
It's shameful!

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
It's unthinkable.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
It's up to us to put
a stop to this injustice!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, Honoka,
what are we gonna do about it?

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
Um, report it to
the Student Council?

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
Although we don't
have any proof...

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Also, if we bring this
up with the Student Council,

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
Miyuki will hear about it, too.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
So?

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
If she finds out that
Tatsuya was targeted,

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
we'll be doomed.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
Remember what she did just
because someone badmouthed him?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what
she'd do this time?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
What?! Do you mean to tell me

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
that Miyuki's really
that terrifying?!

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
How can we protect Tatsuya
but keep it from Miyuki?

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
I mean there is one way.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
We just need to resolve
this ourselves, right?

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
What?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] It means that
if we catch the culprit--

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
if we can just handle it
before Miyuki finds out,

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
then it's no harm no foul!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but--

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
When you say "we"
do you mean...?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
<i>Yes</i> !

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
It'll be you, me, and Shizuku!

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
Say hello to the new
Girls' Detective Club!

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?!

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
A high-school mystery!

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
It's always been a dream of
mine to do something like this!!

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
She's really into this...

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] So you're saying you
were unable to provoke him

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
into using his
pseudo jamming trick?

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, Hajime.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
I was sure that if we were able
to catch him off guard,

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
he would activate it
as a failsafe.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
But now it seems that
a far more direct approach

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
may be necessary this time.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
With any luck,

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
we may be able to win
him over to our side.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
[KINOE]
Right.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
We'll leave that to Sayaka Mibu.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
She seems like an appropriate
choice for that task.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] So we keep eyes
on Miyuki's brother

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
and if we get photos
of him being attacked,

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
we have our proof, got it?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Does anyone see Tatsuya?

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He's over by
the lab building.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh? Oh! I see him!

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Now that I think about it,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
we're acting like stalkers.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
--[EIMI] Eh?
--[HONOKA] What?

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] No, we're not!
What are you talking about?!

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] Yeah! We're
just being detectives!

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
No way does this
count as stalking!

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Wait!

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Signs of a Psion Wave!

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Huh? It just vanished!

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
Do you think that was
cast jamming just now?

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
No question about it.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it's strange.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem like Miyuki's
brother was using any antinite.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
He wasn't, was he?

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
Look! It's the attacker!

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
He's under the tree
to the right!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grunts]

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
[sighs] No... I won't reach him.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Eimi! Are
you getting any photos?

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Why didn't anybody remind me?!

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
D'ya get anything?

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
No idea...

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
Did a new club activities
report come in?

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
Uh, yes.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
It's regarding that incident
at the dojo the other day.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
Is that all it is?
You look so despondent.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
If something is
bothering you, tell me.

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
Bothering's an understatement...

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
Kirihara...

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
You're saying that you sensed

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
the purpose of Mibu's
swordsmanship was changing.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
Do I understand you correctly?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
She became violent.
It was no longer a sport to her.

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
And then it struck me.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
What if somebody
on the team corrupted her?

00:18:55.844 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
After that I knew,
I had to say something.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
If what Kirihara said is true

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
and Mibu was
somehow manipulated,

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid it would mean

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
that somebody else
is responsible.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
Someone with ties to the school.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
The attack on my brother,
and before that,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
the incident at the dojo.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
Mayumi, what in the world
is happening at this academy?

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI grunts]

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Brother?

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
Has anything unusual
happened since we last spoke?

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
Nothing. It's been routine.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
By the way...

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
Would you mind telling
me a little bit about

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
two of your classmates?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
Specifically, Ms. Mitsui
and Ms. Kitayama.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] My brother is showing
interest in other girls?!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
Miyuki?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Uh! What, pray tell,
were you hoping to learn?

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
They're ordinary girls, right?

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.109 position:50% align:center
Any abnormal tendencies?

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
T-T-Tendencies?

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
What I mean is,

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
can the two of them be
trusted to act sensibly?

00:19:58.073 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
I-I don't see any
reason why not...

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
Unless--!

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me! Have those two
been causing you trouble?!

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
It's not like that at all.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Relax.

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
Reason I ask is lately they've
been watching me on my patrols

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
from afar and I was
curious what they were after.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
Wait, they've been watching you?

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
They have, yes, along with
this girl with bright red hair.

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
I think she's from Class 1B?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
Her name is Eimi Akechi.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
So the three of them
have been spying on you?

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Seems so. That and
taking photographs.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
Photographs?
Of you, Big Brother?

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Why am I jealous?! No!

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
Such vulgar thoughts!

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
But still, I want
those photos so bad!

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
No. They're not photos of me.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
It seems like they've
been gathering information

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
on the person who's
been messing with me.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
You don't mean

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
that someone is
still targeting you?

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I don't know what came over me.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
So anyway, thus far I haven't
suffered any real harm,

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
but I find myself wondering
what their endgame is.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
I just hope
whoever's behind this

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
is out to be a high-school
bully and nothing more.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I worry about
getting too involved.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
No, I'm overthinking it...

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Honoka, Shizuku, Eimi...

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
What on earth are you
trying to accomplish?

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Check this out!

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA gasps]

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] This guy's for sure
the attacker from yesterday!

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
No question!

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Agreed.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
His name's Kinoe
Tsukasa of Class 3F...

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
The captain of
the boys' kendo team?

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
That's who attacked Tatsuya?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.404 position:50% align:center
I'm in! And for
Miyuki's sake, too!

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] Right! We'll catch
him no matter what!

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
Working together!

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Eimi!

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Honoka!

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Huh? Uh...

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:13.249 position:50% align:center
[EIMI, HONOKA]
The Girls' Detective Club!

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
--[EIMI, HONOKA] Ready... go!
--[SHIZUKU] Go!
