[ANNOUNCER 07A] It's day four
of the Nine Schools Competition!

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50% align:center
Today marks the start
of the Rookie events!

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
Up first will be the
qualifying rounds for

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
the Speed Shooting event!

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
Wh-What's going on?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
Does she have air mines
set up or something?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
No idea!
Never seen this before!

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
[THIRD HIGH STUDENTS murmur]

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
Shiori, any idea what
sort of tactic she's using?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
It appears Ms. Kitayama
divides the field

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.054 position:50% align:center
up into multiple zones,

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
then activates area-of-effect
Oscillation Magic

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
wherever the clay intersects.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
Wonder how things would play
out if she competed against you.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
Not well.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.105 position:50% align:center
Her use of this tactic

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
indicates to me that Ms.Kitayama
struggles with precision.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
The difficulty
ramps up from here.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
In the finals, you'll be dealing
with two types of clay.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
Which means

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
an even higher degree of
mastery is required to accel.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Perfect.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.085 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Precision is my specialty.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.253 position:50% align:center
I need only run
a few calculations

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
and I can render her
magic completely useless.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.892 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kitayama of First
High School, I presume.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.143 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
My name is Shiori Kanou
of Third High School.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, too.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.776 position:50% align:center
I hear that you're
extremely talented.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
I look forward to competing
against you in the semifinals.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Interesting.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.575 position:50% align:center
The implication being you don't
intend to lose before then.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI chuckles]

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.123 position:50% align:center
Very well. I'll be looking
forward to it. Semifinals it is.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
This is for you, Airi.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.054 position:50% align:center
I promise I won't let you down.
No matter what.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
Secondary, ready.
Tertiary calculated.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
What in the world?!

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
She's using Oscillation Magic
to destroy the first target,

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
but then somehow all
the exploding fragments

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
hit everything else. What gives?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
A Movement Spell maybe?

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
Meaning that she knows
where all the fragments are?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
And then targets
them individually?

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
No way. it's hard enough to
zero in on a single target.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
How the heck can she calculate

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
and direct every
single fragment at once?

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
Impossible! You'd need a
supercomputer to do that!

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me
that's what she's doing?!

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
It looks like her accuracy
is sharper than ever.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
She's exceeded my expectations
for as long as I've known her.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
[AIRI gasps]

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Don't give up.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
Challenge yourself to aim
higher and put in the work.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] After all, the view is
much better from up here.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
And she has put in the work.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
She honed her spatial
recognition and calculation

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
skills at the Kanazawa
Magical Physics Institute.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
In doing so,

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
she developed special eyesight
that allows her to interpret

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
anything she sees as numerical
formulas applicable to magic.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
As a result, Shiori
can predict anything,

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
including the trajectories of
every seemingly random particle.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
Sub-target
predictions calculated.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] This magic belongs to
Shiori alone and has no equal.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
Her ability to formulate
such beautiful and flawless

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
calculations,
rivals any supercomputer,

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
and acts as her ultimate weapon.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
Arithmetic Chain!

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI]
I've analyzed the magic

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kitayama employed
in the quarterfinals.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
In order to make her
clay targets easier to hit,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
she uses Convergence
Magic to increase

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
their density mid-flight and
draw them into one another.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI]
Like that.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
As you can see, it also
repels her opponent's targets

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
making them harder to hit.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
As we both know,
specialized CADs,

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
like those used
in Speed Shooting,

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
can store up to nine
activation sequences.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
It seems that Ms. Kitayama
was using them separately,

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
which threw off her opponent,
giving her an advantage.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
Of course, I guess
you'd have no trouble

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.837 position:50% align:center
handling all of the
sequences, correct?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI chuckles]

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Look at that!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
Her opponent's clay
is being scattered!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
It looks like
Shizuku's plan is working!

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
No. It's not...

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Just watch.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
She still hit them even though
they're all over the place?

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
Does that mean she nullified
Shizuku's magic?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Shizuku's doing amazing,

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
but Ms. Kanou is racking up
points at a faster clip!

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
No way!

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Shizuku Kitayama...

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
Your mother is a
world-renowned magician,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
and your father
is a man of means.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
You grew up privileged
to have a support system

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
that nurtured your talents.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
Your life has been the
complete opposite of mine.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
My family lost its number
and fell into ruin.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
And my parents fought nonstop.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
Back then, I just wanted to
walk away from everything

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
and give up.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
It was that hand, her hand,

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
that guided me
back into the light.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
The moment I took that hand,
I made up my mind.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
I would never let myself
go back to that place again.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
I would move forward toward
victory by Airi's side!

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] This doesn't look
promising, does it, Mari?

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
No...

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
Shizuku...

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]
Hey, it's going to be al right.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
I mean, you remember
who's engineering for Shizuku,

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
don't you? [giggles]

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
There's no way my brother

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
doesn't have a counter
measure in place for this.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Something's wrong.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
I'm more exhausted
than I should be.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
It's a given that
Arithmetic Chain

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
can be a fairly draining
spell to utilize,

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
but based on my simulations
of Kitayama's tactics,

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
it should be optimally adjusted.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
So, why?

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI gasps]

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Wait a minute!

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU chuckles]

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
This isn't good, is it, George?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
No...

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
Ms Kitayama's CAD
makes no sense!

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
Unless... Is it generalized?!

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
As I predicted they assumed

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
it was specialized and
strategized accordingly.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
that's a generalized unit

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
with added sights that was only
recently unveiled in Germany.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
It can store up to
99 activation sequences.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
So unless she has counter
measures ready for all 99...

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
This match is mine!

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
How'd that miss?!

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
It makes sense now!

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
A specialized CAD would never
be able to handle that much.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Even so, weren't there
strict limits placed on

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
the output levels of spells
cast during the quarter finals?

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
So was she deliberately using
fewer activation sequences?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
It must've been her plan from
the start to throw us off.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
To make us think
it was specialized.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
That way we'd only counter
nine activation sequences!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
You're saying she has
99 activation sequences!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
That's so completely
overdesigned...

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Someone actually
came up with this.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
A plan that hinges on a cutting-
edge generalized CAD...

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI] Meaning the player
would have to have insane

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
magical skills to compensate
for the slower speed,

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
so we'd mistake her device
for a specialized CAD.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
What an ambitious strategy,
and it caters to her strengths!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
Could it be that First High

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
is hiding an
engineer that talented?

[MASAKI] Kanou may not
understand what's happening yet,

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
but it's as if she's
running back and forth

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
across a tennis court
with every shot.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
She can't last much longer.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
I refuse to allow myself to fail

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
when I've come all this way!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
No! Not after everything
I've been through!

[SHIORI]
I don't wanna go back!

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to be by her side!

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.961 position:50% align:center

to the final!

here are the final results
for all participants.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
[THIRD HIGH BOY 07A]
First High is placing

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
so much higher than we expected.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
[THIRD HIGH BOY 07B]
Who could anticipate them

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
sweeping the Women's
Speed Shooting events

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
in both divisions
the way they did?

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
[THIRD HIGH GIRL 07A]
The real blow was having

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.481 position:50% align:center
Kanou finish fourth somehow,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
when she was supposed to
be a lock to win!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Shiori, the opponent you faced

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
in battle for third place
was someone you should've

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
been able to beat in your sleep.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
So what is it that caused you
to make so many mistakes?

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
[KICHIJOJI]
Kanou and Ms. Kitayama

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
were similarly talented.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
However, after
watching that match,

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Masaki and I are in agreement.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
Yeah. First High's
got a beast of an engineer.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
Someone who's
upgraded their tech

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
by several generations.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
Point being, their
victory was no fluke.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
How exciting is this?

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
What an accomplishment!
Who'd have thought

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
First High would sweep
the podium like that?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
We have our amazing
team to thank for that.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
That may be part of it,
but it's without question

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
that your talents acted
as a force multiplier.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI] Right! I never would've
thought in a 1,000 years

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
I'd come as far as I have!

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
We're glad to have you
on our side, Tatsuya.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] My new Speed Shooting
spell, Active Air Mine,

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
never would've
seen the light of day

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
if it hadn't been for you.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
Hey, I was only doing my job.
I mean I am your engineer.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
Aw, what a modest boy!

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
they're entering Active Air Mine

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
into the Magic Index!

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
Isn't it wild that you got to
debut it?

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
And it was developed
right here by Tatsuya!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Wait, what?! That's crazy!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Aw! Our little Tatsuya's going
to be famous after this!

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. He's supposed
to be our secret weapon!

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
No. I didn't credit myself.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
It's registered under
Ms. Kitayama's name.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Acting too modest can
make you sound arrogant.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
No. That's not what I'm doing.

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
I just would rather
not feel the humiliation

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
of not being able to
cast my own spells.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
That's all that this is about.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] Shiori? I know
you're there. Can we talk?

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] Of course I lost.
I was never good enough.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
It was really only
a matter of time

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
before I let everyone down...

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
All I ever wanted was
for Airi to be proud of me.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Just forget about me...

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
Hey, quit being so pathetic!

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired
of this, Shiori!

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
How many times do I
have say I believe in you?!

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
When are you gonna
get it together

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
and believe in
yourself for a change?!

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
Well, this isn't good.

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
I doubt that my
purification ritual

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
would work on her in that state.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[AIRI] I've never
seen Shiori like this.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to worry

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
that we might have to find
someone to take her place.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
Don't work yourself up;
it won't come to that!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
No?

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
My gut feeling is
she's gonna be fine!

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
Well then,
if that's your gut feeling,

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
then I suppose
I'll hold out hope.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center

to go out there any minute now!

Shizuku's match this morning,

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
so I wasn't even
thinking about it!

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center

[HONOKA] This girl...
Isn't she from Third High?!

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
Is she a spy? Is she
trying to sabotage me?

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
we still don't know

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center

Hm!

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
worry about me.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
There won't be any accident.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Did I say that out loud?

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
You have no reason
to be nervous.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
Trust me. Long as
you give it your all,

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
you'll breeze through
the qualifying rounds!

Thank... you?

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
Listen. I felt
like being helpful,

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
and you look like you
needed the encouragement!

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
No, she just wanted to
chat with me for a bit.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.941 position:50% align:center
She's from Third High,
isn't she?

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
She is. But more than that,

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center

That magic... Who is she?!

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
She's a Tsukushiin--a family of
Shinto-type Ancient Magic users.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
Their roots trace
to a great Shinto Clan.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
Right, and just as
the name implies,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
they're extremely adept
at water-related magic.

Toko is a formidable
opponent, yes,

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
she can't be defeated.

Wow. Everyone's working so hard.

I guess Miyuki's been busy
with the Student Council.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
I hope she's finding
time to practice.

[MIYUKI] I'm leaving myself
in your hands, Brother!

your heart into this, huh?

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
Huh? T-T-Tatsuya?!

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA yells]

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA gasps, yelps]

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Sorry...

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA gasps]
N-N-No! I'm fine! I-It's okay!

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
I really didn't mean
to scare you like that.

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
Is there anything I can
do to make it up to you?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
Something that...
that would make it up to me?

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] I'm leaving myself
in your hands, Tatsuya!

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Honoka...

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
No! Stop it brain!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
I did not ask for
this daydream right now!

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA squeals]

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I'm so conflicted.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I'm in
the Nine Schools Competition.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.300 position:50% align:center
I'm not nearly as
talented as Shizuku,

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
much less your sister.
And we've already seen

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
just how incredible
all the athletes

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
from the other schools are.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
If you're worried about that,
this'll help you.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
At the very start of your
first Battle Board match

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
I want you to use this spell.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
Huh? You want me
using Light Magic?

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
In the past, no player
has been successful

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
using Light Magic
as interference.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
But I think you can
change that, Honoka.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] This particular
spell was designed

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.117 position:50% align:center
with your affinity in mind

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
and should lean
into your strengths.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
It's a spell made just for you;
you can be proud of it.

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA gasps]
You made a spell just for me?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
All right, I've got this.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
On your marks...

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
[buzzer beeping]

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
[BATTLE BOARD PLAYERS gasp]

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
[BATTLE BOARD PLAYERS yelp]

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA chuckles]

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Nothing can stop me.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
Not with Tatsuya on my side

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
and the amazing spell
he made for me!

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
This is my spell
and no one elses!

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
All right! Tatsuya! I did it!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll be!

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Who knew that nervous girl

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
would have such a neat
trick up her sleeve!

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to go up
against her in the final!

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A] We will
now announce the athletes

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
participating in
tomorrow's events.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
Shiori...

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
Regarding tomorrow's
Ice Pillars Break...

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.984 position:50% align:center
I can't let you compete
in the condition you're in.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
You would be a liability
to the rest of the team.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
That wouldn't be
fair to them or you.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'm replacing
you on the roster.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
I see.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
[AIRI grunts]

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
[AIRI]
This is your last chance.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
If you still care at all
about being a part of this team,

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
then show up at the strategy
tent tomorrow at six A.M.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
Don't bother waiting for me.
I've decided I'm done.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
I'm disappointed in you.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
Do whatever you want!

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
I'm selfish...

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
Airi deserves a partner
who is talented,

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.066 position:50% align:center
not someone who
can't do the one thing

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
they're supposed to be good at.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
She has no use for me
and my lack of talent.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
Shiori, do you have a minute?

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Ms. Mizuo, I'm so sorry...

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
Do you hate me?

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
Of course I don't.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
Actually, I was
hoping we could talk.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI grunts]
Why? There's nothing to say.

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
Hey. You've known Airi
for how long now?

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
Since Junior High School?

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
You met at a fencing
match, right?

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
She used to believe in me.
She lifted me up.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
And I let her down in return.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
As much as she did for you,

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
you lifted her up, too.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
I did?

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO chuckles]
Airi and I...

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
We go way back. Our families
have known each other forever.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
She's always been
talented and proud.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
And her family status set
her apart from others.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
As a result, she's always
struggled to make friends.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
But then, one day, Airi met you.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
She was so thrilled to
have found someone with

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
the drive to challenge her.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
That was the first time I'd
ever seen Airi looking so happy.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
And the truth is, Airi
wouldn't be who she is today

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
without having had you
in her life as a friend.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO] It's just that...
she's really bad at saying it,

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean she isn't
worried to death about you.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
Airi could have replaced you a
lot sooner, but chose not to.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
why that might have been?

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on, now.
Just think about it.

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
If you're willing
to give up after one loss,

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
you're not going to get
very far as a magician.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
Setbacks are normal. You just
gotta keep moving forward.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
Forward...

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
Airi's under pressure, too.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
I mean she is an Ishiiki,
but she still gives her best

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
no matter what.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
That mindset is why
I know she'll succeed.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
Ms. Mizuo...

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
Just focus on giving your best.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.519 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
It's past six. You're late.

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] I'm sorry to have
made you worry about me.

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
I'm all right now.
