00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A] We return to
the Nine Schools Competition!

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
Today, we continue with
our Women's Battle Board

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
and Ice Pillars Break
Rookie Event matches!

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
Eimi! You got this!

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Just one more win,

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
and then I'm through
to the finals.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
Miyuki and Shizuku
have already made it!

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
So I've got to give
it my best shot!

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
And every shot here counts!

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
Oh, interesting.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
When she moves her pillars,

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.950 position:50% align:center
she alters their phenomena
preventing any changes.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
Which explains why I'm unable
to affect them with magic

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50% align:center
once they're in flight.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd try countering
with something like that!

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
All right! Nice one!

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Keep it going, Eimi!
Bring us home!

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
Too early to tell.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
Think about it. We have to
assume that Third High's

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
been studying Eimi's strategy.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
Hope you're ready!

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
All according to plan.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
Shiori's off to a great start.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's nice to see
her back to normal.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
What the--? I don't get
why that didn't work...

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
Those pillars should've
fallen over and shattered,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
but instead they slid together!

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
I see. What a brilliant move.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
She reduced her pillars'
friction coefficient to zero.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
It worked!

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
Right before the collision
with her opponent's pillar,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
she minimizes the coefficient
of friction of her own pillar.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
Then, the instant her
three pillars have stacked,

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
she increases the coefficient
of friction to the max.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
It's a maneuver that requires

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
incredible calculations
and precision.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
Only Kanou could have
pulled it off.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
I've rendered Ms. Akechi's
only strategy useless.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
So it's time to
finish this match.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Airi...

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
For so long I felt trapped; a
prisoner of my family's legacy.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
I thought it was all I deserved.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
But you... You taught me
that I had the power to decide

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
for myself what mattered.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
I'm done letting
others define me.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
From now on,
I do this on my own terms.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
Just watch, Airi!

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
Wh-What do I do?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[EIMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Amelia?

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Amelia.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
Amelia, listen closely...

00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why am I thinking
of that right now?

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
And why can't I remember
what came after that?

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
What did Grandma
tell me that day?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
I overestimated
First High's engineer.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
This is a disappointment.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI yelps]
She's done for!

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Not yet.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
There's no way my brother
hasn't planned for this.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
Be patient.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
As it stands, they have us
beat in terms of control.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
But then again, "control" isn't
your specialty, is it, Eimi?

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
Is this the limit
of what I can do?

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
Guess so...

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
And after everything
I've done to get here.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
I hope everyone
can forgive me...

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
But still...

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Forget that.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look at Eimis Psions!

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
I can't give up! I won't!

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
Not yet!

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
No way! Since when is she
capable of a move like that?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
What did... I just do?

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
[EIMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Amelia...

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
[EIMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Well, it would appear

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
that you've lost again.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] Yeah. I came
really close though!

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Maybe next time!

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
[EIMI'S GRANDMOTHER]
Amelia, listen closely.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
You mustn't tell lies.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
Great magicians like us
turn lies into reality.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
Believe me, little one.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
We must be very
careful about lying.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we run the risk of
overwriting our reality--

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
turning lies into truth.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
But, um, I, uh...

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
You may be still too
young to understand.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
It will all become
clear to you in time.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
In time...

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Grandma, I think I get it now.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
The truth is
I want to win this!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
More than anything!

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm going to
give this everything I've got!

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI grunts]

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
Wow, Eimi!

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
Who knew you had all
this power hiding inside you?

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Huh, y'know what just
occurred to me?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
You know those card games

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
we've been playing the
past few nights?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
Did you notice that
Eimi seemed to be

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
losing just as many games
as she was winning?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMI]
Uh, now that you mention it...

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI]
No way! That was on purpose?

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
[SUBARU]
Well, I can't say for sure.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's possible
that she's made a habit out of

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
letting up without realizing it.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
That is until now,
because the stakes are so high.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
If so, then what
we're witnessing

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
could very well be
Eimi's true power.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Where did
this power come from?

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
Although, I have to
wonder, Ms. Akechi...

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
You've only got three
pillars to my two!

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Say goodnight!

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
This is bad. She's losing
steam sooner than we thought.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
It was only a matter of time

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
before your stamina ran out.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
I haven't given up yet!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
I don't want to lose!

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
The only chance she has
is to break all three at once

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
which means sacrificing one
of her only remaining pillars.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Even if she
managed another attack,

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
those last three pillars
have been fused together

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
into one solid mass.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
A collision with the
intent of knocking them over

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
would be nearly impossible.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
Which means

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
it's a question of how Eimi will
bend reality with her magic.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50% align:center
[EIMI] Magicians can make
anything we imagine a reality...

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Grandma?

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm imagining myself
smashing my opponent's pillars

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
over and over and over again!

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
Now, please, let it be enough!

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
I'm putting all of my
power into one final blow!

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
She has that much power left?!

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
I won't let you steal this!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
Not this time! I'll focus
all of my Psions on defense!

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
You realize what this means
for the final, don't you?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
First High has all three spots!

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
[EIMI]
Hey, everyone...

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.348 position:50% align:center
[chuckling]

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Eimi!

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Don't overdo it!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
What are you doing out of bed?

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Huh? I'm fine; never better...

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Ladies!

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
We've been approached by

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
the Tournament Committee
with some exciting news!

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
They have an offer
regarding the final.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
An offer?

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] As of Eimi's win,
First High School now controls

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
the three top spots in

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
the Women's Ice Pillars
Break Rookie Event.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
So instead of
competing this afternoon,

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
they'd like to know if
we'd prefer to skip the final

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
and have the three
of you share first place.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Actually...

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
I was already thinking about
withdrawing from the final

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
before you mentioned
this, so sure.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
I certainly can't
blame you for that!

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is so cool! This means
you each get first place!

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
Congrats, all of you!

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
Great. I'll let them
know we accept.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Ladies.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
I'd rather not.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
If possible,

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
I'd like to compete with Miyuki.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
Shizuku?

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
I won't try to talk you
out of it if you're serious.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Miyuki, what would
you like to do?

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
I don't...

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
If Shizuku wants to
compete against me

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
in an Ice Pillars Break match,

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
then I have no reason to
refuse her that opportunity.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
I see. In that case,

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
I'll go and let the
Tournament Committee know

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
what you've decided.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU, MIYUKI]
Right!

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I'm surprised you were so eager

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
to go up against Miyuki.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
I guess it must be
really important to you.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Hm!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
I'm here to prove myself.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
I couldn't just pass on
an opportunity like this.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
Ever since we enrolled
at this school together,

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
since we met Miyuki,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
I've questioned
whether the pride

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I used to have in my
abilities had been misplaced.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
The chance to test yourself

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
against a magician of her
caliber doesn't come up often.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
...I'm not going to back down.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
I'm going to do everything
I can to prepare.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to win,
I can't hold back.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Shizuku...

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Right! Fight hard!

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
And I promise t'do the same!

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
Here's the plan!

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
I'm in the Battle
Board final, right?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
And you're gonna be in the
Ice Pillars Break final!

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
So let's both win our events and
then we can celebrate together!

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
We'll party all night!
And we'll stuff ourselves

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
with all the yummiest
food they have!

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
I like that. It sounds fun.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
Okay! Let's swear on it!

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
That we're both going to win!

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
Right. I swear.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Airi...

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I couldn't win.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Don't worry about it.
You performed really well.

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Airi.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
I know I should feel bitter,

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
but somehow,
I just feel motivated.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've ever
felt this way before.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
Well, look at you.
You're getting stronger.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
I may have lost today,
but, Airi, I'm grateful to you.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
It's all because of you;

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
I'm no longer
shackled to my past.

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
My eyes are set squarely on
the future from here out.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO chuckles]

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Shizuku really
is something else.

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
I'd be way too
intimidated to consider

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
going up against Miyuki.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
But I've got my own
match to worry about!

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
I'll say and you'd better
give it everything you've got!

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
Here we are, together at last!

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
I've been looking
forward to this match!

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
I'm excited to face you.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
I bet you've got
some flashy tricks

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
up your sleeve for
the final, don't you?

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA grunts] Yeah?
Well, I've seen your magic

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
and I'm not scared!

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
That's right! I'm gonna win!
Just you watch me!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
Well, then, this is
going to be interesting!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Hm?

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] All right!
Time for me to go get ready!

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
See ya in the final!

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
I'm not used to standing up
for myself like that!

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
I think that Shizuku
might be rubbing off on me...

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
Hi, Mitsui!
I wanted to let you know

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
that it's looking like we
won't be able to spare Tatsuya

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
from Ice Pillars
Break after all.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
Well, it can't
be helped I guess.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
He's spread so thin!

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
Managing both
Miyuki and Shizuku.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Oh! But he wanted me
to give you this message.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
"If you remember your
training and stick to the plan,

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
you've got this.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
It won't be easy,
but you can do this, Honoka!"

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
That's what he said!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tatsuya...

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
No surprise who you're
facing in the final:

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
Toko Tsukushiin of Third High.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
She uses Spirit Magic to
manipulate the water's surface.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
Do I have a chance?

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
Even Ancient Magic
has its limitations.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
For instance, her spells?

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
They all emit
electromagnetic noise.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
The key to winning against her

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
lies in that noise, Honoka.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Hm. Understood!

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
Wish me luck.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 07A]
And now,

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
the Women's Battle Board
Rookie Event Final

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
is about to begin!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
On your marks...

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
[machine beeping]

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
That's Mirroring Magic!

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
By altering the water's surface

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
using even a harmless
spell like that,

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
she effectively
prevents anything else

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
from being cast in that area!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
[NANAMI] So it's almost like
a form of Area Interference!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
First strike goes to Honoka!

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
Thankfully, Ancient
Magic takes longer

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
to activate than Modern Magic!

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
I'm well acquainted with the
flaws of Ancient Magic!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Fine! You win this
battle fair and square!

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
But the war is far from over!

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm very familiar
with this trick!

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA grunts]

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
Where the heck does that girl

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
think she's going
with a jump like that?

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
I don't know if you know this,
but it's against the rules

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
to take shortcuts
using a Jump spell!

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Got it!

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Oh, I see. She's
jumping to dodge my trap!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.716 position:50% align:center
That's not technically
a violation...

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
But don't worry!

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
That's far from the only thing
that I've got in store for you!

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] Honoka,
your sensitivity to light

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
is a crucial part
of our strategy.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.104 position:50% align:center
That talent is
your secret weapon.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
It allows you to sense
and avoid things

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
that others would miss.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
That is how you're
going to beat Tsukushiin.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I get it now!

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
I see them!

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
Right where that
light is shining--

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
those are all magic traps!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
Better get rid of those!

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
[TOKO gasps]

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
Did she just suppress
my Spirit Magic?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
That girl... is she...
the same as me?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
[TOKO]
Honoka Mitsui...

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.421 position:50% align:center
Mitsui!

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
How did I manage to miss that?

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
This girl is a Light Element!

00:18:12.384 --> 00:18:15.178 position:50% align:center
I guess that explains why
she was able to see my magic.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
See, I knew from the
start there was something

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
I liked about this girl!

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
This is just so perfect!

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
Who knew the Nine Schools
Competition would be this fun?

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
From the top of this waterfall,

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
I should be able to
see the entire course!

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
I'll know where she's
laid all her traps,

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
and then it's smooth surfing!

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh? There's that many?!

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
If I suppress them all,
it'll drain all my stamina!

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
I'll start with the close ones.

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
[TOKO chuckles]

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Hang on.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are those decoys?

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I knew it!

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
She must've realized by now

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
that I have the power
to sense her magic!

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
So the dummies are just
a tactic to wear me out!

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sorry.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
It'll take a lot more
than that to fool me!

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
Huh?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA gasps]

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
Okay, that one wasn't fake!

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
I had no idea she could
cast something that big!

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
Nice knowin' ya!

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
No, Mitsui!

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
It's been fun! But time
to break out the big guns!

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
What the...?
She has a second CAD?

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] That's not Ancient
Magic! That's Modern Magic!

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yelps]

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
That was ancient magic!

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
Ancient Magic Spells
are second nature to me;

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
they're like my arms and legs!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
I can practically use
them in my sleep!

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm able to multitask
using Modern Magic as well!

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
[grunts] No good.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
I can't catch up to her!

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[TOKO giggles]

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA]
Come on, Mitsui.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
Try to remember all
that training you did

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
and how hard you've worked!

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
And if nothing else,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
remember all of the
great advice and coaching

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
you got from Tatsuya!

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
Honoka.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA grunts]

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA chuckles]

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me!

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
That's right!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
I've been training
nonstop for this!

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
I've worked as hard as
anyone else to get here!

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
And of course,

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
it goes without saying that
I've got Tatsuya on my side!

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
She's moving better suddenly.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
We elements have been known
to awaken brand new powers

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
we were unaware we had,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
often manifesting when those we
care about most

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
are depending on us.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
Is that what this is?

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
[TOKO grunts]
All right, how about this?!

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
Throw anything you want at me,
I'm still gonna win!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
Good to see you again!

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] This race'll come
down to this last curve,

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
and I got the
inside track! Sorry!

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
This match is mine-- [gasps]

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
What is going on?!

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
I could've swore
I had the inside track!

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
Illusion Magic?!

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
She disguised the edge of the
channel with a dark shadow!

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
And I fell right for it!

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] Tatsuya,
the strategy you came up with

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
was such a huge success!

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
We did it!

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
I... I did it!

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
[TOKO] Man, I'm never
gonna live this down!

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
Imagine being a Tsukushiin

00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
and suffering an embarrassing
defeat in a water sport!

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. I guess
that goes to show

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
just how strong your
feelings are towards him!

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
Uhh! Wha--?!

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
Toko...

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.854 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
[TOKO cries]
I can't believe she beat me!

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
[MIZUO]
There, there.

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:03.156 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] I fought tooth and
nail, and in the end, I won!

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
It's down to you, Shizuku.

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:11.247 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Honoka.

00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:14.376 position:50% align:center
And now... it's my turn.

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
Mm!
