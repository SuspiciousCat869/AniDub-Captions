00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA, SHIZUKU]
What?!

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, that boy
is your older brother?

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
Talented magicians who
happen to be siblings.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
But one's an Honor Student
and the other is an Irregular?

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Enough already!

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear Miyuki say she's
going home with her brother?

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
We have something
to discuss with her

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
as a fellow Course One student.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
Now get out of our way, Weed.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKI]
What do you think you're doing

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
trying to split these two apart?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
You have no right!

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
Tear us apart?! You can't!

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
Mizuki! He would never
do that to us, would he?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI cackles] I'm gonna
tear the two of you apart!

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Big Brother!

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI groans]

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA] I'll never
let go of you, Miyuki.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Hold me in
your arms forever, Brother!

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI sighs]
Hold me, Big Brother, please...

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
[TATSUYA]
Miyuki?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI]
Look, Ms. Shiba,

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
the sooner you face
the facts, the better.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
You may be siblings,
but a Weed is still a Weed.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
Course One and Course Two
students should not be mingling.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
At this high school,

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
you're either an honor student
or you're an irregular.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
We are the Blooms and
they are the Weeds, got it?

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
I'm just stating
an irrefutable fact.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
Go on, guys, tell them.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
It's not that
hard to understand.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
Ms. Shiba's one of us.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
You losers need to back off!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
No. How can you say that?
Stop it, guys!

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
[BLOOM 02E]
Go on, piss off!

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI whimpers]

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] They don't
realize how much this is

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.750 position:50% align:center
hurting Ms. Shiba...

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
All she wants is to
be with her brother!

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
And here they are,

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
mocking all the Course Twos
right in front of her...

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with them?!

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
I feel so stupid for having been
so proud of making Course One!

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
Look at how they act!
Especially this guy!

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
It's unbearable!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
This is simply our high school's
meritocracy at work.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
You Weeds had your shot and

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
were judged inferior. Both your
talent and your lives, frankly.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
It's time you
learned your place.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
We're all new
students here, remember?

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
I mean, who do
you think you are?!

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
How superior to us Weeds
could you Blooms be?!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI grunts]

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
[MORISAKI] How dare you address
me as if you're my equal!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
Why don't I show you
just how strong we are.

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't dare!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
You're casting an attack spell?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center

[ERIKA grunts]

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
It looks like this
Course Two student

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
just got the better
of you, Mr. Course One.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
No way a bloom could
be bested by a Weed!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Honestly!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
Come on, enough
of this-- [yelps]

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center

This is so messed up!

All they're doing is causing
Ms. Shiba even more pain!

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
That's right; show them all!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
Show 'em the power
of an Honor Student!

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
Just shut up!
You've done enough!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA] I'll stop them,
even if it means using my magic!

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center

[HONOKA]
Y-Yes?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
[MARI] You were just about
to unleash an attack spell,

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
were you not?

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
Except for self-defense,
anti-personnel attacks

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
are not only against our school
rules; they're against the law.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
Huh? But... I...

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is, I intend to
get the whole story from you.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
You are to report to the
Disciplinary Committee Room.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
No...

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
In the end, I only made it worse

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
and I've caused trouble for
the student council president...

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
Honoka...

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't I have just stayed
calm and kept my mouth shut?

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to look
Ms. Shiba in the eye again...

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
Ugh, she must hate me now!

Hold on a minute. If I may...

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
That spell she was
about to unleash?

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
It was nothing more
than a Flash Spell.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
I don't believe she
intended to cause harm.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you can analyze
activation sequences

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
as they're being launched?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
I may lack some
practical skills,

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
but I am adept at analysis.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Is that possible?

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
That's a lie!

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center

Why is Ms. Shiba's brother

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center

Ms. Shiba, I, uh...

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
I know that you weren't
trying to attack anyone...

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
You were only trying to
stop everyone from fighting.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center

Miyuki, we've reached
an understanding.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
You have nothing to
worry about, either.

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
I, uh, um! Sorry...

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
I've got to thank him properly.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
Why am I at such a loss for
words at a time like this?

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
She means thank you very much
for standing up for her before.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you,
it didn't escalate into

Um, I, uh--!

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for everything
that happened, Big Brother!

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, it wasn't your fault.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
But don't call me
big brother, okay?

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're all
first years here.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! Of course!

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
Ahh...

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center

You came to my rescue, Shizuku!

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Feels good, right?

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
Getting to tell
them how you feel?

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
It sure does.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
Can you believe how many amazing
Course Twos there are at school?

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
You're telling me.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center

ID'ing the spell
behind a launched

I don't get how
he's in Course Two...

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
What's the difference even?

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center

Ms. Shiba! Big Brother!

Please don't
call me big brother.

Oh, right...
What should I call you?

Tatsuya is fine.

Hi, Tatsuya!

[TATSUYA] What is it,
Student Council President?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's not stand
on ceremony, okay?

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
Forget the title. Mayumi's fine!

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for being rude,

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
but didn't you meet my
brother for the first time

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
during the enrollment ceremony?

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
I can see why you'd think that.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
But our connection
is deeper! [giggles]

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] You see, your brother
and I first met a lifetime ago.

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
Torn apart by
a cruel twist of fate,

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
and I thought
I'd never see him again!

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
But we reunited at last
on the day of the ceremony!

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center

Finally we're together, Mayumi.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center

Tatsuya, dear...

--[TATSUYA] Hm?
--[MIYUKI] Say it isn't so!

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
Brother, when did this happen?!

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Just kidding!

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
We did meet for the first time
during the enrollment ceremony.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
But...

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya, doesn't
this feel like destiny?

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I assume by destiny

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
you mean the sense of
impending doom, right?

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
You're no fun... Ugh.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Enough of that, you!

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
Ow!

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
[MARI]
Give them the message, already!

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
You did have something
to tell them, didn't you?

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
I wanted to invite you
to have lunch with me

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
in the Student Council Room.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
You, too.

[gasps]

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] With the way she was
behaving herself around Brother,

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
I ought to be careful letting
her get too close to him.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI chuckles]
Hey, don't worry about me.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
I promise I don't bite.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
However, in matters pertaining
to improving our academy,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I would like to enlist your aid.

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have some
thoughts already.

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
About this school?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
I wonder what the student
council president wanted?

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
I think she's inviting
them to join the council.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
From what I understand,

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
it's a tradition for the
top new student to join.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
Aha! That makes sense for her!

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
But what is Tatsuya
doing there then?

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[HONOKA]
What?!

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Tatsuya's joining the
Disciplinary Committee?

[STUDENTS chattering]

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
How did he get picked?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what gives?

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be his
connection to Ms. Shiba!

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
Lucky. Getting all
this special treatment

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
thanks to his talented sister.

[SHIZUKU] There isn't any point
in trying to explain it to them.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
They don't care how good
Tatsuya and the others are...

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
I really hate it.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
The Course Two students
are all so talented...

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Why is everyone okay with
discriminating against them?

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
There's not much hope of getting

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center

to understand.

believed it ourselves.

I guess you're right.

found out we'd made Course One.

But... But still!

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
Now we know all about
Tatsuya and the others

and about how amazing they are!

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center

saying it's going to

be easy to change

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
But then that's all the
more reason to get started!

Mm.

study as hard as I can!

each other as rivals, didn't we?

Hmm.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
Aside from the siblings,
there were a few other students

make a real difference here.

It'll be exciting to see them

it'll be a sight to see.

something special about him.
