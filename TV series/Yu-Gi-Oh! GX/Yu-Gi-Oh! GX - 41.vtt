THERE'S MORE

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:22.089
TO HIM THAN
MEETS THE EYE.

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:24.797
OH, THERE IS, SO KEEP
A SHARP LOOKOUT,

00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:28.675
THOUGH THAT MAY BE
DIFFICULT TO DO
AFTER I PLAY THIS!

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.680
DIFFICULT FOR YOU,
THAT IS.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.185
NOT FOR ME.

00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:37.500
I ACTIVATE DARK ARENA!

00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:43.250
THE FIELD!
I CAN'T SEE!

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.847
[MONSTER GROWLS]

00:08:53.847 --> 00:08:55.018
[THINKING]
HOW CAN I FIGHT

00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.856
IF I CAN'T
MAKE OUT MY ENEMIES?

00:08:56.856 --> 00:09:01.135
YOUR MOVE!
HA HA HA!

00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:02.339
Zane: WHAT HAPPENED?

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:04.746
Syrus: I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING IN THERE!

00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:06.317
Crowler: SOMEONE
SHOULD GO IN THERE!

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:10.296
SOMEONE OTHER THAN ME,
OF COURSE.

00:09:10.296 --> 00:09:11.566
SOME GRILLED
CHEESE...

00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:12.937
I'M EATING
GRILLED CHEESE...

00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:15.276
A BIG, MELTING
TRIPLE-DECKER OF IT.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:18.653
JADEN...YOU TOOK
THIS GUY ON
IN A DUEL BEFORE!

00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:21.127
TELL ALEXIS HOW TO
GET OUT OF THIS JAM!

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:24.136
WISH I COULD, BUT SOMETHIN'
TELLS ME HE'S DIFFERENT NOW.

00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:26.208
THE GUY I DUELED
WAS A SHAM.

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:29.584
Crowler: I CONCUR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I EVER HIRED HIM.

00:09:29.584 --> 00:09:30.621
HUH?
HUH?

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.895
OR WHY I SAID
THAT OUT LOUD.

00:09:32.895 --> 00:09:34.900
POINT IS...THIS TIME,
HIS POWERS ARE REAL.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:39.981
Titan: HA HA HA!

00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:41.787
[THINKING]
WITH THIS DARK ARENA
CARD IN PLAY,

00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:43.492
I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING...

00:09:43.492 --> 00:09:45.464
INCLUDING WHAT
MONSTERS TITAN
HAS OUT!

00:09:45.464 --> 00:09:48.306
HA HA HA!

00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:50.478
THE DARKNESS IS FITTING
FOR A SHADOW DUEL,

00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:51.783
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:54.691
BUT STILL, ALLOW ME TO
SHED AT LEAST SOME LIGHT

00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:56.195
ON THE SITUATION.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.535
HERE, IN THE DARK ARENA,
YOUR MONSTERS

00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:00.742
IN ATTACK MODE
MUST ATTACK.

00:10:00.742 --> 00:10:02.815
BUT SINCE THEY
CAN'T SEE...

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:05.723
I AM ALLOWED TO CHOOSE
THEIR TARGET FOR THEM.

00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:07.662
WELL THEN THAT'S
A CASE OF THE BLIND
LEADING THE BLIND.

00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:10.570
AFTER ALL, JUST
BECAUSE MY MONSTERS
AND I CAN'T SEE,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.309
IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T WIN!

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:13.980
I'LL JUST NEED
SOMEONE WHO
REALLY PACKS

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.120
A POWERFUL PUNCH!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.758
HERE WE GO!

00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:18.961
MY DRAW!

00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:20.967
PERFECT.
I ACTIVATE...

00:10:20.967 --> 00:10:24.076
THE SPELL CARD...
POLYMERIZATION!

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:26.850
FUSING ETOILE CYBER
AND BLADE SKATER

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.696
TO CREATE...
CYBER BLADER!

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.367
AND WHAT'S COOL
ABOUT HER...

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:33.971
IS HER SPECIAL
EFFECT CHANGES

00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:35.977
WITH THE NUMBER
OF MONSTERS YOU HAVE.

00:10:35.977 --> 00:10:37.582
DOES IT?

00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:40.691
YEAH, AND SINCE YOU
HAVE TWO MONSTERS
OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:45.204
CYBER BLADER'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE
DOUBLED TO 4200!

00:10:45.204 --> 00:10:46.742
CHECK IT OUT!

00:10:50.252 --> 00:10:53.461
HA HA HA!
4200 ATTACK POINTS?

00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.266
WHATEVER WILL I DO?

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:56.670
YOU'LL GET
YOUR BUTT KICKED,

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.810
CUZ NOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHO I ATTACK!

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.418
MY BLADER'S
THE STRONGEST
CREATURE OUT!

00:11:01.418 --> 00:11:03.022
SHE'LL TAKE DOWN
ANY TARGET!

00:11:03.022 --> 00:11:04.693
NOW...GO IN!

00:11:04.693 --> 00:11:08.337
FACE HER,
MATADOR FIEND!

00:11:08.337 --> 00:11:10.745
GO WHIRLWIND RAGE!

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:21.074
WHAT? MY CYBER
BLADER IS SO
MUCH STRONGER

00:11:21.074 --> 00:11:22.412
THAN THAT
MATADOR FIEND!

00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:24.250
SHE SHOULD WIN THIS!

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.424
AAH!

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:27.694
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:29.967
OH, I'M SORRY.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:32.909
MATADOR FIEND CANNOT
BE DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:35.215
AND IT ALSO
DOESN'T TAKE DAMAGE.

00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:38.926
ALTHOUGH...THE MONSTER
THAT BATTLES IT...
IS DESTROYED.

00:11:38.926 --> 00:11:39.929
NO WAY...

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:40.999
THERE'S MORE.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:42.436
JUST LIKE I SAID BEFORE...

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.944
EVERY MONSTER THAT'S
IN ATTACK MODE HERE...

00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.849
MUST NOW
BATTLE EACH OTHER.

00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:48.655
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.359
CYBER TUTU'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:52.365
ALLOWS HER TO ATTACK
YOU DIRECTLY!

00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:53.870
SO YOUR
MATADOR FIEND

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.578
WILL HAVE TO
PICK A FIGHT
WITH SOMEONE ELSE!

00:11:56.578 --> 00:11:59.520
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN!

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.996
CYBER TUTU'S SPECIAL ABILITY
ONLY ACTIVATES...

00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:04.868
IF THERE ARE NO MONSTERS
ON MY FIELD

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:06.540
WITH LESS ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.649
BUT MY MATADOR FIEND
HAS ZERO ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:12.958
SO YOU SEE, CYBER TUTU'S
EFFECT CAN'T BE USED.

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.797
NOR WILL IT
EVER BE USED AGAIN

00:12:14.797 --> 00:12:17.805
AFTER PICADOR FIEND
GETS DONE WITH HER!

00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.714
THIS WILL BE
HER LAST DANCE.

00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:29.005
TUTU!

00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:30.543
AAH!

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:36.928
HA HA HA!

00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:39.936
SO THIS IS WHAT
A SHADOW GAME...
FEELS LIKE.

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.809
[GASPING]

00:12:43.447 --> 00:12:48.528
MAN...I HOPE ALEXIS...
IS OKAY IN THERE.

00:12:48.528 --> 00:12:50.100
DON'T WORRY, ALEXIS.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.609
AT LEAST YOUR BROTHER
WON'T REMEMBER THAT
YOU FAILED HIM.

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:54.713
HA HA HA!

00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:56.718
I'M NOT GOING
TO FAIL HIM!

00:12:56.718 --> 00:13:01.533
I PLAY CYBER GYMNAST
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:04.341
GIMME
YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.082
DEAR...IF YOU ACTUALLY
KNEW WHAT MY BEST WAS...

00:13:07.082 --> 00:13:09.823
I DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD BE
SO EAGER FOR IT.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.394
OH REALLY?

00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:13.065
HAVEN'T YOU
REALIZED YET?

00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:16.709
I'M NOT THE SAME DUELIST
YOU KNEW FROM BEFORE.

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:19.919
I CHANGED WHEN
THE SHADOWS TOOK ME IN.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:21.558
HELP ME!

00:13:21.558 --> 00:13:23.061
ANYONE!

00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:24.532
OH, PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU!

00:13:24.532 --> 00:13:27.976
SOMEBODY! I'LL DO
ANYTHING-JUST PLEASE HELP!

00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:30.349
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING?

00:13:30.349 --> 00:13:31.520
SO BE IT.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.693
I WILL SPARE YOU
THE AGONY OF THE SHADOWS,

00:13:33.693 --> 00:13:36.132
AND YOU WILL BE
MY DEVOTED SERVANT.

00:13:36.132 --> 00:13:38.975
YOU WILL DO MY BIDDING.

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:41.114
ALRIGHT! VERY WELL!

00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:43.354
JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO!

00:13:43.354 --> 00:13:46.529
I WANT YOU TO DEFEAT
THOSE THAT GUARD
THE SACRED BEASTS.

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:49.839
AND THIS SHADOW CHARM
THIS WILL HELP YOU DO IT.

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:57.595
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

00:13:57.595 --> 00:14:01.339
SO YOU SEE...NOW, I'M
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER!

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:02.610
HA HA HA!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.148
AND UGLIER.

00:14:04.148 --> 00:14:05.518
BUT I GOT NEWS
FOR YOU,

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:06.822
TRUE DUELING POWER
DOESN'T COME

00:14:06.822 --> 00:14:09.630
FROM SOME
SHADOW CHARM!

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.271
IT COMES FROM
THE REASONS
WHY YOU DUEL.

00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:13.976
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GOING
TO LOSE THIS!

00:14:13.976 --> 00:14:15.180
GOT IT?!

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.118
THE REASONS
WHY YOU DUEL?

00:14:17.118 --> 00:14:18.756
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT FROM?

00:14:18.756 --> 00:14:21.698
SURELY NOT FROM
YOUR BELOVED BROTHER--

00:14:21.698 --> 00:14:25.643
AFTER ALL, THE WHOLE REASON
HE BECAME A SHADOW RIDER
WAS TO GAIN POWER.

00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:29.354
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
YOU'RE A LIAR!

00:14:29.354 --> 00:14:32.162
I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S A FACT.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:34.368
BUT IF YOU STILL
DON'T BELIEVE ME...

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:37.611
JUST WAIT!

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:40.921
AFTER ALL, ONCE I
BANISH YOU TO THE SHADOWS...

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.759
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:44.564
AND YOU'LL SEE SOON!

00:14:44.564 --> 00:14:47.874
BECAUSE THE PICADOR FIEND
NOW ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY!

00:14:47.874 --> 00:14:50.549
[ROARING]

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:52.420
[GROANING]

00:14:55.997 --> 00:14:57.569
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH,
ATTICUS.

00:14:57.569 --> 00:14:59.741
WE JUST HAVE TO
HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:09.604
HA HA HA!
THE END IS NEAR...
THE SHADOWS BECKON.

00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:12.145
YOU SQUIRM BUT THEY
STILL CLOSE IN...

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:15.220
IT IS SIMPLY A MATTER
OF TIME NOW.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.892
[THINKING]
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:19.031
WITH CYBER GYMNAST'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:20.802
I CAN DISCARD ONE
CARD FROM MY HAND

00:15:20.802 --> 00:15:22.775
AND DESTROY ONE
OF HIS MONSTERS.

00:15:22.775 --> 00:15:24.614
BUT SINCE I DON'T
HAVE ANY CARDS
RIGHT NOW

00:15:24.614 --> 00:15:26.787
I'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL NEXT ROUND
TO USE IT...

00:15:26.787 --> 00:15:27.890
HA HA HA!

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.695
WHAT ARE YOU PLOTTING
OVER THERE?

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:30.831
LET ME GUESS.

00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:33.507
SOMETHING
WITH CYBER GYMNAST?

00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:35.111
WELL, DON'T EVEN BOTHER!

00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:37.318
SHE WON'T BE AROUND
FOR MUCH LONGER!

00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:40.660
I SUMMON
BANDERILLERO FIEND!

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.906
AND HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
DESTROYS YOUR CYBER GYMNAST!

00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:46.645
HA HA HA!

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:49.821
GET UP!
OR ARE YOUR REASONS
FOR DUELING...

00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.893
NOT ENOUGH...ANYMORE?

00:15:51.893 --> 00:15:54.200
HA HA HA!

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.436
[THINKING]
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT...

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:57.609
MAYBE THEY'RE
NOT ENOUGH...

00:15:57.609 --> 00:15:59.382
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I
WANT TO WIN THIS...

00:15:59.382 --> 00:16:01.655
I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH.

00:16:01.655 --> 00:16:05.800
IT'S OVER...MY KEY,
MY BROTHER, MY SOUL...

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.371
I'VE LOST THEM ALL.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.959
THAT'S RIGHT,
STAY DOWN.

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.699
THERE'S NO POINT
TO KEEP FIGHTING.

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:18.370
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.844
AFTER ALL...THE REASONS
YOU FIGHT

00:16:20.844 --> 00:16:23.852
AREN'T NEARLY AS STRONG
AS THE SHADOWS!

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:26.393
Atticus: ALEXIS!

00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:28.064
DON'T GIVE UP!

00:16:28.064 --> 00:16:31.040
YOU CAN DO THIS!

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.578
BRO.

00:16:32.578 --> 00:16:35.285
LEXI...

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:39.498
CAN'T STOP!

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.667
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.242
THIS IS MY TURN!

00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:46.151
AND I ACTIVATE
POT OF GREED!

00:16:46.151 --> 00:16:50.964
SO NOW...I GET TO
DRAW TWO NEW CARDS!

00:16:50.964 --> 00:16:52.736
HMM.

00:16:52.736 --> 00:16:54.174
AND WITH ONE
OF THEM,

00:16:54.174 --> 00:16:55.912
I CAN CALL BACK
AN OLD ONE!

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:58.553
I PLAY THE WARRIOR
RETURNING ALIVE

00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:01.160
TO BRING BACK
BLADE SKATER
TO MY HAND!

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.403
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
FUSION RECOVERY...

00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:05.974
IT ALLOWS ME TO
BRING BACK

00:17:05.974 --> 00:17:09.886
POLYMERIZATION
AND ETOILE CYBER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:09.886 --> 00:17:11.122
WHAT?!

00:17:11.122 --> 00:17:12.862
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
POLYMERIZATION

00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:15.769
AND FUSE TOGETHER
ETOILE CYBER
AND BLADE SKATER

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:18.042
TO SUMMON...
CYBER BLADER!

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:19.815
YOU REMEMBER HER?!

00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:23.492
WELL NOW SHE'S BACK
AND READY TO GET
SOME SWEET REVENGE!

00:17:23.492 --> 00:17:25.297
THIS IS OVER!

00:17:25.297 --> 00:17:27.069
YOUR SHADOW POWERS
HAVE FAILED YOU!

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.674
YOU'VE LOST
THE DUEL!

00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:31.080
HUH. YOU'RE DELIRIOUS.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.253
I HAVE STILL
THREE MONSTERS OUT!

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:35.226
AND YOU ARE STILL
IN THE DARK.

00:17:35.226 --> 00:17:37.465
YEAH, MAYBE,
BUT NOT FOR LONG!

00:17:37.465 --> 00:17:39.003
BECAUSE MY
CYBER BLADER'S

00:17:39.003 --> 00:17:40.909
ABOUT TO LIGHT UP
YOUR WORLD!

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:42.982
YOU LIE!
WRONG!

00:17:42.982 --> 00:17:45.155
SINCE YOU HAVE
THREE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:47.061
BLADER'S SPECIAL
ABILITY,

00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:49.802
SHINING CYBER LIGHT,
ACTIVATES!

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:52.276
CANCELING ANY AND ALL
EFFECTS YOU HAVE OUT!

00:17:52.276 --> 00:17:53.579
NO FAIR!

00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:54.917
DARK ARENA!

00:17:54.917 --> 00:17:57.357
YOU'VE DESTROYED
MY SPELL!

00:17:59.964 --> 00:18:04.444
Jaden: HEY, LOOK!
THE SHADOWS ARE
DISAPPEARING!!

00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:06.449
ALEXIS IS OKAY!

00:18:06.449 --> 00:18:08.021
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:18:08.021 --> 00:18:09.325
MATADOR FIEND'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:09.325 --> 00:18:12.467
TO REDUCE BATTLE
DAMAGE TO ZERO
IS NEGATED, TOO!

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.504
NO!

00:18:13.504 --> 00:18:16.145
SO GO...
CYBER BLADER!

00:18:16.145 --> 00:18:19.220
ATTACK WITH
SKATE BLADE SLASH!

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.290
[CHIRPING]

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.159
[GROANS]

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:28.146
OHH!

00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:40.615
[GROANING]

00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:43.992
NO! NO!

00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:45.597
NO, NO...NOT AGAIN!

00:18:45.597 --> 00:18:47.469
[MOANING]

00:18:57.498 --> 00:18:59.838
Titan: NOOOOO!

00:19:05.421 --> 00:19:07.092
ATTICUS...

00:19:07.092 --> 00:19:08.997
LEXI.

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.015
ADDY...
WELCOME BACK.

00:19:15.015 --> 00:19:16.420
THANKS, LEX.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.124
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:21.032
BUT...WAIT...
THERE ARE SO MANY
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,

00:19:21.032 --> 00:19:22.035
LIKE HOW YOU
EVER ENDED UP

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.205
IN THE SHADOW REALM.

00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.811
TITAN SAID YOU DID IT
FOR THE POWER.

00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:26.181
BELIEVE ME, LEXI.

00:19:26.181 --> 00:19:27.919
I NEVER CHOSE TO GO.

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.490
ONE DAY A FEW OF US
WERE TOLD TO MEET

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.196
AT THE ABANDONED DORM.

00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:34.973
AND THEN...WELL...
IT HAPPENED.

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:38.383
SEE, THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A DUEL TEST IN THE BASEMENT,

00:19:38.383 --> 00:19:41.960
BUT INSTEAD, WE FOUND HUNDREDS
OF THOSE LITTLE SHADOW FIENDS.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.504
I COULDN'T ESCAPE...

00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:48.713
I WAS THEN BROUGHT
TO THE SHADOW REALM AND KEPT.

00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:50.653
FOR MONTHS THEY
BRAINWASHED ME.

00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:53.122
'TIL I BECAME THIS THING
CALLED NIGHTSHROUD.

00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:54.290
BUT WHO?!

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.058
WHO WAS IT THAT
BRAINWASHED YOU?

00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:58.094
I NEVER DID
FIGURE THAT OUT.

00:19:58.094 --> 00:20:00.196
HOWEVER...
THE PERSON WHO
CALLED ME

00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:01.797
TO TAKE THE DUEL
TEST WAS...

00:20:01.797 --> 00:20:03.766
IT WAS
PROFESSOR BANNER.

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:04.967
[GASPS]

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:06.836
[GASPING]

00:20:06.836 --> 00:20:08.871
OUR PROFESSOR BANNER?!

00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:12.441
[THINKING]
SO HE'S IN ON IT?!
