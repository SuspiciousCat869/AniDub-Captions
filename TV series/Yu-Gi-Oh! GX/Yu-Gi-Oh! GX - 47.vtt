THAT'S THE DEAL!

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:38.529
FINE, THAT'S THE DEAL.

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:40.200
BUT IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN!

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.938
NOW LET'S DO THIS,
CHAZZ!

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:42.940
I WILL!

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.980
AND I'LL SHOW YOU...

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.517
THAT YOU LOVE ME!

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:52.429
LET'S DUEL!

00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:54.166
HERE GOES!

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.238
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL START WITH...

00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:58.409
OJAMA YELLOW!

00:08:58.409 --> 00:08:59.479
HI, THERE!

00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:00.883
BOSS THINKS
YOU'RE CUTE!

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:03.890
AND AFTER TWO FACEDOWNS
I'LL PLAY...

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.428
THE SPELL CARD
LOVE LETTER!

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:08.600
AND HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.347
FIRST OFF, IF I GOT A
FACEDOWN AND A MONSTER
SITTIN' ON MY FIELD,

00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:15.984
YOU GET A GIFT!

00:09:15.984 --> 00:09:17.923
YOU SEE, EITHER MY MONSTER,

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.361
OR MY FACE DOWN CARD
BECOMES YOURS!

00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:21.665
AREN'T I SWEET?

00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:23.268
YEAH, I KNOW IT!

00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:24.873
AND THAT'S JUST THE FIRST
OF LOTS OF GIFTS

00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:27.145
YOU'LL BE GETTING FROM ME!

00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:30.052
THE CHAZZ KNOWS HOW
TO TREAT HIS LADIES.

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.424
I'M NOT YOUR LADY,
CHAZZ.

00:09:32.424 --> 00:09:35.097
BUT IF I HAVE TO
TAKE YOUR GIFT, FINE.

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:37.001
I'LL TAKE ONE OF
YOUR FACEDOWNS.

00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:38.171
[THINKING] PERFECT.

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:40.209
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN.

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:41.613
ATTICUS WAS RIGHT!

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:44.452
DUELING CAN BE JUST LIKE
OLD FASHIONED COURTING!

00:09:44.452 --> 00:09:47.426
AFTER ALL, HER ACCEPTING
MY FACEDOWN CARD

00:09:47.426 --> 00:09:50.367
IS JUST LIKE HER
ACCEPTING A VALENTINE FROM ME!

00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:54.442
A VALENTINE I PROBABLY
WOULD'VE BEEN TOO SCARED
TO DELIVER IN REAL LIFE.

00:09:58.084 --> 00:09:59.923
BUT WITH ATTICUS' HELP?

00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:01.326
HUH?

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:03.464
ONWARDS AND
UPWARDS, CHAZZ!

00:10:03.464 --> 00:10:06.070
IF YOU CAN'T
CHARM HER, DUEL HER!

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.173
OKAY!

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.375
GO!

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:20.036
HMM.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.173
BUT THERE'S MORE!

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:23.745
NEXT I PLAY THE SPELL
CARD GIANT TRUNADE!

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:27.187
WHAT IT DOES IS BRING
ALL SPELLS AND TRAPS
BACK TO OUR HANDS!

00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:29.626
SO I'LL TAKE THAT
FACEDOWN BACK NOW!

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:33.469
[GIGGLING]

00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:35.640
CHAZZY,
FROM ME TO YOU!

00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:48.303
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU
TO GIVE ME THIS BACK SO SOON!

00:10:48.303 --> 00:10:50.075
AND NOW, I THINK
I'LL PLAY IT:

00:10:50.075 --> 00:10:52.714
HIDDEN WISH!

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:55.989
WHEN HIDDEN WISH RETURNS
FROM MY OPPONENT'S
FIELD BACK TO ME

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.929
IT DEALS 1,000 POINTS
OF DAMAGE TO YOU.

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:01.869
OH, NO!

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.075
THEN I REGAIN
1,000 POINTS.

00:11:04.075 --> 00:11:07.415
SO I GUESS I SHOULD SAY
THANKS, DARLING!

00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:10.790
I JUST KNEW THAT US DUELING
WOULD BRING US CLOSER.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.229
ARE YOU FEELING THE SPARKS?

00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:15.201
UGH...

00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:17.406
I'M FEELING NAUSEOUS.

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:19.912
AND NOW, I'LL ACTIVATE
MY OTHER FACEDOWN,

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:22.084
THE CARD KNOWN AS
TREASURE MAP!

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:24.088
ONCE I SEND IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:24.088 --> 00:11:26.260
I GET TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.570
AND I'LL LAY THEM
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.775
ALL RIGHT CHAZZ,
LET'S GO!

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.584
I SUMMON BLADE SKATER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:38.723
NOW TAKE OUT
THAT OJAMA YELLOW!

00:11:38.723 --> 00:11:41.563
WHIRLWIND SLASHER!

00:11:41.563 --> 00:11:43.535
UH, BOSS?!

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:45.540
DON'T WORRY! GO!

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.179
RING OF DESTRUCTION!

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.224
NOW WE BOTH GET HIT,

00:11:53.224 --> 00:11:55.964
WITH YOUR BLADE
SKATER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:55.964 --> 00:11:57.668
LIKE A COUPLE!

00:11:57.668 --> 00:11:59.206
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC!

00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:02.078
AFTER ALL, WHAT'S
LOVE WITHOUT PAIN?

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:03.649
NICE WORK, DON JUAN!

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:06.021
YOU KNOW IT,
ATTICUS!

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:07.960
CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.897
PUH-LEEZE!

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.002
THEN MAYBE THIS WILL WORK!

00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:15.244
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD,
GRACEFUL CHARITY!

00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:19.586
NOW I DRAW 3 NEW CARDS
AND DISCARD TWO CARDS
FROM MY HAND.

00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:22.093
OH--POT OF GREED!

00:12:22.093 --> 00:12:23.763
LOOKS LIKE I GET TWO MORE!

00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:25.233
NOW GO FACEDOWN!

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:26.270
OH, YEAH!

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.541
IT'S OJAMA TRIO!

00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:33.185
NOW 3 OJAMA TOKENS
GET TO CRASH YOUR FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.457
AND IF ONE OF 'EM
GETS WIPED OUT,

00:12:35.457 --> 00:12:37.964
YOU LOSE 300 POINTS!

00:12:37.964 --> 00:12:40.369
IT'S SO GREAT TO SHARE.

00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:44.111
NEXT I'LL CAST MY SPELL
CARD POLYMERIZATION!

00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:47.420
LET'S GO, GUYS!

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.193
OJAMA BLACK, OJAMA GREEN,

00:12:50.193 --> 00:12:52.030
AND OJAMA YELLOW!

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.570
FUSE AND FORM OJAMA KING!

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.109
OJAMA!

00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:01.519
OJAMA!

00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:06.398
AND THANKS TO OJAMA KING'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:08.737
UP TO 3 OF YOUR
MONSTER CARD ZONES

00:13:08.737 --> 00:13:11.209
ARE RECLASSIFIED
AS OCCUPIED!

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:12.212
[GASP]

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.827
[THINKING] NO!

00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:21.433
NOW I'VE GOT NO ROOM
TO PLAY ANY NEW
MONSTER CARDS!

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:23.538
I'LL BE COMPLETELY
DEFENSELESS!

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:27.348
NEXT I'LL THROW A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.417
SO TELL ME?

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:30.822
ARE YOU FEELING
THE FUZZIES YET?

00:13:30.822 --> 00:13:35.367
AFTER ALL, I FILLED UP
YOUR FIELD TO SHOW HOW
MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE!

00:13:35.367 --> 00:13:36.669
RIGHT?

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.941
HE IS SO GONE.

00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:41.214
IT IS SORT
OF ROMANTIC.

00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:42.583
HUH?

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:45.457
[THINKING]
IF I COULD JUST
GET HER ON THE FIELD,

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.295
I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE!

00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:51.037
BUT I CAN'T EVEN
SACRIFICE THOSE OJAMA
FREAKS TO SUMMON HER!

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:55.514
WAIT, I THINK I GOT IT.

00:13:55.514 --> 00:13:56.984
YEAH!

00:13:56.984 --> 00:13:58.488
GOT WHAT?

00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:01.562
THIS LIL' MOVE SHOULD
THROW "CHAZZ-ANOVA"
FOR A LOOP!

00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:03.700
I'M LAYIN' A FACEDOWN!

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.903
AND THAT IS IT!

00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:06.774
FINE, MY TURN!

00:14:06.774 --> 00:14:10.817
I PLAY A LITTLE CARD
I LIKE TO CALL DRESS UP!

00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:15.227
THE NEW DUDS GIVE OJAMA KING
AN EXTRA 300 ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:15.227 --> 00:14:16.899
THANKS FOR THE THREADS!

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:19.638
AND IT'S GOT ANOTHER BONUS!

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:22.779
I GET TO SWITCH ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS TO ATTACK MODE!

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.218
ANOTHER GIFT FOR YOU!

00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:26.354
BUT WAIT!

00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:29.428
ALL OF HER MONSTERS
HAVE NO ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:29.428 --> 00:14:30.430
NO JOKE!

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.500
AND IT GETS WORSE.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.340
IF CHAZZ ATTACKS
AND TAKES OUT AN OJAMA,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.843
SHE'LL LOSE
300 LIFE POINTS.

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:39.351
AND WHAT'S WORSE IS CHAZZ
CAN KEEP DOING THIS,

00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:42.325
DEALING UP TO 1,800
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:43.494
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!

00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:46.268
BECAUSE THEN SHE
WILL LOSE THE MATCH!

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:49.308
AND I WILL WIN
A GIRLFRIEND!

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:51.780
EW! ME AND CHAZZ
A COUPLE?

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.117
I BETTER DO
SOMETHING

00:14:53.117 --> 00:14:54.454
AND I BETTER DO
IT FAST!

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.900
LET'S SEE HERE.
ON ONE HAND,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.211
I COULD WIN THIS
DUEL RIGHT NOW AND
WIN A GIRLFRIEND!

00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:07.050
BUT WHAT WOULD CHAZZ
HAVING A GIRLFRIEND MEAN

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.258
IF SHE WASN'T REALLY
MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME?

00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:11.995
I AGREE!

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.036
WAIT, SO THEN HE'S NOT
GONNA FORCE OJAMA BLACK

00:15:15.036 --> 00:15:17.809
INTO ATTACK MODE?
HE KEEPS DEFENDING?

00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:19.179
LOOK OUT BELOW!

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:21.151
HERE I COME!

00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:22.688
CHOWDERHEAD!

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:26.028
SEE WHAT A
SWEET GUY I AM?

00:15:26.028 --> 00:15:27.065
BUT THERE'S MORE:

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:30.540
NEXT I PLAY
DRAMATIC CROSROADS!

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.377
IT'S DECISION TIME!

00:15:32.377 --> 00:15:35.451
NOW PAY ATTENTION:
OPTION NUMBER ONE:

00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:37.355
YOU DISCARD ONE RANDOM CARD.

00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:38.492
OPTION NUMBER TWO:

00:15:38.492 --> 00:15:42.434
YOU SHOW YOUR
ENTIRE HAND TO ME.

00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:48.281
AND THEN I AM ALLOWED
TO TAKE ONE OF YOUR
CARDS FOR MYSELF!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.787
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?!

00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:55.232
BECAUSE IF ALEXIS
REALLY LOVES ME,

00:15:55.232 --> 00:15:59.141
THEN SHE'LL TRUST ME
AND LET ME SEE HER HAND!

00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:03.818
SHE'LL GIVE ME HER
VERY BEST CARD AS
PROOF OF OUR LOVE!

00:16:03.818 --> 00:16:08.930
THEN SHE AND I WILL
LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER!

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.467
HA HA HA!

00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:13.408
SO NOW, MAKE YOUR CHOICE!

00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:16.315
OKAY, CHAZZ, LISTEN UP.

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:19.856
YOU'RE NOT EVER GONNA
SEE MY HAND, YOU GOT IT?

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.997
I'M SHOT DOWN?!

00:16:22.997 --> 00:16:25.570
LISTEN. WANNA KNOW
WHO I LOVE?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.176
I AM IN LOVE
WITH DUELING!

00:16:28.176 --> 00:16:30.113
OOH, OUCH, CHAZZ!

00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:32.587
CRASH AND BURN, DUDE!

00:16:32.587 --> 00:16:33.957
YEAH, SO WHAT?

00:16:33.957 --> 00:16:35.192
HUH?

00:16:35.192 --> 00:16:36.964
DON'T FORGET:
IF I WIN THIS,

00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:39.269
YOU'LL STILL BE MINE!

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:40.973
DUDE, IT'S OVER!

00:16:40.973 --> 00:16:43.312
I'LL DATE YA, BOSS!

00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:44.615
WE'D MAKE
A CUTE COUPLE!

00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:47.421
IF YOU WON'T LOVE ME
THEN I'LL DEFEAT YOU.

00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.925
AND YOU'LL HAVE
TO GO OUT WITH ME!

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:55.574
WELL, THEN I SIMPLY
CAN'T LET HIM DEFEAT ME.

00:16:55.574 --> 00:16:57.813
I JUST HOPE I DON'T
DISCARD THE ONE MONSTER

00:16:57.813 --> 00:16:59.951
THAT CAN GET ME OUT
OF THIS MESS!

00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:08.906
ALRIGHT, CHAZZ, HA!

00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:11.512
IF YOU REALLY WANT
A WEDDING,

00:17:11.512 --> 00:17:13.183
HERE'S YOUR ONE CHANCE!

00:17:13.183 --> 00:17:14.385
YEAH?

00:17:14.385 --> 00:17:17.025
I PLAY THE SPELL
RITUAL SANCTUARY!

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:26.146
NOW BY DISCARDING A
SPELL CARD FROM MY HAND,

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:30.490
I'M ABLE TO ADD
ANY RITUAL SPELL
FROM MY DECK

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.595
BACK INTO MY HAND.

00:17:32.595 --> 00:17:36.739
AND NOW I'LL PLAY IT:
MACHINE ANGEL RITUAL!

00:17:38.042 --> 00:17:39.512
WHAT THE--

00:17:42.118 --> 00:17:46.128
NOW ANY MONSTER WITH
CYBER ANGEL IN ITS NAME
I CAN SUMMON.

00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:47.564
NO WAY!

00:17:47.564 --> 00:17:49.636
YOU'VE GOT NO
MONSTER ZONES

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:52.208
BECAUSE OF THOSE OJAMAS!

00:17:52.208 --> 00:17:55.149
AND YOU CAN'T GET RID
OF THEM EITHER!

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:57.354
OH, YES I CAN.

00:17:57.354 --> 00:17:59.827
REMEMBER, THIS IS
A RITUAL SUMMONING.

00:17:59.827 --> 00:18:00.896
SO WHAT?

00:18:00.896 --> 00:18:03.402
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

00:18:03.402 --> 00:18:05.473
EVERYTHING.

00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:06.976
BECAUSE THAT NO
SACRIFICE RULE

00:18:06.976 --> 00:18:09.148
DOESN'T APPLY
TO RITUAL SUMMONINGS.

00:18:09.148 --> 00:18:11.153
AND THE MONSTER
I'M RITUAL SUMMONING

00:18:11.153 --> 00:18:13.660
CALLS FOR ME TO
SACRIFICE ALL 3 OJAMAS.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.099
PLUS SINCE THEY'RE
NOT BEING DESTROYED

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:18.170
I DON'T LOSE ANY POINTS!

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.676
BUT YOU SURE
ARE GOING TO, CHAZZ!

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:23.784
NOW, COME ON OUT
CYBER ANGEL BENTEN!

00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:38.084
CYBER ANGEL BENTEN,
ATTACK HIS KING!

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:40.256
ANGEL FLIGHT FLURRY!

00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:49.278
[GIBBERISH]

00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:59.802
NOW FOR CYBER ANGEL'S
SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:18:59.802 --> 00:19:02.683
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THE DEFENSE POINTS

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.119
OF THE MONSTER THAT
WAS DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:07.188
I'M SORRY, CHAZZY!

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.356
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.992
THAT WOULD LEAVE
THE CHAZZ WITH NOTHING!

00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:15.463
SHE BEAT ME!

00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:17.965
MY DARLING BEAT ME!

00:19:17.965 --> 00:19:20.134
SO MUCH FOR TRUE LOVE!

00:19:20.134 --> 00:19:22.703
WHICH IS FINE!

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:26.674
'CAUSE THE CHAZZ
ALWAYS RIDES ALONE!

00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:29.977
ALEXIS!

00:19:29.977 --> 00:19:32.313
AT LEAST YOU COULD
LET HIM DOWN GENTLY!

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:36.450
STILL BE FRIENDS?

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.486
[EXPLOSION]

00:19:43.524 --> 00:19:45.626

WARNED US ABOUT...

00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:48.829
IT'S HERE.
