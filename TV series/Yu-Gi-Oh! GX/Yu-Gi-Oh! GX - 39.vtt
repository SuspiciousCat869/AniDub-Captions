00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:07.426
THE POINT IS,
THEY ALL SAW WHO DID IT.

00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:08.729
CAUGHT YA
RED-HANDED.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:09.967
SOITENLY DID.

00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:11.437
YOU'RE SO BUSTED.

00:08:11.437 --> 00:08:12.875
WHO TOLD YOU
WHAT?

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.048
REALLY. I'M LOST.

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:16.954
All: WHERE ARE THESE
SO-CALLED WITNESSES?

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.558
HA HA HA!

00:08:18.558 --> 00:08:21.132
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM,
BUT I CAN,

00:08:21.132 --> 00:08:23.372
AND I KNOW THEY'RE
BEHIND THIS, DETECTIVE.

00:08:23.372 --> 00:08:25.679
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:27.885
IT'S NOT JUST THEM.
IT'S ME, TOO.

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:28.955
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:30.360
THAT'S RIGHT,
MY CHILDREN.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.299
ALL OF US
ARE IN ON IT.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.873
WE ARE
THE CRIMINAL RING
KNOWN AS...

00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:38.049
All: THE DARK SCORPIONS.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.923
All: UH, SORRY.
NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

00:08:40.923 --> 00:08:42.561
OF COURSE
YOU HAVEN'T.

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.200
WE'VE BEEN
DEEP UNDERCOVER

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.239
AT YOUR SCHOOL
FOR YEARS NOW,

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.613
WAITING
FOR OUR CHANCE
TO NAB THOSE KEYS...

00:08:48.613 --> 00:08:51.622
All: AND NOW, THE SCORPIONS
FINALLY HAVE THEM.

00:08:51.622 --> 00:08:52.892
SO?

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:54.296
TO USE THEM,

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:56.068
YOU'LL STILL HAVE
TO BEAT ME IN A DUEL.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.706
SO BRING IT ON.

00:08:57.706 --> 00:08:59.511
WHY YOU?
I'LL DUEL.

00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:01.083
I'LL TAKE THEM ON.

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.955
OR PROFESSOR BANNER
COULD.

00:09:02.955 --> 00:09:04.693
OH, I'LL SIT
THIS ONE OUT.

00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:07.201
OF COURSE.
THAT'S IT--

00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:08.939
WHY THE KEYS
DIDN'T WORK.

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:10.443
HA!

00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:12.717
WE HAVE TO BEAT THEM
IN A DUEL.

00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:14.422
GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:17.363
SO LET'S GO,
SHADOW RIDER.

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:22.913
HMM.

00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:26.992
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:26.992 --> 00:09:29.265
DUEL.
DUEL.

00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:34.346
I'LL WIN THIS AS EASY
AS I STOLE YOUR KEYS.

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:37.422
FIRST, I'LL SUMMON
GOLEM SENTRY IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:39.361
NEXT, I PLACE
A CARD FACE DOWN.

00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:41.233
THAT'LL DO FOR NOW.

00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:43.340
MY TURN. HAH!

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.485
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
FIEND'S SANCTUARY.

00:09:47.485 --> 00:09:52.266
WITH THIS CARD, I CAN
SUMMON A METAL FIEND
TOKEN TO THE FIELD,

00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:55.575
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
MY FIEND TOKEN

00:09:55.575 --> 00:10:00.122
TO BRING OUT
ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 5.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.899
GO, ARMED DRAGON.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.742
USE THOSE ARMS TO
DESTROY THAT GOLEM.

00:10:06.742 --> 00:10:09.449
SPIKED SPINNER.

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:11.756
AAH!
ALL RIGHT...

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:15.734
AND FOR MY NEXT MOVE,
I'M GONNA PLACE
TWO FACEDOWNS.

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:18.910
THEN I'LL USE
MY DRAGON'S ABILITY,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.451
AND IT'S A BIG ONE.

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.654
[ALL GASP]

00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:26.566
GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:29.040
ON THE TURN
ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 5
WINS A FIGHT,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.413
WELL, THEN YOU CAN
TRADE HIM IN...

00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:33.553
FOR A LEVEL 7.

00:10:33.553 --> 00:10:35.157
Zaloog: LEVEL HIM UP
ALL YOU WANT.

00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:38.902
IT WON'T MATTER,
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHY.

00:10:38.902 --> 00:10:41.744
FIRST, I PLAY
POT OF GREED.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:44.786
IT LETS ME DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:46.124

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:47.862
AH, JUST

00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:49.901

[ALL GASP]

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:54.381
AND WHEN I SAY
ONE AND ONLY,
I REALLY MEAN IT

00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:57.055
BECAUSE, MY CHILDREN,
I AM HIM.

00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:58.627
WAIT. SO...

00:10:58.627 --> 00:11:00.565
HE'S A CARD?

00:11:01.969 --> 00:11:04.912
WITH THIS, MUSTERING
OF THE DARK SCORPIONS,

00:11:04.912 --> 00:11:07.619
I CAN SUMMON
ALL OF THEM.

00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:08.789
THAT'S RIGHT--

00:11:08.789 --> 00:11:10.762

00:11:10.762 --> 00:11:13.671
COME JOIN ME
ON THE FIELD NOW.

00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:16.445
SCORPION ROLL CALL.

00:11:16.445 --> 00:11:20.122
ROLLS? WHO'S GOT THE ROLLS?
WHERE ARE DA ROLLS?

00:11:20.122 --> 00:11:22.497

I'M MEANAE THE THORN.

00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:27.210
THE NAME IS CLIFF

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.882
GUESS HOW I REMOVE 'EM.

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:30.386

00:11:30.386 --> 00:11:33.462

00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:35.969

00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:38.677
NOW I'LL PLAY A TRAP.

00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:40.816
HMM.

00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:42.622
YOU SEE,
ON THE FIRST TURN

00:11:42.622 --> 00:11:44.327
THAT ALL
THE DARK SCORPIONS
ARE OUT,

00:11:44.327 --> 00:11:48.372
THIS TRAP ALLOWS EACH OF US
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY,

00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:50.478
AND FOR EVERY ONE
OF THOSE ATTACKS,

00:11:50.478 --> 00:11:52.685
YOU'LL LOSE
400 LIFE POINTS.

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:55.024
NOW LET HIM HAVE IT--

00:11:55.024 --> 00:11:57.666
DARK SCORPION COMBINATION.

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.371
YAH!

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:00.541

DOUBLE BLAST ATTACK.

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:05.756
SCORPION SLICE.

00:12:05.756 --> 00:12:07.260
MALLET MASH.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.233
HAMMER HAMMER.

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:11.172
AH!
OHH!

00:12:11.172 --> 00:12:12.509

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.758
YAAH! AAH!

00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:19.730
THIS ISN'T HOW YOU
WANNA START A DUEL.

00:12:23.374 --> 00:12:25.982
HA HA HA!
AND THERE'S MORE, TOO,

00:12:25.982 --> 00:12:27.620
FOR YOU SEE, CHAZZ,

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.897
NOW OUR SPECIAL ABILITIES
GO INTO EFFECT AGAINST YOU.

00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:32.735
SAY WHAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:34.607
SO FIRST A MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD

00:12:34.607 --> 00:12:37.081
MUST RETURN TO THE TOP
OF YOUR DECK.

00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:41.394
AND THEN NEXT,
A CARD ON YOUR FIELD
RETURNS TO YOUR HAND.

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:42.932
Cliff: THERE'S MORE.

00:12:42.932 --> 00:12:44.871
THE TOP TWO CARDS
ON YOUR DECK,

00:12:44.871 --> 00:12:47.177
THEY GO TO THE GRAVE.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.997
AND THEN ONE CARD
IN YOUR HAND IS DESTROYED.

00:12:55.803 --> 00:12:59.179
AND FINALLY, A CARD WITH
"DARK SCORPION" IN ITS NAME,

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.920
CAN BE ADDED TO OUR HAND
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.197
AND I'LL PICK THIS--
DARK SCORPION COMBINATION,

00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:06.902
THE CARD THAT
STARTED IT ALL,

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:09.276
AND NOW
IT'LL END IT ALL.

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:13.855
STAY TOUGH, CHAZZ.

00:13:13.855 --> 00:13:14.858
YOU CAN BEAT
THESE GUYS.

00:13:14.858 --> 00:13:16.797
HELLO?
OF COURSE I CAN.

00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:21.678
NOW BE QUIET AND LET
THE CHAZZ DO HIS THING.

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:24.453
I PLAY
LEVEL MODULATION.

00:13:24.453 --> 00:13:26.492
NOW YOU GET TO DRAW
TWO CARDS,

00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.866
AND I GET TO SUMMON
FROM THE GRAVE

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:32.008
A HIGH-LEVEL MONSTER
WITHOUT PAYING A DIME,

00:13:32.008 --> 00:13:36.187
AND I CHOOSE
ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 7.

00:13:36.187 --> 00:13:39.229
[ROARS]

00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:41.837
UGH, HIM AGAIN?

00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:47.153
YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE
BUT TO PLAY
TWO FACE DOWNS THEN.

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:49.293
I HATE IT
WHEN THIS GUY
PLAYS FACE DOWNS.

00:13:49.293 --> 00:13:50.897
I HEAR YA, SYRUS.

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:52.402
THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING.

00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:53.906
IT'S MY TURN,

00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:57.784
AND FIRST,
ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 7's
EFFECT ACTIVATES.

00:13:57.784 --> 00:14:01.194
NOW, BY SENDING
ONE MONSTER CARD
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVE,

00:14:01.194 --> 00:14:03.334
MONSTERS
WITH ATTACK POINTS
EQUAL OR FEWER

00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:05.740

ARE DESTROYED,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.852
AND THE CARD
I'M DISCARDING IS
DESPAIR FROM THE DARK--

00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:11.858
2,800 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:11.858 --> 00:14:14.031
HOLD IT.
I PLAY A TRAP--

00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:17.341
RETREAT OF
THE DARK SCORPIONS.

00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:21.787
NOW ALL DARK SCORPIONS
ON THE FIELD RETREAT
TO MY HAND.

00:14:21.787 --> 00:14:24.028
FINE.
I'LL ATTACK DIRECTLY.

00:14:24.028 --> 00:14:26.267
ARMED DRAGON,
GO GET HIM.

00:14:26.267 --> 00:14:28.573

HOW DARE HE STRIKE
THE BOSS LIKE THAT.

00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:40.341
DON'T YOU WORRY.
WE'LL GET HIM BACK.

00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:43.517
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:45.858
ONE LUCKY MOVE--
THAT'S ALL--

00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:47.429
BUT IT WON'T MATTER.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:50.137
IT ENDS HERE.

00:14:50.137 --> 00:14:53.079
I SUMMON MYSELF,

Cliff: HEY, WAIT A SEC.

00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:16.781
SO THAT YOU ALL
CAN'T BE.

00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:19.690
SEE, OJAMA TRIO
CREATES
OJAMA TOKENS,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.164
AND THEY
TAKE UP 3 OF
YOUR MONSTER SLOTS,

00:15:22.164 --> 00:15:24.437
AND WHEN DESTROYED,
YOU LOSE
300 LIFE POINTS.

00:15:24.437 --> 00:15:25.741
RRGH!

00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:27.178
