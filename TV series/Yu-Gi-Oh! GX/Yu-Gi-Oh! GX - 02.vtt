GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME,
MY STUDENTS.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.565
I'M CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD,
THE HEADMASTER HERE,

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.869
AND YOU ARE THE BEST
AND BRIGHTEST
YOUNG DUELISTS IN THE WORLD.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.139
NOW PLEASE
GET YOURSELVES SETTLED IN
AT YOUR ASSIGNED DORMS.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.809
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THEM
QUITE COMFORTABLE--

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.979
DEPENDING UPON
HOW YOU RANKED OF COURSE.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.614
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, SY,

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.882
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I'M IN
THE SLIFER RED DORM.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:56.917
THAT'S COOL.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.085
SAME WITH ME.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.320
HEY, YOU IN RED, TOO?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.488
WELL NOW, LET'S SEE HERE,

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.256
YELLOW SLEEVES,
YELLOW BUTTONS.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.257
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.492
OH, I GET IT.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.527
SO THAT'S WHY SY AND I
ARE IN RED.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.931
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'VE JUST
FIGURED THAT OUT NOW.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:11.999
SO WHAT?

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.133
EVER THINK
I'M COLOR BLIND?

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.901
WELL, NO, ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.571
ARE YOU COLOR BLIND?

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.972
NO, BUT I COULD'VE BEEN.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.407
SEE YOU ROUND
THE DORMS.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.408
I DOUBT THAT.

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:22.609
YOUR DORM'S OVER THERE.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.813
THIS ISN'T A DORM.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.416
IT'S LIKE AN OUTHOUSE
WITH A DECK.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.584
YOU KIDDIN' ME?

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.085
CHECK OUT THE VIEW.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.887
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.224
ALL RIGHT,
THIS ONE HERE'S
OUR ROOM, SY.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.059
IT'S KINDA SMALL, HUH?

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.928
HEY, YOU'RE A SMALL GUY.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:43.330
ANYWAY, I LIKE IT.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.899
THIS'LL MAKE A SWEET PAD
FOR OUR FIRST YEAR HERE.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.836
YEAH, KINDA WEIRD,
MEETING AT THE ENTRANCE EXAMS,
AND NOW ROOMMATES?

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:54.041
THINK WE WERE SOMEHOW
CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
IN SOME ANCIENT LIFE, JADEN?

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:58.645
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU WERE
AN EGYPTIAN PHARAOH
AND I WAS THE GUARDIAN SETO?

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.814
NO OFFENSE,
BUT THAT'S JUST LAME.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.082
WELL, IT COULD BE TRUE.

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:03.550
FORGET IT.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.986
THEY BROKE THE MOLDS
WHEN THEY MADE
THE TWO OF US.

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.988
YEAH,
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:10.490
SY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WORK ON THAT CONFIDENCE.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.659
BUT FIRST,
LET'S WORK ON THIS PAD.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.595
HEY, THOSE WERE CLOSED
FOR A REASON!

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:16.897
OH, SORRY.

00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.432
YEAH,
WE DIDN'T SEE YOU
UP THERE.

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.300
WELL, CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:33.128
WOULD YOU STOP
THE SCREAMING?

00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:35.664
WHO ARE YOU
AND WHAT YOU DOING
IN MY ROOM?

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:36.665
OH, SORRY.

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.333
MY NAME'S JADEN YUKI.

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.734
AND I'M SYRUS.

00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:42.671
WE'RE YOUR
NEW ROOMMATES.

00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:43.905
YOU'RE NEW ALL RIGHT,

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.141
SO LEMME TELL YOU
HOW THINGS WORK HERE.

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.242
WHAT THINGS?

00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:49.244
LIKE WHEN PARENT'S
WEEKEND IS GONNA BE?

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:51.746
DUH, LIKE HOW THE WHOLE
COLOR THING WORKS?

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:53.782
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING.

00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:55.150
Both: YEAH?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.419
YA GOT 3 DIFFERENT KINDS OF
STUDENTS HERE:

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.421
OBELISK BLUE STUDENTS,

00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.989
RA YELLOW STUDENTS,

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.891
AND SLIFER RED STUDENTS.

00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.226
NOW, THE BLUES ARE
THE HIGHEST-RANKED STUDENTS.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.995
SOME KIDS ARE BLUE
CUZ A' GRADES,

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:08.730
OTHERS THROUGH CONNECTIONS.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.398
THE YELLOWS ARE
SECOND HIGHEST,

00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:13.401
MOSTLY YOUNGER STUDENTS
WITH LOTSA POTENTIAL.

00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:17.172
THEN, THERE'RE US,
THE RED WONDERS.

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:18.340
THE WONDERS.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.974
THAT'S A COOL NAME.

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:23.812
AS IN, I WONDER
HOW FLUNKIES LIKE US
EVER GOT THIS FAR, MAYBE.

00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:26.848
YEAH, SORRY,
BUT WE'RE BOTTOM OF
THE BARREL HERE.

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:28.383
DUELIN' DUDS.

00:04:28.383 --> 00:04:30.018
OH, I'M CHUMLEY,

00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:35.724
COME ON.

00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:36.891
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
STILL DEPRESSED.

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:38.993
BUT CHUMLEY SAID WE REDS
WERE THE WORST.

00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:40.061
FORGET THAT.

00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:42.330
I MEAN,
RED'S A SWEET COLOR.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.798
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:45.333
WHERE DO YA THINK
THE TERM "RED HOT"
COMES FROM?

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.569
FROM RED, BABY.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.038
BESIDES, THE YEAR
HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET,

00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:51.539
SO HOW CAN WE BE
THE WORST?

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.275
YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT, JADEN.

00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:56.010
RED IS FOR RED HOT--

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.614
SCORCHING,
DANGEROUS, HOT.

00:04:59.614 --> 00:05:01.249
I'M LIKE A FURNACE,

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.487
OR A REALLY BIG BOTTLE
OF SPICY SALSA DIP, RIGHT?

00:05:05.487 --> 00:05:07.322
WAIT, I'M NOT A DIP.

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:08.790
WAIT UP.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.792
THERE'S SOME KIND
OF DUEL ACTION
GOIN' ON IN THERE.

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:11.993
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:05:11.993 --> 00:05:13.728
I JUST KNOW.

00:05:13.728 --> 00:05:16.331
IT'S OVER THIS WAY,
I'M SURE OF IT.

00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.932
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE OF IT?

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:22.837
DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
SIXTH SENSE FOR DUELING
OR SOMETHING?

00:05:22.837 --> 00:05:24.506
IT'S IN THE AIR, SYRUS.

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.907
CAN'T YA JUST SMELL IT?

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:28.743
MAYBE IF TODAY'S POLLEN COUNT
WAS LOWER.

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:31.679
ARE YOU SURE
WE SHOULD BE IN HERE?

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:33.014
TOO COOL.

00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:34.783
WOW.

00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:37.986
THIS IS THE SWEETEST
DUELING ARENA
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:39.888
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

00:05:39.888 --> 00:05:41.890
IT LOOKS COMPLETELY
STATE OF THE ART.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.160
I BET IT WOULD BE
AMAZING TO DUEL HERE.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.494
WELL, LET'S FIND OUT.

00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:47.996
DO YOU THINK WE'RE ALLOWED?

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:49.164
SURE WE'RE ALLOWED.

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:50.231
WE'RE STUDENTS HERE

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.299
AND THIS IS OUR CAMPUS,
RIGHT?

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:52.400
Boy: WRONG.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.502
THIS IS THE BLUE
OBELISK'S CAMPUS.

00:05:54.502 --> 00:05:56.304
AND YOU SLIFER
RED REJECTS

00:05:56.304 --> 00:05:59.441
AREN'T WELCOME HERE,

00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:01.843
CHECK OUT THE CREST.

00:06:01.843 --> 00:06:04.312
THIS ARENA'S OUR TURF.

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:05.346
SORRY.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:06.915
WE WERE JUST LOOKING AROUND,

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:08.716
BUT WE'LL LEAVE NOW,
RIGHT, JADEN?

00:06:08.716 --> 00:06:10.118
NAH, WE DON'T
HAVE TO LEAVE.

00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:13.822
NOT SO LONG
AS ONE OF YOU GUYS
AGREES TO DUEL ME.

00:06:13.822 --> 00:06:14.989
I'LL BE A GUEST DUELIST.

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:16.458
HEY, YOU'RE THAT KID.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.327
CHAZZ,
THAT APPLICANT WHO BEAT
DR. CROWLER IS HERE.

00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:22.831

00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:23.832
OH, HEY.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:24.833
WHAT'S UP?

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:25.900

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.438
HIS NAME'S

00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:31.906
AND HE WAS
THE NUMBER ONE
DUELIST

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:33.441
BACK AT DUEL
PREP SCHOOL,

00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:36.077
SO YOU MAKE SURE

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.181
THE BEST DUELIST

00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:41.182
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:42.784
SAY WHAT?

00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:45.720
YOU SEE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO BE
THE FUTURE KING OF GAMES,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.022
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA BE.

00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:52.827
A SLIFER SLACKER
AS KING OF GAMES?

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:54.062
THAT'LL BE THE DAY.

00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:55.997

00:06:55.997 --> 00:06:57.999

WHADAYA MEAN
THERE, CHAZZ?

00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:02.403
HE DID BEAT CROWLER,

AND THAT LEGENDARY
RARE MONSTER OF HIS,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.710
I SUPPOSE
IT TAKES SOME SKILL
TO PULL THAT OFF.

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:13.681
GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.049

HEY, HE JUST ASKED
IF YOU WANTED SOME TEA.

00:09:46.234 --> 00:09:47.568
YA DON'T HAVE TO
SNAP AT HIM.

00:09:47.568 --> 00:09:50.004
THAT'S OK, JADEN,
I'M USED TO IT.

00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:52.073
TEA MAKES YOU WET THE BED.

00:09:52.073 --> 00:09:53.841
NOT THAT I DO...
OR EVER DID--

00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:55.176

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.388
TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:09.757
OH, AND WHY DON'T

00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:13.494
WHOEVER WINS

00:10:13.494 --> 00:10:14.729

00:10:23.237 --> 00:10:25.973
Sy: I'M NOT SO SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA, JADEN.

00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:28.509

00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:31.379
THERE'S NO CHOICE.

HE SHOWS.

00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:41.556
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:43.991
THERE WAS NO WAY
I WAS GONNA MISS THIS.

00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:46.094
WAIT UP.

00:10:46.094 --> 00:10:50.765
Chazz :TIME TO FIND OUT
IF YOU BEATING DR. CROWLER
WAS A FLUKE OR A FACT.

00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:53.401
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO,

00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:54.669
LIKE WHICH ONE
OF THE TWO OF US

00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:57.238
IS REALLY GONNA BECOME
THE NEXT KING OF GAMES.

00:10:57.238 --> 00:10:59.073
YEAH, YEAH.

00:10:59.073 --> 00:11:02.310
JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
YOUR BEST CARD READY
TO HAND OVER WHEN YOU LOSE.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.344

00:11:03.344 --> 00:11:04.378
NOW, GAME ON.

00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:14.012
Both: DUEL!

00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:15.714
ALL RIGHT, SLACKER.

00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:23.054
FOR MY FIRST MOVE,
I'LL SUMMON REBORN ZOMBIE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:29.761
AND I'LL ALSO PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:32.263
I GUESS THAT'S ONE WAY
TO START A DUEL,

00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:34.532
BUT I'M GONNA GO
A LITTLE BIGGER.

00:11:34.532 --> 00:11:35.900
HERE GOES.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.742
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YA,
WINGED KURIBOH.

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:45.076
MAYBE I'LL USE YOU
LATER.

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:47.579
BUT NOW I'LL PLAY
POLYMERIZATION,

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:50.982
FUSIN' ELEMENTAL
HEROES AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX...

00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:57.122
AND BRINGIN' OUT
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN

00:11:57.122 --> 00:11:58.657
IN ATTACK MODE.

I TOLD YA I'D START BIG,
DIDN'T I?

00:12:05.864 --> 00:12:07.666
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD.

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.334
WHY'S THAT?

00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:12.370
BECAUSE THAT CARD
I JUST PLAYED FACE DOWN
WAS A TRAP, SLACKER,

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.938
THAT YOU'VE SET OFF.

00:12:13.938 --> 00:12:16.241
CHTHONIAN POLYMER,
DO YOUR STUFF.

00:12:19.077 --> 00:12:21.579
WHAT'S CHTHONIAN
POLYMER'S STUFF?

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:24.683
Alexis: I HAD A FEELING
I'D FIND YOU GUYS HERE.

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:25.917
ALEXIS?

00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:28.586
CHTHONIAN POLYMER'S
A NASTY TRAP.

00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:29.921
IT ALLOWS YOU
TO TAKE CONTROL

00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:31.823
OF AN OPPONENT'S
FUSION MONSTER

00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:34.125
BY SACRIFICING
ONE OF YOUR OWN
CREATURES.

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.226
OH, NO.

00:12:35.226 --> 00:12:37.328
JADEN JUST SUMMONED
A FUSION MONSTER.

00:12:37.328 --> 00:12:41.232
I SACRIFICE REBORN ZOMBIE
TO GAIN CONTROL
OF YOUR WINGMAN.

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:46.337
AW, MY MONSTER.

00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:56.848
HOW DID CHAZZ KNOW
TO PLAY THAT?

00:12:56.848 --> 00:12:58.550
YOU'RE SO PREDICTABLE,
JADEN.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.352
YOU WOULDN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT THAT WINGMAN
AT THE EXAM,

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:03.655
SO I'D KNEW
YOU'D USE HIM SOON.

00:13:03.655 --> 00:13:05.990
STILL,
SINCE THAT WINGMAN WAS
A SPECIAL SUMMON,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.328
THAT MEANS I'M ALLOWED
TO SUMMON ANOTHER
MONSTER DURING MY TURN.

00:13:10.328 --> 00:13:11.596
Jaden, voice-over:
NOT THAT ANYTHING
IN MY HAND

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:14.899
IS A MATCH
FOR THE WINGMAN.

Chazz, voice-over:
GO ON, YOU SLIFER SLACKER.

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:18.603

AFTER ALL,
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:23.308
THE FLAME WINGMAN'S
SUPER POWER.

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:26.878
ALL RIGHT, I SUMMON

IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:30.348 --> 00:13:32.584
THERE, ALL SET.

00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:35.854
YEAH, SET UP
TO GET KNOCKED DOWN.

00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:37.856
RISE, CHTHONIAN SOLDIER.

00:13:37.856 --> 00:13:40.425
AND NOW, FLAME WINGMAN,

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:42.727
ATTACK WITH
SKY-DIVE SCORCHER.

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:50.735
AND NOW THANKS TO
WINGMAN'S SUPER POWER,

00:13:50.735 --> 00:13:55.006
YOUR LIFE POINTS TAKE DAMAGE
EQUAL TO YOUR DESTROYED
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.218
BUT DON'T THINK
FOR ONE SECOND

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:09.087
THAT I'M DONE YET,

ARE YOU STARTING
TO KNOW YOUR PLACE HERE
AT THE ACADEMY YET?

00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:22.000
MAYBE YOU WERE SOMEBODY
BACK AT HOME,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.434
BUT HERE IN THE BIG LEAGUES,

00:14:23.434 --> 00:14:26.037
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A PATHETIC LITTLE AMATEUR,

00:14:26.037 --> 00:14:28.239
SLIFER SLIME.

00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:30.842
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN CARD.

00:14:30.842 --> 00:14:32.677
GO AHEAD, SLACKER.

00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:34.179
[SOBBING]

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:36.014
OH, WHAT WONG, BABY?

00:14:36.014 --> 00:14:37.348
ARE YOU CRYING?

00:14:37.348 --> 00:14:39.017
[LAUGHING]

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:40.185
THIS IS TOO FUN.

00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:41.186
WHAT?

00:14:41.186 --> 00:14:42.921
JUST WHAT I CAME FOR.

00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:45.056
MAN, I MEAN,
THE TRASH TALKING,

00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:46.791
THE ACTION,
IT'S ALL SO GREAT.

00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:48.026
WHAT THE...

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:50.829
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO SPARKMAN.

00:14:53.698 --> 00:14:56.701

ATTACK WITH
STATIC SHOCKWAVE.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.622
STILL THINK IT'S GREAT,
SLACKER?

00:15:17.622 --> 00:15:20.258
BECAUSE WHEN
CHTHONIAN SOLDIER
IS DESTROYED,

00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:22.060
YOU RECEIVE
THE SAME AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.095
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS
AS I DO.

00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:26.397
DIFFERENCE IS--
YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY TO SPARE.

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:32.868
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME,
SLACKER.

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:34.970
YOUR BEST CARD'S
ABOUT TO BE ALL MINE.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.371
THIS ISN'T OVER YET.

00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:38.106
I THROW DOWN
A FACE DOWN.

00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:39.508
PLAY WHAT YOU LIKE.

00:15:39.508 --> 00:15:42.444
MY NEXT ATTACK
WILL FINISH OFF
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:44.546
AND THAT ATTACK'S
COMING RIGHT NOW.

00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:46.214
GO, FLAME WINGMAN!

00:15:46.214 --> 00:15:47.582
NOT SO FAST.

00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:49.718
THAT WAS A TRAP CARD
I JUST THREW.

00:15:49.718 --> 00:15:50.719
A TRAP?

00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:52.354
IT'S MIRROR GATE.

00:15:52.354 --> 00:15:54.856
THEN JADEN'S
STILL IN THIS DUEL
AFTER ALL.

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:57.259
MIRROR GATE
MAKES TWO MONSTERS
IN A BATTLE

00:15:57.259 --> 00:15:59.127
SWITCH WHICH SIDE
THEY'RE ON,

00:15:59.127 --> 00:16:01.596
SO NOW THAT WINGMAN
IS BACK WITH JADEN.

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:10.405
YEAH!

00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:11.640
GO, WINGMAN.

00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:20.849
NOOO!

00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:23.351
AND JUST LIKE
YOU TOLD ME A WHILE AGO,

00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:25.921
DON'T FORGET MY
WINGMAN'S SUPER POWER.

00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:29.491
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THE ATTACK POINTS OF
YOUR DESTROYED MONSTER.

00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:35.197
ALL RIGHT.

00:16:35.197 --> 00:16:37.098
NICE MOVES,
JADEN.

00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:41.970
MORE LIKE LUCKY MOVES
IF YA ASK ME,
YOU SLIFER SCHOOL SCUM.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.006
ALL RIGHT,
I ACTIVATE CHTHONIAN BLAST.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:49.411
NOW, SINCE YOU DESTROYED
ONE OF MY MONSTERS,
I CAN DESTROY ONE OF YOURS,

00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:52.547
AND YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO HALF OF ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:52.547 --> 00:16:54.282
FLAME WINGMAN.

00:16:54.282 --> 00:16:58.687
NOW I ACTIVATE THE TRAP CARD
CALL OF THE HAUNTED.

00:16:58.687 --> 00:17:02.090
IT LETS ME SELECT
ONE MONSTER CARD
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.626
AND SUMMON IT
BACK TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:06.528
RISE, INFERNAL WARRIOR!

00:17:06.528 --> 00:17:09.097
BUT HE WON'T BE STAYING
ON THE FIELD FOR LONG,

00:17:09.097 --> 00:17:14.469
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO
SACRIFICE HIM TO SUMMON
MEFIST THE INFERNAL GENERAL.

00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:15.637
NOT BAD.

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:17.505
NOT BAD?

00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:19.774
YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE,
SLACKER, YOU KNOW THAT?

00:17:19.774 --> 00:17:21.576
ACTING ALL CONFIDENT.

00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:24.312
BUT YOUR LOUSY MONSTERS
WON'T GET YOU
OUT OF THIS JAM.

00:17:28.183 --> 00:17:32.587
I KNOW HE'S WRONG,
KURIBOH.

00:17:32.587 --> 00:17:37.125
BECAUSE CHAZZ
DOESN'T KNOW THAT
MY MONSTERS AND I,

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.628
WE HAVE A BOND.

00:17:39.628 --> 00:17:40.762
Jaden, voice-over:
SPEAKIN' OF...

00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:46.268
UH, GUYS?

00:17:46.268 --> 00:17:48.970
WE GOT COMPANY--
CAMPUS SECURITY.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.105
IF THEY FIND US
ALL IN HERE,

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:51.539
WE'LL GET SERIOUSLY
BUSTED.

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.208
Sy: WHAT?

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:54.276
WHY?

00:17:54.276 --> 00:17:57.345
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL
STUDENTS HERE.

00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:59.881
THE RULES SAY
NO OFF-HOUR
ARENA DUELS.

00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:01.283
CHAZZ KNOWS THAT.

00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:03.785
BUT LET ME GUESS--
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.787
COME ON, LET'S GO.

00:18:05.787 --> 00:18:07.689
WELL, WELL, SLACKER,

00:18:07.689 --> 00:18:10.025
LOOKS LIKE YOU
LUCKED OUT THIS TIME.

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:11.293
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:18:11.293 --> 00:18:12.460
THE MATCH ISN'T OVER.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.695
YEAH, IT IS.

00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:15.797
I'VE SEEN WHAT
I CAME HERE TO SEE.

00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:17.532
YOU'RE A SORRY DUELIST.

00:18:17.532 --> 00:18:19.668
YOU BEATING DR. CROWLER
WAS JUST A FLUKE.

00:18:19.668 --> 00:18:21.670
JADEN, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.771
YEAH,
HE'S RIGHT.

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.607
COME ON, LET'S GO.

00:18:25.607 --> 00:18:26.808
THIS STINKS.

00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:29.611
I HAD THIS GUY
ON THE ROPES.

00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:30.645
COME ON!

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:49.397
YOU CERTAINLY
ARE STUBBORN, JADEN.

00:18:49.397 --> 00:18:52.534
ONLY ABOUT MY DUELING.

00:18:52.534 --> 00:18:54.069
THANKS
FOR SHOWING US
THE BACK WAY OUT.

00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:55.704
SURE.

00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:57.539
I'M SORRY THAT
YOU DIDN'T GET TO FINISH
YOUR MATCH WITH CHAZZ.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:58.940
IT'S OK.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.277
I KNOW JUST HOW IT
WOULD'VE ENDED ANYWAY.

00:19:02.277 --> 00:19:04.012
REALLY?

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:06.414
NO OFFENSE,
BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,

00:19:06.414 --> 00:19:08.950
IT LOOKED LIKE
IT COULD'VE GONE EITHER WAY
BETWEEN YOU AND CHAZZ

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.251
WHEN YOU GUYS STOPPED.

00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:11.252
NO WAY.

00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:12.821
NOT AFTER I DREW THIS.

00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:19.828
WITH MONSTER REBORN,
I SUMMON FLAME WINGMAN
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.670
ATTACK--
SKY-DIVE SCORCHER!

00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:42.150
SEE YA.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:46.488
HEY, WAIT UP.

00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:50.992
Alexis, voice-over:
THIS IS GOING TO BE
ONE INTERESTING YEAR.
