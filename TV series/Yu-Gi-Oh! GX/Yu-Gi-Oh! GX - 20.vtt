I SUMMON
MAIDEN IN LOVE!

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:12.854
SHE'S CUTE!

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:15.390
HMM.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.892
MY TURN NOW!
HERE GOES!

00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:20.194
SO MANY CHOICES,

00:08:20.194 --> 00:08:22.263
BUT I THINK
THAT I'LL GO
WITH THIS ONE:

00:08:22.263 --> 00:08:24.599
ELEMENTAL HERO
AVIAN!

00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:28.803
ATTACK!

00:08:28.803 --> 00:08:31.572
AWW, MY POOR,
HELPLESS MAIDEN.

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:34.208
HEY, WHO SAYS SHE'S YOURS?

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:37.111
HOW ABOUT WE LET
THE MONSTER DO THE
FIGHTING, OK, GUYS?

00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:40.815
Jaden:
QUILL CASCADE!

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:42.684
OH!

00:08:46.287 --> 00:08:48.890
[GROANING]

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.226
YOU MAY HAVE BROKEN
HER HEART, BUT SHE LIVES
TO LOVE ANOTHER DAY!

00:08:52.226 --> 00:08:54.562
SEE, AS LONG AS SHE STAYS
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:57.065
HER SPECIAL ABILITY KEEPS HER
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:08:57.065 --> 00:08:58.499
[THINKING]
HUH?

00:08:58.499 --> 00:09:01.636
OH, WINGED KURIBOH.

00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:04.539
HUH? WHOA!
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?!

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:06.541
MY--MY LADY!

00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.975
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

00:09:07.975 --> 00:09:10.511
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

00:09:10.511 --> 00:09:11.979
HMM.

00:09:11.979 --> 00:09:13.681
WHAT?!

00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.784
Jaden: COME ON, AVIAN!
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:19.620
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN ATTACK MODE,
NOT IN LOVE!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.624
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE
SOME COMPETITION.

00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:27.995
MY MONSTER'S
HEAD OVER HEELS.
COULD IT GET ANY WORSE?

00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:30.631
HMM. ACTUALLY,
IT COULD, JADEN.

00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.635
SEE, MAIDEN IN LOVE HAS
ANOTHER SPECIAL ABILITY, TOO.

00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:37.872
ANY MONSTER THAT ATTACKS HER
GETS A MAIDEN COUNTER.

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:39.640
UH...UH!

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.576
WHAT'S A MAIDEN
COUNTER?

00:09:41.576 --> 00:09:43.411
Blair:
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.712
[GIDDY CHUCKLING]

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:46.647
HMM.

00:09:49.684 --> 00:09:52.387
WELL, MOVING ON!

00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:55.356
HMM.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:56.924
ALL RIGHT!

00:09:56.924 --> 00:10:00.094
I ATTACH THE EQUIP SPELL CARD
CUPID'S KISS TO MY MAIDEN!

00:10:04.031 --> 00:10:06.467
AND NOW...

00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:08.870
I'LL HAVE HER ATTACK!

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.938
MR. AVIAN HERO!

00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.874
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:10:12.874 --> 00:10:14.876
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG!

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:16.043
AH!

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.947
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

00:10:19.947 --> 00:10:22.116
YOU'RE SO MEAN!
[CRYING]

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:24.719
MY LADY, PLEASE ACCEPT
MY APOLOGIES.

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:26.621
OK.

00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:28.055
MM-WAH!

00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:29.090
AH!

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.159
GIMME A BREAK!

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:34.529
NOW, HOW ABOUT DOING ME
A LITTLE FAVOR, MR. AVIAN?

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:35.730
ANYTHING!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.166
GOOD! SEE HIM?

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:40.067
TAKE HIM DOWN!

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:41.836
DONE!

00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:45.706
[GROANING]

00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:48.242
AVIAN!
ARE YOU NUTS?!

00:10:48.242 --> 00:10:50.378
COME ON!
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:10:50.378 --> 00:10:52.814
Jaden: CAN'T YA SEE
SHE'S TOTALLY
JUST USIN' YOU?!

00:10:52.814 --> 00:10:54.816
SHE CAN USE ME
ANYTIME!

00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:56.250
[THINKING]
I NEVER FELT
THIS WAY

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.219
WITHOUT A GRILLED
CHEESE AROUND.

00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:01.355
Blair: SORRY, JADEN,
BUT WHEN MAIDEN TAKES DAMAGE

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:03.925
FROM A MONSTER
THAT'S BEEN PEGGED
WITH A MAIDEN COUNTER,

00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:07.428
THE EQUIP SPELL CUPID'S KISS
AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATES,

00:11:07.428 --> 00:11:10.031
AND THAT LETS ME
TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:13.100
SURE, IT COSTS ME
SOME POINTS, BUT IT'S ABOUT
TO COST YOU A LOT MORE!

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:18.814
WELL, NOW THAT I'VE
TAKEN CONTROL OF
YOUR ONLY MONSTER,

00:11:18.814 --> 00:11:21.216
I THINK I'LL JUST PLAY
A FACE DOWN CARD
AND END MY TURN!

00:11:21.216 --> 00:11:24.753
MAN, AVIAN'S FALLIN'
IN LOVE, AND I'M
FALLIN' BEHIND!

00:11:24.753 --> 00:11:25.854
AH!

00:11:25.854 --> 00:11:27.423
[THINKING]
SPARKMAN!

00:11:27.423 --> 00:11:30.359
BUT IF I ATTACK,
HE'LL FALL FOR MAIDEN
JUST LIKE AVIAN DID.

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:31.994
STILL, I GOTTA DO
SOMETHIN'!

00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:35.731
I SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO SPARKMAN!

00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:42.805
HATE TO DO IT, AVIAN,
BUT YOU'RE EITHER
WITH ME OR AGAINST!

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:47.509
SPARKMAN! ATTACK AVIAN
WITH STATIC SHOCKWAVE!

00:11:48.877 --> 00:11:50.379
DON'T THINK SO!

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:52.147
I USE DEFENSE MAIDEN!

00:11:58.146 --> 00:12:00.716
SEE, IT REDIRECTS
SPARKMAN'S ATTACK

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:04.319
SO THAT THE MAIDEN IN LOVE
GETS HIT INSTEAD OF AVIAN!

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:05.954
OH!

00:12:05.954 --> 00:12:07.789
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:09.758
UH...

00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:11.893
SPARKMAN!

00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.162
YOU DARE STRIKE
A DEFENSELESS MAIDEN?!

00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:16.832
FOR SHAME, SPARKMAN,
FOR SHAME!

00:12:16.832 --> 00:12:18.700
[SOBBING]

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.702
YOU'RE RIGHT!
I'M SO SORRY!

00:12:20.702 --> 00:12:22.204
I BEG YOUR
FORGIVENESS!

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:24.206
I'LL DO ANYTHING!
ANYTHING!

00:12:24.206 --> 00:12:26.208
[THINKING]
ANYTHING?

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:28.710
WELL, NOTHING COMES
TO MIND NOW,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.712
BUT I'M SURE I'LL THINK UP
SOMETHING LATER.

00:12:30.712 --> 00:12:32.280
OH!

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.150
SIMPLY SAY THE WORD,
MY DARLING!

00:12:36.618 --> 00:12:39.554
AND SHE WILL,
NOW THAT HE'S PEGGED
WITH A MAIDEN COUNTER.

[GIGGLING]

00:12:41.423 --> 00:12:45.160
I WANT ONE!
HOW DO I GET
A MAIDEN COUNTER?!

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.963
YEAH, ME TOO!
I WANT ONE, TOO!

00:12:47.963 --> 00:12:49.665
UH, GUYS?
TRY AND REMEMBER

00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:51.900
THAT IT'S JUST
A CARD YOU'RE
LOOKING AT.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.935
TRY AND REMEMBER
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

00:12:53.935 --> 00:12:56.071
WHEN SY AND I WERE
GROWING UP,

00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:59.007
HE USED TO CLAIM
HE WAS GOING STEADY
WITH DARK MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:00.609
IS THAT SO?

00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:02.244
SHE BREAK
YOUR HEART, SY,

00:13:02.244 --> 00:13:04.146
OR DID YOU JUST
DECIDE TO SEE
OTHER MONSTERS?

00:13:04.146 --> 00:13:06.381
ALL RIGHT, HERE I GO!

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:13.121
I ACTIVATE
THE EQUIP SPELL CARD
HAPPY MARRIAGE!

00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.059
NOW MAIDEN GAINS
AS MANY ATTACK POINTS
AS AVIAN HAS!

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:19.961
THAT IS, IF AVIAN SAYS,
"I DO," OF COURSE.

00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.130
IT WOULD BE MY HONOR.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.900
HOORAY!

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.703

NOW LET'S HAVE HER PAY
A VISIT TO SPARKMAN!

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!

00:13:35.977 --> 00:13:38.213
YOU SAID YOU'D DO
ANYTHING FOR ME!

00:13:38.213 --> 00:13:41.216
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
COMMAND ME, MY LOVE.

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:43.218
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
THAT'S BETTER.

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:45.487
WHAT IS YOUR WISH?

[WHIMPERING]

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:51.259

[GROANING]

00:13:57.499 --> 00:14:00.102

STAND THERE, HUBBY.

AH! SORRY, BUT YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO BEAT ME, JADEN!

00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:12.247
I'M DUELING FOR LOVE!

00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:15.250
[GROANING]

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.252
DID SHE SAY DUELING
FOR LOVE?

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:19.321
DOESN'T SHE MEAN
DUELING WITH LOVE?

00:14:19.321 --> 00:14:22.124
DON'T TELL ME
YOU HAVEN'T PUT
THE PIECES TOGETHER YET!

00:14:22.124 --> 00:14:23.125
THINK ABOUT IT, ZANE!

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.227
SHE PUTS ON A DISGUISE,

00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:28.697
TRICKS HER WAY
INTO OUR SCHOOL,
BREAKS INTO YOUR ROOM?

00:14:28.697 --> 00:14:30.932
OH.
SHE'S IN LOVE!

00:14:30.932 --> 00:14:34.402
BIG-TIME, AND SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH YOU, ZANE.

00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:35.937
HMM?

00:14:35.937 --> 00:14:38.073
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:40.509
PLAYIN' TWO GUYS
AGAINST MAIDEN
WASN'T TOO SMART.

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:42.010
BUT, WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.013
NOT MUCH I CAN DO
ABOUT IT NOW.

00:14:45.013 --> 00:14:47.149
OH! OR IS THERE?

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:50.152
OF COURSE!
IT'S SO OBVIOUS!

00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:53.922
IF I'M GONNA TAKE ON
THAT MAIDEN IN LOVE,
I NEED A WOMAN'S TOUCH!

00:14:53.922 --> 00:14:57.058
AND I HAVE JUST THE ONE!

00:14:57.058 --> 00:15:00.929
NOW SET THOSE SAPS
STRAIGHT, BURSTINATRIX!

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:03.298
OH! BURSTINATRIX!

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:05.934
UH, I KNOW
THIS LOOKS BAD, BUT, UH--

00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:07.936
SAVE IT!
YOU TWO ARE PATHETIC.

00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:10.405
BUT YOUR HONEYMOON IS
ABOUT TO BE OVER.

00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:11.807
HUH?
WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW.

00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:18.974
WOW!
YOU GO, BURSTINATRIX!

00:15:18.974 --> 00:15:22.477
NOW LET'S GO GET
OUR MONSTERS BACK!

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:25.080
I ACTIVATE BURST RETURN!

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.549
WHEN BURSTINATRIX IS OUT,
THIS CARD LETS ME BRING BACK

00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:30.018
ALL OTHER ELEMENTAL HEROES
TO MY HAND!

00:15:30.018 --> 00:15:32.287
Jaden: TRUST ME.
YOU GUYS'LL THANK ME FOR IT.

00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:34.957
OH!

00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:36.525
WHAT WAS I THINKING?!

00:15:36.525 --> 00:15:38.060
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED!

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.129
OH, BOY.
SPARKWOMAN'S NEVER
GOING TO FORGIVE ME!

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:43.932
Both: GUY PACT.
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN, OK?!

00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:46.435
HOW ABOUT YOU TWO GUYS
GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW

00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:49.271
OR I'LL TELL
THE ENTIRE DECK?!

00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:51.873
ALL RIGHT,
AND NOW THAT I HAVE
MY HEROES BACK,

00:15:51.873 --> 00:15:54.576
IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE PAYBACK!

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.079
I PLAY
POLYMERIZATION.

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:01.083
AND FUSE TOGETHER
BURSTINATRIX
AND AVIAN

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:04.686
TO CREATE
ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:16:04.686 --> 00:16:06.955
NOW THAT'S
THE PERFECT COUPLE!

00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:09.324
AND THIS IS
THE PERFECT ATTACK!

00:16:09.324 --> 00:16:11.627
INFERNAL RAGE!

00:16:13.261 --> 00:16:14.763
OH!

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.274
THAT'S GAME!

00:16:26.274 --> 00:16:28.143
THANKS FOR
THE SWEET DUEL,
BLAIR.

00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:29.711
THAT WAS FUN!

00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:32.080
ALL RIGHT. GUESS I HAVE TO
TELL YOU MY SECRET NOW.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.182
NAH, I LEARNED
MORE THAN ENOUGH,

00:16:34.182 --> 00:16:36.118
FROM OUR DUEL,
BLAIR.

00:16:36.118 --> 00:16:38.754
AND I THINK OUR
SPECTATORS LEARNED A
FEW THINGS, AS WELL.

00:16:38.754 --> 00:16:41.189
UH...

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:42.758
SURE DID.

00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:45.594
LOVE IS
ON HER MIND, ZANE.

00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:47.763
ZANE, YOU'RE HERE!

00:16:47.763 --> 00:16:49.431
Blair: WELL, THEN...

00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:51.566
I GUESS YOU KNOW.

00:16:51.566 --> 00:16:53.802
I'M THE ONE
WHO SNUCK INTO
YOUR DORM ROOM,

00:16:53.802 --> 00:16:55.604
NOT JADEN.

00:16:55.604 --> 00:16:58.373
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU EVER SINCE
I MET YOU.

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:00.542
HMM, AT NATIONALS.

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:02.210
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.780
WE MET RIGHT
AFTER YOU WON THE
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH!

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.748
IT WAS THEN I MADE
A PLEDGE:

00:17:06.748 --> 00:17:08.850
THAT I WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO BE
WITH YOU!

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.385
AWW!
AWW.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:13.388
I REMEMBER, YOU SAID
THAT IF I TRAINED
REALLY REALLY HARD,

00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:16.224
I COULD GET
INTO DUEL ACADEMY
LIKE YOU, SO I DID!

00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:17.626
AND NOW
THAT I'M HERE,

00:17:17.626 --> 00:17:19.327
WE CAN GET MARRIED!

00:17:19.327 --> 00:17:20.395
[GIGGLING]

00:17:21.763 --> 00:17:24.733
HA! GET MARRIED.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE!

00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:26.735
YOUR HONEYMOON COULD
BE IN THE CAFETERIA.

00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:28.737
DR. CROWLER COULD
GIVE YOU AWAY!

00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:30.739
I'M NOT JOKING.

00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:32.240
Alexis: BLAIR, SWEETIE,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.209
LOVE DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

00:17:34.209 --> 00:17:37.846
YOU CAN'T SNEAK YOUR WAY
INTO SOMEBODY'S HEART.

00:17:37.846 --> 00:17:39.681
JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MAIDEN.

00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:41.783
SHE USED TRICKS TO GET LOVE,

00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:44.352
AND SHE ENDED UP ALONE
AND IN TEARS.

00:17:44.352 --> 00:17:47.789
YOU CAN'T USE SPELLS
OR DISGUISES TO FIND
YOUR SOUL MATE, BLAIR.

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:50.258
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST
AND UP-FRONT WITH THEM.

00:17:50.258 --> 00:17:53.128
YEAH, RIGHT!
YOU JUST WANT ZANE
FOR YOURSELF!

00:17:53.128 --> 00:17:55.130
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GIT RID A' ME!

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.065
HEH HEH! ZANE,
A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE?

00:17:57.065 --> 00:18:00.435
BLAIR, AS FLATTERED AS I AM
BY YOUR AFFECTIONS...

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:01.837
PHEW!

00:18:01.837 --> 00:18:04.773
RIGHT NOW, I'M
ONLY IN LOVE WITH
ONE THING: DUELING.

00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:06.541
DUELING?

00:18:10.178 --> 00:18:14.116
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GO HOME.

00:18:14.116 --> 00:18:16.451
WAIT. WHY DOES SHE
HAVE TO GO HOME?

00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:18.220
'CUZ YOU SAY SO?
HELLO!

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.123
SHE'S A STUDENT HERE
AT DUEL ACADEMY,
AND A GOOD ONE!

00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:23.358
JADEN,
SHE HAS TO GO HOME.

00:18:23.358 --> 00:18:26.495
HUH? OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
HERE, ZANE.

00:18:26.495 --> 00:18:29.598
YOU'RE PUSHING HER
OUT BECAUSE SHE'S
A GOOD STUDENT!

00:18:29.598 --> 00:18:32.334
HA! BECAUSE SHE
MIGHT DETHRONE YOU!

00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:34.903
SHE HAS TO GO HOME
BECAUSE SHE'S
IN SECOND GRADE.

00:18:34.903 --> 00:18:36.638
UH, SAY WHAT?!

00:18:36.638 --> 00:18:38.073
Both: IN SECOND GRADE?

00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:41.676
OH, SO THEN YOU'RE
SAYIN' THAT I ALMOST
GOT BEAT BY A GIRL

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.712
WHO'S ONLY
EIGHT YEARS OLD?!

00:18:43.712 --> 00:18:45.247
OH!

00:18:46.882 --> 00:18:49.651
EIGHT AND A HALF,
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER.

00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:50.852
AAAH!

00:18:50.852 --> 00:18:52.921
[CRYING]

00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:54.990
THAT'S WHY DUELING'S
SO GREAT!

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.959
IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO DRAW, YOU'RE OLD
ENOUGH TO WIN!

00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:04.900
Blair: GOOD-BYE!

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.969
I'LL BE BACK JUST AS SOON
AS I FINISH GRADE SCHOOL!

00:19:07.969 --> 00:19:11.072
AND MIDDLE SCHOOL, TOO,
BUT I'LL BE BACK,
YOU GUYS!

00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:13.141
HA HA!
HEAR THAT, ZANE?

00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.011
OH, PLEASE, I'LL BE
LONG GONE BY THE TIME
SHE GETS HERE.

00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:17.579
THAT'S TRUE.

00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:20.015
I GUESS BLAIR'S CRUSH
ENDS RIGHT HERE.

00:19:20.015 --> 00:19:21.850
Zane:
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.552
GOOD-BYE, JADEN!

00:19:23.552 --> 00:19:25.487
MY SWEET PRINCE!

00:19:25.487 --> 00:19:27.923
I LOVE YOU!

00:19:27.923 --> 00:19:29.157
WHAT?!

00:19:29.157 --> 00:19:30.692
WAIT! SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO LIKE ZANE!

00:19:30.692 --> 00:19:33.728
SHE DOES LIKE ZANE,
BUT APPARENTLY,
SHE LOVES YOU.

00:19:33.728 --> 00:19:36.298
GOOD LUCK.

00:19:36.298 --> 00:19:38.300
Syrus:
UH, HEY, CHUMLEY,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.734
WANNA GO GET
SOME NEW CARDS?

00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:41.303
YEAH, I GOT ONE IN MIND.

00:19:41.303 --> 00:19:42.871
Alexis: JUST DO ME
A FAVOR, FELLAS,

00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:45.040
AND STAY AWAY
FROM THE GIRLS
IN MY DECK.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.541
I'LL SEE YOU SOON!

00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:48.109
WRITE ME EVERY DAY!

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:50.779
I LOVE YOU, JADEN,
SWEETIE!

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:55.217
AW! WISH THEY MADE CARDS
TO COUNTER THIS.
