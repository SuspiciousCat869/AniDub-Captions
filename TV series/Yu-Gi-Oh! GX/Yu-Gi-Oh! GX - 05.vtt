00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:28.515
OR YOU COULD SAY
THAT WE'VE FOUND

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.016
A COUPLE PLACES
WHERE IT'S NOT!

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.651
YEAH, WELL WE'VE
BEEN FINDING PLACES

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.253
FOR OVER AN HOUR
NOW, BUT THEN,

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:35.255
I GUESS IT COULD
BE WORSE FOR SY.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:36.423
HUH? FOR SY?

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:37.724
YEAH, WE COULD BE NEAR

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:40.894
A LAKE OF "DIRTY,
SWAMP WATER."

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.529
VERY FUNNY, BUT
YOU WERE THE ONE

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.097
WHO REFUSED TO BATHE

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:46.499
'CAUSE YOU WERE
SCARED OF THE BATH
WATER LAST NIGHT.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.236
HA! WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
CLEANED IT ONCE IN AWHILE

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:51.104
IT WOULDN'T BE
SO SWAMPISH!

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:52.105
MAYBE IF YOU
GREW UP

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.040
AND STARTED TO
TAKE SHOWERS!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.176
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT!

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.711
CHECK OUT WHAT'S
BEHIND IT!

00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.312
THE OLD DORM!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.081
AND PROBABLY LOTS
OF GHOSTS, TOO!

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:03.750
RELAX, GUYS.

HUH?!

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.757

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.129
THAT'S FUNNY.

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.197
I WAS ABOUT
TO ASK YOU GUYS

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:18.698
THE VERY SAME THING.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.433
WE HEARD ABOUT
THE ABANDONED DORM

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:21.635
AND WANTED TO
CHECK IT OUT.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.136
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY INTELLIGENT.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.638
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
KIDS HAVE A WAY

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.473
OF DISAPPEARING
AROUND HERE?

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:27.574
AW, COME ON.

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:28.708
THAT'S JUST
SOME URBAN MYTH.

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.010
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.745
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.146
WHY ELSE WOULD
THE ACADEMY

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.649
MAKE THIS PLACE
COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN!

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:37.183
THEY CATCH YOU HERE,

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.752
AND THEY'LL
EXPEL YOU, JADEN.

YEAH, SURE, OK, SO THEN
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.555
I HAVE MY REASONS,
THAT'S WHY!

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.190
WHOA, ALEXIS,
NO NEED TO SNAP!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.159
WE JUST CAME HERE
TO LOOK AROUND,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.827

OUT OF YOUR WAY,

ABOUT IT.

THEN THE RUMORS
AREN'T JUST RUMORS!

SO TOTALLY
MOVE IN HERE!

HAS SOMETHING TO DO

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:09.735
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN...

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:12.471
I SUMMON YOU OUT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:21.046
AND I'M GONNA THROW DOWN
TWO FACE-DOWNS AS WELL!

00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:23.582
TOO BAD YOU WON'T HAVE
A CHANCE TO USE THEM!

00:14:23.582 --> 00:14:25.985
I SUMMON
TERRORKING ARCHFIEND

00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:27.453
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:27.453 --> 00:14:29.955
[ROAR]

00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:33.526
NOW, YOU HAVE TWO VICIOUS
ARCHFIENDS TO CONTEND WITH,

00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:35.761
AND THANKS TO
THE SPECIAL ABILITY

00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:37.263
OF THE INFERNAL QUEEN...

00:14:37.263 --> 00:14:39.798
THE TERRORKING'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:14:39.798 --> 00:14:42.168
AUTOMATICALLY
INCREASE BY 1,000,

00:14:42.168 --> 00:14:44.403
MAKING HIM AN EVEN
MORE FIENDISH FORCE

00:14:44.403 --> 00:14:45.804
TO BE RECKONED WITH!

00:14:47.673 --> 00:14:49.808
3,000 ATTACK POINTS?

00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:51.043
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:14:51.043 --> 00:14:53.445
AND NOW I'M GOING TO
PUT THEM ALL TO USE.

00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:55.948
TERRORKING ARCHFIEND...

00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:57.917
ATTACK AVIAN!

00:14:57.917 --> 00:14:59.752
LOCUST-STORM BARRAGE!

00:15:02.087 --> 00:15:03.455
NO WAY!

00:15:03.455 --> 00:15:05.324
YOU FORGOT ABOUT
MY FACEDOWN CARD--

00:15:05.324 --> 00:15:06.625
MIRROR GATE!

00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:11.297
THIS TRAP CARD
CAUSES OUR MONSTERS

00:15:11.297 --> 00:15:12.565
TO TRADE PLACES--

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:14.867
MY AVIAN FOR
YOUR TERRORKING!

00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:17.870
SO, NOW ALL THOSE
3,000 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.006
ARE GONNA BE GOING
TO WORK FOR ME!

00:15:21.006 --> 00:15:22.374
YOU REALLY
THOUGHT YOU COULD

00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:24.176
BAIT ME INTO A TRAP?!

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:25.244
LOOK AROUND YOU

00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:26.545
AND TELL ME
WHO'S TRAPPED.

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:27.613
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

00:15:27.613 --> 00:15:29.148
I MEAN YOUR TRAP
WON'T WORK

00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:30.950
AGAINST MY
TERRORKING!

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.419
IT SIMPLY ACTIVATES
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY--

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:35.888
AN ABILITY THAT WILL
DETERMINE OUR MONSTERS' FATE

00:15:35.888 --> 00:15:37.189
BY WAY OF CHANCE!

00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:43.963
OH, MAN...

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:45.431
YOU SEE,
WHEN HE'S TARGETED

00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:46.732
BY AN OPPONENT'S EFFECT,

00:15:46.732 --> 00:15:48.100
TERRORKING'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.969
GIVES ME
A GAMBLING CHANCE--

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:52.771
A NUMBER BETWEEN ONE AND 6
IS SELECTED AT RANDOM--

00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:55.074
AND IF IT HAPPENS
TO BE A TWO OR A 5...

00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:57.776
THEN YOUR TRAP'S DESTROYED
AND ARCHFIEND STAYS

00:15:57.776 --> 00:15:59.511
TO FIGHTS ON MY SIDE.

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.546
SO...

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:02.114
LET'S SPIN
THE WHEEL OF FATE

00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:04.216
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS,
SHALL WE?

00:16:08.988 --> 00:16:10.122
IT'S OK...

00:16:10.122 --> 00:16:11.724
THE ODDS ARE WAY
IN JADEN'S FAVOR.

00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:13.392
YOU FLUNKED
MATH, CHUMLEY!

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:17.162
NO, I GOT A 54.

00:16:17.162 --> 00:16:18.998
Man: TWO!

00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:21.033
IT SEEMS AS
THOUGH THE CHANCE

00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:23.435
HAS FAVORED
THE TERRORKING ARCHFIEND!

00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:25.404
MIRROR GATE
IS SHATTERED!

00:16:25.404 --> 00:16:27.506
LOCUST-STORM BARRAGE,

00:16:27.506 --> 00:16:29.174
FINISH HIM!

00:16:29.174 --> 00:16:31.043
[ROAR]

00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:34.546
WELL, THAT STINKS!

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:36.682
BUT AT LEAST IT
ACTIVATES MY OTHER TRAP!

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:38.050
HERO SIGNAL!

00:16:41.287 --> 00:16:43.656
WHEN MY MONSTER IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:45.958
THIS TRAP CARD ALLOWS ME
TO AUTOMATICALLY

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.393
SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM MY DECK

00:16:47.393 --> 00:16:50.329
OR MY HAND WITH "ELEMENTAL
HERO" IN ITS NAME!

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:53.265
AND I SUMMON,
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN!

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:55.167
DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:57.036
[GRUNTING]

00:16:58.904 --> 00:17:00.306
OH, WAY TO DUEL!

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:03.275
THAT CLAYMAN SHOULD
KEEP JADEN SAFE!

00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:05.277
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:06.278
HMM?

00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:08.781
AT LEAST, NOT FROM THIS!

00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:10.649
[GASPS]

00:17:14.553 --> 00:17:17.413
NOW THE SHADOW GAMES
HAVE TRULY BEGUN!

00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:19.816
[GRUNTING]

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:22.785
DON'T YOUR LIFE POINTS SEEM
SO UTTERLY INSIGNIFICANT

00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:25.655
NOW THAT IT'S YOUR VERY
LIFE THAT'S AT RISK?

00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:26.923
[GASPING]

00:17:26.923 --> 00:17:28.090
JADEN!
NO!

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.159
HEY, MY ARM!

00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:31.260
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.029
IT IS THE WAY
OF THE SHADOWS,

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:36.098
TRANSCENDING THE GAME,
ATTACKING YOUR BODY!

00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:38.634
OH! HEY, I CAN'T
MOVE MY FEET!

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:40.203
OF COURSE NOT.

00:17:40.203 --> 00:17:42.205
AS THE SHADOW
FOG ROLLS PAST,

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:43.806
YOU ALL WILL FEEL
THE DARKNESS

00:17:43.806 --> 00:17:45.341
TAKE YOU INTO ITS GRIP--

00:17:45.341 --> 00:17:46.342
COMPLETELY.

00:17:46.342 --> 00:17:47.376
THE AIR!

00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:48.444
GETTING TOUGH
TO BREATHE!

00:17:48.444 --> 00:17:51.147
YOU ARE AT THE MERCY
OF THE NIGHT, NOW!

00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:53.449
Syrus: I--I CAN'T
FEEL ANYTHING!

00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:55.117
TREASURE THE NUMBNESS--

00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.552
FOR IT WILL NOT LAST!

00:17:56.552 --> 00:17:58.788
SOON, YOU WILL BE DRAWN
INTO AN INFINITE CHASM

00:17:58.788 --> 00:18:00.990
OF ETERNAL DARKNESS
WHERE EVERY WAKING MOMENT

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.391
WILL BE FILLED
WITH A GAPING--

00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:03.392
Jaden: WHAT?
GIVE ME A BREAK!

00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:04.427
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?

00:18:04.427 --> 00:18:05.528
SO WHAT?

00:18:05.528 --> 00:18:07.096
BACK AT OUR DORM, WE
GOT BLACKOUT CURTAINS

00:18:07.096 --> 00:18:08.498
SO THAT WE
CAN SLEEP IN LATER.

00:18:08.498 --> 00:18:10.333
I'M NOT SCARED OF
THE DARK--IT'S GREAT!

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:11.834
HMM.

00:18:11.834 --> 00:18:13.603
BUT YOUR
BLACKOUT CURTAINS

00:18:13.603 --> 00:18:16.205
DO NOT WIELD THE SAME
KIND OF MYSTIC POWER

00:18:16.205 --> 00:18:18.508
AS MY MILLENNIUM
ITEM DOES.

00:18:18.508 --> 00:18:19.509
WHOA.

00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:20.510
OH, NO.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.644
TROUBLE!

00:18:21.644 --> 00:18:24.013
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:18:24.013 --> 00:18:25.114
BUT MAKE IT COUNT,

00:18:25.114 --> 00:18:27.016
IT MAY BE YOUR LAST!

00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:28.017
Jaden, thinking:
WOW...

00:18:28.017 --> 00:18:29.151
MILLENNIUM ITEMS,

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.720
A SHADOW FOG...

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.989
WHO COULD ASK FOR
A BETTER CHALLENGE?!

00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:35.324
[THINKING]
WHAT IS HE
SMILING ABOUT?!

00:18:35.324 --> 00:18:36.626
ALL RIGHT, JADEN...

00:18:36.626 --> 00:18:38.461
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:39.629
HERE GOES, BUDDY.

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:42.164
FOR MY MOVE, I PLAY...

00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:45.868
THE SPELL CARD
POT OF GREED!

00:18:45.868 --> 00:18:48.604
AND I'LL FUSE THIS
ELEMENTAL HERO SPARKMAN

00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:50.373
WITH MY CLAYMAN
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:53.576
[GROWLING]

00:18:57.647 --> 00:18:59.649

[ROARS]

00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:07.557
AND NOW I'LL USE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:19:07.557 --> 00:19:09.358
WHICH LET'S ME
DESTROY A MONSTER

WHOSE ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.062
ARE LOWER THAN HIS!

00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:15.464
NOW, THUNDER GIANT,
LET LOOSE...

00:19:15.464 --> 00:19:17.199

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.971
UH-OH.

00:19:23.806 --> 00:19:27.777
I ACTIVATE TERRORKING

00:19:27.777 --> 00:19:29.145
SPIN ROULETTE!

00:19:31.647 --> 00:19:32.949
OH, NO.

I WIN AGAIN!

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.895
IT SEEMS AS
THOUGH EVEN FATE

00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:48.030
ISN'T ON YOUR SIDE
HALF THE TIME!

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.199
AND NOW YOU WILL
PAY THE PRICE!

00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:53.569

THIS IS TOTALLY

THAT SHADOW DUELIST'S

00:20:08.184 --> 00:20:10.519
CAN USE THAT ROULETTE
TO SAVE HIMSELF!

AND THIS CHOKING
DARK FOG

ISN'T EXACTLY HELPING

HERE TO SAVE ALEXIS
