00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:41.367
AND I SUMMON VAMPIRE BAT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:42.869 --> 00:08:45.338
AND WITH MY WINGED FRIEND
OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:47.607
EVERY ZOMBIE MONSTER
I HAVE OUT

00:08:47.607 --> 00:08:51.110
GAINS 200
ATTACK POINTS!

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.379
DON'T THE 3 OF YOU
LOOK SO CUTE!

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:54.714
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAD BAGS,

00:08:54.714 --> 00:08:56.583
YOU COULD GO
TRICK OR TREATING!

00:08:56.583 --> 00:08:59.085
THE ONLY TREAT
WILL BE YOUR DEMISE!

00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:03.356
ZOMBIE WEREWOLF,
GO SIC THAT GEAR SOLDIER,

00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:05.859
MIDNIGHT POUNCE!

00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:07.727
[HOWLS]

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:11.264
WELL, WELL.

00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:12.265
IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT YOUR MUTT

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:13.399
STILL HAS
SOME BITE IN HIM

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:15.034
AFTER ALL.

00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:16.936
NO MATTER, I STILL HAVE
MORE LIFE POINTS.

00:09:16.936 --> 00:09:19.706
PERHAPS.
BUT NOT FOR MUCH LONGER!

00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:23.710
VAMPIRE BAT,
ATTACK WITH SWARMING SCOURGE!

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.578
[SQUEAKING]

00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:31.384
[GROANING]

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:33.887
I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL
THEIR LITTLE TEETH!

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:36.322
THIS ISN'T SOME
DUELING HOLOGRAM,

00:09:36.322 --> 00:09:38.391
THIS IS REAL!

00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:40.560
AND THAT CAN ONLY
MEAN ONE THING--

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.229
THIS IS REALLY
A SHADOW GAME, TOO!

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:50.175
Syrus: CROWLER'S
TAKING A BEATING.

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:51.710
NO, HE CAN'T!

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.978
IF CROWLER
DOESN'T WIN,

00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:55.447
HE'LL LOSE HIS KEY
AND SOUL!

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:56.582
WHAT WILL WE DO?!

00:09:57.983 --> 00:09:59.451
AAH!

00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:01.787
HA HA HA!
FOR RUBBER BATS,

00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:05.123
THEY PACK QUITE A WALLOP,
DON'T THEY?

00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:07.826
LISTEN, DEAR,
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ENDURE THIS.

00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:10.496
STEP DOWN, AND I'LL DUEL
THAT ONE IN WHITE.

00:10:10.496 --> 00:10:12.030
YOU HEAR THAT, ZANE?

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.600
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH
YOU'RE HER TYPE.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.068
YES,
OR HER BLOOD TYPE!

00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:17.836
SO HOW ABOUT IT?

00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:20.072
GIVE ME YOUR STUDENT,
AND I'LL LET YOU GO FREE.

00:10:20.072 --> 00:10:22.307
Crowler: AS TEMPTING
AS YOUR OFFER IS,

00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:25.210
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.546
I WON'T LET YOU LAY
A FINGER ON MY STUDENTS!

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:28.914
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:10:28.914 --> 00:10:30.282
I AM THE LEADING
PROFESSOR

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.085
AT THE MOST FAMOUS DUEL
ACADEMY IN THE WORLD!

00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.120
AND IF YOU WANT TO GET
TO MY PUPILS,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.756
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GET THROUGH
YOURS TRULY.

00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:40.659
BUT YOU CAN BARELY
STAND, CROWLER!

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.228
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:45.998
I STILL HAVE
A DECK IN MY HAND,

00:10:45.998 --> 00:10:48.967
AND A FEW TRICKS
UP MY SLEEVE!

00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:50.736
LIKE THIS, FOR EXAMPLE!

00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:54.106
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN CARD,
DAMAGE CONDENSER!

00:10:54.106 --> 00:10:55.474
IT SUMMONS A MONSTER
FROM MY DECK

00:10:55.474 --> 00:10:56.842
WHOSE ATTACK POINTS
ARE EQUAL OR LESS

00:10:56.842 --> 00:10:59.645
THAN THE DAMAGE YOU'VE
JUST INFLICTED ON ME.

00:10:59.645 --> 00:11:02.214
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE MORE PAIN YOU DEAL,

00:11:02.214 --> 00:11:04.416
THE MORE HURT
YOU'LL FEEL!

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.785
RISE,
ANCIENT GEAR SOLDIER!

00:11:08.554 --> 00:11:10.822
BUT HE WON'T
BE AROUND FOR LONG.

00:11:12.452 --> 00:11:15.255
I'LL NOW SACRIFICE
THE ANCIENT
GEAR SOLDIER,

00:11:15.255 --> 00:11:17.824
SO I CAN SUMMON
MY OWN 4-LEGGED FRIEND,

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:19.559
THE ANCIENT GEAR BEAST!

00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:23.163
AND AS YOU'RE
ABOUT TO SEE,

00:11:23.163 --> 00:11:24.798
HE'S WELL-TRAINED!

00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:26.233
GO,
ANCIENT GEAR BEAST!

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:27.668
SHOW THAT
ZOMBIE WEREWOLF

00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:29.303
WHO'S TOP DOG!

00:11:29.303 --> 00:11:31.571
DON'T DO IT!
IF YOU WIN,

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:32.572
SHE'LL
BRING BACK

00:11:32.572 --> 00:11:34.341
THE WEREWOLF
ALL OVER AGAIN!

00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:35.575
HELLO!

00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:37.177
APPRECIATE THE ADVICE,

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:39.980
BUT YOU'RE FORGETTING
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY:

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.448
ANCIENT GEAR BEAST
CANCELS THE EFFECT

00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:43.450
OF ANY DESTROYED MONSTER!

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.585
CLEVER CALCULATION.

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.287
YES,
GOOD THINKING!

00:11:47.287 --> 00:11:49.956
NOW, ATTACK ZOMBIE WEREWOLF!

00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:55.162
[WHINING]

00:11:58.265 --> 00:11:59.933
HA HA HA!

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:01.201
IF YOU'D
LIKE SOME HELP

00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:02.903
WITH YOUR DUELING
STRATEGY,

00:12:02.903 --> 00:12:05.439
FEEL FREE
TO STOP BY MY CLASS.

00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:07.207
MAYBE CROWLER'S
LESSON PLANS
REALLY DO WORK.

00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:08.275
QUIET.

00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:11.478
HE'LL ONLY GIVE US
MORE HOMEWORK!

00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:13.046
NICE MOVE.

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:15.615
PITY YOU WON'T HAVE
MANY MORE.

00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:19.553
I CAST THE FIELD SPELL,
INFERNALVANIA!

00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:27.427
BUT YOU'LL DESTROY
EVERYTHING WITH THAT!

00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:28.795
EXACTLY!

00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:32.799
BY DISCARDING A ZOMBIE
MONSTER FROM MY HAND,

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:35.302
I CAN SEND EVERY CREATURE
THAT IS ON THE FIELD

00:12:35.302 --> 00:12:36.903
STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:38.138
THAT'S TRUE.

00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:39.439
BUT DON'T YOU
FORGET,

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:41.842
BY USING THAT
INFERNALVANIA,

00:12:41.842 --> 00:12:43.944
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE ALLOWED TO
NORMAL SUMMON

00:12:43.944 --> 00:12:45.946
YOUR MONSTERS
ANYMORE.

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:47.147
SO WHAT?

00:12:47.147 --> 00:12:49.349
WHO SAYS I NEED
ANY MORE MONSTERS,

00:12:49.349 --> 00:12:51.451
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:53.253
DON'T PLAY GAMES
WITH ME.

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:55.956
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THAT BAT OF YOURS!

00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:57.491
BUT DO YOUR STUDENTS?!

00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:01.194
DO THEY KNOW MY VAMPIRE BAT
CAN BE MADE INDESTRUCTIBLE

00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:04.331
BY SIMPLY DISCARDING
ANOTHER ONE FROM MY DECK?

00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:07.033
OR DID YOU SKIP
THAT CHAPTER?

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:08.034
OH, DEAR!

00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:09.102
BUT FIRST,

00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:11.438
I'LL DISCARD ONE
OF MY ZOMBIE MONSTERS,

00:13:11.438 --> 00:13:13.340
FOR INFERNALVANIA!

00:13:19.446 --> 00:13:20.747
AND LIKE I SAID,

00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:23.350
NOW I'LL JUST DISCARD
ANOTHER VAMPIRE BAT

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.552
TO KEEP THIS ONE
ON MY FIELD!

00:13:29.156 --> 00:13:31.224
NOW,
ATTACK THE GOOD PROFESSOR!

00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:39.466
NO, NOT AGAIN!

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:42.135
I CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS.

00:13:42.135 --> 00:13:43.970
HE NEEDS OUR HELP.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.739
NO! STAY BACK!

00:13:45.739 --> 00:13:49.810
THIS IS MY DUEL,
AND MY DUEL ALONE!

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.045
YOU MUST PROTECT
YOUR KEYS.

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.313
UNH...

00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:57.884
CROWLER!

00:13:57.884 --> 00:14:00.053
WE CAN'T JUST STAND HERE
AND DO NOTHING!

00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:02.189
YES,
I COMPLETELY AGREE
WITH YOU, DARLING.

00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:03.790
PLEASE STEP IN.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.593
SAVE YOUR TEACHER,
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
HE CAN'T SAVE HIMSELF.

00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:07.594
Jaden: WRONG!

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:08.995
OH?

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:11.465
Students: JADEN?!

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.433
DR. CROWLER
CAN WIN THIS DUEL!

00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:15.335
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

00:14:15.335 --> 00:14:16.536
IT'S SLACKER.

00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:18.305
I KNOW BECAUSE
I'VE DUELED HIM!

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:21.141
BELIEVE ME,
HE CAN THROW DOWN!

00:14:21.141 --> 00:14:23.610
AND HE'LL FIND
A WAY TO BEAT YOU!

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.247
SO GET UP, DR. CROWLER!
AND GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:34.081
I AM NOT GIVING UP!

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.216
OH, ARE YOU STILL HERE?

00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:38.118
YOU HAD BETTER
BELIEVE IT.

00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:39.920
AND HERE TO STAY, TOO,
MISSY!

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.921
YOU SEE,
THOUGH IT MAKES ME

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.422
SLIGHTLY ILL
TO ADMIT IT,

00:14:42.422 --> 00:14:44.591
JADEN IS
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:47.327
I CAN BEAT YOU!
I CAN THROW DOWN,

00:14:47.327 --> 00:14:49.129
AND I CAN GET
MY GAME ON!

00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:50.397
BLECH, I SUDDENLY
FEEL THE NEED

00:14:50.397 --> 00:14:52.165
TO RINSE MY MOUTH OUT.

00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:54.201
COME ON,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD, TEACH.

00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:55.202
YES, PERHAPS.

00:14:55.202 --> 00:14:56.203
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT IS?

00:14:56.203 --> 00:14:57.204
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:14:57.204 --> 00:14:58.538
IT'S TRUE.

00:14:58.538 --> 00:15:02.276
TO WIN, CROWLER WILL NEED
TO MOUNT QUITE A COMEBACK.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.343
NOW, LET'S DUEL!

00:15:06.413 --> 00:15:09.516
I SUMMON ANCIENT GEAR
GOLEM IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:12.219
CHECK IT!
CROWLER'S BEST MONSTER!

00:15:12.219 --> 00:15:13.954
BUT WHERE'S
THE SACRIFICE?

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:16.923
IT'S ON THE FIELD.
THE ANCIENT GEAR CASTLE.

00:15:16.923 --> 00:15:18.725
A VERY SKILLFUL MOVE.

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:21.361
SEE, WHEN SUMMONING A MONSTER
WITH "ANCIENT" IN ITS NAME,

00:15:21.361 --> 00:15:23.563
YOU CAN SACRIFICE
ANCIENT GEAR CASTLE,

00:15:23.563 --> 00:15:25.866
AND IT COUNTS AS THE SAME
NUMBER OF SACRIFICES

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:28.402
AS HOWEVER MANY MONSTERS
YOU'VE SUMMONED SO FAR.

00:15:28.402 --> 00:15:29.803
NOW, GEAR GOLEM,

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:32.906
ATTACK VAMPIRE BAT
WITH MECHANIZED MELEE!

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:39.743
UNH!

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:43.113
DID YOU FORGET
THAT VAMPIRE BAT
CAN'T BE DESTROYED?

00:15:43.113 --> 00:15:45.115
BUT AS INFERNALVANIA
WILL DEMONSTRATE,

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:46.483
YOUR GOLEM CAN!

00:15:46.483 --> 00:15:47.918
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:15:47.918 --> 00:15:48.919
HUH?

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:50.721
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:53.724
OH, JUST DESTROY EVERY
TRAP AND SPELL CARD

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:56.193
ON THE ENTIRE FIELD!

00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:59.597
SUFFER THE WRATH
OF HEAVY STORM!

00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:03.100
UNH!

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:11.141
YOU MUST BE QUITE A BORE
FOR YOUR STUDENTS,
