THE VERY BEST

BUT YOU DO REALIZE, CLASS,

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.844
THAT THERE WERE
OTHER GREAT DUELISTS
WELL BEFORE ALL OF THEM.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.782
HOW IS THAT, PROF?

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:00.623
I MEAN, DUEL MONSTERS
HASN'T BEEN AROUND
ALL THAT LONG.

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:03.598
GUESS YOU WERE ASLEEP
DURING THAT CLASS, JADEN.

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:05.871

BACK IN ANCIENT EGYPT.

HUH.

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:08.311
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.750
AND ONE OF THE BEST
WAY BACK IN THOSE DAYS

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.026
WAS A POWERFUL PHARAOH
NAMED ABIDOS THE THIRD.

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.965
ABIDOS WAS UNDEFEATED.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.706

THAT'S SO SWEET.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.544
HE MUST'VE BEEN
SOMETHIN' ELSE.

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:22.917
OF COURSE, IT'S
A GOOD THING HE'S
NOT AROUND TODAY,

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:25.825
CUZ THEN THAT UNDEFEATED
RECORD WOULD GO ADIOS.

SURE IT WOULD,
SLACKER,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.038

PROBABLY TAKE DOWN

THAN "SARCASM."

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.350
DUELIN'S NOT
WHAT IT USED TO BE,
HUH, OLD-TIMER?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.322
NO. IT'S MUCH TAMER NOW,

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:27.561
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU
A TASTE OF THE OLD SCHOOL.

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.868
I PLAY SECOND SARCOPHAGUS,

00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:31.907
AND ONCE THE THIRD
IS PLAYED,

00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:35.382
THIS DUEL AND YOUR SOUL
WILL BE MINE.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:36.853
HMM.

00:08:36.853 --> 00:08:38.290
WHAT'S IT DO?

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.864
OHH, I DON'T
WANNA KNOW.

00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:44.674
NEXT, I'LL PLAY
MY POT OF GREED.

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:50.991
THIS LETS ME DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS FROM MY DECK,

00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:53.331
AND I THINK I'LL
PLAY ONE RIGHT NOW.

00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.503
GO, TRIBUTE TO THE DOOMED.

00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:58.077
NOW, BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD FROM MY HAND,

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.817
YOUR AVIAN
IS DESTROYED...

00:09:03.123 --> 00:09:05.095
AND NEXT, I'LL PLAY

00:09:05.095 --> 00:09:09.641
PHARAOH'S SERVANT
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:12.649
NOW STICK HIM.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.325
AAH!

00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:18.198
AAH! AAH!

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:19.468
JADEN!

00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:22.108
MY UNDEFEATED RECORD
WILL BE STAYING INTACT,

00:09:22.108 --> 00:09:23.812
BUT YOU WILL NOT.

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:28.725
DON'T WORRY, KEY-KEEPER.

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:31.733
AFTER I PLAY THIS FACEDOWN,
IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN,

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:34.408
IF YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH
LEFT TO PLAY IT, THAT IS.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.179
HMM.
HMM?

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:37.482
COME ON.

00:09:37.482 --> 00:09:40.424
GIVE US PRESENT-DAY
PEEPS SOME CREDIT.

00:09:40.424 --> 00:09:43.833
MY GO, AND I PLAY
THIS CARD.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.738
IT'S EMERGENCY CALL,

00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:47.509
AND IT SPRINGS
AN ELEMENTAL HERO

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.715
FROM MY DECK
TO MY HAND,

00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:51.286
AND THE HERO
I'M SPRINGIN'

00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:54.327
IS GONNA BE
SPARKMAN...

00:09:57.202 --> 00:09:58.472
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.478
NEXT, I'M PLAYING
THE SPELL CARD

00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:02.516
KNOWN AS
RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE.

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:04.254
WHAT'S THAT DO?

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:07.830
FOR EVERY ELEMENTAL HERO
THAT JADEN HAS
OUT ON HIS FIELD,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.008
WELL, THEN ONE
OF ABIDOS' TRAP OR SPELL
CARDS IS DESTROYED.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.189
YEAH, LIKE THAT
FIRST SARCOPHAGUS
YOU GOT OVER THERE.

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:21.133
WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
NOT GOING TO BE SEEIN'
WHAT IT DOES AFTER ALL.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.803
RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE,

00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:25.344
DESTROY
THE FIRST SARCOPHAGUS.

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:28.519
I DON'T THINK SO.
GO, MAGIC JAMMER.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:32.964
IT TURNS
YOUR RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE
INTO A RIGHTEOUS WASTE.

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:37.276
UH! RRGH!

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:39.181
HMM,
WICKED COUNTER.

00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.752
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

00:10:40.752 --> 00:10:42.223
YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT GETTING

00:10:42.223 --> 00:10:44.429
SOME NEW CARDS
FOR THAT WEAK DECK.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:46.133
OOH, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:47.570
YEAH. BAD CALL.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.575
WEAK? SEE IF YOU
THINK THIS IS WEAK.

00:10:49.575 --> 00:10:52.183
SPARKMAN, ATTACK.

00:10:57.162 --> 00:10:59.703
RRGH! UHH!

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.218
YOU CAN'T ATTACK ME.

00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:06.655
I CAN'T?

00:11:06.655 --> 00:11:08.861
HATE TO BREAK IT TO YA',
BUT, YEAH, I CAN.

00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:10.231
THAT'S HOW
YOU PLAY THE GAME.

00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:11.735
READ THE RULE BOOK.

00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:15.445
BUT I AM ABIDOS,
THE GREATEST DUELIST EVER.

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:16.815
THE GREATEST?

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:18.586
UM, I'M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:19.756
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:21.594
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
DUELIN' THAT GREAT.

00:11:21.594 --> 00:11:23.801
I MEAN FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S UNDEFEATED,

00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:26.475
I WAS HOPIN' FOR--
I DON'T KNOW--

00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:29.015
SOME SUPER-SWEET
MONSTERS OR
WICKED RARE CARDS,

00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:31.020
BUT SO FAR, I'VE BEEN
KINDA UNDERWHELMED.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.028
YEAH. HIS CARDS
ARE HARDLY BETTER
THAN A STARTER DECK.

00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:36.602
FOR A LEGEND,
THIS GUY IS A BIT
OF A LETDOWN.

00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:39.242
LOOKS LIKE JADEN'S
GONNA WIN THIS ONE EASY.

00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:41.749
THERE GOES MY SHOT
AT A NEW ROOM.

00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:43.587
Jaden:
YOUR MOVE, ABIDOS.

00:11:43.587 --> 00:11:46.294
HELLO? HELLOOO?

00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:53.748
I ATTACK WITH
SINISTER SERPENT.

00:11:53.748 --> 00:11:56.723
AAH!

00:11:56.723 --> 00:11:59.096
AND I WIN ANOTHER MATCH.

00:11:59.096 --> 00:12:01.636
OHH!

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:03.809
I CANNOT BE BEATEN.

00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:07.117
AAH!

00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:08.922
YOU ARE THE GREATEST,
O PHARAOH.

00:12:08.922 --> 00:12:10.760
ALL HAIL ABIDOS.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.434
Men: HAIL! HAIL! HAIL!

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:15.740
HAIL! HAIL!

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.314
YOU KNOW I'M GETTIN'
REALLY SICK AND TIRED

00:12:18.314 --> 00:12:21.322
OF HAVING TO LOSE TO THIS
SPOILED BRAT EVERYTIME.

00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:25.266
BUT IF WE DON'T,
HE'LL PROLLY FEED US
TO THE LIONS.

00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:30.981
WAIT. COULD IT BE ALL
MY SERVANTS LET ME WIN?

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:32.685
LET YOU WIN?

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.758
WOW, WHAT A GIANT
LOSER THIS GUY IS.

00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:36.429
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:38.869
I WOULDN'T MIND
HAVING SOME SERVANTS
LIKE THAT.

00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:40.641
BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE
HAS BEEN A LIE.

00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:42.679
YOU NEVER
REALLY DUELED?

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.217
I GUESS NOT.

00:12:44.217 --> 00:12:46.455
THEN LET'S START
YOUR FIRST LESSON
RIGHT NOW.

00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:48.562
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME RIGHT.

00:12:48.562 --> 00:12:51.403
NOW GET
YOUR GAME ON AGAIN,

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:54.176
BUT IF THIS IS GONNA BE
YOUR FIRST REAL DUEL,

00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:56.516
LET'S DO THIS RIGHT
AND DITCH THAT MASK.

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:00.895
THAT'S IT.

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:02.432
OHH.
HUH?

00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:05.306
JADEN, JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL GIVE IT YOUR BEST.

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:07.111
THAT'S ALL
I EVER GIVE.

00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:09.084
NOW LET'S DUEL.

00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:12.727
I'M THROWIN' DOWN
A FACEDOWN.

00:13:12.727 --> 00:13:14.765
ALL RIGHT, ABIDOS.
YOUR MOVE.

00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:16.102
VERY WELL.

00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:19.979
I ACTIVATE
THIRD SARCOPHAGUS.

00:13:19.979 --> 00:13:22.552
LEAVE IT TO JADEN TO
PEP-TALK A SHADOW RIDER.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.925
NO JOKE.
BAD IDEA.

00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:29.873
AND I SACRIFICE ALL 3
TO FINALLY SUMMON

00:13:29.873 --> 00:13:32.680
SPIRIT OF THE PHARAOH
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.584
SPIRIT OF
THE WHO WHAT?

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:41.203
OHH...

00:13:42.673 --> 00:13:44.244
HMM.

00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:45.715
[SLAM]

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:56.978
WELL, GUESS
HE LOOKS COOL,
BUT I GOTTA ADMIT,

00:13:56.978 --> 00:14:01.089
I EXPECTED
A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN
2,500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:02.627
I'M NOT DONE.

00:14:02.627 --> 00:14:05.067
A PHARAOH IS NOTHING
WITHOUT HIS SERVANTS.

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:07.072
YOU SEE, WHENEVER
HE'S SUMMONED,

00:14:07.072 --> 00:14:09.245
I GET TO CALL UP
HIS FRIENDS

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:13.121
UP TO 4 LEVEL-2 ZOMBIES
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:21.076 --> 00:14:22.113
AH!

00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:24.018
AND NOW MY DRAW.

00:14:24.018 --> 00:14:26.724
NOT SO FAST.
GO, INVINCIBLE HERO.

00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:28.630
A TRAP CARD?
FOR THIS ONE TURN,

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.872
YOU CAN'T DESTROY
MY SPARKMAN.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:36.384
THEN I SUPPOSE
IT'S A VERY GOOD THING
I HAVE THIS CARD.

00:14:36.384 --> 00:14:37.688
HUH?

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:40.696
I ACTIVATE THE POWERS
OF THOUSAND ENERGY.

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:43.470
NOW, ALL LEVEL-2 MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.478
GAIN 1,000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:46.478 --> 00:14:48.617
NO WAY.
AW, MAN.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:50.288
"AW, MAN"
IS RIGHT

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:53.463
BECAUSE THAT IS 300
MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN SPARKMAN,

00:14:53.463 --> 00:14:55.369
MEANING
THE EXTRA DAMAGE
GOES RIGHT TO...

00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:57.307
Syrus: JADEN!

00:14:58.443 --> 00:15:00.315
AAH! RRGH!

00:15:00.315 --> 00:15:01.618
YOUR MOVE!

00:15:01.618 --> 00:15:02.821
AAH!

00:15:02.821 --> 00:15:04.928
SPARKMAN MAY
SURVIVE THE BATTLE,

00:15:04.928 --> 00:15:07.033
BUT JADEN STILL
TAKES DAMAGE--

00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:09.239
300 POINTS FOR EACH
OF THOSE ZOMBIES.

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:10.575
FOR EACH OF THEM?

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.748
BUT THAT'LL BE LIKE
1,200 LIFE POINTS.

00:15:15.322 --> 00:15:16.558
THERE'S MORE.

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:18.764
I STILL HAVE
SPIRIT PHARAOH HIMSELF.

00:15:18.764 --> 00:15:20.703
ATTACK.

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:21.973
AAH!

00:15:21.973 --> 00:15:24.413
JAY!

00:15:24.413 --> 00:15:26.318
RRGH.

00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:29.560
NOW I THINK I'LL SACRIFICE
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.838
TO ACTIVATE A LITTLE CARD
I LIKE TO CALL SOUL GUIDE.

00:15:33.838 --> 00:15:36.111
IT GIVES ME LIFE POINTS

00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:38.752
EQUAL TO THE ATTACK POINTS
ON THE CARD I LOST,

00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:41.325
BUT IT'S ABOUT TO GET
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:43.731
SOUL GUIDE ALSO LETS ME
PUT A COPY OF THE CARD

00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:46.706
I JUST SACRIFICED
RIGHT BACK IN MY HAND,

00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:49.680
AND EVEN THOUGH
THOUSAND ENERGY

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.488
WILL MOST CERTAINLY
DESTROY MY MONSTERS,

00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:54.828
FROM HOW YOUR LIFE POINTS
WILL TURN OUT,

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.766
IT WILL BE WORTH IT.

00:15:56.766 --> 00:15:58.571
MY RECORD SHALL STAND.

00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:03.084
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:03.084 --> 00:16:04.687
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:16:04.687 --> 00:16:06.560
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE YOUR SOUL.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.798
NOT YET.
IS THAT SO?

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:10.136
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.573
AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SEE WHY.

00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:14.747
HA! HMM.

00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:19.127
I SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN

00:16:19.127 --> 00:16:21.332
IN ATTACK MODE...

00:16:23.003 --> 00:16:25.878
AND THEN I'LL PLAY
THIS HERE CARD.

00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:29.654
IT'S CALLED OVERSOUL,
AND, BOY, IS IT SWEET.

00:16:29.654 --> 00:16:32.495
I GET TO SUMMON
AN ELEMENTAL HERO BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:35.470
AND I THINK I KNOW
JUST THE ONE--

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.779
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN.

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:43.927
SO WHAT?
YOU'VE GOT 3 WEAK MONSTERS.

00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:45.765
THEY CAN'T
BEAT MY PHARAOH.

00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:48.505
HE'LL TAKE THEM APART
ONE AT A TIME.

00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:50.945
SORRY, BUT HE WON'T BE
GETTIN' THE CHANCE.

00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:53.652
SEE, ABIDOS,
YOUR 3-CARD COMBO
WAS PRETTY SWEET...

00:16:53.652 --> 00:16:55.624
HMM?
HMM...

00:16:55.624 --> 00:16:57.329
BUT I GOT
A 4-CARD ONE.

00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:59.535
HEATED HEART,
EMERGENCY CALL...

00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:01.673
THEN THERE'S
RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE

00:17:01.673 --> 00:17:04.681
AND LAST,
BUT NOT LEAST, OVERSOUL,

00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:07.657
AND TOGETHER, THEY'RE
ACTIVATIN' THIS--

00:17:07.657 --> 00:17:10.832
THE ONE AND ONLY
SPELL CARD KNOWN
AS HERO FLASH.

00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:12.302
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

00:17:12.302 --> 00:17:14.275
WELL, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA FORGET IT.

00:17:16.814 --> 00:17:19.622
FIRST, I GET TO SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO BURTINATRIX

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.727
FROM MY DECK
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:17:21.727 --> 00:17:23.933
BUT THAT'S
NOT ALL, ABIDOS.

00:17:23.933 --> 00:17:25.571
NOW ALL THE HEROES
I HAVE OUT

00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:28.813
GET TO ATTACK
YOUR LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY.

00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:30.919
NOW ELEMENTAL HEROES,

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.027
LET'S PUT A BLEMISH
ON THAT PERFECT RECORD
A' HIS.

00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:37.269
HERO FLASH.

00:17:37.269 --> 00:17:40.745
AAH!

00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:42.183
THAT'S GAME

00:17:42.183 --> 00:17:43.853
AND A PRETTY
GOOD ONE, TOO.

00:17:43.853 --> 00:17:45.224
YOU'VE GOT MOVES.

00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:46.627
YEAH, BUT NOT
LIKE JADEN'S.

00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:48.232
BIG, FAT,
HAIRY DEAL.

00:17:48.232 --> 00:17:50.170
OJAMA HURRICANE'S
JUST AS GOOD.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.908
ABIDOS DOESN'T
LOOK SO HOT.

00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:55.318
Jaden: HEY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:17:55.318 --> 00:17:59.696
I USED TO THINK I WAS
THE BEST DUELIST OF ALL TIME,

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:02.537
BUT NOW I KNOW
I NEED A LOT OF PRACTICE,

00:18:02.537 --> 00:18:04.943
IF I WANT TO BE
A TRUE DUELING LEGEND.

00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:06.581
HEY, ANYTIME.

00:18:06.581 --> 00:18:07.583
HMM.

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:10.959
WELL, I WAS THINKING
RIGHT NOW.

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:13.065
RIGHT NOW?
YOU WANT A REMATCH?

00:18:13.065 --> 00:18:14.669
NO.

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:17.577
JADEN, YOU COULD
COME BACK WITH ME.

00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:18.713
HUH?

00:18:18.713 --> 00:18:20.084
J-JADEN!

00:18:20.084 --> 00:18:22.458
YOU'RE TOO GOOD
FOR THIS PLACE. LISTEN.

00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:24.262
COME BACK TO MY KINGDOM,

00:18:24.262 --> 00:18:26.735
AND, I PROMISE YOU
POWER AND FAME.

00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:28.172
UH, NICE OFFER.

00:18:28.172 --> 00:18:30.345
AAH!
JADEN, WAIT.

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:31.915
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:33.788
SWEET!
SO I WILL GET HIS ROOM.

00:18:33.788 --> 00:18:35.158
CHAZZ!

00:18:35.158 --> 00:18:38.734
SOUNDS NICE, BUT I THINK
I PREFER IT RIGHT HERE,

00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:41.742
BUT, HEY, DROP ME A LINE
IF YOU'RE EVER
IN MY 'HOOD, OK?

00:18:41.742 --> 00:18:45.452
SAME WITH YOU, THAT IS,
IF YOU EVER FIND

00:18:45.452 --> 00:18:48.961
A TIME VORTEX
WARPING LOOP HOLE OR--

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.604
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL JUST CALL YOU.

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:58.153
Abidos: FAREWELL.

00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.498
Jaden: YA KNOW, ABIDOS
WASN'T SUCH BAD GUY.

00:19:02.498 --> 00:19:04.719
I MEAN, HEY,
LOOK WHAT HE GAVE ME.

00:19:04.719 --> 00:19:07.122
I AM STARTIN' TO GET
QUITE A COLLECTION,

00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:09.457
BUT WHERE'S THE SHADOW RIDER
WITH A SKATEBOARD?

00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:13.161
I DON'T SEE WHY JADEN
GETS ALL THE FREE STUFF.

00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:16.164
PROLLY CUZ I BEAT
A DUELING LEGEND.

00:19:16.164 --> 00:19:19.568
OH, NOW HE'S A LEGEND,
CUZ YOU BEAT HIM?

00:19:19.568 --> 00:19:20.869
WELL, CHAZZ,

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.437
THAT IS WHAT ALL
THE HISTORY BOOKS

00:19:22.437 --> 00:19:24.739
SAY THAT HE IS,
RIGHT?

00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:27.242
WELL, WE KNOW
THE TRUTH.

00:19:27.242 --> 00:19:29.744
HE WAS A SHAM, A FAKE.

00:19:29.744 --> 00:19:33.548
Jaden: JADEN THE LEGEND SLAYER.
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.417
GOOD, JADEN,

00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:37.419
BECAUSE SOON, YOU
WILL GET THE CHANCE
TO TRULY EARN IT.

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:40.422
SOON, YOU WILL FACE
YOUR TRUE TEST.
