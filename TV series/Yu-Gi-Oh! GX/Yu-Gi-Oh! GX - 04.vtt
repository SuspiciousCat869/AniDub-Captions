00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.193
I MAY FLUNK
NOW AND THEN,
BUT I NEVER FAIL!

00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:23.162
Woman: YOO-HOO! AUTO CLUB!

00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:24.898
OH, HEY!
YOU WORK HERE, TOO?

00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:29.402
OH, NO, I DON'T WORK HERE.
I OWN HERE! COOL, HUH?!

00:07:29.402 --> 00:07:32.205
NAH, THAT'S NOT COOL.
THAT'S TOTALLY SWEET!

00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:33.673
HOW DO YOU
KNOW HER, JAY?

00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.608
I THINK IT WAS
THE CARBURETOR.

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:37.410
HERE, I HAVE
SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.512
HUH?

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:43.283
JUST CALL IT
A "THANK YOU"
FOR HELPING ME.

00:07:43.283 --> 00:07:46.352
THEN THIS GUY SHOWS UP
AND TAKES ALL THE NEW CARDS.

00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:48.087
I MEAN, EVERY ONE!

00:07:48.087 --> 00:07:50.290
SO WE COULDN'T
GETCHA ANY, CHAZZ.
SORRY.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.025
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S "SORRY"?

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:54.260
YOU GUYS, THAT'S WHAT,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.462
CUZ NOT ONE DUELIST HERE
CAN BEAT ME,

00:07:56.462 --> 00:07:57.864
NO MATTER
WHAT CARD HE HAS.

00:07:57.864 --> 00:08:01.267
Crowler: UNLESS THAT DUELIST
HAPPENS TO BE JADEN YUKI.

00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:02.702
WHO'S THERE?!

00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:05.305
SOMEONE WHO SUSPECTS
YOU DESPISE JADEN
AS MUCH AS I DO.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:07.740
THAT'S THE STICKY FINGERS
WHO TOOK THE RARE CARDS!

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.108

00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:11.811
OH, DO YOU MEAN
THESE CARDS?

00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:15.615
OH, NOW DAT'S STYLE!

00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:18.051
TALK ABOUT HAVIN'
A CARD UP YOUR SLEEVE.

00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:20.219
HA HA HA!

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:21.321
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.655
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CHAZZ?

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:25.758
DON'T RECOGNIZE ME?
HOW ABOUT NOW?

00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:27.093
CROWLER!
CROWLER!
CROWLER!

00:08:27.093 --> 00:08:29.329
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOKED BETTER
ALL COVERED UP.

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:31.998
YES. WELL,
I HAVE A PLAN

00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:33.800
THAT WILL
MAKE US ALL
LOOK BETTER

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.301
AND MAKE JADEN
YUKI LOOK LIKE

00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:37.770
THE CUT-RATE DUELIST
HE TRULY IS.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.039
I WANT YOU TO BE
HIS OPPONENT
FOR HIS FIELD TEST

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.475
AND TO USE
THESE RARE CARDS
TO BEAT HIM.

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.344
BUT WE'RE NOT
IN THE SAME DORM!

00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:46.312
THEY WON'T LET ME BE
HIS TEST OPPONENT.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.314
THEY?
I AM "THEY."

00:08:48.314 --> 00:08:49.782
I'LL MAKE
IT HAPPEN!

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:51.551
AND YOU JUST MAKE
SURE THAT YOU USE

00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:54.087
ALL OF THESE
RARE CARDS TO PUT
JADEN IN HIS PLACE

00:08:54.087 --> 00:08:56.389
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE ACADEMY!

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:57.890
[LAUGHING]

00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:02.629
AAH!

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:05.398
I'M DUELIN' AN OBELISK,
AND IT'S CHAZZ?!

00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:06.733
Crowler: THAT'S
RIGHT, JADEN.

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:08.568
SINCE YOU
ALWAYS TALK
SUCH A BIG GAME,

00:09:08.568 --> 00:09:11.738
I PULLED SOME STRINGS
FOR YOU SO YOU GOT
THE CHALLENGE YOU DESERVE!

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:13.706
SO CONGRATULATIONS!

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:16.542
YOU'LL BE DUELING ONE
OF THE TOP-RANKED
STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL!

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.277
WHAT AN HONOR!

00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:20.413
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT
YOU WERE ABLE TO SNAG

00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:24.684
A LOT OF TODAY'S
RARE CARDS SO THAT YOUR
DECK IS UP TO SNUFF!

00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:28.187
WHAT'S WRONG?
AREN'T YOU GOING TO THANK ME?!

00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:30.757
[THINKING] I'VE GOT
A BAAAD FEELING ABOUT THIS!

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.458
[THINKING]
THIS IS CLEARLY A TRAP.

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:35.194
ONLY A CAVALIER FOOL
WOULD AGREE TO IT.

00:09:35.194 --> 00:09:37.096
Jaden: I'LL DO IT!

00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:39.766
ALL RIGHT, CHAZZ!
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:43.136
LET'S FINISH WHAT WE STARTED
AT OBELISK ARENA!

00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:45.605
INDEED. IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE SCHOOL, TOO,

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.607
WHERE EVERYONE
CAN WATCH!

00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:51.944
YEAH. WATCH YOU
GET SLAMMED BY ME!

00:09:51.944 --> 00:09:53.413
DUEL!

00:09:53.413 --> 00:09:54.981
NO EXCUSES
THIS TIME, CHAZZ!

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.516
BRING IT,
SLIFER SLACKER!

00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:58.251
OH, IT IS BROUGHT!

00:09:58.251 --> 00:09:59.919
HA!

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:02.188
WELL!
IT'S MY FAVORITE
FURRY FRIEND.

00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.123
[THINKING] KURIBOH,
YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT!

00:10:04.123 --> 00:10:07.326
WE'RE ABOUT TO RAIN DOWN
SOME SERIOUS SKILLS
ON CHAZZ! CHECK IT!

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:09.462
YOU REMEMBER THIS GUY,
DON'T YOU, CHAZZ,

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:11.397
FROM OUR FIRST MATCH?!

00:10:11.397 --> 00:10:14.000
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN!

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:21.240
HE'D LIKE TO GET
REACQUAINTED.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.509
HEH HEH HEH.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:25.912
NOT AFTER HE SEES
WHAT I GOT FOR HIM!

00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:30.483
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND

00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:31.718
THAT OVERSIZED
PILE OF PEBBLES

00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:33.419
HAS A CHANCE
AGAINST ME, JADEN,

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:35.188
OR AGAINST THIS!

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:38.357
[THINKING] 'PRECIATE
THE RARE CARD, CROWLER.

FRESH OFF THE PRESSES,
MEET MAGICAL MALLET!

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:42.762
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:43.963
A REDO.

00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:45.865
ALL THE CARDS IN MY HAND
THAT I DON'T WANT,

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:47.366
I PUT BACK IN MY DECK.

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.135
THEN I SHUFFLE AND REDRAW.

00:10:49.135 --> 00:10:51.137
PRETTY COOL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:10:51.137 --> 00:10:52.438
WHA?! HOW?!

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:54.273
A RARE CARD
ON THE FIRST DRAW?!

00:10:54.273 --> 00:10:56.642
AND A VERY DANGEROUS
ONE AT THAT.

00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:58.811
NOW, CHAZZ WILL ESSENTIALLY
BE ABLE TO PICK

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:02.048
EXACTLY WHICH CARDS HE WANTS
AND WHICH HE DOESN'T.

00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:04.217
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
TO THE BEST PART!

00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:08.855
SEE, JADEN, I GOT TO RESHUFFLE
MAGICAL MALLET, TOO!

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.623
SO IF I DRAW IT AGAIN,
WHICH I JUST DID,

00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:12.291
I CAN PLAY IT AGAIN AN' AGAIN!

00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:16.262
AND THAT COMES IN HANDY
WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR THIS!

SHARPEN YOUR CLAWS
FOR ATTACK MODE!

AND THERE'S A LOT MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM!

CHECK OUT THE MAGIC
OF FRONTLINE BASE!

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:29.575

ANOTHER LEVEL-4 OR BELOW

00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:31.711

00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:51.121
BUT WAIT.
I'M NOT DONE YET

00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.256
'CAUSE HE STILL HAS
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY!

BY SENDING A CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
INTO ATTACK MODE!

THIS HEATSEEKER BLITZ
FROM MY TIGER CATAPULT,

PERHAPS JADEN CAN'T PLAY
WITH THE BIG BOYS, AFTER ALL.

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:26.222
I GUESS HE'S NOT AS GOOD
AS EVERYONE THINKS!

00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:29.025

I'LL FINISH UP WITH
ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

THROUGH THAT CLASS, AS WELL.

00:13:21.644 --> 00:13:24.080
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,
AND I CHOOSE...

TO CREATE XYZ DRAGON CANNON!

ACTUALLY, LESS.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.072
SURE, THEY SAY TWO
IS BETTER THAN ONE,

00:13:49.072 --> 00:13:50.874
BUT I HAVE TO DISAGREE,

00:13:50.874 --> 00:13:53.076
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ONE
IN QUESTION

00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:57.614
IS THE ULTIMATE V-TO-Z
DRAGON CATAPULT CANNON!

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:06.456
MAKES YOUR SPARKMAN LOOK LIKE
A HEAP OF SPARK PLUGS, HUH?

00:14:06.456 --> 00:14:08.157
OR AT LEAST, IT DID.

00:14:08.157 --> 00:14:10.293
HUH? MY SPARKMAN!

00:14:10.293 --> 00:14:14.330
OH, I'M SORRY.
DIDN'T I MENTION V-TO-Z's
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.299

TO REMOVE ONE CARD

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:18.501
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD
ONCE PER TURN!

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:20.370
HA HA HA!

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.138
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE,

00:14:22.138 --> 00:14:24.207
JUST WAIT'LL YOU
SEE HIS ATTACK,

00:14:24.207 --> 00:14:27.310
AN ATTACK THAT WILL STRIKE
YOUR LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.646
DON'T THINK SO, CHAZZ.
I HAVE A TRAP!

00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:31.881
A HERO EMERGES!
BLAST IT!

00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:33.249
A HERO WHAT?!

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:35.752
EMERGES!
AS IN EMERGES
ONTO THE FIELD!

00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:38.621
CUZ NOW YOU
