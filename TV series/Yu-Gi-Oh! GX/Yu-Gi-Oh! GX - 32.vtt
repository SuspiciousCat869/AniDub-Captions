8000 POINTS?

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.373
I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT "CONSEQUENCES"

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:41.008
AFTER THIS TURN.

00:08:41.008 --> 00:08:42.976

FORGETTING MY FACE DOWN?

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.386
I PLAY THE TRAP
RED GHOST MOON!

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:53.754
NOW, DARLING...

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:57.090
BY DISCARDING ONE ZOMBIE
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.593
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK
POINTS ARE ADDED DIRECTLY TO

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:02.296
MY LIFE POINTS AND OUR
LITTLE BATTLE ENDS RIGHT

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:03.864
HERE AND NOW.

00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:14.741
HA HA HA!

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:18.312
THAT'S 8000 POINTS,
PLUS THE 4000 I HAD...

00:09:18.312 --> 00:09:20.914
GIVING ME
A TOTAL OF 12,000!

00:09:20.914 --> 00:09:22.583
WRONG.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:25.485
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
CARD DE-FUSION...

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.688
DISASSEMBLING CYBER

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:34.528
RED GHOST MOON'S
TARGET IS GONE--SO
ITS EFFECT IS CANCELLED!

00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:36.163
MY POINTS!

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:42.336
HEY, KNOW WHAT ELSE?

00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:45.138
NOW THAT POWER
BOND IS GONE...

00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:47.441
HE WON'T HAVE TO PAY
POINTS FOR USING IT!

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:49.843

00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:54.214
I'LL END WITH ONE FACEDOWN.

00:09:58.118 --> 00:09:59.119
HA HA HA!

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:00.721
OH, MY DARLING!

00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.656
I SEE NOW WHY YOU'RE
RANKED THE TOP DUELIST

00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:04.391
AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:07.261
ACTUALLY, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN ANYTHING YET.

00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:08.729
WELL, I HOPE NOT.

00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:10.931
ZANE, DEAR...PRECIOUS.

00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:13.267
WE'VE ONLY JUST
BEGUN THIS DUEL.

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:16.436
AND I EXPECT TO HAVE A
LOT MORE FUN WITH YOU!

00:10:16.436 --> 00:10:18.538
AW MAN...I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA LIKE

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:19.806
HER KIND OF FUN...

00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:26.046
NOW THEN...SHALL WE?

00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:28.615
FIRST, I'LL SACRIFICE
VAMPIRE LADY...

00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:30.450
TO SUMMON VAMPIRE LORD!

00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:34.488
NEXT I'LL SACRIFICE HIM...

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:38.892
TO SUMMON...VAMPIRE GENESIS!

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:43.430
[ROARING]

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.098
UGLY!

00:10:45.098 --> 00:10:46.099
SCARY!

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:47.434
DARLING ZANE.

00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:49.770
I PROMISED YOU
SOME FUN, DIDN'T I?

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.538
AND NOW WE'LL HAVE IT.

00:10:51.538 --> 00:10:53.407
ARE YOU EXCITED?

00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:57.944
OH...YOU'RE SUCH A BORE.

00:10:57.944 --> 00:10:59.946
WELL MAYBE THIS
WILL ROUSE YOU--

00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:02.282
VAMPIRE GENESIS ATTACK!

00:11:02.282 --> 00:11:03.984
[ROARING]

00:11:03.984 --> 00:11:05.752
AS FUN AS THIS IS....

00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:07.254
I'M AFRAID THAT I'M
GOING TO HAVE

00:11:07.254 --> 00:11:10.190
TO INTERRUPT IT WITH MY
FACEDOWN CARD...

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.560
THE TRAP:
ATTACK REFLECTOR UNIT!

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.828
A TRAP?!

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:20.247
ONE THAT'S EVOLUTIONARY.

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.316
YOU SEE, ATTACK
REFLECTOR UNIT EVOLVES

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:24.551
MY CYBER DRAGON INTO...

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:28.255
THE CYBER BARRIER
DRAGON!

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:31.292
AND WHEN THE CYBER BARRIER
DRAGON IS IN ATTACK MODE...

00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.328
ONCE PER TURN, ITS SPECIAL
POWER ALLOWS ME TO NEGATE

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:36.630
THE ATTACK OF YOUR MONSTER!

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.833
SO YOUR VAMPIRE GENESIS'S
ATTACK...CAN GO RIGHT BACK TO

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.069
WHERE IT STARTED.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.737
[GROWLING]

00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.279
HOW DARE YOU!

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.951
YOUR BRO'S GOT GAME!
NO WONDER HE BEAT ME!

00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:58.319
THOUGH IT WAS CLOSE.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:59.353
YEAH...

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:01.588
IT'S MY TURN!

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.691
AND I PLAY POT OF GREED!

00:12:03.691 --> 00:12:06.026
THIS LETS ME DRAW TWO
CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:07.394
NEXT I ACTIVATE...

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.331
THE SPELL PHOTON
GENERATOR UNIT!

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.200
NOW BY SACRIFICING MY
DRAGONS...I CAN SUMMON

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.569
THE CYBER LASER DRAGON!

00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.807
AND WITH CYBER
LASER DRAGON...

00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:21.842
ONCE EVERY TURN,
I CAN DESTROY

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.510
ONE MONSTER
THAT HAS EQUAL...

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.012
OR MORE ATTACK
OR DEFENSE

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:28.182
POINTS THAN LASER
DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.317
I BET YOU TALK TO ALL
THE GIRLS LIKE THAT.

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:32.886
NO, JUST ONES I
REALLY DON'T LIKE.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.688
NOW...LASER DRAGON!

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:38.158
LET LOOSE...BLUE
LIGHTNING LASH...

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:40.427
[ROARING]

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.864
AND NOW GO AHEAD
AND ATTACK HER DIRECTLY!

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:46.100
BLUE LIGHTNING BLAST!

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:50.838
AAAH!

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:59.446
OH, AND...DON'T
THINK I FORGOT CYBER
BARRIER DRAGON.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.614
ATTACK!

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:02.149
SONIC SHRIEK!

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.320
AAH!

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.091
ALL RIGHT!!!

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.427
THAT'S EXACTLY THE MOVE
I WOULD'VE MADE!

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.631
SURE, CHUM...
TOTALLY...IN
YOUR DREAMS!

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.868
SO...NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY
MY BROTHER'S NEVER LOST,

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:21.935
HUH, GUYS?!

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.504
STILL, MOM SAYS I GOT
THE LOOKS...

00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:25.706
[OTHERS GROAN]

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:29.209
I'LL PLACE ONE FACEDOWN
AND...END MY TURN.

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:31.912
DARLING...YOU DO
REALIZE...YOU'RE FORCING ME

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:35.416
TO REVEAL MY UGLY SIDE!

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:37.484
YOU SEE?

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:40.721
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO
GET UGLIER...

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:43.724
I PLAY...
ILLUSION GATE!

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:47.194
ILLUSION GATE?

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:48.695
UH-OH.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.865
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT IT DOES?

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.600
NO.
NOT ME.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.636
Banner: I THINK WE'RE
ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:56.804
BEHOLD!

00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:59.706
FIRST, THIS SPELL CARD
DESTROYS ALL MONSTERS

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:02.042
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:03.210
UHH...

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.378
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.413
IT HAS TWIN FUNCTIONS.

00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:09.016
HA HA HA!

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.920
YOU SEE...
THIS CARD ALSO ALLOWS ME

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.855
TO SUMMON ANY MONSTER
YOU'VE USED

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:17.157
DURING THIS ENTIRE DUEL.

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.292
WHAT?

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:21.028
SO, EVEN THOUGH
YOU DE-FUSED CYBER DRAGON

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.729
AFTER ONLY ONE TURN,

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:25.099
YOU DID USE HIM
DURING THIS DUEL.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.600
PLEASE.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.835
NO CARD
IS POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:29.570
TO LET YOU MAKE
A MOVE LIKE THAT.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.572
THERE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF CATCH.

00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:34.575
YES...BUT IT'S
JUST A TINY ONE.

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:36.810
AFTER USING
ILLUSION GATE,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.113
SHOULD I HAPPEN
TO STILL LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:42.950
I MUST SACRIFICE A SOUL
TO THE SACRED BEASTS.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.051
THAT ALL?

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.352
WELL, GOOD!

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:47.221
IT'S WHATCHA GET
FOR TAKING
CROWLER'S!

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:51.291
BEG YOUR PARDON...
I SAID A SOUL,
NOT MY SOUL.

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.793
YOU SEE,
IN THE SHADOWS,

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:55.529
IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO THE SACRED BEASTS...

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.131
SYRUS.
HUH?

00:14:57.131 --> 00:14:58.332
OH, YES.

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.900
THOSE BEASTS
WOULD FIND YOUR SOUL

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.102
TO BE A TASTY TREAT,
I'M SURE.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:03.737
UHH...SYRUS!

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.672
RUN!!!

00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.074
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:08.142
HUH?

00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:09.176
SYRUS!

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:12.312
SY!

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.784
AW...SORRY, ZANE...

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.020
HA HA! AND NOW...

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.124
I SUMMON THE ALMIGHTY
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:26.426
[ROARING]

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.463
AAH!

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:33.767
SY!

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.938
[GASPING]

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:44.545
WHATEVER WILL YOU DO?

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:48.015
I HAVE YOUR BEST MONSTER
AND YOUR LITTLE BROTHER...

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:51.752
ACTUALLY, I SUPPOSE
THEY'RE REALLY ONE
IN THE SAME NOW.

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:55.355
AFTER ALL, IF YOU MANAGE
TO DO IN THE CYBER
END DRAGON,

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:58.692
YOU'LL ALSO BE DOING IN
LITTLE SYRUS' SOUL.

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:02.663
SO AS I SAID...
WHATEVER WILL YOU DO?

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:04.231
[THINKING]
THE FACEDOWN CARD
ON MY FIELD

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.166
IS CALL OF THE HAUNTED.

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:08.902
IF I USE IT TO RESURRECT
CYBER BARRIER DRAGON,

00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:11.805
I CAN STOP
THAT CYBER END DRAGON
AND WIN THE DUEL.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.840
CAMULA WILL BE
DEFEATED.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.009
WE'LL BE THAT
MUCH CLOSER TO
KEEPING THE WORLD SAFE

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.644
FROM THOSE
SACRED BEASTS...

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.047
AND IN EXCHANGE,
WE JUST LOSE ONE SOUL--

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:21.248
MY BROTHER'S.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.516
THE CHOICE IS CLEAR.

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.223
SO?! WHAT IS IT
GOING TO BE--

00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:33.293
SAVE THE WORLD OR SAVE
YOUR BROTHER'S SOUL,

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.762
WHICH ALSO MEANS
LOSING YOURS!

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:38.398
GO ON, ZANE...DO IT.

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.499
YOU HAVE TO.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.800
HUH?

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.437
MY SOUL IS
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
TO STOP CAMULA.

00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:47.407
AFTER ALL, IF SHE WINS
THIS DUEL, ZANE...

00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:48.875
SHE'LL GET
YOUR SPIRIT KEY,

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.343
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.911
THE SHADOW RIDERS...

00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:55.081
THEY'LL BE THAT
MUCH CLOSER TO FREEING
THOSE SACRED BEASTS!

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.382
BESIDES, ZANE...

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:57.984
IF ONE OF US
HAS TO GO DOWN,

00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:59.619
IT MIGHT AS WELL
BE ME.

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:02.288
SURE, I MAY HAVE
GOTTEN THE LOOKS,

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:05.225
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
YOU GOT JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:08.828
THE SKILLS, THE SMARTS--
EVERYTHING.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.831
ANYWAY, BIG BRO...
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.600
I MEAN,
AT LEAST THIS WAY...

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.968
I'LL BE REMEMBERED
FOR SOMETHING

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:17.537
OTHER THAN JUST BEING
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.474
THIS WAY, ZANE...
I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO'S THE HERO.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.876
THE ONE WHO SAVES
THE DAY.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.845
AFTER ALL, WE BOTH KNOW

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:28.982
I WOULD'VE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO DO IT BY DUELING.

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:30.516
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU SAID...

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.552
I NEVER BELONGED HERE.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.090
I DID SAY THAT, SYRUS,
BUT SINCE THEN,

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.424
YOU PROVED ME WRONG.

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:39.993
YOU DO BELONG HERE.

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:42.662
HMM?

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:43.930
I LOVE YOU, SYRUS.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.398
NEVER FORGET IT.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.699
AW, ZANE...

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.603
I'LL MISS YOU,
LITTLE BRO.

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.171
FAREWELL.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.109
I STAND DOWN.

00:17:58.109 --> 00:17:59.978
ZANE?!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.312
SO BE IT!

00:18:01.312 --> 00:18:04.616
CYBER END DRAGON,
DESTROY HIM!

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:08.486
[ROARING]

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:11.022
AAH!

00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:13.191
ZANE, NO!

00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:14.993
STOP! TAKE ME!

00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:28.072
BIG BROTHER?!

00:18:28.072 --> 00:18:29.774
[GRUNTING]

00:18:46.157 --> 00:18:48.693
OH, NO...

00:18:48.693 --> 00:18:51.463
Camula:
AT LAST, DARLING,
YOU'RE ALL MINE.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:54.499
A TAD SMALLER AND A SMIDGE
LESS TALKATIVE...

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:57.001
BUT A DARLING TROPHY
NONETHELESS.

00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:00.171
[SHUDDERING]

00:19:00.171 --> 00:19:02.707
HA HA HA!

00:19:02.707 --> 00:19:05.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:23.656 --> 00:19:26.292
JUST LIKE THAT...

00:19:26.292 --> 00:19:27.794
HE'S GONE.

00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:29.529
UHH!
HMM?

00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:30.630
THAT'S IT!

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.631
JADEN?

00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:32.632
YOU HEAR ME?!

00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:34.867
NO MORE, CAMULA!

00:19:34.867 --> 00:19:37.737
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU
MESSIN' WITH MY FRIENDS!

00:19:37.737 --> 00:19:39.172
GOT THAT?

00:19:39.172 --> 00:19:41.407
WHAT YOU DID TO CROWLER,
TO ZANE?!

00:19:41.407 --> 00:19:43.009
IT STOPS HERE,

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:45.712
AND I'M GONNA BE
THE ONE WHO STOPS IT!

00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:47.847
JADEN...

00:19:47.847 --> 00:19:51.517
SURE, I MAY NOT BE UP
TO SNUFF, BUT I DON'T CARE.

00:19:51.517 --> 00:19:54.787
I'M TAKING YOU ON
AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

00:19:54.787 --> 00:19:56.789
I'M GETTIN' OUR FRIENDS'
SOULS BACK!

00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:57.790
ABOUT TIME!

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.626
CAMULA!!!

00:19:59.626 --> 00:20:03.162
[GRUNTING]

00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:05.598
CAMULA, HERE I COME...

00:20:05.598 --> 00:20:08.368
SO GET SET
TO GET YOUR GAME ON!
