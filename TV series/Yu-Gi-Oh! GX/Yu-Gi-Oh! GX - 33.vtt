ATTA--

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:37.677
HYAH!

00:08:37.677 --> 00:08:39.645
TEMPEST?
WHAT IS WRONG?

00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:41.147
HA HA HA!

00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:43.449
HUH?

00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:46.052
GUESS HE DOESN'T
LIKE HIS NEW BOSS!

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:48.388
BUT YOU CAN FORGET
THE TWO WEEK NOTICE,

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:51.691
I THINK I'LL JUST PLAY
MY TRAP CROSS HEART!

00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:54.394
AND THAT PUTS TEMPEST
BACK ON MY SIDE!

00:08:54.394 --> 00:08:56.295
WHAT?

00:08:56.295 --> 00:08:58.264
HYAH!

00:08:58.264 --> 00:08:59.265
OHH!

00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:03.253
GO AHEAD
AND TAKE HIM BACK!

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:06.823
I WILL STILL WIN!

00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:09.926
LOOKS LIKE
JADEN'S...LEARNED
A FEW NEW TRICKS.

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.595
I HOPE SO!

00:09:11.595 --> 00:09:14.364
THERE'S MORE WERE
THAT CAME FROM!

00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:15.866
ALRIGHT...TIME TO
TEACH THAT WEREWOLF POOCH

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.302
A FEW NEW TRICKS!

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:19.436
LIKE HOW TO PLAY DEAD!

00:09:22.406 --> 00:09:24.274
[HOWLING]

00:09:29.012 --> 00:09:33.283
HEH HEH HEH!
HOW QUICKLY YOU FORGET!

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:36.320
WHEN YOU DESTROY
MY WEREWOLF,

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.322
ANOTHER ONE COMES
FROM MY DECK

00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:40.390
WITH A LITTLE SURPRISE...

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.693
500 MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:42.693 --> 00:09:46.229
[HOWLS]

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:49.466
MAYBE A FACEDOWN...
WILL TAME 'IM!

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.601
[THINKING]
FOOL...YOU HAVE MUCH
MORE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:59.506
THAN JUST HIM...
THIS NEXT TURN
SHOULD PROVE THAT...

00:09:59.506 --> 00:10:00.940
I PLAY THE SPELL
POT OF GREED!

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.445
NOW I MAY DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:06.513
HEH HEH HEH!

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:08.448
JADEN...TELL ME...

00:10:08.448 --> 00:10:10.050
DO YOU KNOW
THE ONLY THING WORSE

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.218
THAN A VAMPIRE MISTRESS?

00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:15.255
A VAMPIRE MISTRESS
WITH A GRUDGE!

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:18.425
GOOD BYE, MY WEREVOLF!

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:22.395
I SACRIFICE YOU TO
SUMMON...VAMPIRE LORD!

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:27.100
AND NOW I'LL REMOVE HIM
FROM PLAY TO SUMMON FORTH...

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.569
VAMPIRE GENESIS!

00:10:31.037 --> 00:10:33.373
[GROWLS]

00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:34.474
DIDJA SEE THAT?!

00:10:34.474 --> 00:10:36.142
UNFORTUNATELY!

00:10:36.142 --> 00:10:38.611
3000
ATTACK POINTS...

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.246
AND A POWERFUL
SPECIAL ABILITY, TO BOOT.

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:44.651
JADEN WILL HAVE HIS
WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM.

00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:48.655
Camula: NEXT I'LL USE
THE SPELL CARD
GENESIS CRISIS!

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:52.225
NOW EVERY TURN...
A ZOMBIE-TYPE MONSTER
IS TRANSFERRED

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:55.395
DIRECTLY FROM MY DECK
AND INTO MY HAND!

00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:59.199
AND WITH VAMPIRE GENESIS...
I CAN DISCARD THAT MONSTER

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:00.967
TO THE GRAVEYARD TO
SUMMON ANOTHER ONE!

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:04.003
IT CAN BE
ANY ZOMBIE MONSTER,

00:11:04.003 --> 00:11:06.506
AS LONG AS IT IS
A LOWER LEVEL!

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:09.576
SO I'LL BE DISCARDING
RYU KOKKI TO BRING BACK

00:11:09.576 --> 00:11:14.147
VAMP'S BEST FRIEND:
ZOMBIE WEREVOLF!

00:11:14.147 --> 00:11:16.983
NOW, IF I RECALL...
YOUR ELEMENTAL HERO

00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:19.719
CANNOT BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE,

00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:21.321
AS LONG AS YOU
SACRIFICE

00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:25.959
ONE OF THE OTHER CARDS
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:27.660
AND IT SEEMS
YOU HAVE ONE.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.596
PITY IF SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO IT...

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:32.499
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE:
IF IT DISAPPEARED...

00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:34.234
DUE TO MY GIANT TRUNADE!

00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:39.606
OHH!

00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:44.277
HOW'D SHE KNOW
T'DO THAT?!

00:11:44.277 --> 00:11:45.512
I DON'T KNOW.

00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:48.615
CAMULA KNOWS OUR DECKS
BETTER THAN ANY ONE.

00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:50.583
AND WHAT'S MORE...
SHE'S CALCULATED

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:52.051
A PERFECT STRATEGY
AGAINST THEM!

00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:55.054
SO ISN'T THE VILLAIN
SUPPOSED TO TELL

00:11:55.054 --> 00:11:56.556
THE CHARMING HERO
HOW SHE DID IT?

00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:58.158
CUZ I'M ALL EARS!

00:11:58.158 --> 00:11:59.259
YOU DIDN'T
THINK MY BATS...

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.362
WERE JUST
FOR DECORATION DID YOU?

00:12:02.362 --> 00:12:04.497
THEY WERE SPYING ON EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU!

00:12:04.497 --> 00:12:05.999
OHH!

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:07.333
HA HA HA!

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:09.469
AND JUST AS THEY
TOLD ME THE WEAKNESSES

00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:10.670
OF YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE FRIENDS,

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.305
CROWLER AND ZANE...

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:13.573
THEY TOLD ME YOURS!

00:12:13.573 --> 00:12:15.233
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:23.245
AND NOW!
VAMPIRE GENESIS,

00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:27.117
GO AND ATTACK
THAT TEMPEST!

00:12:27.117 --> 00:12:29.086
CRIMSON STORM!

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.448
[GRUNTING]

00:12:37.448 --> 00:12:39.416
SO MUCH FOR THAT
ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST.

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:43.854
NOW JADEN'S OUT THERE
LIKE A SITTING DUCK!

00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:45.322
AND I THINK THAT
ZOMBIE WEREWOLF

00:12:45.322 --> 00:12:47.124
LIKES DUCK--
THIS COULD BE IT, GUYS!

00:12:47.124 --> 00:12:50.194
THIS IS VERY
ANTI-LISHUS!

00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:56.567
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE THROUGH!

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.604
ZOMBIE WEREWOLF
ATTACK JADEN DIRECTLY!

00:13:00.604 --> 00:13:02.639
[HOWLING]

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.308
[ALL GASP]

00:13:04.308 --> 00:13:06.643
[GROANING]

00:13:06.643 --> 00:13:08.912
WELL?! FALL DOWN!

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:10.781
YOU SHOULD HAVE
NO MORE LIFE POINTS LEFT!

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.283
HA HA HA!

00:13:13.283 --> 00:13:14.751
GUESS AGAIN, CAMULA!

00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:15.819
HOW IS THIS?!

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.321
INSURANCE IS HOW!

00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:18.622
WHEN YOU SENT THIS
FACEDOWN CARD

00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:19.890
BACK TO MY HAND,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.458
ITS EFFECT
WENT OFF,

00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:24.795
AND I GOT 500
LIFE POINTS
JUST IN TIME!

00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:27.164
I SEE.
HOW FORTUNATE FOR YOU.

00:13:27.164 --> 00:13:29.700
BUT YOU JUST POSTPONE
THE INEVITABLE.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.870
I ACTIVATE THE MAGIC
OF GENESIS CRISIS!

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.305
AND NOW I'LL ADD
YET ANOTHER ZOMBIE MONSTER

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.461
FROM MY DECK
TO MY HAND!

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:41.386
OHH.

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:43.722
JADEN'S HANGING ON...

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:47.158
BUT STILL, CAMULA HAS
WAY MORE LIFE POINTS
THAN HIM...

00:13:47.158 --> 00:13:48.393
FOR SURE...
SHADOW CHARM OR NOT

00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:50.695
HOW COULD WE EVER
LET HIM DUEL CAMULA?

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:52.597
HE'S JUST NOT AT
THE TOP OF HIS GAME!

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:53.798
WE MIGHT AS WELL
HAND OVER

00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:56.334
OUR SPIRIT KEYS
RIGHT NOW!

00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:57.536
Bastion:
THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.404
BUT I ADMIT,
WITH THAT VAMPIRE GENESIS...

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:02.474
AND THAT GENESIS CRISIS
ON THE FIELD,

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:03.909
THERE ISN'T MUCH OF IT.

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.510
LET'S BARGAIN
WITH HER--

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.646
MAYBE PUT HER
IN TOUCH WITH
THE LOCAL BLOOD BANK?

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.381
I THINK THIS IS
BIGGER THAN
THAT, PROFESSOR,

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.950
I MEAN SURE...
VAMPIRES CRAVE BLOOD...

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.320
BUT I THINK
THIS ONE CRAVES OUR
SPIRIT KEYS A LOT MORE!

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.591
PATHETIC MORTAL...
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I CRAVE...

00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:24.629
CENTURIES AGO, THE VAMPIRES VERE
A PROUD AND PEACEFUL RACE.

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:28.433
WE LIVED IN HARMONY WITH OUR
MORTAL BROTHERS AND SISTERS...

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.602
THAT IS...UNTIL
THE DARK TIMES....

00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:32.304
UNTIL THE WAR...

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:36.241
NO ONE KNEW WHO STRUCK FIRST...
BUT THE FIGHTING WAS FIERCE.

00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.344
NEITHER SOLDIER NOR CHILD WAS
SPARED THE HORROR

00:14:39.344 --> 00:14:41.713
AS HATRED DECIMATED BOTH
OUR PEOPLES.

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:46.751
I, THE LAST OF MY RACE, HAD NO
CHOICE BUT TO GO INTO HIDING.

00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:50.221
FOR YEARS I SLEPT.
A COFFIN AS MY HOME.

00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:52.190
THEN A STRANGER APPROACHED.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.894
THE DARK POWER OF SHADOW
COURSED THROUGH HIS VEINS.

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:59.631
HE OFFERED ME A CHOICE:
SPEND AN ETERNITY IN MY TOMB,

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:02.000
OR ACCEPT HIS SHADOW CHARM
AND JOIN HIS QUEST

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.269
FOR THE SACRED BEAST CARDS.

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:07.372
FOR EACH DUELIST THAT
I WOULD BEAT IN BATTLE...

00:15:07.372 --> 00:15:09.507
THEIR SOUL WOULD BE MINE!

00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:14.179
WHICH I WOULD USE TO RESURRECT
MY DEFEATED ARMY OF VAMPIRES,

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.981
AND WE WOULD SUCK OUR REVENGE

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:19.751
FROM THE BLOATED
VEIN OF HUMANITY!

00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:22.320
WOW, A LITTLE TOO MUCH
INFORMATION THERE.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.322
SO IF I GO DOWN
RIGHT NOW,

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.459
YOU'LL GET MY KEY
AND MY SOUL TO START
A VAMPIRE ARMY?!

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:30.395
YOU'RE SMART
FOR A MORTAL.

00:15:30.395 --> 00:15:31.997
PERHAPS YOU'LL DO US
BOTH A FAVOR

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:34.299
AND JUST GIVE UP, JADEN.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:36.501
I WILL MAKE IT PAINLESS...

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:38.303
LADY, IF YOU THINK
THAT I'M GONNA
GIVE UP...

00:15:38.303 --> 00:15:41.206
YOU REALLY HAVE
GONE BATTY!

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.907
[THINKING]
ALRIGHT,

00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:45.810

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.224
OR IN THIS CASE,
POT 'A NEED...

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.060
CUZ THAT'S JUST
WHAT I GOT!

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.230
I PLAY DARK FACTORY
OF MASS PRODUCTION,

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.865
THIS LETS ME TAKE
TWO MONSTERS

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.867
FROM THE GRAVEYARD
AND PUT 'EM RIGHT
BACK IN MY HAND!

00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:15.242
HMM. NOW I
ACTIVATE...THIS!

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:18.845

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.047
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
POLYMERIZATION...

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:23.917
THIS BABY LET'S ME

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.152

SO CHECK OUT AVIAN
