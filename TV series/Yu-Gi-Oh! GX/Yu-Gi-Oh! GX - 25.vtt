00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:01.430

00:10:11.406 --> 00:10:12.774
ACTUALLY,
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

00:10:12.774 --> 00:10:15.277
I SHOULD SAY
SLAYER MODE!

00:10:15.277 --> 00:10:17.779
CUZ THAT'S JUST
WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO
TO THAT DRAGON!

00:10:19.648 --> 00:10:22.117
AWESOME! JADEN'S
JUST TAKEN LEAD!

00:10:22.117 --> 00:10:24.052

UH-OH.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.624
I ACTIVATE
MY MASKED DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:31.560
YOU SEE, WHEN THIS CARD
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD
DUE TO A BATTLE,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.362
I CAN SUMMON
A DRAGON-TYPE MONSTER

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:36.565
WITH 1,500 OR FEWER
ATTACK POINTS FROM MY DECK.

00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:38.266

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:40.502

YEAH, AND 3's THE LOWEST.

GET A LOT BIGGER.

AND SACRIFICING
HIS LEVEL 3 FORM,

00:11:55.143 --> 00:11:56.712
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:11:56.712 --> 00:11:58.213
NOW THEN...

00:11:58.213 --> 00:12:00.916

BE CAREFUL, JADEN!

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:13.361
BY LEVELING UP,
ARMED DRAGON'S POWER

00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.830
HAS SUBSTANTIALLY
INCREASED,

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.099
AND HE WAS PLENTY
POWERFUL BEFORE!

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:18.100
AW, MAN...

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.201

00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:21.803
WOW, CHAZZ,
THAT THING'S PRETTY SWEET!

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:23.939
BUT THEN...SO'S MY TRAP!

00:12:23.939 --> 00:12:25.407

AND I'LL EQUIP IT...
TO BURSTINATRIX!

00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:32.981
NOW MONSTERS WITH 1,900
OR MORE ATTACK POINTS
CAN'T ATTACK!

00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:34.950
THEM'S THE BREAKS!

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.785

HA HA HA!
HUH?

00:12:36.785 --> 00:12:37.853
YOU WANT BREAKS?

00:12:37.853 --> 00:12:39.554
I'LL GIVE YOU BREAKS,
JADEN,

00:12:39.554 --> 00:12:42.758
BECAUSE EVEN WITH THAT
HERO RING SHIELD OUT,

00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:46.695
MY ARMED DRAGON LEVEL 5
IS GOING TO CRUSH
YOUR CREATURE!

00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:47.796
HOW?

00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:50.665
ARMED DRAGON'S SPECIAL
ABILITY, THAT'S HOW!

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:54.269
YOU SEE, BY DISCARDING
A MONSTER TO THE GRAVE,

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:56.972
I CAN DESTROY A MONSTER
OF YOURS WHOSE ATTACK POINTS

00:12:56.972 --> 00:12:58.807
ARE EQUAL OR LESS
THAN THE ONE I TOSSED!

00:12:58.807 --> 00:13:00.142
WAIT, SO...

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:03.678
SO IF FLYING
KAMAKIRI 1 GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:13:03.678 --> 00:13:07.482
THEN JADEN'S
BURSTINATRIX WILL BE
IN BIG-TIME TROUBLE!

00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:09.384
SHE HAS
LESS ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:09.384 --> 00:13:11.853
I'M SORRY, BURST...

YOU SEE, IT TAKES
DISCIPLINE TO WIN.

00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.579
YOU NEED TO HAVE
A SENSE OF DUTY.

YOU NEED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF PLAN!

00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:23.584
