00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:33.444
WHEN I OBELISK,
I TEST GOOD!

00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:35.313
BUT WHEN COME TO DUEL,

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:38.483
DAMON HAVE SOME DEGREE
OF DIFFICULTY.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:42.854
Damon, thinking:
ALRIGHT, TIME TO
TAKE DOWN JINZO!

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:44.755
HERE GOES!

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.891
OH, GREAT! A TRAP!

00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:49.360
THIS IS THE WORST DRAW
I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY GOTTEN!

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.395
I'VE LOST!

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:54.198
MY DRAW RUIN ME...
EACH TIME!

00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:56.501
SO I DECIDE
I MUST IMPROVE!

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:59.437
I DO EVERYTHING
I CAN THINK OF!

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.672
SOMEONE! PLEASE!

00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:04.942
MAKE ME A BETTER
CARD DRAWER!

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.344
BUT NO ANSWER.

00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:07.645
NOTHING HAPPEN.

00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:09.580
ONLY WAVES GO
BACK AND FORTH.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.184
BACK AND FORTH.
ALWAYS BACK AND FORTH.

00:08:13.184 --> 00:08:14.719
THEN...HIT ME!

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:16.087
UH, YOU WANT ME TO
HIT YOU?

00:08:16.087 --> 00:08:18.155
NO, IT HIT ME.

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:20.658
JUST LIKE I KNOW WHAT
COME NEXT IN WAVE,

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.095
I REALIZE I CAN KNOW
WHAT COME NEXT IN CARDS.

00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:26.397
MUST SIMPLY BE
IN TUNE WITH NATURE!

00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:27.565
Alexis, thinking:
I'M THINKING THIS
GUY CAN'T HELP ME

00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:28.666
FIND MY BROTHER.

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:30.201
IN FACT, FROM
THE SMELL OF HIM,

00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.069
I DON'T THINK HE
CAN EVEN FIND
A BAR OF SOAP...

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.072
THIS WHY...
I LIVE OUT HERE.

00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:39.810
TO TRAIN, TO LEARN,
TO BE AT ONE WITH NATURE!

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.381
TO BE AT ONE...
WITH THE DRAW!

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.024
[GRUNTING]

00:08:57.762 --> 00:08:59.397
I GET VERY GOOD.

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:03.034
BUT STILL...ONLY ONE
WAY FOR I TO BE SURE.

00:09:03.034 --> 00:09:04.569
ULTIMATE TEST.

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:06.604
I DRAW EGG-WICHES.

00:09:06.604 --> 00:09:09.740
THIS IS WHY I TAKE
THEM THESE PAST WEEKS.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.776
NOT BECAUSE I THIEF!

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:13.511
WE UNDERSTAND.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.147
I DON'T.
I MEAN, DON'T GET
ME WRONG, DAMON...

00:09:16.147 --> 00:09:18.749
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
A THIEF ANYMORE, BUT...

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.318
BUT?
BUT THIS:

00:09:20.318 --> 00:09:21.485
I LIKE THOSE
EGG-WICHES

00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.621
AS MUCH AS
THE NEXT GUY,
SO LET'S DUEL!

00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:25.890
IF I WIN, THEN YOU
STOP SWIPIN' 'EM!

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.125
YOU WIN,
THEY'RE ALL YOURS!

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:29.260
HMM. FINE!

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.028
BUT I EXPERT DRAWER,

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:32.997
THERE NO WAY
YOU CAN BEAT ME!

00:09:32.997 --> 00:09:34.765
HEY, I'M NO SLOUCH!

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:35.766
IT'S TRUE!

00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:36.767
HE'S THE BEST I KNOW!

00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:37.598
OHH.

00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:38.799
Damon: IT ON!

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.100

00:09:45.634 --> 00:09:47.969
ALRIGHT, DAMON,
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:53.941
Both: LET'S DO THIS!

00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:59.746
IT'S TIME

HEH HEH HE. YES.

00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:24.471
THE NATURE
HAS TAUGHT ME WELL.

00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:26.273
I PLAY CARD FACEDOWN.

00:10:26.273 --> 00:10:28.575

WHAT'S THAT THING?

00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:36.883
NOT FRIENDLY.

00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:38.819
NOW FOR EVERY CARD
IN MY HAND

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:40.420

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.490
DRAWLER GAIN 500

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.393
AND I RETURN FOUR
CARD FROM HAND!

00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:12.819
BY DRAWLER HE NO GO
TO GRAVEYARD.

00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:15.188
HE GO TO BOTTOM
OF YOUR DECK

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:17.591
SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE
USE FOR LONG TIME!

00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:19.593
NOW MY TURN END.

00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:22.796

[THINKING]
SWEET! ANOTHER
GOOD DRAW!

00:11:25.198 --> 00:11:28.735
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
POLYMERIZATION!

00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:30.971
AND FUSE ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN

RAMPART BLASTER!

IN DEFENSE MODE?

00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:39.946
YEP...BUT IF I TAKE
ITS ATTACK POINTS...

00:11:39.946 --> 00:11:41.515
AND SPLIT THEM
IN HALF?

00:11:41.515 --> 00:11:44.985
I'M ALLOWED TO WAGE

00:11:44.985 --> 00:11:47.187

HE NO MATCH
FOR THE WAY OF NATURE!

00:12:06.006 --> 00:12:07.207

UH-OH.

00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:09.109
HE'S GOT A WEIRD
LOOK IN HIS EYE...

00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:11.878

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:13.547
I ACTIVATE TRAP!

00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:15.549
GO, MIRACLE DRAW!

00:12:15.549 --> 00:12:18.885
THIS HOW WORK:
BEFORE I MAKE MY
CARD DRAW FROM DECK...

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:21.722
I ANNOUNCE WHAT CARD
I THINK I DRAW,

00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:24.825
AND IF I RIGHT...
YOU TAKE 1,000 DAMAGE,

00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:27.194
I WRONG,
I TAKE DAMAGE!

00:12:27.194 --> 00:12:29.096
HE'S GUESSING WHAT
HE'S GOING TO DRAW?

00:12:29.096 --> 00:12:30.497
GOOD LUCK!

00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:32.799
THIS IS ONE
GUTSY MOVE!

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.134
[THINKING]
NO JOKE.

00:12:34.134 --> 00:12:35.168
NEARLY FORTY CARDS
IN THAT DECK...

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:36.970
AND HE'S GOING TO GUESS
THE TOP ONE?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.005
YOU THINK I WON'T
GUESS RIGHT.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.173
YOU MIGHT...

00:12:40.173 --> 00:12:41.742
NO MIGHT!

00:12:41.742 --> 00:12:43.443
THE SNOW NO NOT
MIGHT MELT!

00:12:43.443 --> 00:12:44.745
IT WILL MELT!

00:12:44.745 --> 00:12:47.481
AND I WILL GUESS RIGHT!

00:12:57.391 --> 00:12:59.893
DRAW WILL BE...CARD LOAN!

00:13:03.363 --> 00:13:04.398
HE'S RIGHT?!

00:13:04.398 --> 00:13:05.432
NO WAY!

00:13:05.432 --> 00:13:07.868
THIS GUY'S WEIRDING ME OUT.

00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:08.935

00:13:08.935 --> 00:13:12.539
NOW YOU TAKE
1,000 POINT DAMAGE.

[GRUNTING]

00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:19.045
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
CARD LOAN.

00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:22.015
YOU REGAIN 1,000 POINTS,

00:13:22.015 --> 00:13:24.951
AND I LOSE
1,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:27.921
BUT I GET TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM DECK!

00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:30.757
AND THEN I MUST
RETURN CARD TO MY DECK

00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:32.259
AT THE END OF MY TURN!

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:34.461
ALL OF THAT JUST
TO MAKE A DRAW?

00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:36.563

HUNCH WHAT'S THERE.

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:38.698

I ACTIVATE DRAWBER!

00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:44.004
A SPELL CARD!

00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:47.541
NOW YOU DRAW CARD,
AND I GUESS WHAT IT IS!

00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:50.377
I GUESS CORRECT
AND ALL CARD IN YOUR HAND

00:13:50.377 --> 00:13:54.648
AND ON FIELD GO BACK
TO YOUR DECK.

00:13:54.648 --> 00:13:57.250
OH, NO! THAT'LL LEAVE
JADEN WIDE OPEN!

00:14:07.294 --> 00:14:10.430
DRAW IS...DEFUSION!

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.998

00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:21.204
GUESS EVERYTHING
GOES BACK TO MY
DECK NOW...

00:14:21.204 --> 00:14:22.939

LEAVE IT AT THAT.

THERE IS ONLY ONE
CARD THAT CAN HELP ME.

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:17.394
WITH IT, I CAN
DESTROY MONSTER,

00:15:17.394 --> 00:15:19.930
THEN DESTROY JADEN!

I MUST DRAW SHIELD
CRUSH TO WIN.

SO THAT I CAN CREATE
THE ELEMENTAL

ALRIGHT! THAT DRAWLER
WON'T BE DESTROYING

00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:09.016

AND THAT MEANS THAT
YOU TAKE DAMAGE

00:18:30.504 --> 00:18:33.073
EQUAL TO HALF YOUR
DESTROYED MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:35.676
