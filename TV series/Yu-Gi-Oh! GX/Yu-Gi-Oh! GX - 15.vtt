WEBVTT

00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:03.175
Fontaine: ALL RIGHT,
CLASS, GET YOUR GAME ON--

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:04.876
TENNIS GAME, THAT IS!

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.920
COME ON,
WOULD SOMEONE TELL ME

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.623
WHAT IN THE WORLD
TENNIS HAS TO DO
WITH DUELING?

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:18.757
EVERYTHING!

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.025
TAKING TURNS,
THINKING ON YOUR FEET,

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.795
AND THE HARDER
YOU PLAY,

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:24.296
THE BETTER YOU DO.

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:25.664
WELL, IN THAT CASE.

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:31.503
ALEXIS, HEAD'S UP!

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:35.975
THAT'S DR. CROWLER--

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:41.180
THANK YOU.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.782
ALEXIS, THAT BALL
ALMOST CREAMED YOU.

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:47.186
ARE YOU OK?

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:49.822
YEAH, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO CARRY YOU TO THE NURSE?

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:54.827
THAT'S OK, THANKS.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.434
Boy, voice-over:
THAT'S ALEXIS RHODES.

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.705
DO YOU NEED ME
TO CARRY YOU
TO THE NURSE?

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.942
NO, I'M GOOD,
IT'S JUST I KNOW YOU
FROM OBELISK BLUE.

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:11.410
I'VE SEEN YOU AROUND--

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.946
NOT THAT I'VE EVER
HAD THE PLEASURE
OF TALKING TO YOU.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:16.282
SWEET.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:19.518
LET ALONE TOUCH YOU.

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:23.956
ANYWAY,
BACK TO MY MATCH.

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.424
WHAT WAS THE SCORE?

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.359
Second boy:
LOVE SOMETHING,
I THINK.

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:31.623
HOW WAS THAT?

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:32.858
NOPE.

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:36.362
THAT'S STILL NOT
A GOOD ENOUGH AN APOLOGY.

00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:38.030
A LITTLE HARDER
NEXT TIME.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.466
SOME OF MY VERTEBRAE
ARE STILL INTACT.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.101
YA KNOW, DR. CROWLER,

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.670
I SAW THE INCIDENT
AND TECHNICALLY JADEN
WASN'T EVEN THE ONE

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.205
THAT HIT YOU
WITH THAT BALL,

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:47.740
IF YA DON'T MIND
ME SAYING.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.009
WELL, I DO MIND,
BECAUSE JADEN WAS THE ONE
THAT STARTED IT.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.246
I SAW THE WHOLE THING
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.082
WELL, ONE EYE.

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:59.351
CYCLOPS.

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:02.521
CARE REPEATING THAT,
YOU SLIFER SLUDGE?

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:03.922
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
GONNA PUNISH ME,

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:05.324
HOW 'BOUT
I JUST PROMISE TO
QUIT TENNIS?

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:06.625
I DON'T EVEN
LIKE IT.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.594
DON'T LIKE TENNIS, EH?

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:12.097
WELL, THEN I CAN THINK
OF NO BETTER PUNISHMENT
FOR YOUR CRIME, THEN.

00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:15.367
I'LL MAKE YOU PLAY
UNDER THE STRICT TUTELAGE
OF OUR CAPTAIN.

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:17.302
HE'LL WHIP YOU
INTO SHAPE IN NO TIME.

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:19.972
COME ON, I SAID SORRY.

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:22.307
OH, YES, AND YOU WILL BE.

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:26.578
Jasmine: ALEXIS.

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:29.348
WE FOUND OUT WHO
THAT HOT TENNIS GUY
IS FOR YOU.

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:31.250
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, MINDY?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.619
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO FIND OUT
WHO HE WAS.

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:34.686
YEAH, YEAH.

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:35.954
ANYWAY,
HE'S A TOTAL CATCH.

00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:37.489
NOW TRY TO STAY CALM.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.191
HIS NAME IS
HARRINGTON ROSEWOOD,

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.026
AS IN ROSEWOOD
SPORTING GOODS,

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.795
AND THEY'VE GOT STORES
EVERYWHERE

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:44.530
AND HE'S THE HEIR.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.799
PLUS HE'S A THIRD YEAR
OBELISK BLUE.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.133
THAT'S GREAT.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.268
GREAT?

00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:51.203
AN OLDER GUY
WHO'S RICH
AND A HOTTIE?

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:52.538
THAT'S NOT GREAT,
ALEXIS,

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:53.672
THAT'S BOYFRIEND
MATERIAL,

00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:55.574
SO GO ON
AND GET HIM.

00:03:55.574 --> 00:03:59.077
GIRLS,
I'M JUST NOT LOOKING FOR
A BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:00.145
AW, MAN. AW, MAN.

00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:01.346
AW, MAN. AW, MAN.

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:04.349
WHERE'S THE LOUSY
TENNIS TEAM?

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.118
WHAT'S WITH
SUPER SPAZZ OVER THERE?

00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:08.854
DON'T KNOW, DON'T CARE.

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:11.290
ALEXIS, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE TENNIS TEAM MEETS?

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.591
OUT ON THE COURTS, SYRUS.

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:14.126
WHAT ON EARTH IS WRONG?

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.127
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:16.862
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.

00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:18.797
CARE TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC, SY?

00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:19.865
NO QUESTIONS.

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:22.034
HE'LL ONLY
COME BACK.

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:23.936
IT'S THE MOST
UNFAIR THING EVER.

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:25.537
DR. CROWLER'S
LETTING THE TENNIS
CAPTAIN

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:26.839
BOSS JADEN AROUND
AS PUNISHMENT

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.240
FOR HITTING HIM
WITH THAT BALL.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.242
HOW'S THAT
THE MOST UNFAIR
THING EVER?

00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:33.178
'CUZ THE CAPTAIN'S
THE GUY WHO
REALLY HIT CROWLER.

00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:34.780
WHO'S
THE CAPTAIN?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.814
SERVICE!

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.072
I THOUGHT THAT
WE WERE GONNA BE
PLAYING TENNIS,

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:57.942
NOT RUNNIN' SPEED DRILLS.

00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:02.980
MAN, THIS GUY
DOESN'T LET UP.

00:05:07.018 --> 00:05:09.854
COME ON, JADEN,
NO PAIN NO GAIN.

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:12.190
YOU'VE GOTTA HUSTLE
TO BUILD THAT MUSCLE.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.525
YOU NEED TO SWEAT
TO BECOME A THREAT.

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:15.626
IF YOU DON'T
PICK UP THE PACE,

00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:17.128
YOU WON'T WIN THE RACE.

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:19.030
OK, HARRINGTON.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.798
YOU CAN LAY OFF
WITH THE SPORTS CLICHES.

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:22.433
I GET IT, I GET IT.

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:26.103
HEY, THERE'S NO
LETTER "I" IN
THE WORD "TEAM," JADEN.

00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:29.140
WHY, THAT'S
THE VERY FIRST RULE
IN TENNIS.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.208
REALLY?

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.809
EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE PLAYIN' SINGLES?

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.277
MOVING ON,

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:35.980
IT'S TIME WE GOT TO WORK
ON YOUR FOREHAND
AND BACKHAND.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.415
I THINK
A THOUSAND STROKES

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:39.116
WILL HELP YOU
MAKE TENNIS
MORE YOUR RACKET.

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:41.118
GET IT? GET IT?

00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:42.119
I GET IT.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:43.521
THIS GUY'S A NUT.

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.690
THESE CLICHES,
THIS CRAZY PRACTICING--

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.192
YA KNOW,
HE IS A BIT OBSESSIVE.

00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:50.661
LET HIM OBSESS--
OVER ME!

00:05:54.298 --> 00:05:59.036
Harrington:
AND DONE...

00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.271
WITH THE FIRST 10.

00:06:02.974 --> 00:06:05.476
HI, ALEXIS.

00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:08.613
ALEXIS?

00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:09.947
HEY, THERE.

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:11.515
SORRY I'M SWEATING SO MUCH.

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:14.185
I'VE JUST BEEN KICKING
THIS GUY'S--

00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:17.588
JADEN, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST HEARD.

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:20.691
I WAS ON MY WAY HERE
AND I RAN INTO
PROFESSOR BANNER.

00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.127
HE TOLD ME SOMEONE'S
SPOTTED CHAZZ.

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:24.295
NO KIDDIN'?

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:27.031
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:29.367
A BENCH-WARMING
LOAFER LIKE JADEN

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.135
TALKING TO GIRL
LIKE ALEXIS?

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:32.203
NO WAY!

00:06:32.203 --> 00:06:34.472
TIME TO RUN SOME
INTERFERENCE.

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:36.474
HEY, TIME OUT!

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:37.942
WHAT?

00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:40.444
YOU CAN'T TALK TO
A FIRST ROUND PICK
LIKE ALEXIS.

00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:42.280
I MEAN,
YOU CAN'T EVEN
RETURN A BUGGYWHIP

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.547
WITH SOME TOP SPIN,

00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:45.950
SO STAY AWAY
FROM MY LITTLE
OBELISK PIXIE.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.518
OBELISK PIXIE?

00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:51.355
WONDER WHAT THAT
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:53.624
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
NO I DON'T.

00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:55.626
LISTEN, JADEN,
I'M WARNING YOU,

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.928
JUST STEP AWAY FROM
THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

00:06:57.928 --> 00:06:59.797
YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE.

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:02.800
DO NOT MAKE ME GO
ATHLETIC ON YOU.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.168
WHOA, BRO, COOL OFF.

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:06.637
ALEXIS AND I ARE
JUST TALKING HERE.

00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:08.139
NOW, YOU WERE SAYIN', LEX?

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:09.140
LEX?

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.141
WHAT IS THAT,
SOME KIND OF PET NAME?

00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:11.142
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:12.143
WHAT'S IT SHORT FOR?

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:13.944
"ALEXIS."

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:16.947
SURE, YOU'D LIKE ME
TO BELIEVE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:18.015
WELL, I DON'T.

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:19.917
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU SAY.

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:23.120
WHICH IS WHY
THIS LITTLE HUDDLE
IS OVER.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.622
GREAT, SO THEN BEAT IT.

00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:25.790
NO WAY, BRO.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.024
KNOW YOUR SPORTS.

00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:28.959
WHEN A HUDDLE IS OVER,
YOU MAKE YOUR PLAY.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.528
YOU DON'T RUN AWAY.

00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:32.797
I GET IT, YOU WANNA
TENNIS MATCH, RIGHT?

00:07:32.797 --> 00:07:33.798
NO WAY.

00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:34.865
I WANT A DUEL--

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:36.967
WINNER BECOMES
ALEXIS' FIANCE.

00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:38.469
WHOA! FIANCE?

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:39.870
SLOW DOWN.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.706
OH, I JUST
LOVE WEDDINGS.

00:07:41.706 --> 00:07:45.343
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT ARRANGED ONES.

00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:47.545
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE STAKES,

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:49.947
BUT I NEVER BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:51.015
YOU GOT IT.

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:53.517
HARRINGTON,
LET'S THROW DOWN.

00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:54.952
HERE WE GO.

00:07:54.952 --> 00:07:57.588
YEAH, AND IF THIS GUY DUELS
LIKE HE PLAYS TENNIS,

00:07:57.588 --> 00:07:59.757
IT'LL BE ROUGH GOING
FOR JADEN.

00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:05.096
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:07.965
YEP, AND WILLING.

00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:09.633
Both: LET'S DO THIS!

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:11.268
GET YOUR GAME ON.

00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:15.139
TWO CUTIE PIE BOYS
DUELING IT OUT
FOR YOUR HAND IN MARRIAGE?

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:16.874
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:19.477
PLEASE, MINDY,
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:20.945
OH, FINE, "ENGAGED."

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:22.513
WHAT,
ARE WE GOING TO
SPLIT HAIRS HERE?

00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:25.182
I'M NOT GETTING
ENGAGED EITHER, JAZZ.

00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:27.318
THE ONLY REASON I HAVEN'T
WALKED OUT OF HERE YET

00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:29.019
IS TO SEE IF
THE RUMORS ARE TRUE--

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.857
TO SEE IF HARRINGTON'S
REALLY AS GOOD AS ZANE.

00:08:32.857 --> 00:08:35.426
Sy, voice-over:
THOSE ARE THE RUMORS?

00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:38.696
AW, MAN,
IF HARRINGTON'S AS GOOD
AS MY BIG BROTHER,

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.865
THEN HE MUST NOT DUEL
LIKE HE'S PLAYS TENNIS.

00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:42.967
HE MUST DUEL
EVEN BETTER.

00:08:42.967 --> 00:08:44.368
SERVICE!

00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:48.305
FIRST, I'M GONNA VOLLEY
A SPELL CARD AT YOU--

00:08:48.305 --> 00:08:49.807
SERVICE ACE.

00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:51.976
A SPELL CARD ALREADY?

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:53.711
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,

00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.014
AND JUST LIKE A POWER SERVE,
IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT.

00:08:57.014 --> 00:08:58.549
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:00.151
I PICK A CARD.

00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:03.521
THEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
IF IT'S A SPELL,
TRAP, OR MONSTER.

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:05.456
IF YOU GUESS RIGHT,
YOU'RE FINE.

00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:07.258
BUT IF YOU GUESS WRONG...

00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:12.463
WELL THEN YOU GET SERVED
WITH A STINGING
1500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:14.498
SO I JUST GUESS?

00:09:14.498 --> 00:09:15.499
Jaden, voice-over:
EASY.

00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:21.305
WOW, THIS REALLY IS
MAKING JADEN SWEAT.

00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:23.641
YEAH, AND HUM, TOO.

00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.109
Jaden, voice-over: HMM.

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:30.748
LOOK AT YOU.

00:09:30.748 --> 00:09:34.285
I BET THIS IS PROBABLY
THE BEST WORKOUT
YOU'VE HAD ALL WEEK LONG.

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:35.286
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GUESS.

00:09:35.286 --> 00:09:38.289
IT'S A SPELL CARD!

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:39.523
YOU SURE?

00:09:39.523 --> 00:09:42.293
YOU CAN STILL CHANGE
YOUR MIND, YA KNOW.

00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:44.028
THEN WAIT.

00:09:44.028 --> 00:09:47.932
I'LL SWITCH MY GUESS
AND SAY IT'S A TRAP.

00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:49.433
MONSTER.

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.536
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE FOUND
ANOTHER THING
YOU'RE BAD AT, HUH?

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:55.873
ANYWAY, NOW WE'LL PUT
THIS CARD AWAY

00:09:55.873 --> 00:09:58.309
AND LET LOOSE
THE BIG STROKE.

00:09:58.309 --> 00:09:59.710
SERVICE ACE!

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.645
GOOD LUCK RETURNING
THIS SHOT, PAL!

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:12.289
15-LOVE, AND I'LL PLACE
THIS CARD FACEDOWN
TO FINISH THE SET.

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:13.524
YOUR SERVE.

00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:16.093
YEAH, AND I'D BETTER
MAKE IT COUNT.

00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:19.363
HERE GOES!

00:10:19.363 --> 00:10:21.365
Jaden, voice-over:
DECISIONS, DECISIONS.

00:10:21.365 --> 00:10:24.201
WELL, SINCE HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY MONSTERS OUT,

00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:26.537
I SHOULD PROLLY JUST GO
FOR THE DIRECT ATTACK

00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:30.508
WITH MY OLD FRIEND
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:38.582
NOW, AVIAN, SHOW
HARRINGTON WHY YOU'RE
THE REAL KING COURT.

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:42.786
QUILL CASCADE!

00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:44.622
DON'T THINK SO, BIRDBRAIN.

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:47.024
I ACTIVATE RECEIVE ACE.

00:10:47.024 --> 00:10:49.426
THIS TRAP CARD
NEGATES YOUR ATTACK

00:10:49.426 --> 00:10:53.030
THEN DEALS
1500 DAMAGE POINTS
DIRECTLY TO YOU.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.099
GOOD LUCK
FEATHERING THIS STORM.

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:04.677
THAT'S 30-LOVE,

00:11:04.677 --> 00:11:08.448
THOUGH I DO HAVE TO PAY
3 CARDS BECAUSE
OF THE TRAP I PLAYED.

00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:10.683
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA
THROW DOWN A FACEDOWN,

00:11:10.683 --> 00:11:12.752
AND THAT'S IT FOR ME.

00:11:12.752 --> 00:11:15.355
BOY, YOU ARE LAZY,
AREN'T YOU?

00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:17.924
HEY, BRO, THAT'S FINE!

00:11:17.924 --> 00:11:20.860
MAKES IT THAT MUCH
EASIER FOR ME.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.262
I PLAY SMASH ACE.

00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:24.364
IT LET'S ME
FLIP THE TOP CARD ON MY DECK,

00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:25.932
AND IF IT'S A MONSTER--

00:11:25.932 --> 00:11:28.268
LEMME GUESS--

00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:31.771
HEY, YOU'RE STARTING TO GET

00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:34.874
AND YOU WILL BE
GETTING SWUNG AT.

00:11:34.874 --> 00:11:36.943
OH, YEAH! A MONSTER.

00:11:36.943 --> 00:11:38.878
LADY LUCK--
SHE HATES ME.

00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:40.513
WELL, SHE LOVES ME.

00:11:40.513 --> 00:11:42.448
OF COURSE, MOST GIRLS DO.

00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:45.385
AND NOW GET READY
FOR SMASH ACE!

00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:52.625
SORRY,
BUT I'M ACTIVATIN'
MY FACEDOWN CARD.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.793
IT'S A TRAP--

00:11:53.793 --> 00:11:54.794
FEATHER WIND.

00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:55.829
EVER HEAR OF IT?

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:56.830
OR MAYBE
I SHOULD SAY,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.298
HAVE YA EVER
CAUGHT WIND OF IT?

00:11:58.298 --> 00:11:59.332
WHAT THE--

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:06.806
NO WAY!

00:12:06.806 --> 00:12:08.174
SORRY, PAL,

00:12:08.174 --> 00:12:12.612
BUT YOUR ACE
JUST GOT BLOWN
RIGHT OUT OF BOUNDS.

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:14.280
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.282
YOU WIN SOME,
YOU LOSE SOME.

00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:20.253
SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOTTA
TAKE HITS TO GIVE 'EM.

00:12:20.253 --> 00:12:23.156
GREAT, HE'S BACK
ON HIS CLICHE KICK.

00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:24.224
WELL, HERE'S MINE--

00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:26.226
HE WHO LAUGHS LAST,
LAUGHS LOUDEST.

00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.001
THIS IS PATHETIC.

00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:37.203
NOW THEY'RE SEEING
WHO CAN LAUGH
THE LONGEST?

00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:38.438
COME ON, HARRINGTON!

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.874
JUST IMAGINE
ME TICKLING YOU

00:12:40.874 --> 00:12:42.775
I'M STILL LAUGHING, JADEN.

00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:45.211
JUST 'CUZ I'M TALKING,
IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT.

00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:46.212
YOU HEAR ME?

00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:48.481
HEY, I'M STILL LAUGHING!

00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:50.083
I'M STILL LAUGHING!

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:53.853
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
THIS CONTEST JUST LIKE
YOU'RE LOSING THIS DUEL.

00:12:53.853 --> 00:12:55.188
YOU KNOW WHAT,
HARRINGTON?

00:12:55.188 --> 00:12:56.856
YOU CAN WIN
THIS LOUSY LAUGH FEST,

00:12:56.856 --> 00:12:59.192
BUT THIS DUEL'S
A DIFFERENT STORY.

00:12:59.192 --> 00:13:01.461
SURE, YOU MAY HAVE
HOME COURT ADVANTAGE,

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:02.929
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:04.430
AND DO YOU
WANNA KNOW WHY?

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.367
'CUZ IN A DUEL
I'M ALWAYS AT HOME.

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:08.534
SWEET!

00:13:08.534 --> 00:13:09.869
I'M PLAYIN' THIS.

00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:11.871
OH, YEAH!

00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:13.439
POLYMERIZATION!

00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:15.275
FUSE CLAYMAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:21.247
INTO THE ELEMENTAL HERO
RAMPART BLASTER!

00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:27.086
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:28.521
THAT'S HOW YOU DUEL,
JADEN.

00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:29.656
NICE WORK.

00:13:29.656 --> 00:13:30.757
LIKE THAT?

00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:32.258
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE THIS.

00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:35.028
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN,
ATTACK!

00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:36.729
ELECTRIC ORB!

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.205
AND I'LL FOLLOW IT UP
WITH RAMPART BLASTER.

00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:47.840
RAMPART BARRAGE!

00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:01.854
ALL TIED UP.

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:05.591
WAY TO GO, JADEN!

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:08.761
WELL, AT LEAST
THEY STOPPED LAUGHING.

00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:12.532
SO, GOT ANY CLICHES
TO SAY NOW?

00:14:12.532 --> 00:14:14.334
I SUPPOSE,

00:14:14.334 --> 00:14:20.440
BUT IN THIS CASE
I'LL LET MY CARD DO
MY TALKING FOR ME.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.042
SEE, THIS ONE
SAYS IT ALL.

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:24.544
DEUCE!

00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:26.379
ANOTHER SPELL CARD?

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:27.847
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:14:27.847 --> 00:14:30.283
BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:34.020
I CAN ONLY ACTIVATE IT
WHEN WE BOTH HAVE
1,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.655
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:14:35.655 --> 00:14:38.524
FROM NOW ON,
EACH OF US CAN ONLY ATTACK
WITH ONE MONSTER

00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:40.026
DURING OUR BATTLE PHASE,

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:43.162
AND LIFE POINTS DON'T MATTER.

00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:47.000
YOU WIN BY BEING
FIRST TO DAMAGE THE OTHER
TWICE IN A ROW.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.470
WAIT, SO IT'S JUST
A STRAIGHT UP
HEAD TO HEAD MATCH NOW?

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.537
RIGHT.

00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:54.307
I TOLD YOU THAT CARD
WOULD SAY IT ALL.

00:14:54.307 --> 00:14:56.376
I SUMMON THE BIG SERVER!

00:14:56.376 --> 00:14:58.378
THE REASON
HIS SERVE IS SO BIG

00:14:58.378 --> 00:15:03.249
IS BECAUSE IT STRIKES DIRECTLY
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:15:03.249 --> 00:15:07.387
NOW, BIG SERVER,
ATTACK WITH SPIKED SERVE.

00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:20.033
ADVANTAGE, HARRINGTON.

00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:21.768
THAT WAS EASY.

00:15:21.768 --> 00:15:24.604
NOW JUST ONE MORE STRIKE
AND YOU'RE FINISHED.

00:15:24.604 --> 00:15:28.241
THE DUEL WILL BE OVER,
AND ALEXIS WILL BE MINE.

00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:33.613
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:35.681
THE BIG SERVER
HAS A SPECIAL ABILITY

00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:38.017
THAT LETS ME
TAKE SERVICE ACE
FROM MY DECK

00:15:38.017 --> 00:15:39.752
AND PLACE IT IN MY HAND.

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:42.188
YOU GET A NEW CARD, TOO,
BUT IT WON'T MATTER.

00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:43.756
I MEAN, LET'S BE REAL HERE.

00:15:43.756 --> 00:15:46.192
THERE'S NO WAY IT'LL BE
AS GOOD AS THIS ONE.

00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:47.460
HOW COULD IT BE?

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.828
NOW DRAW YOUR CARD.

00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:57.870
ALL RIGHT,
AND NOW I'M SERVING UP
THE SPELL CARD SERVICE ACE.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.473
YOU REMEMBER HOW IT WORKS,
RIGHT?

00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:02.275
YOU CHOOSE THE CARD'S TYPE.

00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:04.277
IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE GOOD.

00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:07.146
YEAH, AND IF I'M WRONG,
I'M A GONER.

00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:10.483
Jaden, voice-over:
'SPECIALLY SINCE THAT'LL
BE TWO HITS IN A ROW.

00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:12.919
Sy, voice-over:
HE ONLY HAS
A 1-IN-3 CHANCE.

00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:14.754
Alexis, voice-over:
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS--

00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:17.223
THE GAME, THE SET,
THE MATCH.

00:16:24.664 --> 00:16:26.833
Jaden, voice-over:
HOPE I GUESS RIGHT.

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:32.038
ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS YOU DREW
A MONSTER CARD.

00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:33.206
YOU GOT IT.

00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:34.440
SWEETNESS!

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.210
YEAH, WE'RE
STILL IN IT.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.678
OH, YEAH?

00:16:38.678 --> 00:16:40.713
TELL ME IF YOU
STILL THINK YOU'RE IN IT
AFTER THIS.

00:16:40.713 --> 00:16:45.451
I PLAY GIANT RACKET
AND EQUIP IT TO BIG SERVER.

00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:46.953
SO, YA STILL IN IT?

00:16:46.953 --> 00:16:48.020
TO WIN IT.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.922
I CAN TAKE THAT
SERVER GUY DOWN.

00:16:49.922 --> 00:16:53.025
MAYBE,
BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT
ON YOUR FIRST TRY.

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:56.095
SEE, WHEN A MONSTER
IS EQUIPPED WITH GIANT RACKET,

00:16:56.095 --> 00:17:00.366
IT HAS A ONE TIME POWER
THAT ALLOWS IT TO TURN
ANY BATTLE DAMAGE TO ZERO.

00:17:00.366 --> 00:17:02.602
WAIT, AND SINCE YOUR
DEUCE ONLY ALLOWS ME

00:17:02.602 --> 00:17:04.937
TO ATTACK WITH ONE
MONSTER PER TURN,

00:17:04.937 --> 00:17:06.439
I WON'T BE ABLE TO
DESTROY HIM.

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.208
BIG SERVER CAN'T BE BEAT
BY ONE ATTACK.

00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:10.776
EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:13.212
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
YOU'RE NOT IN IT,

00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:14.447
YOU'RE NOT ALL OVER IT,

00:17:14.447 --> 00:17:15.915
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT
TO LOSE IT.

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:22.855
Jaden, voice-over:
NOT AS LONG AS THERE ARE
STILL CARDS IN MY DECK.

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:24.190
HERE WE GO!

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.224
DRAW!

00:17:28.808 --> 00:17:31.010
SWEET!

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.279
THE BALL'S
IN MY COURT NOW.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:36.215
FIRST,
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
CARD DEFUSION.

00:17:36.215 --> 00:17:38.952
WITH IT, I'LL DEFUSE
RAMPART BLASTER.

00:17:42.822 --> 00:17:45.558
NOW I HAVE 3 MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD,

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:48.328
WHICH MEANS
EVEN IF YOU BLOCK
MY FIRST ATTACK,

00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:50.430
I CAN STILL HIT YOU
WITH TWO MORE.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.966
THEN YOU'LL LOSE
THE DUEL.

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:55.568
I'M STARTING TO SEE WHY
YOU'RE RANKED AS A SLIFER,

00:17:55.568 --> 00:17:57.637
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LISTEN.

00:17:57.637 --> 00:17:59.806
AS LONG AS
MY SPELL CARD'S OUT,

00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:02.542
YOU CAN ONLY ATTACK
WITH ONE MONSTER PER TURN.

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:05.044
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU HAVE 3.

00:18:05.044 --> 00:18:07.647
I'M STARTING TO SEE WHY
YOU'RE A SNOBBY OBELISK.

00:18:07.647 --> 00:18:09.082
WHAT?

00:18:09.082 --> 00:18:12.552
'CUZ YOU REALLY
UNDERESTIMATE
YOUR OPPONENTS.

00:18:12.552 --> 00:18:15.621
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
FEATHER SHOT.

00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:19.225
IT LETS AVIAN ATTACK
ONCE FOR EVERY MONSTER
I HAVE ON THE FIELD.

00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:21.394
I DREW THIS CARD
WHEN YOU ACTIVATED

00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:23.496
THE BIG SERVER'S
SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:25.031
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID?

00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:28.634
YOU GET A NEW CARD, TOO,
BUT IT WON'T MATTER.

00:18:28.634 --> 00:18:30.636
YEAH, WELL, GUESS WHAT?

00:18:30.636 --> 00:18:32.472
IT MATTERED!

00:18:32.472 --> 00:18:34.007
GO, AVIAN!

00:18:34.007 --> 00:18:37.176
ATTACK WITH
QUILL CASCADE TIMES 3!

00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:41.447
THAT'S ONE.

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:45.618
THAT'S TWO.

00:18:49.322 --> 00:18:51.791
AND THIS THIRD TIME
WILL BE THE CHARM.

00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:01.067
WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT.

00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:02.301
ALL RIGHT!

00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:05.438
HE'S GETTING
MARRIED!

00:19:05.438 --> 00:19:07.974
I MEAN,
SOMEDAY HE WILL,
MAYBE.

00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:09.008
LEXI?

00:19:11.811 --> 00:19:13.112
THIS CAN'T BE.

00:19:13.112 --> 00:19:15.815
YEAH! THAT'S GAME!

00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:17.316
BUT SHE WAS MY SOUL MATE!

00:19:17.316 --> 00:19:18.451
MY FIRST DRAFT PICK!

00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:20.353
MY MARQUEE GIRLFRIEND!

00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:29.662
WOW, YOU HAD TO
WORK FOR THAT ONE, JADEN.

00:19:29.662 --> 00:19:32.365
HEY, NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:35.301
SPEAKING OF GAIN,
HAS JADEN GAINED A WIFE?

00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:39.038
SO ROMANTIC.

00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:43.376
WELL, ALEXIS,
GUESS I'M YOUR FIANCE.

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:45.144
HE'S GOING
THROUGH WITH IT?

00:19:45.144 --> 00:19:47.046
OH, MY.

00:19:47.046 --> 00:19:51.818
SO WHAT'S "FIANCE" MEAN,
ANYHOW?

00:19:51.818 --> 00:19:53.719
IT MEANS "FRIEND"--

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:55.354
AT LEAST,
FOR NOW, BIG GUY.

00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:06.365
ALEXIS,
I'LL WIN YOUR HEART YET!

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:08.334
ALTHOUGH MINDY
DID SLIP ME HER NUMBER.
