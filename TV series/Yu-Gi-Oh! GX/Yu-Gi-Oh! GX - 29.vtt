00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:46.312
MY DRAW! HYAH!

00:16:46.312 --> 00:16:47.413
ALL RIGHT!

00:16:47.413 --> 00:16:51.016
I PLAY THE SPELL
CARD: POLYMERIZATION!

00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:55.821
AND...WITH CLAYMAN
AND BURSTINATRIX
IN MY HAND...

00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:57.790
I'LL FUSE THEM
TO CREATE...

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.793
THE ELEMENTAL HERO
RAMPART BLASTER!

00:17:04.096 --> 00:17:05.731
AND EVEN
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:17:05.731 --> 00:17:07.199
SHE CAN STILL
BLAST YOU

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:09.034
WITH HALF HER
ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:09.034 --> 00:17:11.337
SO GO AHEAD AND LET
HIM HAVE IT, BLASTER!

00:17:14.273 --> 00:17:16.508
AND DON'T PULL
ANY FIREPOWER!

00:17:16.508 --> 00:17:18.410
RAMPART BARRAGE!

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:22.715
UNH!

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:23.849
YES!

00:17:26.652 --> 00:17:29.388
AND DON'T FORGET
SHE'S STILL IN DEFENSE!

00:17:29.388 --> 00:17:32.124
SO IF YA WANNA GET
TO ME...

00:17:32.124 --> 00:17:33.992
YOU'LL HAVE TO
GET THROUGH HER.

00:17:33.992 --> 00:17:35.561
PRETTY SWEET THERE,
DONTCHA THINK?

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:42.034
HMMM. OKAY...

00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:43.836
MAYBE NOT SO SWEET
FOR YOU,

00:17:43.836 --> 00:17:45.270
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN!

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.741
ENOUGH! UNH!

00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:50.175
YOU FOOL!

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:52.177
THAT BLASTER DOESN'T
CHANGE A THING!

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:54.513
BUT YOU CAN BET
THIS NEXT CARD WILL.

00:17:54.513 --> 00:17:57.116
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE
YOUR LIFE POINTS, JADEN.

00:17:57.116 --> 00:17:59.318
OH, AND NOT
IN A GOOD WAY!

00:17:59.318 --> 00:18:01.153
YOU SEE, JADEN,
YOUR BLASTER CAN'T

00:18:01.153 --> 00:18:04.056
PROTECT YOU FROM
MY RED EYES' ATTACK!

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:06.859
ALRIGHT, I'LL BITE,
WHY NOT?

00:18:06.859 --> 00:18:10.262
BECAUSE THIS TIME
HIS ATTACK IS
AN ACTUAL CARD!

00:18:10.262 --> 00:18:13.132
INFERNO FIRE BLAST!

00:18:13.132 --> 00:18:14.366
A CARD?!

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:15.367
LOOK OUT!

00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:16.368
NOT LISHUS!

00:18:18.237 --> 00:18:19.304
AAH!
AAH!

00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:20.939
[MOANING]

00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:23.409
[GROANING]

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:25.010
NICE CARD, HUH?

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.613
IT'S JUST AS STRONG
AS MY RED EYES' ATTACK...

00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:32.551
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
IT HITS YOUR LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.421
AND I'M NOT THROUGH
WITH YOU YET, KEY-KEEPER!

00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:38.323
NEXT I SUMMON
ATTACHMENT DRAGON!

00:18:41.527 --> 00:18:42.728
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:44.363
HE'S NOT
THE ATTACKING TYPE, SEE,

00:18:44.363 --> 00:18:46.465
LIKE HIS NAME SUGGESTS...

00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:49.268
HE'S A LOT MORE
OF THE ATTACHING TYPE!

00:18:49.268 --> 00:18:50.869
SHOW HIM, DRAGON!

00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:55.941
[SCREECHING]

00:19:04.183 --> 00:19:05.884
BLASTER'S MADE
A NEW FRIEND.

00:19:05.884 --> 00:19:08.887
A FRIEND THAT FORCES
HER INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:19:08.887 --> 00:19:11.723
AND BECAUSE SHE IS...
NO MORE DIRECT ATTACKS!

00:19:11.723 --> 00:19:13.125
OH NO...

00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.694
[MOANING]

00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:17.563
[SCREAMING]

00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:24.269
THIS THING...
IT'S GOING GONEZO!

00:19:27.973 --> 00:19:29.741
AW, MAN...
SO HOT!

00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:31.977
NOW I KNOW WHAT
GRILLED CHEESE FEELS LIKE!

00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:33.111
JADEN!

00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:35.013
[PANTING]

00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:42.321
ALL RIGHT, MY TURN!

00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:44.790
HYAH!

00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:48.891
[THINKING]
AND FROM THE RATE THAT
ORB IS DISAPPEARIN'...

00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:53.095
MAYBE MY LAST CHANCE
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS...

00:19:53.095 --> 00:19:54.828
AND THE WORLD!

00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:55.829
OHH.
