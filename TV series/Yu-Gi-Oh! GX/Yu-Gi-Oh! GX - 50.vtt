00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.744
THIS IS JUST
THE KIND OF THING

00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:22.350
WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.754
HMM?

00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:25.093
WHEN HE DUELED
HIS DAD,

00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:26.665
CHUMLEY BLANKED OUT
ON THE FLIP EFFECT.

00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:28.271
BUT THANKS
TO LAST NIGHT,

00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.685
CHUMLEY'S NOW A LEAN,
MEAN DUEL MACHINE.

00:08:32.685 --> 00:08:34.157
HMM.

00:08:34.157 --> 00:08:36.331
WELL, MAYBE
NOT LEAN.

00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:41.349
I SUMMON EUCALYPTUS MOLE
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:44.761
AND NEXT I'LL BE LAYING DOWN
ANOTHER FACEDOWN.

00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:48.005
COME NOW, CHUMLEY.
THAT'S YOUR MOVE?

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:54.160
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM
AND EUCALYPTUS MOLE!

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.604
MECHANIZED MELEE!

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.913
AND OF COURSE,
LEST YOU FORGET,

00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:01.953
ALL EXTRA DAMAGE
GOES TO YOU.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.669
LET'S JUST WAIT
ONE MINUTE, OK?

00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:09.680
IF YOU TAKE OUT
MY EUCALYPTUS MOLE,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.191
I GET A KOALA
FROM MY DECK.

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.466
AND GUESS WHO
WANTS TO SAY HI.

00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:18.945
MY LITTLE FRIEND, BIG KOALA.

00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:21.721
MORE LIKE...A BIG WASTE.

00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:25.167
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WILL BE SUMMONING

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:27.174
ANCIENT GEAR SOLDIER!

00:09:27.174 --> 00:09:30.050
WHATEVER.
CHECK THIS. LISHUS.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.632
I'M GOING TO PLAY...
WILD NATURE'S RELEASE.

00:09:34.632 --> 00:09:38.044
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY BIG KOALA'S DEFENSE POINTS

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.623
ARE ADDED ONTO
HIS ATTACK POINTS.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.697
WHEN DID CHUMLEY
GET SO GOOD?

00:09:43.697 --> 00:09:45.202
FROM WATCHING ME.

00:09:45.202 --> 00:09:46.774
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:51.423
OK, KOALA, TAKE OUT
THAT PILE OF RUSTY BOLTS.

00:09:52.728 --> 00:09:54.535
TAKEDOWN FROM DOWN UNDER!

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:01.057
NOTHING I CAN'T
COME BACK FROM.

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:02.562
ALL RIGHT.

00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:04.836
NOW CHECK OUT
MY FACEDOWN.

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:06.977
ISN'T IT, LIKE,
TOTALLY AWESOME?

00:10:06.977 --> 00:10:08.984
BEAST SOUL SWAP
LETS ME BRING BACK

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.823
A MONSTER
TO MY HAND,

00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:13.499
AND THEN I GET TO
SUMMON ANOTHER BEAST

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:16.108
WITH THE SAME LEVEL.
IT'S SWITCHALICIOUS.

00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.516
GUESS I'LL CALL...

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:21.561
ANOTHER BIG KOALA.

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.839
UH...I'M LOST. WHY DID HE
TRADE OUT FOR ANOTHER?

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:27.547
ANYONE? WELL?

00:10:27.547 --> 00:10:30.224
HA HA. I THOUGHT
CHUMLEY WAS DUMB.

00:10:30.224 --> 00:10:32.565
WILD NATURE'S
RELEASE IS RISKY.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.676
THE CARD DESTROYS
YOUR MONSTER.

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:38.084
YEAH, UNLESS YOU SWAP OUT
YOUR MONSTER,

00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:40.659
JUST LIKE CHUMLEY DID.
NICE MOVE, HUH?

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:42.231
UH, YEAH.

00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:43.904
YOU KNOW,
I THINK SY

00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:45.576
SLEPT THROUGH
THAT CLASS.

00:10:45.576 --> 00:10:47.182
AND LOOK
WHO'S TALKING!

00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:48.620
HA HA HA!

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.597
ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK
I'D CALL IT SLEEPING IN CLASS.

00:10:51.597 --> 00:10:54.374
IT'S MORE LIKE SCHEDULED
STUDY EYE BREAKS.

00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:56.280
Alexis: GIVE ME
A BREAK, JADEN.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.395
BIG KOALA, TAKE OUT
THAT GEAR SOLDIER.

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:06.248
NOW, THAT'S
AN AUSSIE-SIZED
SUPER SLAM!

00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:09.492
AH. IT'S ALL FOR NAUGHT.

00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:12.804
AND I'LL BE LAYING DOWN
ONE FACEDOWN.

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.977
THE TUTORIAL IS OVER.

00:11:14.977 --> 00:11:18.490
IT'S TIME TO GIVE CHUMLEY
A REAL SCHOOLING.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.069
LET'S SEE HOW
YOU HANDLE THIS.

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.547
OK, CHUMLEY, I ACTIVATE
MY POT OF GREED,

00:11:25.547 --> 00:11:30.531
WHICH, OF COURSE, ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW TWO MORE CARDS...

00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:34.210
SUCH AS THE ULTIMATE SPELL
CARD--ANCIENT GEAR FACTORY!

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.984
OH!
OH!

00:11:38.526 --> 00:11:40.366
AH...

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:44.145
DEAR CHUMLEY,
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FAIL

00:11:44.145 --> 00:11:46.386
FOR THE LAST TIME.

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:52.407
THE ANCIENT GEAR FACTORY.

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:54.514
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:59.029
IT ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
ANY ANCIENT GEAR CARD I HOLD,

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:03.077
SUCH AS MY FRIEND,
THE ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM.

00:12:03.077 --> 00:12:04.381
UH!

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:05.786
NOT AGAIN.

00:12:05.786 --> 00:12:07.224
JUST WHAT'S HE
TRYING TO PULL?

00:12:07.224 --> 00:12:08.796
WHAT ABOUT HIS SACRIFICE?

00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:11.071
AS IN GOLEM
KIND OF NEEDS ONE.

00:12:11.071 --> 00:12:12.409
NOT QUITE.

00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:13.881
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD.

00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:15.486
YOU'RE HERE?

00:12:15.486 --> 00:12:18.162
WHY NOT? I JUST
LOVE A GOOD DUEL,

00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:20.637
THOUGH IT DOESN'T LOOK
SO GOOD FOR CHUMLEY.

00:12:20.637 --> 00:12:23.815
HE'S RIGHT. I DON'T NEED
TO SACRIFICE A CARD.

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:28.096
ALL YOU NEED DO
IS LOOK INTO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:28.096 --> 00:12:30.103
IF IT HOLDS ANCIENT
GEAR MONSTERS

00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:33.682
WHOSE LEVELS ARE
TWICE THAT OF MY GOLEM,

00:12:33.682 --> 00:12:35.689
THEY BECOME
THE SACRIFICE,

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:38.499
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
ALREADY DESTROYED.

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:50.875
SO, PLEASE, LET'S ALL
WELCOME BACK...

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:53.316
[RUMBLING AND HISSING]

00:12:53.316 --> 00:12:56.962
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM!

00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:10.274
WHAT A MOVE! I MEAN,
YOU KNOW, I GUESS.

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:13.051
HEY, JUST WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:16.229
DEAR CHUMLEY, HOW CAN I
RECOMMEND YOU?

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.302
I MEAN, COME NOW.

00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:21.614
YOU CAN'T EVEN WIN
ONE EASY DUEL.

00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:24.992
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM,
ATTACK BIG KOALA.

00:13:24.992 --> 00:13:28.103
MECHANIZED MELEE.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.525
I PLAY A TRAP CARD.

00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:37.535
AND IT'S
A TOTALLY-LISHUS ONE

00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:39.342
CALLED ANIMAL TRAIL.

00:13:39.342 --> 00:13:44.158
NOW DES KANGAROO JUMPS
RIGHT INTO MY HAND.

00:13:46.499 --> 00:13:48.138
A KANGAROO?
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO

00:13:48.138 --> 00:13:50.447
MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT, CHUMLEY.

00:13:50.447 --> 00:13:54.259
SOMETHING...LIKE
ANCIENT GEAR DRILL!

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:57.269
IMPRESSIVE, ISN'T IT?

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:00.147
THANKS TO THIS
LISHUS CARD,

00:14:00.147 --> 00:14:03.725
I GET TO TAKE
ANY SPELL CARD

00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:05.799
AND PLACE IT
FACEDOWN.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.070
OH, MAN.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.077
DID HE SAY
"ANY SPELL"?

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:11.519
THIS IS NOT
BODING WELL.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.696
GIVE IT A REST ALREADY.
HE'S THROUGH.

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:16.870
NOT YET. CHUMLEY,
REMEMBER LAST NIGHT

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.443
AND WHAT I SAID?

00:14:18.443 --> 00:14:20.115
WHICH
WAS WHAT?

00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:22.891
THAT YOUR FRIENDS
ARE WITH YOU!

00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.397
[CHEERING]

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:33.495
I GET IT NOW.

00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:36.471
THAT'S WHY JADEN
HAS SO MUCH FUN.

00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:38.411
HE NEVER DUELS ALONE,
BECAUSE HE'S GOT US.

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:40.987
AND NOW I GOT THEM.

00:14:40.987 --> 00:14:42.727
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:14:42.727 --> 00:14:44.834
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME,
CROWLER,

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:46.706
BECAUSE IT'S
MORE THAN JUST ME.

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:49.349
IT'S ALL MY BEST BUDS, TOO.

00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:50.720
HMM. RIGHT ON!

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.891
LOOK AT HIM.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.229
HE'S HAPPY.

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:54.400
THAT'S A FIRST.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.805
YEAH. BIG DEAL.

00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:57.912
JADEN, THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING?

00:14:57.912 --> 00:15:00.186
NOW LET'S DO THIS.

00:15:00.186 --> 00:15:02.461
JADEN CAN'T SAVE YOU.

00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:04.602
BUT THIS CARD
JUST MIGHT.

00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:06.074
UH!

00:15:06.074 --> 00:15:07.545
IT'S MY CARD,

00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.217
THE ONE
I THOUGHT UP

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.492
WHEN I WENT CAMPING
WITH MY DAD.

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:13.499
AW, WHO AM I KIDDING?

00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:15.573
FROM WHEN I RAN AWAY.

00:15:15.573 --> 00:15:18.917
IT WAS AFTER I FLUNKED
MY SECOND ADVANCEMENT EXAM.

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:23.601
I WENT TO TOSS MY DECK OFF
THE HIGHEST ROCK I COULD FIND

00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:25.574
TO GIVE UP DUELING
FOR GOOD.

00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:34.572
BUT THEN...IT HAPPENED.

00:15:34.572 --> 00:15:35.910
HUH?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.913
OH!

00:15:38.853 --> 00:15:42.632
I SAW THE MOST AWESOME-LICIOUS
SUNRISE EVER.

00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:44.639
AND THAT'S
WHEN I REALIZED--

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:47.616
THINGS MAY SEEM TO BE
AT THEIR DARKEST,

00:15:47.616 --> 00:15:50.594
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
STAY THAT WAY FOR LONG.

00:15:50.594 --> 00:15:51.663
UH!

00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:55.209
I ACTIVATE
AYERS ROCK SUNRISE!

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:00.594
YOU CAN'T STOP
THE SUN FROM RISING,

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:03.972
JUST LIKE YOU
CAN'T STOP MY DREAM.

00:16:03.972 --> 00:16:06.314
I WILL BE A FAMOUS
CARD DESIGNER,

00:16:06.314 --> 00:16:08.388
AND NOW LET'S SEE

00:16:08.388 --> 00:16:10.395
ONE OF MY FIRST
CARDS IN ACTION.

00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:12.335
FIRST, IT LETS ME
SUMMON ONE BEAST

00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:13.907
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:15.145
THINK YOU CAN
GUESS WHO?

00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:20.865
THE ONE, THE ONLY
BIG KOALA!

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.247
THEN TURN YOUR EYES
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:16:25.247 --> 00:16:28.758
AND YOU'LL FIND FOR EACH BEAST,
PLANT, OR WINGED BEAST,

00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:33.742
MR. TALL, DARK, AND RUSTY
LOSES 200 ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:35.715 --> 00:16:36.953
AAH!

00:16:36.953 --> 00:16:39.729
NOW, HOW ABOUT WE TRY
SOMETHING FUSE-ALICIOUS

00:16:39.729 --> 00:16:43.141
WITH POLYMERIZATION!

00:16:43.141 --> 00:16:46.385
I'M MELDING BIG KOALA
AND DES KANGAROO

00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:50.533
TO CREATE MASTER OF OZ
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:53.209
THAT'S, LIKE,
CHUMLEY'S BEST MONSTER.

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:55.283
GO GET 'EM, CHUM.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.468
ALL RIGHT. TIME TO FINALLY
ACE AN EXAM.

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:05.117
BRAVO, CHUMLEY.
VERY IMPRESSIVE,

00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:07.157
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

00:17:07.157 --> 00:17:11.874
IMPRESSIVE INDEED,
BUT HOW COULD I, DR. CROWLER,

00:17:11.874 --> 00:17:15.218
AN OBELISK BLUE, ALLOW
A SLIFER RED FLUNKY

00:17:15.218 --> 00:17:18.798
TO DEFEAT MOI?
THE ANSWER--I CAN'T.

00:17:18.798 --> 00:17:22.510
IF YOU ATTACK, IT WILL
BE YOUR LAST MISTAKE.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.330
ALL RIGHT, MASTER OF OZ,
ATTACK ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.005
OUTBACK ATTACK!

00:17:31.005 --> 00:17:33.214
HA HA HA HA!

00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:39.936
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
LIMITER REMOVAL!

00:17:39.936 --> 00:17:41.040
SAY WHAT?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.382
WITH IT,
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:17:43.382 --> 00:17:46.192
OF ALL MY MACHINES
ARE DOUBLED!

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:50.573
MAN, THIS IS NOT
GOOD NEWS.

00:17:53.918 --> 00:17:56.494
AH...

00:17:59.805 --> 00:18:01.176
I LOST.

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:10.308
AH...

00:18:10.308 --> 00:18:12.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:15.225 --> 00:18:17.299
HEY, THAT WAS
YOUR BEST DUEL EVER.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.038
NICE WORK, CHUMLEY.

00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:21.814
YEAH. WAY TO PLAY.
REALLY. IT WAS AWESOME.

00:18:21.814 --> 00:18:23.821
AM I RIGHT, GUYS?

00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.059
BRAVO!

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:27.366
NOT TOO SHABBY,
I GUESS.

00:18:27.366 --> 00:18:29.708
BUT I...I STILL LOST.

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:31.648
I CAN'T GET
MY DREAM JOB.

00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:33.321
STOP THAT CRYING.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.591
HUH?

00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.067
IT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE
LOST THIS DUEL,

00:18:37.067 --> 00:18:39.107
BUT LOSING DOESN'T
ALWAYS MEAN FAILING.

00:18:39.107 --> 00:18:41.984
UH...WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

00:18:41.984 --> 00:18:44.191
UH...WHAT DOES HE MEAN?

00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:47.703
Crowler: YOU SEE, THE DUEL
WAS NOT TO WIN OR LOSE,

00:18:47.703 --> 00:18:49.945
BUT TO PROVE
YOUR ABILITY.

00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.216
HUH?

00:18:51.216 --> 00:18:53.022
FOR THE TALENT
YOU DISPLAYED TODAY,

00:18:53.022 --> 00:18:55.062
HOW COULD I
EVER FAIL YOU?

00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:57.570
I WILL RECOMMEND YOU
FOR THE POSITION

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.243
AT INDUSTRIAL
ILLUSIONS.

00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:02.119
HUH? SO I'M NOT
KICKED OUT?

00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:03.725
YOU'RE GRADUATING.

00:19:05.966 --> 00:19:09.178
FAREWELL, AND
CONGRATULATIONS, CHUMLEY.

00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:15.332
HE IS GOING. I DON'T KNOW
HOW I SHOULD FEEL.

00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:18.108
LOOK, CHUMLEY GETS
TO FOLLOW THIS DREAM.

00:19:18.108 --> 00:19:19.680
LET'S NOT BE SAD.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.289
WE SHOULD BE
ALL PARTIES AND HUGS.

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:24.129
HUH? AH!

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.002
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:38.511
CHUMLEY, GOOD LUCK.

00:19:42.726 --> 00:19:48.178
GOOD-BYE, EVERYONE--
JADEN, SY...

00:19:48.178 --> 00:19:50.744
I'LL BE BACK. HMM.

00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:53.413
SOMEDAY.
