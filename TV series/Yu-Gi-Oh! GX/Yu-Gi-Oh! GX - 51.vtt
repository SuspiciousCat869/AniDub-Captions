00:08:27.526 --> 00:08:29.164
BUT NOW I KNOW.

00:08:29.164 --> 00:08:30.803
HE WAS PREPARED FOR
EITHER SITUATION!

00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:33.678
QUESTION IS: AM I?

00:08:33.678 --> 00:08:37.123
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
THAT CYBER END DRAGON
IS OUT.

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:39.899
AFTER ALL, WHEN IT
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.571
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ITS ATTACK POINTS

00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:43.912
AND THE DEFENDING
MONSTER'S DEFENSE POINTS

00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:46.018
ARE DEALT TO ME
AS DAMAGE.

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:47.757
MAN, HOW COULD I HAVE
LET THIS HAPPEN?

00:08:51.402 --> 00:08:53.709
ARGH! WELL?!

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:56.117
ANYTHING ELSE YOU
WANNA THROW AT ME?

00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:59.729
AS A MATTER OF FACT...
YES, THERE IS.

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:01.334
DIFFERENT DIMENSION CAPSULE!

00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:04.577
NOW, JADEN...

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.684
I SELECT ONE CARD
IN MY DECK...

00:09:06.684 --> 00:09:08.055
AND REMOVE IT FROM PLAY.

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:12.470
BUT THEN...IN TWO TURNS,
IT RETURNS TO MY HAND.

00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:15.980
HEY, I REMEMBER THIS...

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.786
IN OUR FIRST DUEL,

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.793
ZANE USED THAT DIFFERENT
DIMENSION CAPSULE

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.298
TO ADD POWER BOND
TO HIS HAND.

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:23.706
WONDER IF HE'S DOIN'
THE SAME THING HERE.

00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:29.390
FINALLY, I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.396
HM...THE
PLOT THICKENS.

00:09:31.396 --> 00:09:32.968
A FACE DOWN, TOO?

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:34.072
I CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE
WHAT THOSE CARDS ARE

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:35.945
BUT I SURE HAVE A HUNCH!

00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:39.021
YEAH, THAT CAPSULE CARD
MUST BE POWER BOND.

00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:41.964
AND THE FACEDOWN
HE JUST THREW MUST
BE DE-FUSION!

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:43.937
HE MUST BE PLANNING TO
DEFUSE CYBER END DRAGON

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:45.441
AND THEN FINISH ME OFF!

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:46.712
JADEN, GO ON.

00:09:46.712 --> 00:09:48.451
IT'S YOUR MOVE NOW...

00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:49.922
AH...

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:54.638
WHAT'S WRONG,
IT'S LIKE HE'S
FROZEN UP.

00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:57.012
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:58.550
HA!

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.888
ZANE THINKS HE'S GONNA
OUTSMART ME AGAIN.

00:09:59.888 --> 00:10:01.360
BUT NOT THIS TIME!

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.399
THIS TIME, I'M GONNA
OUT SMART HIM!

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:04.971
AND I'M GONNA START
RIGHT NOW!

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.108
ALRIGHT!

00:10:06.108 --> 00:10:08.415
HERE GOES!

00:10:08.415 --> 00:10:12.060
I PLAY ELEMENTAL
HERO WILDHEART
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.836
THEN I'M GOING TO ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD WILD HALF,

00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:16.475
AND CUZ A'
ITS EFFECT...

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:18.915
THE POINTS OF YOUR DRAGON
ARE NOW SPLIT IN HALF!

00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:25.236
AND NOW...

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:26.941
A HALF TOKEN WITH
THE SAME POINTS

00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:28.079
AS YOUR WEAKENED
END DRAGON IS SUMMONED!

00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:32.994
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:10:32.994 --> 00:10:37.007
NEXT I EQUIP THE SPELL
CARD CYCLONE BOOMERANG
ON TO WILDHEART!

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:47.206
NOW WILDHEART'S ATTACK
POINTS INCREASE BY 500!

00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:50.684
NOW GO, WILDHEART--
ATTACK THAT CYBER
END DRAGON!

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.891
WILD WALLOPING
BOOMERANG!

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.673
I DON'T THINK SO,
I PLAY DE-FUSION!

00:11:03.257 --> 00:11:05.130
AGAINST ANY OF THOSE
THREE CYBER DRAGONS.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.869
WILDHEART CAN'T WIN.

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:09.043
BUT AGAINST THAT ONE
CYBER END DRAGON...

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.016
WILD HEART
STILL HAS A CHANCE...

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:12.688
YEAH, IT MAY BE
A REALLY SMALL ONE,

00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:15.029
BUT I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE
THAN TO GO FOR IT...

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:17.001
AND JUST HOPE FOR
THE VERY BEST!

00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:18.774
OTHERWISE,
I'LL BE BESTED!

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:25.963
ATTACK, WILDHEART!

00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:39.674
HE DID IT.

00:11:39.674 --> 00:11:42.149
JADEN DESTROYED
ZANE'S CYBER END
DRAGON!

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:43.587
INDEED HE DID.

00:11:43.587 --> 00:11:46.429
JADEN MUST HAVE CALCULATED
THAT ZANE'S FACEDOWN

00:11:46.429 --> 00:11:48.101
WAS DE-FUSION--
MOST IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:49.372
I GUESS...

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:50.743
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
JADEN'S STYLE.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.689
SURE, WILDHEART'S GONE,
TOO.

00:11:54.689 --> 00:11:57.264
BUT SINCE HE WAS EQUIPPED
WITH CYCLONE BOOMERANG...

00:11:57.264 --> 00:12:00.742
ALL SPELL AND TRAP CARDS
THAT ARE OUT ON THE FIELD
ARE NOW DESTROYED!

00:12:04.922 --> 00:12:06.494
AND PLUS...

00:12:06.494 --> 00:12:08.835
FOR EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD
THAT WAS DESTROYED,

00:12:08.835 --> 00:12:13.215
YOU TAKE...
A BIG FAT 500 SMACKEROOS
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:16.291
SO NOT ONLY DID HE DESTROY
CYBER END DRAGON...

00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:18.398
BUT HE TOOK THE LEAD
IN THE DUEL, TOO?

00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:19.636
YES, IT SURE LOOKS
THAT WAY!

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:21.943
JADEN HAS REALLY DONE
HIS HOMEWORK HERE!

00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:23.581
DONE HIS HOMEWORK?

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.655
WELL THEN,
THIS WOULD CERTAINLY
BE THE FIRST TIME...

00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:27.594
THAT SLIFER SLACKER!

00:12:27.594 --> 00:12:28.999
YEAH, NOT ANYMORE!

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.270
IN THIS DUEL HERE...

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.480
I'M PLAYING
WITH MY HEAD,
NOT MY HEART!

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.553
HMM...

00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:38.864
NEXT I'LL
THROW DOWN A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:38.864 --> 00:12:40.168
OH, IS THAT IT?

00:12:40.168 --> 00:12:41.840
VERY WELL.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.278
FIRST OF ALL...

00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:45.184
THE CARD REMOVED
FROM PLAY USING CAPSULE...

00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:46.522
RETURNS TO ME.

00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:48.261
HEY, WAIT A SEC!

00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:49.967
SO THEN THE CARD
YOU HAD IN THERE
WASN'T POWER BOND?

00:12:49.967 --> 00:12:51.604
NO IT WASN'T.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.845
SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU
OVER-THOUGHT THIS ONE, JADEN.

00:12:53.845 --> 00:12:56.687
IT WAS...CARD FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:58.460
WHOA, I DIDN'T SEE
THAT COMING!

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.099
DUE TO THIS...

00:13:00.099 --> 00:13:03.677
WE NOW BOTH GET TO DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM OUR DECKS
TO OUR HANDS.

00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:04.948
OH, I SEE.

00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:06.619
TO SUMMON
HIS CYBER END DRAGON...

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.061
ZANE NEEDED TO USE
AT LEAST FOUR OF HIS CARDS.

00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:10.867
SO THEREFORE...

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:14.177
IF HE HAD USED DE-FUSION
AND THEN PLAYED POWER BOND
RIGHT AFTERWARDS...

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:17.053
THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY
CARDS LEFT IN HIS HAND TO USE!

00:13:17.053 --> 00:13:19.160
AND THAT WOULD'VE PUT
ZANE IN A TOUGH SPOT.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.431
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:21.600
THAT ZANE.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.273
BOY, HE SURE IS A CLEVER GUY!

00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:25.580
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ROOT FOR HIM
INSTEAD OF YOUR BOYFRIEND JADEN!

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.784
SHUT UP!

00:13:26.784 --> 00:13:27.787
AWKWAAARD.

00:13:27.787 --> 00:13:28.790
HEH HEH.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.261
COME ON, JAY.

00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:31.199
HANG IN THERE.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.542
ALRIGHT...

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:37.118
CYBER DRAGON WAGE
A DIRECT ATTACK...

00:13:37.118 --> 00:13:39.257
WITH STRIDENT BLAST!

00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:44.273
DON'T THINK SO!

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.715
I PLAY THE TRAP
DRAINING SHIELD!

00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:50.728
SORRY ZANE...

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:53.235
BUT NOW YOUR
CYBER DRAGON'S ATTACK
IS CANCELLED...

00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:56.546
AND I GET TO REGAIN
LIFE POINTS EQUAL TO
ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:58.218
THAT'S FINE!

00:13:58.218 --> 00:14:00.492
YOU'LL NEED THEM
BECAUSE NOW MY REMAINING
TWO CYBER DRAGONS...

00:14:00.492 --> 00:14:02.666
ARE GOING TO ATTACK,
JADEN!

00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:04.471
STRIDENT BLAST!

00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:10.925
AH...
AAH! ARGH!

00:14:12.531 --> 00:14:15.941
NEXT I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:18.717
WOW, JADEN JUST BARELY
GOT OUT OF THAT ROUND.

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:20.189
TOO CLOSE!

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:21.760
IT'LL BE EVEN CLOSER
NEXT TURN.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.269
THOSE CYBER DRAGONS
ARE STILL OUT.

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:28.014
MEANING JADEN IS IN
A STATE OF CONSTANT PERIL.

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:29.886
HE MUST NEUTRALIZE THEM.

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:31.157
YEAH, NO JOKE
BASTION,

00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:33.196
BUT THE QUESTION
OF THE DAY IS HOW?

00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:34.735
AND MORE
IMPORTANTLY, WHEN?

00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:36.140
YOU KNOW...

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.577
NORMALLY I'D SAY
NOT TO WORRY, BUT...

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:38.948
BUT WHAT?

00:14:38.948 --> 00:14:41.456
BUT WITH THE WAY JAY'S
OVER-THINKING THINGS HERE.

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:43.530
I'M REALLY NOT SO SURE.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.767
I KNOW...

00:14:50.017 --> 00:14:52.425
[THINKING]
COME ON JADEN,
USE YOUR HEAD!

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.702
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
GET RID OF THOSE CYBER DRAGONS!

00:14:55.702 --> 00:14:58.143
AND YOU'VE GOTTA DO IT
RIGHT NOW!

00:14:58.143 --> 00:15:00.350
HERE I GO!
MY DRAW!

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.263
I PLAY THE SPELL:
THE WARRIOR RETURNING
ALIVE!

00:15:04.263 --> 00:15:07.473
NOW I CAN I SELECT
ONE WARRIOR-TYPE MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.346
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND.

00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:10.650
SO...

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.820
COME ON BACK, WILDHEART!

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.191
AND NEXT...

00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:15.331
I'LL ACTIVATE...
POLYMERIZATION...

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.910
AND FUSE WILDHEART WITH
ELEMENTAL HERO BLADEDGE...

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.321
TO CREATE ELEMENTAL
HERO WILDEDGE!

00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:26.166
AND NOW HE'S GOING
TO EDGE YOU OUT...

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.708
BY ATTACKING ALL
THE MONSTERS YOU HAVE
ON YOUR FIELD...

00:15:28.708 --> 00:15:30.915
IN ONE
DEVASTATING ATTACK!

00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:34.359
SO DO YOUR THING,
WILDEDGE,

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.503
AND GO WILD ON THOSE
THREE CYBER DRAGONS!

00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:54.591
MY GOODNESS!

00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:57.500
ALL THREE CYBER DRAGONS
DESTROYED IN JUST ONE TURN?!

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.005
HOW REMARKABLE!

00:15:59.005 --> 00:16:01.346
THIS DUEL IS TRULY
LIVING UP TO ITS HYPE!

00:16:01.346 --> 00:16:02.617
WHAT A SHOT!

00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:04.355
THAT WAS THE SWEETEST!

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:07.298
THERE'S REALLY SOMETHIN'
TO ALL A' THIS
STRATEGIZING STUFF!

00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:08.803
YOU'RE A FOOL.

00:16:08.803 --> 00:16:09.806
WHAT?

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:11.210
I'M ACTIVATING...

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.117
THE TRAP CARD RETURN SOUL.

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:14.521
AH...

00:16:14.521 --> 00:16:17.297
NOW ALL MONSTERS THAT WERE
DESTROYED THIS TURN COME BACK...

00:16:17.297 --> 00:16:18.534
AND RETURN TO MY DECK.

00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:27.396
GREAT, JUST WHEN I
THOUGHT I WAS RID OF
THEM...THEY'RE BACK.

00:16:27.396 --> 00:16:29.636
AND RARIN' TO GET RID
OF ME!

00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:37.629
WHAT A SHAME.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.404
I PICKED JADEN YUKI
TO BE IN MY LAST DUEL...

00:16:40.404 --> 00:16:41.809
WONDER WHERE HE IS.

00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:43.013
SAY WHAT?

00:16:43.013 --> 00:16:44.451
YOU'RE NOT BEING YOURSELF.

00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:46.223
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING
WITH YOUR HEART.

00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:47.426
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:48.597
CUZ TO BEAT YOU!

00:16:48.597 --> 00:16:50.135
I'VE GOTTA PLAY
WITH MY HEAD!

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.907
LIKE I'M DOIN' NOW!

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:53.713
WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW,
JADEN...

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.519
IS WASTING MY TIME.

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:56.823
SURE I AM!

00:16:56.823 --> 00:16:59.030
YOU CAN QUIT WITH ALL
THE MIND GAMES, OKAY?!

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.201
THEY'RE NOT GONNA WORK!

00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:02.074
HMM...

00:17:03.913 --> 00:17:05.150
MIND GAMES?

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.889
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT
HE'S DOING.

00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:08.996
I MEAN, ZANE HAS A POINT.

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:11.571
JADEN...
IS DUELING DIFFERENTLY.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.186
IT'S MY TURN NOW...

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:19.496
AND I PLAY THE SPELL
FUTURE FUSION!

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:22.841
BUT THIS IS
NO ORDINARY FUSION.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.348
YOU SEE, I'M ALLOWED
TO FUSE CARDS...

00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:27.254
NOT IN MY HAND.

00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:32.070
THEREFORE...

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.882
I SEND THREE CYBER DRAGONS
IN MY DECK TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:39.058
AND SUMMON
THE CYBER END DRAGON!

00:17:46.984 --> 00:17:48.555
AH...

00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:51.532
OF COURSE, MONSTERS THAT ARE
CREATED BY FUTURE FUSION...

00:17:51.532 --> 00:17:54.408
AREN'T ALLOWED TO ATTACK
ON THE TURN THEY'RE SUMMONED.

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.912
BUT I CAN WAIT.

00:17:55.912 --> 00:17:57.685
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T.

00:17:57.685 --> 00:18:00.393
I'VE GOTTA THINK
OF A WAY TO GET RID
OF THAT THING FAST!

00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:02.500
COME ON, JADEN,
USE YOUR BRAIN!

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.747
ALRIGHT THEN...HA!

00:18:06.747 --> 00:18:09.590
I'M THROWIN' DOWN
THREE FACEDOWNS!

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.064
AND THAT'S IT!

00:18:12.064 --> 00:18:13.569
STILL WITH YOUR HEAD.

00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:15.074
YOU CAN'T WIN THIS WAY.

00:18:15.074 --> 00:18:16.512
DON'T THINK SO?

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.953
WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:18:18.953 --> 00:18:21.127
GO AHEAD THEN, ZANE,
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:23.267
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT
YOU'VE BECOME.

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:24.738
ENOUGH WITH THAT!

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.477
OKAY FINE THEN, JADEN.

00:18:26.477 --> 00:18:28.885
IF YOU WON'T LISTEN
TO MY WORDS.

00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:31.059
PERHAPS YOU'LL LISTEN
TO MY CARDS!

00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:36.108
FIRST I'M GOING TO PLAY
THE SPELL CARD...

00:18:36.108 --> 00:18:37.947
DE-FUSION!

00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:39.553
ACTIVATE!

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:44.134
NOW, ONE FUSION MONSTER
ON THE FIELD RETURNS
TO MY FUSION DECK.

00:18:45.873 --> 00:18:50.922
NEXT MY THREE NORMAL
CYBER DRAGONS COME BACK.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.092
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE...

00:18:52.092 --> 00:18:53.430
MY SPELL CARD!

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.202
HA!

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.443
RECOGNIZE IT, JADEN?

00:18:57.443 --> 00:18:59.282
IT'S POWER BOND!

00:18:59.282 --> 00:19:02.559
AND WITH IT,
I CAN SUMMON BACK
AN OLD FRIEND...

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.265
THE CYBER END DRAGON!

00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:21.186
WAIT, AGAIN?

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.958
BUT WHY?

00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.333
WHY AGAIN,
YOU MAY BE ASKING?

00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:27.640
QUITE SIMPLE, REALLY.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.482
IF A MONSTER IS SUMMONED
VIA POWER BOND...

00:19:30.482 --> 00:19:32.221
ITS ATTACK POINTS...

00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:34.428
ARE AUTOMATICALLY DOUBLED!

00:19:34.428 --> 00:19:36.066
AH...

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.671
JUST GREAT...
LOOKS LIKE
USIN' MY HEAD...

00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:50.260
HAS GOT ME HEADED
TOWARDS A GIANT LOSS!

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.295
ONE I MAY NEVER
BE ABLE TO LIVE DOWN!

00:19:52.295 --> 00:19:54.931
AND TO THINK,
I ADMIRED YOU, JADEN.

00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:58.168
I WON'T MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN,
NOR WILL ANYONE ELSE!

00:19:58.168 --> 00:19:59.436
OH NO...

00:19:59.436 --> 00:20:00.437
YOU'RE THROUGH!
