00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:49.973
IF THE PROFESSOR
WOULDN'T HAVE
SHOWN UP,

00:18:49.973 --> 00:18:52.409
THEY WOULD
HAVE TAKEN HIM
AWAY FOR SURE!

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:54.111
HOW'D YA FIND
US, PROFESSOR?

00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:55.679
LIKE I SAID,
I LOVE ANIMALS.

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:57.414
OF COURSE,

00:18:57.414 --> 00:19:00.284
IT WOULD BE HARD NOT TO BE
WITH A CAT WHO CAN TRACK
AS WELL AS PHARAOH.

00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:04.288
YEAH, BUT WHY WERE
YOU LOOKING FOR US
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:08.091
WELL, CHILDREN,
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT CHAZZ IS OK.

00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:09.493
THAT'S GOOD NEWS!

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:10.727
SURE IS!

00:19:10.727 --> 00:19:11.795
HEE HEE!
HA HA!

00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:14.898
OF COURSE, THERE IS
SOME BAD NEWS, AS WELL.

00:19:14.898 --> 00:19:16.533
HERE.

00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:17.935
COME WITH ME.

00:19:17.935 --> 00:19:21.939
YOU SEE, PHARAOH TRACKED
HIM HERE TO THE DOCKS.

00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:25.075
BUT WHEN I ARRIVED, HE
WAS ALREADY LEAVING ON HIS
FAMILY'S PERSONAL YACHT.

00:19:28.812 --> 00:19:31.581
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST
OF CHAZZ PRINCETON,
DUEL ACADEMY.

00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:32.649
NO WAY.

00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:41.491
WELL, THAT'S
A SHAME.

00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:44.194
YEAH, I GUESS. HE DID
MAKE THINGS INTERESTING.

00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:47.631
MY CHAZZY.

00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:50.767
WELL, I'M SURE
HE'LL BE BACK
SOMEDAY.

00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:51.768
Sy: ME, TOO.

00:19:54.838 --> 00:19:57.941
Jaden: AFTER ALL, GOOD
RIVALS ARE HARD TO FIND.

00:19:57.941 --> 00:19:59.843
Professor: YES, AND DO YOU
KNOW WHAT IS NOT?

00:19:59.843 --> 00:20:02.346
CLASS. AND SINCE YOU
CUT OUT EARLY TODAY,

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:03.613
WE HAVE SOME MAKING UP
TO DO.

00:20:03.613 --> 00:20:04.581
SO LET'S GO.

00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:05.582
AW!
OH, MAN!
OH!
