00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:48.405
BUT I WIN...

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:50.640
AND YOU GIVE BACK
THE OTHER TWO YOU TOOK!

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:51.775
A DUEL?

00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:52.942
VERY WELL.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.277
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO BE SUSTAINED

00:06:54.944 --> 00:06:55.945
BY THIS
ELECTRICAL LIMBO

00:06:56.613 --> 00:06:58.214
LONG ENOUGH
FOR A MATCH.

00:06:58.882 --> 00:06:59.549
FIRST, I'LL BEAT YOU,

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:02.218
THEN I'LL CONSUME YOU!

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:04.020
YEAH, WE'LL SEE!

00:07:04.687 --> 00:07:06.823
NOW, COME ON AND GET
YOUR GAME ON, JINZO!

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:10.393
LET'S THROW DOWN!

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.763
HA!

00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:14.864
YES.

00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:16.566
LET'S.

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:22.071
FIRST, I SUMMON
MALICE DOLL OF DEMISE

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:23.773
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:29.746
AND NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD ECTOPLASMER!

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:32.248
THIS FIENDISH SPIRIT
ALLOWS EACH PLAYER

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:36.052
TO SACRIFICE ONE MONSTER
AT THE END OF THEIR TURN.

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.922
THEN, HALF OF THAT
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:42.792
ARE DEALT TO THE OPPOSING
PLAYER AS DAMAGE!

00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:46.529
[GRUNTING]

00:07:49.032 --> 00:07:50.800

00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:51.868
OH, NO!

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:53.570
JADEN'S ALREADY
FALLEN BEHIND!

00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:55.738
[THINKING]
THAT'S A CONTINUOUS SPELL CARD.

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:58.441
HE'LL BE ABLE TO USE
ITS MAGIC EVERY TURN.

00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:00.977
BUT THEN, SO WILL I.

00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:03.480
ALL RIGHT, SPOOKY,
HERE I COME!

00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:05.315
ONLY ONE MONSTER.

00:08:05.982 --> 00:08:06.583
BUT IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.720
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL HERO
AVIAN IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.690
[GROWLS]

00:08:14.357 --> 00:08:17.293
AND NEXT, I'M THROWING
DOWN 4 FACE-DOWNS!

00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:20.763
AND PLAYING A CONTINUOUS
SPELL CARD OF MY OWN!

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:22.198
NOW, WHEN IT'S
YOUR TURN,

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:23.666
I GET TO DRAW 4 CARDS.

00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:24.868
BUT THEN DURING MY TURN,

00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:26.336
I'LL HAVE TO DISCARD 4.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:28.404
BUT BEFORE ALL THAT,

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:31.841
I'M GONNA HAVE MY
HERO AVIAN ATTACK YOU!

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:34.711
WING STORM STRIKE!

00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:40.216
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:08:40.884 --> 00:08:41.718
NOW I'M GONNA
USE YOUR OWN

00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:44.621
ECTOPLASMER'S SACRIFICE
EFFECT AGAINST YOU!

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.422
I'M GONNA GIVE UP AVIAN,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.091
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE UP

00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:51.594
HALF OF HIS ATTACK POINTS
FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:54.797
[SCREAMS]

00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:56.533
YEAH!

00:08:58.568 --> 00:08:59.102
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:00.637
I MEAN--THAT'S HOW
YOU BEAT A SPIRIT--

00:09:01.304 --> 00:09:01.738
I MEAN--OH, YOU KNOW!

00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:02.739
ALL RIGHT!

00:09:03.406 --> 00:09:04.207
WE GOTTA GAME NOW!

00:09:04.874 --> 00:09:06.276
Jinzo: A GAME
YOU'LL SOON LOSE!

00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:07.844
AFTER ALL,

00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:09.679
SINCE MALICE
DOLL OF DEMISE

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:11.014
WAS SENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD

00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:13.016
DUE TO AN EFFECT
OF A SPELL CARD,

00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:15.051
HE AUTOMATICALLY
RESURRECTS!

00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:16.219
WELL, SPEAKING
OF SPELLS,

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:17.787
MINE NOW ACTIVATES!

00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:19.923
MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE!

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.592
I GET TO DRAW 4 CARDS!

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:25.695
AND NEXT, I'LL PLAY ONE
OF MY FACE-DOWNS!

00:09:26.362 --> 00:09:28.464
OH, YEAH!
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:09:29.098 --> 00:09:31.601
AND I'LL HAVE TO DISCARD
MIRAGE TO USE IT!

00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:32.835
WHAT A MOVE!

00:09:33.503 --> 00:09:35.071
HE GOT A THOUSAND POINTS
AND DITCHED MIRAGE--

00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:37.307
NOW HE WON'T HAVE TO TOSS
ANY CARDS FROM HIS HAND!

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:40.243
I SUMMON EMISSARY
OF THE AFTERLIFE

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.278
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:44.047
OF COURSE,
ON SECOND THOUGHT...

00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:45.048
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN SMART

00:09:45.715 --> 00:09:46.816
TO PLAY A LITTLE DEFENSE.

00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:48.952
AND SINCE YOU HAVE
NO MONSTERS OUT,

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:50.887
I CAN WAGE
A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:52.555
SICKLE SLASHER!

00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:54.090
NOT SO FAST!

00:09:54.757 --> 00:09:57.093
I PLAY
A HERO EMERGES!

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.661
NOW YOU HAVE TO PICK
ONE OF THE CARDS

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:00.129
IN MY HAND AT RANDOM,

00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:02.198
AND IF IT'S A MONSTER,
I CAN SUMMON IT.

00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:03.232
[GROWLS]

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.934
FAR RIGHT.

00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:06.302
HEY, NICE PICK!

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.637
WELL, FOR ME, ANYWAY!

00:10:08.304 --> 00:10:09.405
SAY HELLO TO...

00:10:10.073 --> 00:10:12.375
ELEMENTAL
HERO SPARKMAN!

00:10:17.814 --> 00:10:18.715
FOOLISH MORTAL!

00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:21.017
BY SENDING EMISSARY
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:23.586
HIS SPECIAL EFFECT
IS ACTIVATED!

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:25.555
NOW, EACH OF US
CAN TAKE A MONSTER

00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:28.691
FROM OUR DECKS AND PLACE
THEM IN OUR HANDS.

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:30.460
AND I CHOOSE
THOUSAND-EYES IDOL!

00:10:31.127 --> 00:10:33.363
WELL, I'LL CHOOSE GOOD
OLD BURSTINATRIX!

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.198
SO BE IT.

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:37.734
NOW, TO CONTINUE
WITH MY TURN.

00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:39.302
AND MALICE DOLL'S

00:10:39.969 --> 00:10:42.038
GO, CLEAVER HEAVER!

[GRUNTS]

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:49.245
AND DON'T FORGET
THE MAGIC OF ECTOPLASMER!

00:10:49.912 --> 00:10:51.781
[GRUNTING]

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.718
HAVING THIS DUEL
WAS AN EXCELLENT IDEA!

00:10:56.386 --> 00:10:58.287
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO
ENJOY SOMETHING SLOWLY

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:00.857
RATHER THAN TO TAKE
IT ALL AT ONCE.

00:11:01.524 --> 00:11:02.759
Syrus: JADEN, YOUR LEGS!

00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:03.993
THEY'RE FADING!

[GASP]

00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:06.262
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:08.064
HA HA! I'M COLLECTING
ON OUR DEAL.

00:11:08.698 --> 00:11:09.999
YOU'VE LOST HALF
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:12.001
SO I'M TAKING HALF

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:14.570

I'LL DUEL TO THE END!

[GRUNTS]

00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:27.079
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:28.547
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:29.214 --> 00:11:29.581
BUT WAIT!

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:30.749
THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:33.418
NEXT, I'LL PLAY
CLAY WRAP FROM MY FIELD,

00:11:34.086 --> 00:11:35.988
AND EQUIP CLAYMAN WITH IT!

00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:38.590
AND I'LL JUST
KEEP ON GOING

00:11:39.258 --> 00:11:40.492
WITH POLYMERIZATION!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.095
I FUSE BURSTINATRIX
WITH CLAYMAN

00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:46.498
TO SUMMON ELEMENTAL

00:11:51.403 --> 00:11:52.538
HERE'S THE SWEET PART--

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:54.373
SINCE CLAYMAN WAS
USED IN THE FUSION,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.175
BOTH HE AND CLAY WRAP

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:57.576
ARE SENT TO
THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:58.243 --> 00:12:00.112
AND THAT ACTIVATES
A SPECIAL EFFECT--

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:02.447

LETS ME TO DESTROY
