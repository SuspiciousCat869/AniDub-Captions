00:09:48.858 --> 00:09:50.360
I NEVER LOST IT!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.096
THIS WHOLE SHADOW GAME
WAS JUST A BIG FAKE!

00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:54.197
HUH?
HUH?

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:56.032
IT WAS ALL JUST HYPNOSIS!

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:57.867
A WHOLE LOTTA
SMOKE AND MIRRORS

00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:59.803
TO MAKE ME THINK
I WAS LOSIN' MY SOUL!

00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:02.005
THIS GUY'S A COMPLETE SHAM!

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:04.440
I MEAN, HE'S PROBABLY JUST
SOME OUT OF WORK CARNIE!

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.242
I'M NOT OUT OF WORK.

00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:08.845
I COULD GET MY JOB
AT THE FAIR BACK
ANY TIME I WANT!

00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:10.747
YEAH, I'M SURE
THAT YOU COULD,

00:10:10.747 --> 00:10:13.183
AND I'M SURE
THAT PAPIER-MACHE
MILLENNIUM ITEM

00:10:13.183 --> 00:10:15.018
GOES OVER REAL WELL
WITH THE KIDDIES?

00:10:15.018 --> 00:10:18.788
NO! BE QUIET!
IT'S REAL! I'M REAL!

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:21.958
YOU'RE A SIDESHOW PHONY.

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.860
YOU FOOL! YOU FORGET!

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.028
OH!

00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:26.629
HMM.

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:28.498
THE GIRL!

00:10:28.498 --> 00:10:30.133
ALEXIS!

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:32.302
HA HA HA! THAT'S RIGHT--

00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:34.237
IMPRISONED IN A SHADOW TOMB!

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:37.841
HER SOUL IS FESTERING
IN THE DARK RECESSES
OF THE NETHERWORLD!

00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:40.176
THAT PROVES THIS MILLENNIUM
PENDANT IS REAL.

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:42.178
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO THAT?!

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:43.546
HUH?
HUH?

00:10:43.546 --> 00:10:47.083
HMM. BESIDES THAT
YOU'RE A BIG DUNCE?

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:51.921
SEE, ALL THE MILLENNIUM
ITEMS WERE SKETCHED ON
THE INSIDE OF THIS DOOR.

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:55.024
AND YOURS WOULD BE
CALLED THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE, NOT PENDENT!

00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:58.027
YOU DON'T HAVE
ALEXIS' SOUL!
YOU NEVER DID!

00:10:58.027 --> 00:11:01.130
SO HAND HER OVER
AND HAND OVER ALL THE
OTHER KIDS YOU SNATCHED!

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.365
OTHER KIDS?

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:04.033
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:06.169
AND BECAUSE OF YOUR
EARLIER CARNIE COMMENT,

00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:08.738
YOU CAN FIND YOUR FRIEND
BY YOURSELF!

00:11:08.738 --> 00:11:12.609
NO WAY! YOU'RE NOT
GETTIN' OUTTA HERE
THAT EASY. COME HERE!

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:14.978
[NO AUDIO]

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:19.983
WHOA.

00:11:21.918 --> 00:11:23.152
HOW'D YOU DO THIS TRICK?

00:11:23.152 --> 00:11:24.153
I DIDN'T!

00:11:31.642 --> 00:11:33.544
WHAT THE--

00:11:33.544 --> 00:11:35.512
OH!

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.178
Syrus: JADEN?!

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.815
OH!

00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:49.620
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
WHERE AM I?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.556
COME ON.
ENOUGH TRICKS ALREADY!

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:53.791
A TRICK?!

00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:55.860
I CAN'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS!

00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:01.966
HELP! THEY'RE ATTACKING!

00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:04.835
JADEN! SAVE ME!

00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:08.172
WHAT IN THE--

00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:19.016
NOW, THAT'S WEIRD.

00:12:19.016 --> 00:12:20.818
FIRST I HEAR YA,
NOW I SEE YA.

00:12:20.818 --> 00:12:22.653
WHAT IN THE WORLD'S
GOIN' ON HERE?

00:12:27.358 --> 00:12:30.227
HEY, WAY TO SHOW 'EM
WHO'S BOSS, KURIBOH!

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.167
TOO BAD HE DOESN'T HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

00:12:39.036 --> 00:12:40.938
JADEN YUKI.

00:12:40.938 --> 00:12:43.307
THE SHADOWS PANG FOR A SOUL.

00:12:43.307 --> 00:12:45.176
ONLY ONE SHALL SURVIVE.

00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:48.045
OH, COME ON, NOW!
RED CONTACTS?

00:12:48.045 --> 00:12:50.915
YOU REALLY WENT
OVERBOARD SETTIN' UP
FOR THIS, HUH?

00:12:50.915 --> 00:12:54.852
THIS DUEL SHALL NOW CONTINUE
IN THE SHADOW REALM.

00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:57.288
SO YOU'RE STICKIN' WITH
THE SHADOW REALM THING?

00:12:57.288 --> 00:12:59.623
FINE, AT LEAST WE GET
TO FINISH OUR MATCH!

00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:02.760
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
MONSTER REINCARNATION!

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.863
NOW, BY DISCARDING ONE
CARD FROM MY HAND,

00:13:05.863 --> 00:13:08.699
ONE OF MY GRAVEYARD
MONSTERS COMES BACK!

00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:11.135
AND I CHOOSE EVERYBODY'S
FAVORITE GOLDEN BOY,

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.703
SPARKMAN!

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:15.206
YOU REMEMBER HIM,
DON'T YA?

00:13:15.206 --> 00:13:17.541
VERY WELL, MY TURN.

00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:20.377
YEAH, BUT DON'T FORGET,
MR. TALL, DARK AND SCARY,

00:13:20.377 --> 00:13:22.580
WITHOUT YOUR PANDEMONIUM
FIELD CARD IN PLAY,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.816
HAVING AN ARCHFIEND
OUT COSTS YOU 500
LIFE POINTS PER TURN!

00:13:27.685 --> 00:13:31.622
500 LIFE POINTS IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO A SOUL!

00:13:31.622 --> 00:13:34.425
NOW, SKULL ARCHFIEND ATTACK!

00:13:34.425 --> 00:13:38.195
WHOA! YOU'RE REALLY
PULLIN' OUT ALL THE
STOPS NOW, AREN'T YA?

00:13:38.195 --> 00:13:40.764
I NOW PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:13:40.764 --> 00:13:43.133
AND SUMMON THE
DESROOK ARCHFIEND
IN ATTACK MODE

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:44.735
TO END MY TURN.

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:54.144
DON'T YOU WORRY,
KURIBOH!

00:13:54.144 --> 00:13:56.080
I'M TOTALLY STILL
IN THIS DUEL!

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.214
HERE GOES!

00:13:57.214 --> 00:13:58.682
[THINKING] ALL RIGHT!

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:00.784
THEY SAY
THE BEST DEFENSE
IS A GOOD OFFENSE.

00:14:00.784 --> 00:14:02.353
BUT WHAT'S COOL
ABOUT THIS CARD

00:14:02.353 --> 00:14:04.188
IS THAT IT CAN LET ME
HAVE BOTH!

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:07.491
SPARKMAN, I'M PUTTIN'
YOU IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:12.496
AND ARMING YOU
WITH THE SPELL CARD
SPARK BLASTER.

00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:16.000
IT HAS 3 BLASTS

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.701
AND LET'S ME CHANGE
THE BATTLE MODE

00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:20.905
OF ANY MONSTER ON THE
FIELD FOR EACH OF 'EM.

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:24.875
AND I THINK I KNOW
JUST THE MONSTER
TO USE IT ON FIRST!

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:26.343
SO BE IT.

00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:29.513
CHANGE THE BATTLE MODE OF MY
SKULL ARCHFIEND OF LIGHTNING.

00:14:29.513 --> 00:14:33.183
HIS 1,200 DEFENSE POINTS
SHOULD MAKE FOR EASY CONQUEST,

00:14:33.183 --> 00:14:35.753
UNLESS THE ROULETTE
NEGATES YOUR EFFECT AGAIN.

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:38.923
SORRY! BUT THAT'S
NOT THE MONSTER I
WAS TALKIN' ABOUT!

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:42.760
IN FACT, MY SPARKMAN'S
NOT EVEN GONNA USE
THAT BLASTER YET!

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.931
HE'S ATTACKING YOUR
DESROOK ARCHFIEND WITH
STATIC SHOCKWAVE!

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:52.036
OH, AND AS FOR
WHO I'M GONNA USE
THE SPARK BLASTER ON?

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:53.904
THE SPARKMAN HIMSELF!

00:14:53.904 --> 00:14:56.106
FROM OFFENSE TO DEFENSE!

00:14:57.708 --> 00:14:58.976
COWARD.

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:01.712
FIRST YOU HAVE YOUR SPARKMAN
ATTACK MY LIFE POINTS

00:15:01.712 --> 00:15:04.281
AND THEN YOU HAVE HIM SWITCH
TO PROTECT YOUR OWN.

00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:06.350
BUT IT MATTERS NOT.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.085
NOTHING CAN PROTECT YOU
FROM THIS!

00:15:08.085 --> 00:15:10.187
THE TRAP CARD BATTLE-SCARRED!

00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:13.157
WITH IT, THE 500 LIFE POINT
PER TURN COST

00:15:13.157 --> 00:15:15.025
OF MY SKULL ARCHFIEND
OF LIGHTNING

00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:17.861
AFFECTS NOT ONLY ME,
BUT YOU, TOO!

00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:20.297
AND FOR AS LONG AS
HE'S OUT ON THE FIELD!

00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:22.533
ARGH! THIS IS BAD.

00:15:22.533 --> 00:15:24.335
I WON'T BE ABLE TO LAST
ANOTHER TURN!

00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:28.539
DON'T WORRY,
KURIBOH BUDDY!

00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:31.208
IT'S ALL GOOD!
WE STILL GOT SPARKMAN.

00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.478
WRONG! SKULL ARCHFIEND,
DESTROY THAT PEON!

00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:37.314
BLAST STREAM OF FURY!

00:15:41.251 --> 00:15:43.854
NEXT, I PLACE A FACEDOWN CARD

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:46.590
AND ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
DOUBLE SPELL.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.527
NOW, BY SIMPLY DISCARDING
ONE OF THE SPELL CARDS
IN MY HAND,

00:15:50.527 --> 00:15:53.931
I AM ALLOWED TO USE
ONE OF THE SPELL CARDS
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.434
AND I SELECT
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS.

00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:00.804
NOW I SACRIFICE
ONE MEANINGLESS CARD

00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:05.142
AND REGAIN A TOTAL
OF 1,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:06.877
YOUR FATE IS SEALED.

00:16:06.877 --> 00:16:09.680
YOU HAVE NOT A SINGLE CARD
REMAINING IN YOUR HAND.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.250
BATTLE-SCARRED WILL TAKE YOUR
LAST LIFE POINTS NEXT TURN.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.321
THEN YOU'LL JOIN THE REST
OF THE STUDENTS I'VE TAKEN
IN THE SHADOW REALM!

00:16:25.363 --> 00:16:27.198
BETTER MAKE
THIS TURN COUNT!

00:16:27.198 --> 00:16:29.567
'CAUSE ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER IT'S
GONNA BE MY LAST!

00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:31.535
HERE I COME!

00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:36.273
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO BUBBLEMAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:43.147
NOW BUBBLEMAN'LL
JUST BURST IF
HE'S LEFT ALONE,

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:45.549
SO IF HE'S THE LAST
CARD IN MY HAND
WHEN I SUMMON HIM,

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:47.451
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
ANOTHER MONSTER!

00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:48.919
AND THERE'S MORE--

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:51.222
IF HE'S THE ONLY ONE
ON THE FIELD
WHEN HE'S SUMMONED,

00:16:51.222 --> 00:16:53.190
I GET TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:16:55.292 --> 00:16:58.396
AND WOULDN'T YA KNOW?!
I DREW HIS FAVORITE--
BUBBLE SHUFFLE!

00:16:58.396 --> 00:16:59.997
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE
OF A TWO-STEP.

00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:01.799
SEE, IT WORKS LIKE THIS:

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:04.702
I SWITCH HIM AND ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:04.702 --> 00:17:07.805
THEN I SACRIFICE
BUBBLEMAN AND
SUMMON A HERO!

00:17:07.805 --> 00:17:10.474
IF MY SKULL ARCHFIEND'S
COUNTER EFFECT

00:17:10.474 --> 00:17:12.977
DOES NOT RENDER YOUR
SPELL CARD USELESS, THAT IS.

00:17:12.977 --> 00:17:16.147
IF THIS ROULETTE LANDS
ON A 1, 3, OR 6,

00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:19.950
YOUR BUBBLE SHUFFLE
SPELL FAILS TO ACTIVATE.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.253
AW, I'VE HAD BAD LUCK
WITH THIS THING.

00:17:26.223 --> 00:17:29.460
TWO?! OH!

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.096
ALL RIGHT!
FINALLY, I WIN!

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:39.737
NOW LET'S GIVE A BIG
SHADOW REALM WELCOME TO
ELEMENTAL HERO BLADEDGE!

00:17:41.405 --> 00:17:42.573
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING--

00:17:42.573 --> 00:17:44.809
HE LOOKS PRETTY SHARP.
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:47.578
SO SHARP THAT WHEN
HE CUTS THROUGH YOUR
DEFENDING MONSTER,

00:17:47.578 --> 00:17:49.647
ALL EXTRA ATTACK POINTS
GO TO YOU!

00:17:49.647 --> 00:17:51.882
NOW, HERO BLADEDGE!

00:17:51.882 --> 00:17:54.652
SHOW HIM HOW YOU
GOT YOUR NAME!

00:17:54.652 --> 00:17:56.687
SLICE AND DICE ATTACK!

00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:06.764
[NO AUDIO]

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:11.569
NO!

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:13.437
[NO AUDIO]

00:18:17.208 --> 00:18:18.909
ARGH! GET OFF ME!

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:21.378
TELL MY KIDS I LOVE--

00:18:23.814 --> 00:18:27.384
WOW, NOW THOSE ARE SOME
SWEET SPECIAL EFFECTS!

00:18:27.384 --> 00:18:29.253
SO REALISTIC!

00:18:32.123 --> 00:18:34.892
HUH? THINK THAT'S AN EXIT?
WELL, GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!

00:18:34.892 --> 00:18:36.761
LET'S MAKE TRACKS!

00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:41.565
JADEN!
YOU OK?

00:18:41.565 --> 00:18:43.868
NEVER BETTER, GUYS!

00:18:45.002 --> 00:18:47.505
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?!

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:49.373
[GASP] DUCK!

00:18:58.649 --> 00:19:00.551
OH! AWESOME!

00:19:00.551 --> 00:19:02.553
I WONDER WHAT HE
DOES FOR AN ENCORE!

00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:04.255
TALK ABOUT A MAGIC TRICK!

00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:06.223
THERE WERE LITTLE
MONSTERS AND VORTEXES.

00:19:06.223 --> 00:19:07.458
MAGIC TRICK?

00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.693
YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAS
THE REAL SHADOW REALM?

00:19:09.693 --> 00:19:12.963
NAH! IT'S ALL MIRRORS
AND FOG MACHINES,
JUST LIKE I SAID.

00:19:12.963 --> 00:19:16.634
THOUGH I'D GIVE MY ENTIRE DECK
TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE DID IT.

00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.602
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT!

00:19:20.905 --> 00:19:22.306
HA HA HA!

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:26.243
LITTLE JADEN MUST BE BEATEN
AND PARALYZED WITH FEAR BY NOW!

00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:28.312
COME OUT, SHADOW DUELIST!

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:30.881
I WANT TO HEAR
EVERY LAST DETAIL!

00:19:30.881 --> 00:19:33.050
EVERY CHATTERING OF HIS JAW!

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.752
HMM? WHAT'S THIS?

00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:37.621
IT'S THAT SHADOW DUELIST'S
PANDEMONIUM CARD!

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:41.392
HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE THIS
BEHIND UNLESS HE LOST!

00:19:41.392 --> 00:19:42.927
WHAT KIND OF SHADOW DUELIST...

00:19:46.463 --> 00:19:48.232
WELL, WELL.
GOOD MORNING, SLEEPY HEAD!

00:19:48.232 --> 00:19:49.433
WHERE AM I?

00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:50.968
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:19:50.968 --> 00:19:53.637
HOLD ON. WHAT KIND OF
A "THANK YOU" IS THAT?

00:19:53.637 --> 00:19:55.973
WE'RE HERE CUZ WE HAD
TO FIND THE BAD GUY,

00:19:55.973 --> 00:19:58.309
WIN THE DUEL, AND RESCUE
THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS!

00:19:58.309 --> 00:20:00.311

00:20:00.311 --> 00:20:02.379

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.854
THIS IS THE FIRST
TRACE OF HIM I'VE
SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

00:20:09.854 --> 00:20:13.791
THAT'S RIGHT, I BROUGHT
IT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
WE WANNA HELP YOU FIND HIM!

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.960
AFTER ALL, WE CAN'T HAVE
YOU GETTIN' LOCKED UP

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.796
IN ANY MORE TOMBS SEARCHIN'
FOR HIM ALL BY YOURSELF!

00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:21.599
YOU REALLY WERE WORRIED
ABOUT ME WEREN'T YOU?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.803
UH. UH-OH! SUN'S UP!

00:20:25.803 --> 00:20:28.239
WE BETTER GET BACK BEFORE
THEY NOTICE WE'RE GONE!

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:29.573

00:20:29.573 --> 00:20:30.574

00:20:30.574 --> 00:20:32.243
SEE YA IN CLASS!

00:20:32.243 --> 00:20:35.145
OH, AND IF ANYONE ASKS,
WE WERE NEVER HERE!

00:20:35.145 --> 00:20:37.615
[THINKING] BUT YOU WERE.
AND YOU SAVED ME.

00:20:37.615 --> 00:20:40.618
AND NOW, I MIGHT STILL BE ABLE
TO SAVE MY BROTHER, TOO.
