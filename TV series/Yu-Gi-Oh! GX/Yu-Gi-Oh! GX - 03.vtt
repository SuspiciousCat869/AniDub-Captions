TAKE DOWN ANY MONSTER

00:14:43.298 --> 00:14:44.933
THAT HAS THE SAME
ATTACK POINTS AS HIM

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:46.601
AND NOT BE DESTROYED.

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.469
AND, THANKS TO
HIS SUPERPOWER--

00:14:48.469 --> 00:14:50.171
ONCE HE DESTROYS
YOUR BLADER,

00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:53.141
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO HER ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:57.045
NOW GO, FLAME WINGMAN,
AND ATTACK CYBER BLADER!

00:14:57.045 --> 00:14:59.380
[SNARL]

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.382
[THINKING]
SOMEONE HASN'T DONE
THEIR HOMEWORK.

00:15:01.382 --> 00:15:03.151
[ROARING]

00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:12.760
WHAT?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.896
HOW DID SHE SURVIVE
MY WINGMAN'S ATTACK?

00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:16.264
SIMPLE!
HUH?

00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:18.333
CYBER BLADER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:20.234
MAKES IT SO SHE
CAN'T BE DESTROYED

00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:22.837
BY AN OPPONENT WITH
ONLY ONE MONSTER.

00:15:22.837 --> 00:15:23.905
BUT THEN...

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.773
THEN THAT WOULD
MEAN THAT...

00:15:25.773 --> 00:15:28.242
NEITHER OF US LOSE
ANY LIFE POINTS.

00:15:28.242 --> 00:15:29.243
HMM.

00:15:30.478 --> 00:15:31.879
WELL, I GUESS
YOU GOT ME.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:33.881
OH, WHEN I GET YOU,
JADEN,

00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:36.017
BELIEVE ME,
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:37.018
HMM!

00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:39.220
LIKE RIGHT NOW,
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.957
I EQUIP MY SPELL FUSION
WEAPON TO CYBER BLADER.

00:15:47.328 --> 00:15:49.430
UH-OH.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.999
I THINK YOU
MIGHT WANT TO

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:52.834
GO, BLADER!

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:56.304
ATTACK THE FLAME WINGMAN
WITH TRIDENT SHOCK!

00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:04.979
[GRUNTS]

00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:12.117
UH-OH.

00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:13.985
YOUR LIFE POINTS ARE
LOOKING PRETTY LOW.

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:16.254
HOPE YOU DIDN'T UNPACK
YOUR BAGS HERE YET!

00:16:16.254 --> 00:16:18.056
YEAH, BECAUSE
IF YOU LOSE,

00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:20.592
YOU'RE BOTH
GETTING EXPELLED.

00:16:20.592 --> 00:16:22.160
WE ARE?!

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.062
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN, SY.

00:16:24.062 --> 00:16:26.464
PROMISE.

00:16:26.464 --> 00:16:29.000
[THINKING]
HMM.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.535
[THINKING]
I HOPE I'M NOT
MAKING A PROMISE

00:16:30.535 --> 00:16:31.536
I CAN'T DELIVER...

00:16:33.104 --> 00:16:35.573
THE ONLY CARD I HAVE
OUT IS FUSION GATE.

00:16:35.573 --> 00:16:38.042
BUT THERE'S STILL
A CHANCE I CAN WIN.

00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:40.645
IT JUST ALL DEPENDS ON
WHAT I DRAW RIGHT HERE...

00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:41.846
RIGHT NOW!

00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:45.016
AH! HERE GOES!

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:48.586
PERFECT!

00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:49.888
OH!

00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:51.022
I PLAY...

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:53.691
THE ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN!

00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.692
RISE UP!

00:16:58.563 --> 00:17:01.933
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
MONSTER REBORN!

00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:05.570
SO COME ON BACK,
ELEMENTAL HERO SPARKMAN!

00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:11.409
WHAT DIFFERENCE
WILL HE MAKE?

00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:14.779
MY CYBER BLADER
HAS WAY MORE ATTACK
POINTS THAN HIM.

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:16.915
YOUR SPARKMAN
WON'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:19.817
HE WON'T, BUT
WITH FUSION GATE'S
SPECIAL EFFECT,

00:17:19.817 --> 00:17:22.620
I CAN FUSE HIM
AND CLAYMAN TOGETHER

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.522
TO SUMMON SOMEONE
WHO WILL!

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:28.092
RISE, ELEMENTAL HERO
THUNDER GIANT!

00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:35.133
[WHIMPERING]

00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:45.043
[ROARS]

00:17:48.313 --> 00:17:49.747
HATE TO
BREAK IT TO YOU...

00:17:49.747 --> 00:17:51.950
BUT MY CYBER BLADER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.519
ARE STILL HIGHER
AT 3,600!

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:56.287
YEAH, I KNOW,
I KNOW.

00:17:56.287 --> 00:17:58.256
BUT ONE OF THUNDER
GIANT'S ABILITIES

00:17:58.256 --> 00:18:00.191
IS THAT HE CAN
DESTROY ANY MONSTER

00:18:00.191 --> 00:18:01.659
WHOSE ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:02.660
ARE LESS THAN
HIS OWN!

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.562
WAIT! ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS?!

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:05.730
THAT'S RIGHT--

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.900
ATTACK POINTS WITHOUT
ANY KIND OF ENHANCEMENT!

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.269
BUT BEFORE I PLAYED
FUSION WEAPON,

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:13.871
HER ATTACK POINTS
WERE JUST 2,100!

00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:15.039
EXACTLY!

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:17.275
AND THAT'S LOWER THAN
MY HERO THUNDER GIANT'S,

00:18:17.275 --> 00:18:20.678
SO YOUR BLADER IS
AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYED!

00:18:20.678 --> 00:18:22.981
[GROWLS]

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:28.152
[SCREAMS]

00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:30.421
AND THE COOLEST PART
OF IT IS, ALEXIS...

00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:33.057
I'M STILL HAVE
HIS ATTACK LEFT
TO USE ON YOU!

00:18:33.057 --> 00:18:34.559
VOLTIC THUNDER!

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.361
[SCREAMS]

00:18:40.598 --> 00:18:42.100
[WHIMPERS]

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.101
[GRUNTS]

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:44.335
ALEXIS!

00:18:44.335 --> 00:18:45.770
UH, WHAT JUST
HAPPENED?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.771
YEAH!

00:18:49.641 --> 00:18:50.742
ALL RIGHT!

00:18:50.742 --> 00:18:52.243
LOOKS LIKE
THAT IS GAME!

00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:55.280
Jaden: WELL,
A DEAL'S A DEAL!

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.949
I WON, SO WE
GET OFF FREE!

00:18:57.949 --> 00:19:00.151
OK, GUYS,
I WON'T BACK OUT.

00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:02.287
WE'LL KEEP QUIET ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:04.088
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,

00:19:04.088 --> 00:19:06.524
I THINK WE SHOULD TURN BOTH
OF THEM IN RIGHT NOW!

00:19:06.524 --> 00:19:07.859
WELL, NO ONE
ASKED YOU!

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:09.294
ALEXIS?

00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:11.562
JADEN BEAT ME IN THE DUEL
FAIR AND SQUARE,

00:19:11.562 --> 00:19:12.930
AND THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.198
WELL, THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT!

00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:15.199
IT WAS A CLOSE!

00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:16.200
HMM?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.201
YEAH.

00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:18.202
YOU GOT GAME.

00:19:18.202 --> 00:19:19.203
HUH?!

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:22.307
LATER!

00:19:24.175 --> 00:19:25.176
[THINKING]
HMM...

00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:26.344
EVEN IF I DID WIN...

00:19:26.344 --> 00:19:28.546
I COULD NEVER HAVE
TURNED THOSE TWO IN.

00:19:28.546 --> 00:19:30.915
THIS PLACE IS A LOT
MORE FUN WITH THEM

00:19:30.915 --> 00:19:32.317
THAN WITHOUT.

00:19:32.317 --> 00:19:34.852
[THINKING]
I'VE NEVER SEEN ALEXIS
ACT THIS WAY BEFORE.

00:19:34.852 --> 00:19:37.922
I WONDER--IS SHE ACTUALLY
FALLING FOR THAT SLIFER?

00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:42.894
[GROWL]

00:19:42.894 --> 00:19:43.928
HMM!

00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:45.029
LUCKY BRAT!

00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:46.464
HE ESCAPED THIS TIME,

00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:48.833
BUT I'LL STILL FIND
A WAY TO EXPEL HIM--

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.635
AFTER I FIND A WAY HOME.
