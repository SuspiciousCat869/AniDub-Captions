00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.764
Chumley, voice-over:
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:04.165
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:07.435
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
OUR GUEST TAG TEAM DUO,

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:10.004
THE PARADOX BROTHERS!

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.207
SALUTATIONS,
YOU FOOLS.

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:13.408
HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO DUEL.

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:15.443
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE'LL BEAT THESE GUYS, SY.

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:17.011
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.015
I SACRIFICE SUIJIN, KAZEJIN,
AND SANGA OF THE THUNDER

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.952
SO THAT I CAN NOW SUMMON
THE ULTIMATE MONSTER--

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:26.120
GATE GUARDIAN.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.957
GO, DESTROY STEAM GYROID!

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.992
TIDAL SURGE ATTACK!

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:38.666
YOU LIFE POINTS
ARE FALLING.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.834
YOUR GAME PLAY'S
APPALLING.

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:42.170
Both: THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE DONE

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.006
EXCEPT GIVE UP
AND START BAWLING.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.075
Man, on P.A.:
ATTENTION, JADEN YUKI,

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:48.409
IT IS YOUR TURN.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.914
YOU MUST MAKE A MOVE

WELL, IT'S TWO
MONSTERS TO NONE.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.916
THAT'S A SIMPLE
CALCULATION TO FIGURE.

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:11.951
THEY'LL BE KNACKERED.

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:13.686
NICE, BASTION.

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:14.787
NOW YOU'RE
DOGGING THEM
IN WORDS

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:15.788
I DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND.

00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:17.657
COME ON,
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:19.325
THAT JADEN
HAS A STRATEGY.

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:20.660
OH, I'M CERTAIN
THAT HE DOES.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.028
IT'S SYRUS
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:24.130
HE'S WALKED
INTO EVERY TRAP,
SPELL, AND ATTACK

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.131
THE PARADOX BROTHERS
HAVE PLAYED.

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.333
HE'S BEEN HORRIBLE.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:28.935
Alexis: YOU KNOW,
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:29.936
I LIKED IT BETTER
WHEN I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:32.772
OH, SORRY.

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:34.841
COME ON.

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:36.109
Chumley, voice-over:
OH, PLEASE, LET THEM WIN.

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.543
LET THEM WIN.

00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:39.012
I'LL GIVE UP
GRILLED CHEESES
FOR A WEEK.

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:40.613
I'LL JUST FRY THEM
INSTEAD.

00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:42.749
GO, TEAM.

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.550
Chazz, voice-over:
FINALLY, THOSE
SLIFER SLACKERS

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.152
ARE GETTING
THE BEAT DOWN
THEY DESERVE.

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:47.620
I CAN'T WAIT 'TIL
THEY LOSE

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.589
AND ARE KICKED OUT
OF DUEL ACADEMY--

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:50.823
ESPECIALLY JADEN.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.759
CHAZZ,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.127
Chazz, voice-over:
THAT SLIME.

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.929
THINKING HE WAS GOING TO BE
THE NEXT KING OF GAMES?

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:57.930
NO WAY.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.999
THAT'S MY DESTINY.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.335
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S
ABOUT TO BE EXPELLED.

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:04.937
HA HA HA! I'M A GENIUS.

00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:06.472
A PURE GENIUS.

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.008
FIRST I LURE THEM DEEP
INSIDE THE ABANDONED DORM.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:10.843
THEN I ARRANGE THIS
TAG DUEL AS PUNISHMENT.

00:03:10.843 --> 00:03:13.346
THEN I HIRE THE WORLD'S
BEST TAG DUELISTS

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.747
TO INSURE THEY LOSE
AND GET EXPELLED.

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:15.948
HA HA HA!

00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:17.683
SO, CROWLER.

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:20.019
ENJOYING THE BOYS' PUNISHMENT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH, ARE WE?

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.055
OH, MY, NO--
YOU MISINTERPRET.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:26.692
I'M JUST LAUGHING
BECAUSE I'M HAPPY
THE DUEL'S NEARLY DONE.

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:28.728
AFTER ALL,
OUR POOR STUDENTS
LOOK OH, SO WEARY.

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:31.964
I'M THRILLED
THEIR SUFFERING
IS NEARLY THROUGH.

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:35.034
OH, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE SUFFERING
SO MUCH TO ME.

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:38.638
IN FACT, JADEN LOOKS
LIKE HE'S JUST GETTING
HIS SECOND WIND.

00:03:41.514 --> 00:03:43.554
WELL, WELL.

00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:46.024
THE SLIFER RED FORGES AHEAD
WHEN A SMART DUELIST...

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:47.025
WOULD HAVE FLED.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:49.794
OH, MAN.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:52.930
I'M STARTING TO WISH
THE ACADEMY HAD MADE
US SLIFERS ORANGE.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.135
THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH SO MANY
OF THESE AWFUL RHYMES.

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:58.703
HUH?

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:00.305
I KNOW. I DON'T THINK
THEY GOT IT, EITHER.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:03.541
FORGET ABOUT OUR RHYMING.

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:04.709
JUST FOCUS MORE
ON YOUR CARD PLAY.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.544
FOR WITH THE PARTNER
YOU HAVE...

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:11.182
TO WIN, YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:14.052
DON'T YOU LISTEN
TO THEM, SY. OK?

00:04:14.052 --> 00:04:16.287
BUT THEY'RE RIGHT.

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:18.790
THEY'RE NOT RIGHT, SY.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.094
I KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
GOING TO BE THE ONE TO
TAKE THAT THING DOWN.

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:24.329
SO, LET'S GO.

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.064
FIRST...

00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:29.167
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN IN ATTACK MODE.

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:35.731
AND THEN NEXT...

00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:38.300
I'M GONNA EQUIP
HIM WITH THIS.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.336
SPARK BLASTER.

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:42.738
NOW WITH EACH BLAST FIRED...

00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:44.840
I CAN CHANGE THE BATTLE MODE
OF ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.675
AND I'LL START WITH...

00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:47.676
GATE GUARDIAN.

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:49.879
TAKE A KNEE.

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:53.549
YOU'RE GOIN' IN
DEFENSE MODE.

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.224
WELL, THAT WAS
CERTAINLY AN ODD CHOICE.

00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:05.060
UNLESS JADEN HAS
SOMETHING PLANNED,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.096
I'M AFRAID HE'S
WASTED HIS MOVE.

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:08.564
YOU MUST BE A FOOL.

00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:11.734
WHEN GATE GUARDIAN'S ON
DEFENSE HE NEVER TIRES.

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:14.069
YOU SITUATION'S
JUST AS DIRE.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.305
AND THOUGH I HATE
TO FEED THE FIRE,

00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:18.841
THE DEFENSE WALL
WE PLAYED YOU HAVE
YET TO RETIRE.

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.411
Jaden: GREAT. THANKS.

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.880
I'M JUST GONNA THROWDOWN A
FACEDOWN NOW AND END MY TURN.

00:05:26.978 --> 00:05:30.048
FINE THEN. MY DRAW.

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:32.150
I'LL JUST PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN...

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.852
NO MORE, NO LESS.

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:35.153
BROTHER,
YOU DO THE REST.

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:38.023
EXCELLENT DECISION.
I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:41.460
FOR I'M QUITE SURE
THAT NEXT TURN,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.196
I'LL WIN US THIS CONTEST.

00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.197
AW, MAN...

00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:47.199
JADEN?
YOU HEARD THEM,

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.434
NEXT TURN THEY'RE
GOING TO TAKE US OUT.

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:52.137
THERE'S NO POINT
TO ME EVEN DRAWING.

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:53.939
I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP,

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.274
MAYBE THEY'LL
AT LEAST LET YOU HAVE
A REMATCH THEN.

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.477
SYRUS. LISTEN TO ME.

00:05:58.477 --> 00:05:59.478
HUH?

00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:01.213
ONE DRAW.

00:06:01.213 --> 00:06:04.049
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES TO TURN
THE TIDE OF AN ENTIRE DUEL.

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:07.552
YOU REMEMBER LAST TIME
YOU HAD ONE DRAW, RIGHT?

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:08.954
YOU'LL NEVER
GET OUTTA THIS.

00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:10.455
YEAH, I GIVE.

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:11.857
LET'S HAVE A REMATCH.

00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:14.359
BUT FIRST, LET'S SEE
WHAT I WOULDA DRAWN...

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:17.195
AND IT'S--WHOA,
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:18.530
YEAH, WELL, IT
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.599
THAT YOU ALREADY GAVE UP
THE MATCH THOUGH, RIGHT?

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.534
HA HA HA!

00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:24.536
YA HEAR WHAT
I'M SAYIN', SYRUS?

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:25.971
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A LAST DRAW,

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.038
'CAUSE WITH THE RIGHT CARD...

00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:30.475
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET
ANOTHER DRAW.

00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:31.877
BUT--

00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:34.446
NO BUT'S ABOUT IT.
MAKE YOUR MOVE, PAL.

00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:35.447
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT, SY.

00:06:35.447 --> 00:06:37.382
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU.

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:39.551
[THINKING]
I KNOW, JADEN...

00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:42.487
THAT'S WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF.

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.393
AW, MAN.

00:06:49.393 --> 00:06:50.994
JADEN SAID MY ONE DRAW
COULD KEEP US FROM
LOSING THIS DUEL.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.596
BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE WON'T LOSE

00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:54.698
IS IF I BEAT THAT
GATE GUARDIAN.

00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:56.366
[GASP] HMM.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.567
OF COURSE...

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:00.671
WHOA.

00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.006
THAT CARD IS SWEET.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.675
WITH THE
RIGHT COMBO,

00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:05.676
IT CAN BEAT
ANYTHING.

00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:06.677
SO CAN I HAVE IT?

00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:09.179
OH, COME ON....

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.180
NO WAY!
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.615
NO, I DON'T.

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:12.616
REMEMBER MY CHARUBIN?

00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:13.617
IT WAS ALREADY BENT.
I NEEDED A COASTER.

00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:14.584
OR MY GREAT MAMMOTH
OF GOLDFINE?

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:16.987
PLEEEEEEEEEEASE.

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:18.322
[THINKING]
THAT'S IT.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:20.991
THAT ONE CARD IS THE
ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE.

00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:23.260
BUT IF I DON'T DRAW
IT, WE'RE DONE.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.995
JADEN AND ME...

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:26.997
ALL OUR HOPES OF
BECOMING THE BEST...

00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:29.066
EVERYTHING WE'VE
EVER DREAMED ABOUT--

00:07:29.066 --> 00:07:31.435
OUR FUN,
OUR FRIENDSHIP,
OUR FUTURE...

00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:34.338
IT'LL ALL BE OVER.

00:07:34.338 --> 00:07:37.240
ALL RIGHT.
HERE IT GOES.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.442
JADEN.

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:40.344
SY? YOU GOT IT?

00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:42.079
WELL THEN SHOW 'EM
THE DRILL.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.015
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:46.817
I SUMMON DRILLOID
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:52.489
AND GUESS WHAT.

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:54.591
WHEN DRILLOID FIGHTS A
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:56.159
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROYED.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:57.194
UGH!

00:07:57.194 --> 00:07:58.328
AW, YEAH.

00:07:58.328 --> 00:08:00.297
SO, OPEN WIDE.

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:04.301
DEFENSE WALL.

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:13.297
HEH HEH HEH.
THOSE TWO MUSTA FORGOT

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:16.300
THAT DEFENSE WALL
AUTOMATICALLY INTERCEPTS
ANY ATTACK.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.335
A NICE TRY.

00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:19.803
BUT NOT NICE ENOUGH.

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:21.972
GATE GUARDIAN STILL STANDS.

00:08:21.972 --> 00:08:23.307
DESPITE YOUR BEST STUFF.

00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:24.308
BUT THAT WASN'T
HIS BEST STUFF.

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:26.143
RIGHT, SY?

00:08:26.143 --> 00:08:27.511
WHAT?

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.848
YEP, BUT NOW THAT YOUR
DEFENSE WALL'S RUBBLE...

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:35.016
YOU'LL GET IT.

00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:37.752
WELL, A CERTAIN
MONSTER WILL, ANYWAY.

00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:38.953
OHH...

00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:43.425
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
CARD, SHIELD CRUSH.

00:08:45.894 --> 00:08:47.595
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.397
AND JUST LIKE
THE NAME SAYS,

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:51.900
IT DESTROYS ANY MONSTER
THAT'S TRYING TO HIDE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.336
JUST LIKE...

00:08:54.336 --> 00:08:56.338
THAT GATE GUARDIAN.

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:05.880
NO. GATE GUARDIAN
IS COOKED.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.383
I CAN HARDLY LOOK.

00:09:08.383 --> 00:09:10.285
NICE GOIN', SY!

00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:12.954
THE BIGGER THEY BRAWL
THE HARDER THEY FALL.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:15.957
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

00:09:15.957 --> 00:09:17.592
FRIED CHEESE, HERE I COME.

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:23.298
NO, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE PUNISHMENT.

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:25.066
AND THIS CROWD'S
TREATING THEM LIKE HEROES.

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:26.468
CHANCELLOR SHEPPARD,

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:27.902
TELL ME YOU'RE
WATCHING THIS.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:29.771
YES, WELL DONE, CROWLER.

00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:32.874
THIS MATCH YOU'VE SET UP
IS PROMOTING TEAMWORK
AND DUELING FORTITUDE.

00:09:32.874 --> 00:09:35.076
FINE JOB.

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.047
DID YOU SEE THAT?
DID YOU?

00:09:39.047 --> 00:09:41.282
TELL ME YOU SAW THAT.

00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:42.817
BASTION,
I'M NEXT TO YOU

00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:44.919
WATCHING MY FRIENDS
IN THE DUEL
OF THEIR LIVES.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.388
WHADDYA THINK
I'M LOOKING AT?

00:09:46.388 --> 00:09:47.555
AH.

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:49.457
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AMAZES ME EVEN MORE

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.626
THAN THEM TAKING DOWN
THAT GATE GUARDIAN?

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:54.462
THE TEAMWORK THAT THEY
USED TO DO IT WITH.

00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:56.498
THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING
TO TAKE TO WIN THIS.

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:59.534
YES. SO LET'S HOPE
THEY CAN KEEP IT UP.

00:09:59.534 --> 00:10:04.773
OK. NOW I'LL PLAY
ONE CARD DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:10:04.773 --> 00:10:05.940
THANKS FOR
THE PEP TALK.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.542
HEY, THANK YOU
FOR THE SWEET MOVE.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:08.843
SURE.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:10.445
MIND IF WE JOIN IN ON
ALL THE PRAISE, YOU TWO?

00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:13.381
BECAUSE FOR DESTROYING
THAT MONSTER,

00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:14.783
WE SHOULD REALLY...

00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:16.951
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.788
THEY SAY WHAT DOESN'T DESTROY
YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER.

00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:23.591
AND IT'S TRUE. AFTER ALL,
WE HAVEN'T BEEN DESTROYED,

00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:26.561
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.296
DARK ELEMENT.

00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:30.732
THIS SPELL CARD CAN ACTIVATE
WHENEVER GATE GUARDIAN

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.967
IS IN THE GRAVEYARD.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:35.103
NOW BY PAYING HALF
OUR LIFE POINTS...

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.610
WE CAN SUMMON A MONSTER
THAT CAN'T BE BEAT IN BATTLE.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.579
DARK GUARDIAN.
DARK GUARDIAN.

00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:55.824
INVINCIBLE IN BATTLE
AND HAS THOSE ATTACK POINTS?

00:10:55.824 --> 00:10:57.025
THIS IS BAD.

00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:59.494
NOW, GUARDIAN ATTACK
DRILLOID WITH

00:10:59.494 --> 00:11:01.029
AX SLASH BASH.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:06.999
THAT'S IT. IF THIS CONNECTS,
JADEN AND SYRUS WILL LOSE.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.900
JADEN...

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.901
HEH HEH.

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:13.872
FAREWELL.

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:15.040
NOT YET.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.541
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN.

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:17.542
HERO BARRIER.

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:18.777
SORRY, FELLAS.

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:21.113
BUT THIS LET'S ME STOP
ONE OF YOUR ATTACKS

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.782
SO LONG AS I HAVE
AN ELEMENTAL HERO OUT.

00:11:23.782 --> 00:11:27.753
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
SPARKMAN IS STANDIN' TALL.

00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:41.111
AN IMPRESSIVE TRAP CARD.

00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.914
I NEVER QUITE THOUGHT
THEY'D BE SO HARD.

00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:46.249
I KNOW, WE BOMBARD
AND BOMBARD.

00:11:46.249 --> 00:11:49.219
OH, WELL, AT LEAST OUR
PRECIOUS DARK GUARDIAN

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:50.353
HAS KEPT UP HIS GUARD.

00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:51.755
QUITE RIGHT, BROTHER.

00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:52.756
HE WON'T BE BLASTED
TO SHARDS...

00:11:52.756 --> 00:11:55.192
HE'LL FINISH THEM
OFF NEXT TURN.

00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.993
AND THIS DUEL
WILL BE OURS.

00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.492
[THINKING] JUST WHEN
I STEP UP MY GAME,

00:11:59.492 --> 00:12:02.695
THEY STEP UP
THEIRS EVEN MORE.

00:12:02.695 --> 00:12:04.397
HA HA HA!

00:12:04.397 --> 00:12:07.066
HERE IT COMES, THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:09.836
THE MOMENT THESE TWO
LOSE AND GET EXPELLED.

00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:11.004
CHIN UP, SY.

00:12:11.004 --> 00:12:12.472
THIS MATCH ISN'T OVER YET.

00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:13.740
BUT, JAY...

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.943
BUT NOTHIN', PAL.
STAND UP.

00:12:16.943 --> 00:12:19.827
'CAUSE YOU'LL WANT
A GOOD VIEW FOR WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO PULL.

00:12:27.298 --> 00:12:29.729
[GRUNTING]

00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:32.665
IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOY
STILL WANTS TO PROCEED.

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:35.735
REALLY, I THOUGHT
SURELY FOR MERCY
HE WOULD PLEAD.

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:38.237
NO, HE WOULD NEED SMARTS
TO KNOW TO CONCEDE.

00:12:38.237 --> 00:12:39.772
CAN IT, YOU TWO.
IT'S MY TURN.

00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:43.876
AND I ACTIVATE THE
SPELL CARD POT OF GREED.

00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:45.978
THIS LETS ME DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:12:45.978 --> 00:12:48.481
AND NEXT I'LL PLAY...

00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:50.349
FUSION GATE.

00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:53.019
WITH THIS CARD, I DON'T
NEED POLYMERIZATION.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:56.355
I CAN SUMMON ALL THE
FUSION MONSTERS I WANT.

00:12:56.355 --> 00:12:58.357
AND I'M GONNA START
BY FUSIN'

00:12:58.357 --> 00:13:00.693
ELEMENTAL HERO
AVIAN BUBBLEMAN.

00:13:00.693 --> 00:13:03.596
AND WHY DON'T WE THROW
SPARKMAN IN THE MIX AS WELL.

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:08.201
ALL TO CREATE--
WAIT FOR IT--

00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:10.870
YEAH! AND THERE HE IS.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.240
THE ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.912
FINE CREATURE, BUT IT STILL
CAN'T BEAT THEIR GUARDIAN.

00:13:19.912 --> 00:13:23.082
BASTION, JUST
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:25.218
I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, JADEN.

00:13:26.753 --> 00:13:29.589
AN IMPRESSIVE MOVE,
BUT IT'S USELESS BOY.

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:33.025
HAVE YOU FORGETTEN
ABOUT DARK GUARDIAN?

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:34.761
HE'S STILL DEPLOYED...

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:36.562
AND SINCE IN BATTLE,
HE CAN'T BE DESTROYED,

00:13:36.562 --> 00:13:38.998
THEIR BEAST
IS NULL AND VOID.

00:13:38.998 --> 00:13:41.200
VOID THIS.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.569
SKYSCRAPER...

00:13:48.347 --> 00:13:50.916
EVER HEAR THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER
PLAY IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE?

00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:53.285
WELL IT'S TRUE 'CAUSE NOW,

00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:56.588
MY ELEMENTAL HERO GETS
AN EXTRA 1000 ATTACK POINTS

00:13:56.588 --> 00:13:58.090
BECAUSE IT'S WEAKER
THAN DARK GUARDIAN.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.192
WHAT THE--
WHAT THE--

00:14:00.192 --> 00:14:02.661
NOW, HERO TEMPEST.

00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:04.963
ATTACK WITH
POWERHOUSE PLUMMET.

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.669
DIDN'T I WARN YOU?
IN BATTLE HE CAN'T BE BEAT.

00:14:10.669 --> 00:14:12.938
YOUR ELEMENTAL HERO
TEMPEST HAS BEEN WASTED,

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:13.939
SO JUST ACCEPT...

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:16.308
YOUR DEFEAT.

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:18.310
SY, CAN YA' SPARE A CARD?

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.813
SURE. I USE TEMPEST'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:26.351
SORRY, YOU GUYS.

00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:29.254
BUT SO LONG AS I BANISH ONE
OF OUR CARDS TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:30.956
TEMPEST ISN'T DESTROYED.

00:14:34.293 --> 00:14:36.762
NICE WORK WASTING YOUR
ATTACK THEN, SLACKER.

00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:37.896
I DON'T GET IT.

00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:39.665
WAS HE HOPING FOR A TIE?

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:41.833
CLEVER.

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:43.969
JUST SO LONG AS SYRUS
KNOWS WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:47.406
JADEN?

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:50.208
HEY, IT'S COOL.
TRUST ME.

00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:51.209
YEAH.

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:52.444
SY, THIS WILL ALL WORK OUT

00:14:52.444 --> 00:14:55.280
IF YOU PLAY THE RIGHT CARD
COME YOUR TURN.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.783
IF HE HAS A TURN. HA!

00:14:57.783 --> 00:15:00.452
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD,
ONE ON ONE FIGHT.

00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:02.821
THOUGH I'M SURE YOU'D
PREFER TO RUN AND HIDE,

00:15:02.821 --> 00:15:06.402
THIS CARD FORCES BOTH OUR
STRONGEST MONSTERS TO BATTLE.

00:15:06.402 --> 00:15:11.162
SO I HOPE THAT YOUR
ELEMENTAL HERO TEMPEST
IS UP FOR A REMATCH.

00:15:13.297 --> 00:15:14.561
BUT WHY?

00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:15.962
IT'LL BE A TIE AGAIN.

00:15:15.962 --> 00:15:17.397
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ATTACKING?

00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:18.732
I HAVE MY REASONS.

00:15:18.732 --> 00:15:19.899
WHA--

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:21.101
AND THEY'RE SNEAKY ONES.

00:15:21.101 --> 00:15:23.636
FOR TEMPEST TO KEEP
TYING DARK GUARDIAN,

00:15:23.636 --> 00:15:26.806
JADEN WILL HAVE TO KEEP
SACRIFICING CARDS.

00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:28.908
AND WHATEVER EDGE
THEY GIVE HIM.

00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:31.478
WELL, I HATE TO DO IT,
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE...

00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:33.613
GUESS I GOTTA GET RID
OF SKYSCRAPER.

00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:39.786
SO, YOU'VE SAVED
YOUR MONSTER...

00:15:39.786 --> 00:15:42.756
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'VE
SAVED YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:47.393
THAT'S ALL FOR ME.

00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:49.896
AND NEXT TURN I GIVE YOU
MY GUARANTEE.

00:15:49.896 --> 00:15:52.398
THIS DUEL WILL BE OURS,
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:54.667
ALL RIGHT, SY, REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID...

00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:56.236
OH, RIGHT...

00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:57.403
[THINKING] THAT THIS
WOULD ALL WORK OUT

00:15:57.403 --> 00:15:59.339
IF I PLAYED
THE RIGHT CARD...

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:00.507
[GASP]

00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:02.408
GOT IT, SY?

00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:04.410
I THINK...

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.678
[THINKING] PLAY.

00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:07.347
THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT
MY BROTHER WAS SAYING.

00:16:07.347 --> 00:16:09.949
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN KNOWING
HOW TO USE A CARD

00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:11.785
AND KNOWING HOW
TO PLAY IT.

00:16:11.785 --> 00:16:13.086
BUT DO I KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE?

00:16:29.502 --> 00:16:31.037
HEY, ZANE?

00:16:31.037 --> 00:16:32.639
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN KNOWING
HOW TO USE A CARD

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.073
AND KNOWING
HOW TO PLAY IT?

00:16:34.073 --> 00:16:35.475
AREN'T THEY THE SAME?

00:16:35.475 --> 00:16:36.910
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
CAN NEVER BE TAUGHT,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.479
ONLY LEARNED.

00:16:39.479 --> 00:16:41.648
IT TAKES A MOMENT
OF PURE CLARITY

00:16:41.648 --> 00:16:43.550
WHERE YOU SEE DUELING
ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.617
A HIGHER LEVEL.

00:16:44.617 --> 00:16:46.452
ALL THE ANGLES.
ALL THE MOVES.

00:16:46.452 --> 00:16:48.521
YOU WON'T THINK.
YOU'LL JUST ACT.

00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:54.661
ALL RIGHT.
THEN ENOUGH THINKING.

00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:56.529
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO ACT.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.763
NO MORE THINKING.
TIME FOR ACTION.

00:17:04.763 --> 00:17:06.892
HERE WE GO. MY DRAW.

00:17:08.892 --> 00:17:11.020
OK, FIRST OFF.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.824
I SACRIFICE DRILLOID
TO SUMMON U.F.O.-ROID.

00:17:16.993 --> 00:17:19.896
AND ALSO, I ACTIVATE THE
SPELL CARD POWER BOND.

00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:20.897
HMM.

00:17:20.897 --> 00:17:22.832
IT'S A FUSION CARD.

00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:24.434
AND I HAVE JUST THE
TWO MONSTERS TO FUSE.

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:27.003
JADEN, DO YOU MIND?

00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:29.005
HEY, WHAT'S MINE
IS YOURS, SY.

00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:31.674
THEN I MERGE U.F.O.-ROID
AND TEMPEST

00:17:31.674 --> 00:17:35.778
TO CREATE
U.F.O.-ROID FIGHTER.

00:17:35.778 --> 00:17:36.913
AND IT GETS BETTER.

00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:39.782
HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE THE SUM TOTAL

00:17:39.782 --> 00:17:41.751
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:44.787
IT MATTERS NOT.

00:17:44.787 --> 00:17:47.190
SO, STOP YOUR
CEASELESS PRATTLE.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.059
YOU KNOW DARK GUARDIAN
CAN'T BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:51.761
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE...

00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:53.763
BUT IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:56.899
'CAUSE POWER BOND
HAS A SPECIAL EFFECT

00:17:56.899 --> 00:17:59.602
THAT DOUBLES MY ROID
FIGHTER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:59.602 --> 00:18:01.604
TO MAKE 8,000?
TO MAKE 8,000?

00:18:01.604 --> 00:18:03.239
SURE, DARK GUARDIAN
WILL SURVIVE THE ATTACK.

00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:05.842
BUT IT'LL BE
A DIFFERENT STORY
FOR YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:18:05.842 --> 00:18:11.281
NOW. LET'S GO.
ROID FIGHTER! ATTACK!

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.316
COSMIC FLUX BLAST.

00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:28.459
WAY TO GO!

00:18:28.459 --> 00:18:29.860
WELL, WELL, THEY WON.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.695
I'M GETTING MORE
IMPRESSED EVERY DAY.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.698
I'M JUST HAPPY THAT
JADEN GETS TO STAY HERE.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.700
JADEN AND SYRUS,
YOU MEAN.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.435
WELL, YES, SYRUS,
TOO, OF COURSE.

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:41.572
I JUST SAID JADEN
BECAUSE, I, UH...

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.540
MOVING ON.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.577
HEH. I'M OUTTA HERE.

00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:48.512
WAIT. WE'RE COMING.

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:50.748
IT CAN'T BE.
HOW'D THEY WIN?

00:18:50.748 --> 00:18:51.749
NOT FAIR!

00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:53.650
HOW?

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.653
BECAUSE OF YOUR SUPERB
TEACHING, OF COURSE.

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:58.288
OH, WAIT,
THEY'RE IN MY DORM.

00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:00.958
THAT FURBALL
JUST LICKED ME.

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.127
DOES HE HAVE RABIES?
SHOW ME HIS PAPERS.

00:19:03.127 --> 00:19:04.795
CALL THE POUND!

00:19:04.795 --> 00:19:06.363
LET IT OUT, SYRUS.

00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:07.364
I KNOW YOU CRY
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY.

00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:10.634
NO WAY.
NOT THE NEW SYRUS.

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:11.969
[CRYING]

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:14.538
AW, THERE ARE SOMETHING'S
THAT'LL NEVER CHANGE.

00:19:14.538 --> 00:19:16.874
WELL, ONE THING THAT
WON'T BE CHANGING

00:19:16.874 --> 00:19:18.375
IS YOUR ENROLLMENT
AT THE ACADEMY.

00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:19.376
YOU'RE HERE TO STAY.

00:19:19.376 --> 00:19:20.811
YEAH!

00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:23.180
OH, AND YOU GUYS?

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.982
LET ME JUST SAY
IT WAS A GREAT HONOR.

00:19:24.982 --> 00:19:25.983
AND IF YA EVER
WANT A REMATCH,

00:19:25.983 --> 00:19:28.452
JUST HOLLER.

00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:30.521
WELL SAID, JADEN.

00:19:30.521 --> 00:19:33.023
AND I'M SURE IT'LL BE
EVEN BETTER WRITTEN.

00:19:33.023 --> 00:19:35.426
THAT'S RIGHT, I'D LIKE
A 5 PAGE REPORT.

00:19:35.426 --> 00:19:39.530
I WANT TO READ ABOUT
ALL WHAT YOU LEARNED
BY DUELING THE BROTHERS.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.698
AND HOW IT HELPED
YOU REALIZE THAT TRESPASSING

00:19:41.698 --> 00:19:43.767
IN THE ABANDONED DORM
WAS WRONG.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:46.770
AW! TALK ABOUT A BUMMER.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.706
HOW 'BOUT 10 PAGES, THEN?
AND SINGLE-SPACED TOO.

00:19:49.706 --> 00:19:54.445
I'LL MAKE SURE THEY
GET IT DONE, CHANCELLOR.

00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:57.047
HOW CAN I WRITE
10 PAGES?

00:19:57.047 --> 00:19:58.849
I'VE NEVER EVEN
READ THAT MUCH.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.048
[THINKING] I WANNA THINK
I IMPRESSED YOU, ZANE,

00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:06.284
THAT I DUELED AT
THAT HIGHER LEVEL,

00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:09.387
THAT I SHOWED YOU
I CAN PLAY A CARD,
NOT JUST USE IT.

00:20:09.387 --> 00:20:11.489
BUT I KNOW I STILL
HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.

00:20:11.489 --> 00:20:13.591
AND A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:16.060
10 WHOLE PAGES.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.163
THAT'S PRACTICALLY A BOOK.

00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:19.164
JADEN!

00:20:19.164 --> 00:20:22.400
MY LIFE IS SO OVER.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.237
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO SPELL PARADOX BROTHERS.

00:20:26.237 --> 00:20:28.406
AND DO ALL THEIR
PARTS HAVE TO RHYME?

00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:29.674
AW, THIS IS GONNA
TAKE FOREVER.

00:20:29.674 --> 00:20:31.743
WHO CARES.

00:20:31.743 --> 00:20:33.545
'LEAST YOU'RE
HERE TO STAY.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:36.247
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:44.088 --> 00:20:45.089
HA HA HA!

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:47.091
THAT'S GAME.
