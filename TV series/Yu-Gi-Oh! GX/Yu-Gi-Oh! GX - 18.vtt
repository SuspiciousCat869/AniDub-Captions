IT'S TRUE THAT
DARK MAGICIAN

00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:04.842
IS THE STRONGEST MONSTER
CARD IN MY DECK...

00:19:04.842 --> 00:19:06.511
BUT AS A DUELIST,
YOU MUST KNOW

00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:08.579
THAT IT'S RARELY
JUST ABOUT THE CARD...

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:11.415
IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT.

00:19:11.415 --> 00:19:13.651
AND WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO IS PLAY THIS:

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.354
DEDICATION THROUGH
LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

00:19:16.354 --> 00:19:18.723
IT TAKES DARK MAGICIAN
AND TURNS HIM INTO

00:19:18.723 --> 00:19:20.725
SOMETHING EVEN
MORE POWERFUL!

00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:22.393
THE LEGENDARY...

00:19:22.393 --> 00:19:24.462
DARK MAGICIAN
OF CHAOS!

00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:25.830
Syrus: OF CHAOS?!

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.265
Chumley: BOY,
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:28.833
YES, WELL,
IT'S NOT.

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:31.335
IT'S ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST
CREATURES YOU'LL EVER SEE.

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:32.436
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:32.436 --> 00:19:35.306
AND I'M ABOUT TO UNLEASH
HIM ON YOU, JADEN!

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:38.176
CHAOS MAGICIAN, RISE!

00:19:40.978 --> 00:19:43.781
NOW, JUST BY SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONING HIM...

00:19:43.781 --> 00:19:45.750
I'M ALLOWED TO
BRING ONE MAGIC CARD

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.885
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
TO MY HAND.

00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:50.288
OH, AND IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T DONE THE MATH YET,

00:19:50.288 --> 00:19:52.890
BLADEDGE DOESN'T
HAVE THE MOST ATTACK
POINTS ANYMORE.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.891
CHAOS MAGICIAN DOES!

00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:56.060
[GASPS]

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.295
2,800?!

00:19:57.295 --> 00:19:58.596
YES!

00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:00.932
NOW, WATCH THEM
ALL IN ACTION!

00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:03.034
SCEPTER STRIKE!

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.072
[GRUNTING]

00:20:08.072 --> 00:20:09.507
JUST FACE IT...

00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:11.375
THIS DECK AND I
FIT PERFECTLY.

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:13.811
ALWAYS HAVE,
ALWAYS WILL.

00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:16.013
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT!

00:20:16.013 --> 00:20:17.815
[THINKING]
OF COURSE,
TO BE HONEST,

00:20:17.815 --> 00:20:19.317
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN...

00:20:19.317 --> 00:20:21.219
AGAINST THE KING
OF GAMES...

00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:23.888
GETTING YOUR GAME ON
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH!
