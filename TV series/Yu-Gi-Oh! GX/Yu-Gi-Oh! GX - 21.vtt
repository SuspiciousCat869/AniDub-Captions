00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.345
WHAT'S IT TO YOU,
PONY TAIL?

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:32.281
YA KNOW, I'M JUST
CURIOUS IS ALL.

00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:34.283
YEAH, WELL, YOU
CAN STAY CURIOUS.

00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:38.387
LISTEN, THOSE MISSING
STUDENTS AREN'T FOR
YOUR AMUSEMENT.

00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.389
YOU OUGHT TO JUST MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:41.691
GOT IT?

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:47.063
OK, DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER PROBLEM IS,

00:08:47.063 --> 00:08:50.166
BUT I KNOW THIS:
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:51.701
I'M GONNA GET
THIS STORY!

00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:04.413
COUNTLESS EQUATIONS,
A MYRIAD OF THEOREMS,

00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:09.318
YET STILL I HAVEN'T
QUITE SOLVED THE PROBLEM
THAT IS JADEN'S DECK.

00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:12.255
AH, THE FLAME WINGMAN.
WHAT A SPECIMEN.

00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:13.923
WHENEVER HE DESTROYS
A MONSTER,

00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:15.458
THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE DEALT

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:17.460
TO ITS OWNER'S LIFE POINTS.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.363
IN ORDER TO STOP HIM,
I MUST STOP BURSTINATRIX

00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:22.298
AND AVIAN SO THEY CAN'T FUSE.

00:09:22.298 --> 00:09:25.902
OF COURSE, EVEN IF I DO,
THERE'S STILL THE THUNDER GIANT.

00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:28.771
HE CAN DESTROY A MONSTER WITH UP
TO 2,400 ATTACK POINTS

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.406
AS SOON AS HE'S SUMMONED.

00:09:30.406 --> 00:09:33.476
TO STOP HIM, I'LL NEED
TO TAKE OUT SPARKMAN AND CLAYMAN

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:34.977
BEFORE THEY CAN FUSE.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.850
THINK, BASTION. THINK.

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:47.924
I COULD ASSEMBLE MY DECK
TO COUNTER EACH OF THOSE
MONSTERS,

00:09:47.924 --> 00:09:50.459
BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE
FAR TOO MUCH TO CHANCE.

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:54.397
THERE SIMPLY MUST BE A BETTER
WAY TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT,

00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:58.000
SOME STRATEGY TO STOP
THOSE FUSION MONSTERS.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.239
WAIT A MOMENT. THAT'S IT!
IT'S SO OBVIOUS!

00:10:04.974 --> 00:10:10.644
JADEN YUKI, THE CODE
OF YOUR CARDS HAS
JUST BEEN CRACKED.

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:12.479
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:21.206
ALL RIGHT, GUYS!
GET YOUR EAT ON!

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.975
THIS STUFF'S SO GOOD!

00:10:23.975 --> 00:10:27.012
THE HARD PART IS
REMEMBERIN' TO CHEW...

00:10:27.012 --> 00:10:28.480
[MUFFLED]
BEFORE YA SWALLOW!

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.083
THAT EXPLAINS WHY WE'RE
MISSING SO MANY FORKS.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:33.452
LOOK, JUST DON'T
STUFF YOURSELF.

00:10:33.452 --> 00:10:35.420
WHAT'S YOUR PROB, SYRUS?

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.622
YOU'RE
BEING VERY
ANTI-LICIOUS.

00:10:37.622 --> 00:10:41.326
MAYBE SO, BUT
IF JADEN'S GOING TO
WIN TODAY'S MATCH,

00:10:41.326 --> 00:10:45.397
HE'S GOING TO NEED
TO BE A LEAN, MEAN,
DUELING MACHINE!

00:10:45.397 --> 00:10:50.460
AFTER ALL, BASTION'S
BEEN TRAINING WEEKS
FOR THIS MATCH-UP!

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.295
YOU TRAINED, WHAT,
AN HOUR?

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:54.330
MORE LIKE HALF.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.565
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:58.668
MINUS THE TIME
WE TOOK FOR
THAT FOOD RUN.

00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:02.872
LOOK, SY, BASTION
HAS HIS WAY TO TRAIN,
AND I HAVE MINE!

00:11:02.872 --> 00:11:04.607
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:11:04.607 --> 00:11:06.843
BY THE WAY...

00:11:06.843 --> 00:11:08.077
WHERE'D THAT GUY
GERARD GO?

00:11:08.077 --> 00:11:09.812
I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM.

00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:11.314
DON'T KNOW, BUT HIS
LUNCH IS MINE!

00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:19.155
IT'S TIME, DUELISTS,
TO FIND OUT...

00:11:19.155 --> 00:11:22.091
WHO WILL REPRESENT
OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ACADEMY

00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:24.260
IN THE ANNUAL SCHOOL DUEL!

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.762
[CHEERING]

00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:30.700
INTRODUCING FIRST
FROM THE RA DORM,
BASTION MISAWA!

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.668
[CHEERING]

00:11:32.668 --> 00:11:36.506
AND THEN FROM SLIFER,
SOME KID.

00:11:36.506 --> 00:11:39.509
[SILENCE]

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:41.644
HERE WE GO!
GOOD LUCK, PAL!

00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:43.513
I APPRECIATE
THE SENTIMENT,

00:11:43.513 --> 00:11:46.549
BUT WITH THE DECK
I'VE PREPARED,
I DON'T NEED LUCK.

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:48.484
YEAH, WE'LL
SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:50.953
GO, JADEN!

00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:52.822
THIS IS WHAT YOU
TRAINED FOR...

00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:54.157
OR DIDN'T.

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:57.059
IT'LL BE INSTINCTS
VERSUS INTELLIGENCE HERE.

00:11:57.059 --> 00:11:58.961
I GUESS. WHO CARES?

00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:00.196
HUH? ALEXIS?

00:12:00.196 --> 00:12:02.732
OH. I MEAN, YEAH!

00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:09.505
ALL RIGHT, WHILE EVERYONE'S
DISTRACTED WITH THIS DUEL,

00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:11.841
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET
MORE DIRT ON THOSE
MISSING KIDS...

00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:13.910
OR THIRDS!

00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:17.680
AND GET THAT
OTHER KID, JADEN,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.149
AND THIS DUEL
OF HIS OUT OF MY HEAD!

00:12:39.402 --> 00:12:40.970
[LOW TONE]

00:12:42.438 --> 00:12:43.840
[LOW TONE]

00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:46.242
[LOW TONE]

00:12:46.242 --> 00:12:49.212
NOW, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO...

00:12:49.212 --> 00:12:50.746
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:52.114
Together: LET'S DUEL!

00:12:54.317 --> 00:12:55.852
ALL RIGHT!

00:12:55.852 --> 00:13:01.624
FIRST MOVE,
I SUMMON CARBONEDDON
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:05.895
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:09.265
A BRAND-NEW DECK,
AND CARBONEDDON IS
ALL YOU CAN BUST OUT?

00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:11.767
HEY, WHATEVER
WORKS FOR YA!

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:15.738
NOW I PLAY
BURSTINATRIX
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.874
HYAH!

00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:21.344
Thinking: JUST ONE TURN
AND ALREADY JADEN HAS

00:13:21.344 --> 00:13:23.446
HALF THE EQUATION
TO CREATE HIS
FAVORITE MONSTER,

00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:25.414
THE FLAME WINGMAN.

00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:27.049
OFF TO A GOOD START,
THERE.

00:13:27.049 --> 00:13:29.986
YEAH, SURE AM!
AND I GOT NEWS FOR YA,

00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:31.554
IT ONLY GETS BETTER!

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.156
BURSTINATRIX, ATTACK!

00:13:39.495 --> 00:13:42.932
NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACE-DOWN
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:13:42.932 --> 00:13:45.935
YOU DON'T
WASTE ANY TIME.
I LIKE THAT.

00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:48.871
Thinking: HERE IT IS,
THE ONE CARD THAT WILL
WIN ME THIS DUEL,

00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.373
BUT FIRST...

00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:53.309
Bastion: I'M GOING
TO SUMMON OXYGEDDON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:56.946
[SCREAMS]

00:13:56.946 --> 00:14:00.049
AND NOW, OXYGEDDON,
ATTACK!

00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:01.317
[LAUGHS]

00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:05.087
THINK AGAIN!
I GOT A TRAP.

00:14:05.087 --> 00:14:07.189
HERO BARRIER!
WITH THIS CARD,

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:09.926
IF I HAVE
AN ELEMENTAL HERO
ON THE FIELD,

00:14:09.926 --> 00:14:12.562
I CAN NEGATE
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK ONCE!

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:19.936
SORRY, BASTION, BUT
BURSTINATRIX ISN'T
BUSTED JUST YET!

00:14:19.936 --> 00:14:23.472
WELL-PLAYED, JADEN.
OF COURSE, I'D
EXPECT NO LESS.

00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:25.174
Thinking: STILL, WHEN
I ACTIVATE THIS CARD,

00:14:25.174 --> 00:14:27.276
IT WON'T MATTER
HOW WELL YOU PLAY.

00:14:27.276 --> 00:14:29.345
I'LL GO AHEAD AND PLACE
THIS FACE-DOWN.

00:14:29.345 --> 00:14:30.846
AND THAT'S ALL.

00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:36.352
ALL RIGHT, THEN. I SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO SPARKMAN

00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:37.920
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:40.122 --> 00:14:44.493
AND I ACTIVATE
THE EQUIP SPELL
SPARK BLASTER

00:14:44.493 --> 00:14:47.363
AND EQUIP IT
ON SPARKMAN!

00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:50.132
NOW I CAN CHANGE
THE BATTLE MODE
OF ANY MONSTER

00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:53.336
ON THE FIELD
AND THE ONE I HAVE SET
IN SPARKMAN'S SIGHTS

00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:55.071
IS OXYGEDDON!

00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.874
NOW HE HAS TO SWITCH
INTO DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:02.111
AND NOW

00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:05.748
BURSTINATRIX
CAN TAKE HIM OUT.

00:15:05.748 --> 00:15:07.683
GO, MAGMA COMET!

00:15:07.683 --> 00:15:09.919
[YELLS]

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:14.790
WHOOPS! LOOKS
LIKE SOMEONE HAS FORGOTTEN
THEIR CHEMISTRY, NO?

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.728
SEE, FIRE AND OXYGEN,
THEY DON'T MIX, JADEN.

00:15:18.728 --> 00:15:21.263
SO WHEN OXYGEDDON
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE

00:15:21.263 --> 00:15:23.199
BY A PYRO-TYPE MONSTER,

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:27.136
IT DOESN'T JUST TAKE
A TOLL ON MY LIFE POINTS,
BUT ON YOURS, AS WELL!

00:15:39.037 --> 00:15:42.341
Jaden: SWEET MOVE.
YOUR MONSTER'S ABILITY
COST US BOTH THERE!

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.344
BUT I'D DO IT ALL
OVER AGAIN, KNOW WHY?

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.213
'CAUSE NOW YOUR FIELD
IS EMPTY, WHICH MEANS

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:51.350
MY SPARKMAN CAN
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.922
ZANE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THAT BOY, HE'S
QUITE A DUELIST!

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.957
IT'S TRUE. WE TEACH
THOSE SLIFERS WELL

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.592
WHEN THEY DON'T
DITCH CLASS.

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:04.329
Thinking: WHY DID I OPEN
MY BIG MOUTH

00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:06.632
AND NOMINATE BASTION
FOR THIS MATCH?!

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.101
HE'S GETTING CREAMED;
I'M GETTING HUMILIATED;

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:14.006
AND WORST OF ALL, JADEN IS
LOOKING BETTER THAN EVER!

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.474
HEY, SORRY THERE,
BASTION.

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.142
GUESS IT'S BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.677
IF YOU WANNA
BEAT MY DECK!

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:21.213
NO, JADEN,
I THINK NOT.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.981
YOU SEE, I'VE
ALREADY BEATEN IT.

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:26.418
NOW, IT'S SIMPLY
A MATTER OF SHOWING
ALL OF MY WORK.

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:28.187
Thinking:
AND A MATTER
OF GETTING JADEN

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:32.057
TO USE THE CARD
THAT WILL LET ME ENACT
MY MASTER PLAN.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:36.361
Bastion: NOW THEN,
LET'S GET BACK INTO
THE FRAY, SHALL WE?

00:16:36.361 --> 00:16:39.031
IT'S MY TURN.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:43.802
AND I'M GOING
TO SUMMON HYDROGEDDON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.304
NOW, HYDROGEDDON,
ATTACK BURSTINATRIX!

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:48.807
[GROWLS]

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.876
AAH!

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:57.316
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
HYDROGEDDON'S ABILITY!

00:16:57.316 --> 00:17:00.219
YOU SEE, WHENEVER
HE DESTROYS A MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:03.222
IT ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
ANOTHER HYDROGEDDON.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.023
AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE
RIGHT HERE IN MY DECK!

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:12.397
AND NOW I'LL PLAY
AN EQUIP SPELL
FROM MY HAND--

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.166
LIVING FOSSIL!

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.535
I CAN NOW SUMMON
ONE MONSTER FROM
MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.203
SO LONG AS I EQUIP
IT WITH THIS.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:20.439
AND THE MONSTER I'LL
BRING BACK IS...

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:24.443
OXYGEDDON!

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.944
RISE AGAIN,
OLD FRIEND!

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.046
[OXYGEDDON YELLS]

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.414
OF COURSE,

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:31.183
FOSSIL LOWERS
HIS ATTACK POINTS

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.318
AND CANCELS
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.721
YEAH, NOW HE'S GOT
THREE MONSTERS!

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.189
AND A STRANGE SMIRK.

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:40.726
NOW IT GETS GOOD.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:44.863
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
CARD---BONDING H2O!

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.700
SEE, JADEN, WHEN I
BOND TWO HYDROGEDDONS
AND ONE OXYGEDDON,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.702
THEY DO THE EXACT
SAME THING

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:53.872
THAT TWO HYDROGEN
BONDED WITH
ONE OXYGEN DO.

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.407
THEY BECOME WATER,

00:17:55.407 --> 00:18:00.913
OR IN THIS CASE
THE ALL-POWERFUL
WATER DRAGON!

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:05.751
[GROWLING]

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.389
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.790
INCREDIBLE.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.125
WHERE'S
THE BATHROOM?

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.094
THAT'S ONE
IMPRESSIVE MONSTER.

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.397
YES, AND ONE
IMPRESSIVE MOVE.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:22.301
MY, THIS WILL BE TOUGH.

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:26.138
I KNEW IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
FOR ME TO NOMINATE BASTION

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.639
FOR THIS MATCH!

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:29.107
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:32.644
HE'S LOOKING MAGNIFICENT;
I'M LOOKING BRILLIANT;

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:36.748
AND BEST OF ALL, JADEN LOOKS
LIKE A COMPLETE FOOL!

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.984
IT'S YOUR MOVE
NOW, JADEN.

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.086
Thinking: AND IF YOU PLAN
TO TAKE ON MY WATER DRAGON,

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:42.888
THERE'S ONLY ONE MOVE
YOU CAN MAKE.

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.990
AND IT'S THE ONE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.326
HOW'S JADEN GOING
TO TAKE DOWN
THAT THING?

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:50.896
HIS SPARKMAN DOESN'T
HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.865
WELL, BASTION,
IT'S LIKE THEY
ALWAYS SAY,

00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:57.803
WHEN THE GOIN' GETS
TOUGH, THE TOUGH
GET GOIN'!

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.205
SO HERE I GO! HA!

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.239
SWEET!

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:02.841
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.843
ONE OF YOUR BEST
MONSTERS OUT,

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:08.246
SO ALLOW ME
TO SUMMON ON UP
ONE OF MINE!

00:19:08.246 --> 00:19:10.616
NOW I MAY NOT KNOW
AS MUCH CHEMISTRY

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:14.553
AS YOU DO, BUT I
CAN STILL MIX IT UP.

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:17.089
AVIAN AND BUBBLEMAN,
GET READY TO MERGE

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:19.257
WITH SPARKMAN
TO CREATE

00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:22.594
THE ONE
AND ONLY ELEMENTAL
HERO--TEMPEST!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.932
ALL RIGHTIE. FUSE!

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.402
I DON'T THINK
SO, JADEN.

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:31.403
HUH?

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:32.671
GO! TRAP CARD,

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:37.409
CURSED SEAL OF
THE FORBIDDEN SPELL!

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:40.412
NOW, BY DISCARDING ONE
SPELL CARD FROM MY HAND,

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.581
I CAN NEGATE
YOUR SPELL CARD
AND DESTROY IT!

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.186
AND YOU CAN NO LONGER USE

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.188
THE CARD THAT WAS
DESTROYED BY THIS EFFECT

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:52.090
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE DUEL.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.993
WAIT. I CAN'T USE
POLYMERIZATION ANYMORE?

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:56.461
I'M AFRAID NOT,

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.296
WHICH ESSENTIALLY
MEANS YOU CAN'T USE

00:19:58.296 --> 00:20:01.066
ANY OF YOUR FUSION
MONSTERS ANYMORE, EITHER.

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:04.970
NO FLAME WINGMAN,
NO THUNDER GIANT,
NONE OF THEM.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.974
NO FUSIONS?!
BUT THAT'S HOW JADEN
WINS ALL HIS DUELS!

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:11.576
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.311
COMPUTE IT ANY
WHICH WAY YOU LIKE,

00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:15.647
BUT THE ANSWER WILL
ALWAYS COME OUT THE SAME.

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.716
THIS DUEL'S OVER.
YOU CAN'T WIN.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.518
