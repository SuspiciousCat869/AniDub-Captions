I DIDN'T STEAL THE DECK.

IT LETS ME BRING BACK
A PAST WARRIOR MONSTER,
LIKE SPARKMAN!

AND DON'T FORGET
SKYSCRAPER'S STILL OUT,

00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:32.699
WHICH MEANS FLAME WINGMAN
GETS AN EXTRA THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS IN BATTLE!

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.569
BUT WAIT.
3,100 ATTACK POINTS,
THAT'S--

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:38.104

EITHER ONE.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:41.308
BUT SINCE
I HAVE A SOFT SPOT
FOR THE GIRL,

00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:42.576
WE'LL START
WITH HIM.

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:45.011
UHH!

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:46.112
OH, YEAH!

00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:48.515
AND I ALSO HAVE
WINGMAN'S SUPER POWER!

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:51.117
IT CAUSES YOU
TO TAKE DAMAGE
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.753
EQUAL TO
THE ATTACK POINTS OF
YOUR DESTROYED MONSTER!

00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:58.592
TAKE THAT, YUGI,

00:07:58.592 --> 00:08:00.093
WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS!

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:02.429
WAY TO PLAY, JAY!
NICE WORK!

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:05.332
CRAZY! I'M BEATIN'
YUGI'S DECK!

00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:06.900
[THINKING]
SIMPLY REMARKABLE.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.603
DIMITRI IS DUELING JUST
AS THE KING OF GAMES WOULD,

00:08:09.603 --> 00:08:11.171
YET JADEN
IS STAYING COMPETITIVE.

00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:12.572
WINNING, EVEN!

00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:15.375
SURE, HE WAS A BIT OVERWHELMED
AT FIRST BY YUGI'S DECK,

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.711
BUT NOW HE'S REALLY
TURNED THINGS AROUND.

00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:19.412
WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE ONE DAY HIS DECK

00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:21.581
WILL BE GOING ON TOUR
RIGHT BESIDE YUGI'S,

00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.450
ASSUMING HE CAN
WIN IT BACK, THAT IS.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.251
SPARKMAN, ATTACK!

00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.886
SPARK STORM!

00:08:31.057 --> 00:08:33.326
NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN
TWO FACEDOWNS

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:36.696
AND USE THE SPELL CARD
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:08:36.696 --> 00:08:39.366
NOW BY SACRIFICIN'
ONE A' THOSE FACEDOWNS,

00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:41.801
I GET BACK
A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:46.506
SWEET, DONTCHA THINK?

00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:48.041
[THINKING]
HA HA, BUT NOT AS SWEET

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.776
AS WHAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN.

00:08:49.776 --> 00:08:51.244
I MEAN, ONE MORE ATTACK,

00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:53.813
AND I'LL HAVE BEATEN
THE KING OF GAME'S DECK!

00:08:55.248 --> 00:08:58.251
JADEN! HE'S ALL YOURS.
YOU'VE GOT IT!

00:08:58.251 --> 00:09:03.023
YOU HAVE NOTHING!
MY DECK IS PREPARED
FOR ALL CONTINGENCIES!

00:09:03.023 --> 00:09:06.960
FIRST, I'LL SWITCH
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.896
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
SPIDER WEB!

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:13.366
OH!

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:15.502
IT ALLOWS ME
TO TAKE ONE OF THE CARDS

00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:17.537
YOU SENT TO YOUR
GRAVEYARD LAST TURN,

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:20.006
AND PLACE IT DIRECTLY
INTO MY HAND!

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:25.345
AND SOON IT WILL GO DIRECTLY
INTO MY LIFE POINTS...

00:09:25.345 --> 00:09:27.714
BECAUSE I CHOSE
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS!

00:09:27.714 --> 00:09:30.250
NEXT, I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.920
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD
MONSTER REINCARNATION!

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.790
AND NEXT, I'LL MAKE
3 SACRIFICES,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.826
WHICH LETS ME PLAY
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS.

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:42.095
FINALLY,
THANKS TO REINCARNATION,

00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:45.198
I'LL TAKE BACK
THE KURIBOH I JUST LOST!

00:09:45.198 --> 00:09:47.400
SO, DID YOU FOLLOW
ALL OF THAT?!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.102
NOT A WORD OF IT!

00:09:49.102 --> 00:09:51.705
WELL, I DID.
SWEET MOVES.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:54.708
BUT THEY WON'T SAVE YOU
FROM THE FLAME WINGMAN!

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.643
SKYDIVE SCORCHER!

00:09:56.643 --> 00:09:58.378
UHH!

00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:01.047
AND DON'T FORGET
HIS SUPER POWER!

00:10:01.047 --> 00:10:02.449
YOU GET HIT FOR DAMAGE

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:05.652
EQUAL TO THE
ATTACK POINTS OF
THE DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:10.190
AAH!

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.526
[GROANING]

00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:16.329
GOOD THING I PADDED
MY POINTS LAST TURN.

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.432
YEAH? WELL, GOOD THING
I HAVE A COUPLE
A' ATTACKS LEFT!

00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:22.102
I USE THE SPELL CARD
DE-FUSION!

00:10:22.102 --> 00:10:25.338
NOW, FLAME WINGMAN, DEFUSE!

00:10:25.338 --> 00:10:29.242
MY! JADEN'S IMPRESSING
MORE AND MORE EVERY TURN!

00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:31.010
WHAT SKILLFUL PLAY!

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.214
NOW HE'LL BE ABLE TO ATTACK
WITH EACH MONSTER SEPARATELY!

00:10:34.214 --> 00:10:36.049
AVIAN, ATTACK!

00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:37.450
TALON TEAR!

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:41.688
AND NOW
BURSTINATRIX!

00:10:41.688 --> 00:10:43.389
FLARE STORM!

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.794
NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU DUEL!

00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:49.529
LISHUS!
ONE MORE ATTACK,

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:51.564
AND HE'LL NAIL
DIMITRI'S
LIFE POINTS!

00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:53.666
YES, AND WITH SPARKMAN
ON THE FIELD,

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:55.802
HIS NEXT ATTACK
WILL BE RIGHT NOW!

00:10:55.802 --> 00:10:58.905
ALL RIGHT! YUGI'S DECK'S
ABOUT TO BE SAVED!

00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:00.340
AND JADEN'S
ABOUT TO BE ONE

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.142
OF THE FEW GUYS
WHO BEAT IT!

00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:03.510
GO, SPARKMAN!

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.911
ATTACK!

00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:08.715
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.971
NOW, SPARKMAN!
SPARK STORM!

00:11:18.193 --> 00:11:22.553
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
FORGETTING ABOUT
SOMEONE--KURIBOH!

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:27.480
WHAT THE--?!

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.582
BY DISCARDING KURIBOH
FROM MY HAND,

00:11:29.582 --> 00:11:33.386
I DON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE
FROM SPARKMAN'S LITTLE
FIREWORK DISPLAY!

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:35.454
GOOD THING
MONSTER REINCARNATION

00:11:35.454 --> 00:11:38.524
LET ME BRING HIM BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD
LAST TURN.

00:11:38.524 --> 00:11:40.860
OH, YEAH. MY BAD.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.530
THANK YOU, KURIBOH.
THAT MOVE TAKES ME BACK
TO OUR DUEL

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.166
AGAINST SETO KAIBA
AT BATTLE CITY.

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:50.102
THOSE WERE SOME GOOD TIMES,
WEREN'T THEY, OLD FRIEND?

00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:51.537
[SQUEAK]

00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:53.039
BATTLE CITY?!

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.274
THIS GUY'S GONE BATTY!

00:11:55.274 --> 00:11:56.976
SY, JUST SMILE
AND NOD,

00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:58.277
SMILE AND NOD.

00:11:58.277 --> 00:12:00.946
NOW THEN.
LET'S CONTINUE THIS--

00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:02.515
FOR KURIBOH!

00:12:02.515 --> 00:12:04.850
HIS FALL
WON'T BE IN VAIN!

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.951
PERFECT!

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.354
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
HAS SERVED ME AGAIN!

00:12:11.017 --> 00:12:15.655
I REMOVE ONE DARK MONSTER
AND ONE LIGHT MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:15.655 --> 00:12:17.357
PAUSE'N REWIND!

00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:19.426
YOU'RE REMOVING THEM,
WHY, DIMITRI?

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:22.396
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS.
IS IT A SUMMONING?!

00:12:22.396 --> 00:12:24.064
NAH,
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:26.833
AH! YOU'RE WRONG.
THERE IS A WAY!

00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:29.569
THERE ARE TWO MONSTERS
THAT CAN BE SUMMONED
LIKE THIS.

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:31.638
TWO RARE CARDS
OF SUCH POWER.

00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:33.440
DUELISTS HAVE SCOURED
THE WORLD OVER

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.242
TO ADD THEM
TO THEIR COLLECTION.

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:38.645
THE FIRST IS CHAOS
EMPEROR DRAGON--
ENVOY OF THE END.

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:40.647
A CARD SO VERY POWERFUL,

00:12:40.647 --> 00:12:43.750
IT HAS BEEN OUTLAWED
IN OFFICIAL DUEL MONSTERS
TOURNAMENTS.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.553
THE SECOND HAS POWER
COMPARABLE TO
THE CHAOS EMPEROR,

00:12:46.553 --> 00:12:49.189
BUT HAS NEVER BEEN
FORBIDDEN ON ACCOUNT
OF ITS SCARCITY.

00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:52.626
IN FACT, SOME SAY
NOT A SINGLE ONE
STILL EXISTS!

00:12:52.626 --> 00:12:54.294
OH? WELL,
THEY'RE WRONG

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:56.329
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE
RIGHT HERE!

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:59.232
BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER--
ENVOY OF THE BEGINNING!

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:07.808
SO THEN YUGI REALLY
DID HAVE THAT CARD!

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.310
[ROAR]

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.179
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A RUMOR.

00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:13.947
I'M AFRAID NOT.

00:13:13.947 --> 00:13:17.184
THIS CARD'S BEEN A PART
OF MY DECK FOR A LONG TIME,

00:13:17.184 --> 00:13:21.121
BUT I ONLY TAKE HIM OUT
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:24.724
LIKE NOW!
LUSTER BLADE ATTACK!

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:31.231
UHH! THAT HURT!

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:33.900
WELL, THAT WAS
JUST THE BEGINNING!

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.237
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU
THE TRUE POWER OF THIS CARD!

00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:40.841
YOU SEE,
IF THE BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.143
IS ABLE TO DESTROY
YOUR MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:13:43.143 --> 00:13:44.911
HE'S ALLOWED
TO ATTACK AGAIN!

00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:46.012
NO WAY!

00:13:46.012 --> 00:13:48.048
AW, MAN.
NOW I'M STARTING TO SEE

00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:50.116
WHY MONSTERS LIKE THIS
ARE OUTLAWED!

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:52.819
AND NOW!
BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER,

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:53.820
END THIS!

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.288
HE'S THROUGH!

00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:57.724
JADEN'S LIFE POINTS
CAN'T WITHSTAND
ANOTHER HIT!

00:13:57.724 --> 00:13:58.892
IT'S OVER!

00:14:00.427 --> 00:14:04.297
NOT YET--
I PLAY THE CARD
HERO SPIRIT!

00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.199
[ROARING]

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:11.605
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:13.240
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE DUEL

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.409
CUZ IF A HERO
IS DESTROYED AND I
PLAY HERO SPIRIT,

00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:18.044
I CAN TURN ALL
THE DAMAGE RECEIVED

00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:19.479
FROM YOUR MONSTER
TO ZERO!

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:20.981
FINE, THEN.

00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.783
I'LL JUST FINISH YOU OFF
NEXT TURN.

00:14:23.783 --> 00:14:26.520
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
WILL SEE TO THAT!

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.054
HA HA HA!

00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:29.122
[THINKING]
HE MAY BE RIGHT.

00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:32.025
YUGI'S DECK
IS JUST SO POWERFUL.

00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:33.326
I THOUGHT
I COULD WIN,

00:14:33.326 --> 00:14:35.128
BUT NOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:14:35.128 --> 00:14:36.129
HUH?

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.064
[SQUEAK]

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:39.799
KURIBOH.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:42.269
SORRY,
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:44.938
HE'S GOT THE HEART
OF THE CARDS
ON HIS SIDE.

00:14:44.938 --> 00:14:47.741
UHH! OW! OH!

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:48.742
[SQUEAKING]

00:14:48.742 --> 00:14:49.776
WHADAYA MEAN, NO?

00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:51.745
COME ON,
THAT'S YUGI'S DECK!

00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.446
OH!

00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:55.682
[THINKING]
WAIT A SEC!
THAT'S IT!

00:14:55.682 --> 00:14:56.816
THAT'S
YUGI'S DECK!

00:14:56.816 --> 00:14:58.184
THERE'S NO WAY
THE HEART OF THE CARDS

00:14:58.184 --> 00:14:59.886
CAN BE ON
DIMITRI'S SIDE!

00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:02.355
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
COMES FROM BELIEVING
IN YOUR OWN CARDS,

00:15:02.355 --> 00:15:03.890
NOT SOMEONE'S
YOU STOLE!

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.759
AND I BELIEVE
IN MY DECK,

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.894
SO IF THE HEART
OF THE CARDS
IS ON ANYONE'S SIDE,

00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:09.529
IT'S ON MINE!

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:12.599
HA! HUH...

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:15.268
SORRY, DIMITRI,
BUT I BELIEVE!

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:16.336
WHAT?!

00:15:16.336 --> 00:15:18.872
I ACTIVATE
SILENT DOOM!

00:15:18.872 --> 00:15:21.808
THIS VERY HANDY
SPELL CARD ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON ONE MONSTER

00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:23.944
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:26.880
SO COME ON BACK,
AVIAN!

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.548
NEXT,
I'LL PLAY THIS--

00:15:28.548 --> 00:15:31.384
IT'S CALLED
DOUBLE SPELL!

00:15:31.384 --> 00:15:34.120
NOW BY DISCARDIN'
ONE SPELL CARD
FROM MY HAND,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.057
I CAN USE ONE SPELL CARD
FROM MY OPPONENT'S
GRAVEYARD!

00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:38.792
IF YA NEED MORE INFO,

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.360
JUST LOOK IN
THE OFFICIAL RULE BOOK

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.562
UNDER THE HEADING,
"HOW'D I LOSE?"

00:15:42.562 --> 00:15:45.065
SOUNDS LIKE JADEN'S
GOT SOMETHING PLANNED!

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:49.369
SO, I'LL DISCARD THIS
AND HELP MYSELF
TO YOUR POLYMERIZATION!

00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:51.404
AAH!

00:15:51.404 --> 00:15:54.541
NOW I'LL FUSE AVIAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:15:54.541 --> 00:15:58.078
TO CREATE MY DECK'S
HEADLINER ONE MORE TIME--

00:15:58.078 --> 00:16:00.947
THE ELEMENTAL HERO
FLAME WINGMAN!

00:16:00.947 --> 00:16:03.917
AND SINCE MY SKYSCRAPER
FIELD CARD IS STILL OUT,

00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:07.220
HE GAINS AN EXTRA
1,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.089
NOW, FLAME WINGMAN!

00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:13.493
ATTACK BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER
WITH SKYDIVE SCORCHER!

00:16:16.896 --> 00:16:20.600
OH! HE'S GONE.
MY LUSTER SOLDIER'S GONE!

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.603
DON'T SWEAT IT,
HE WAS NEVER YOURS
TO BEGIN WITH.

00:16:23.603 --> 00:16:25.705
BESIDES, IF YA WANNA
WORRY ABOUT SOMETHIN',

00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:27.874
WORRY ABOUT WINGMAN'S
SUPER POWER!

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:30.710
IT MAKES IT SO ALL
YOUR DESTROYED MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.947
ARE DEALT AS DAMAGE
TO YOU!

00:16:33.947 --> 00:16:36.383
AAH!

00:16:36.383 --> 00:16:38.184
[GASPING]

00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:45.792
THAT'S GAME!

00:16:45.792 --> 00:16:47.727
AND THE END OF YOU
USIN' THAT DECK!

00:16:47.727 --> 00:16:51.598
I'VE BEEN BEATEN.
UHH...

00:16:51.598 --> 00:16:54.100
EVEN WITH MY...

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.037
[AS DIMITRI]
WITH YUGI'S
LEGENDARY CARDS.

00:16:57.037 --> 00:16:58.638
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:00.373
WHY CAN'T I EVER WIN?

00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:02.994
Zane: THE ANSWER
TO THAT IS OBVIOUS.
HUH?

00:17:07.387 --> 00:17:10.523
HEY, YOU'RE ZANE!

00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:12.120
BIG BRO?!

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.989
WHY ARE
YOU GUYS HERE?!

00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.158
WHY ELSE?
TO SEE THE DECK,

00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:17.392
BUT IT WAS GONE.

00:17:17.392 --> 00:17:19.027
WE SNUCK INTO
THE EVENT HALL

00:17:19.027 --> 00:17:21.630
AND SAW HOW
THE DISPLAY CASE
WAS BROKEN INTO.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.632
WE FIGURED THE THIEF
COULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN FAR,

00:17:23.632 --> 00:17:25.767
SO WE DECIDED TO
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

00:17:25.767 --> 00:17:27.369
WHICH LED US HERE.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.770
WE FOUND YOU A WHILE AGO,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.405
BUT DIDN'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT THE DUEL.

00:17:30.405 --> 00:17:31.940
KIND OF YOU.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.009
WAIT, THEN YOU
SAW IT ALL?

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:36.044
ME AND DIMITRI?
THE WHOLE THING?!

00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:37.479
NOT JUST US.

00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:40.716
YOUR MATCH ATTRACTED
QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION.

00:17:40.716 --> 00:17:42.751
HUH?

00:17:42.751 --> 00:17:43.919
WHOA.

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:46.121
UH, HI!
GLAD YOU ALL COULD MAKE IT!

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:48.824
MAN, THAT JADEN
CAN DUEL!

00:17:48.824 --> 00:17:50.392
DO YA THINK
HE TUTORS?

00:17:50.392 --> 00:17:51.960
I'M FAILING
FUSION!

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.595
WHAT NOW?

00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:55.130
WELL, KID.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.332
THE PUNISHMENT
FOR STEALING HAS ALWAYS
BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR--

00:17:57.332 --> 00:17:59.201
STRAIGHT-UP EXPULSION.

00:17:59.201 --> 00:18:02.671
BUT STILL, SINCE I THINK
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE HERE

00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:06.542
ENJOYED SEEING YUGI'S DECK
IN A DUEL RATHER
THAN A DISPLAY CASE,

00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:09.211
I DOUBT ANYONE
WILL TURN YOU IN.

00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:10.779
DON'T SWEAT IT,
DIMITRI!

00:18:10.779 --> 00:18:12.080
BUT YOU GOTTA TELL US,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.550
HOW YOU WERE SO GOOD
WITH THOSE SPELLCASTERS?!

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.151
I'M FAILING THAT,
TOO!

00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:17.986
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

00:18:17.986 --> 00:18:19.021
I LOST.

00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:20.856
YOU DIDN T LOSE!

00:18:20.856 --> 00:18:24.426
THAT PERSON YOU
WERE PRETENDIN'
TO BE DID, DIMITRI!

00:18:24.426 --> 00:18:25.427
YUGI?

00:18:25.427 --> 00:18:26.528
NAH, BRO!

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:28.363
YOU CAN
NEVER BE YUGI!

00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:30.332
THEN WHO WAS I?

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:32.901
WELL, YOU WERE YOU,
BUT YOU WEREN'T.

00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:34.403
SEE, WHEN
YA COPY SOMEONE,

00:18:34.403 --> 00:18:36.371
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE THAT PERSON!

00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:39.641
YOU'RE YOU COPYING
THAT PERSON, YA KNOW?

00:18:39.641 --> 00:18:42.210
HMM. YEAH,
THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.080
LET ME ATTEMPT TO
INTERPRET FOR HIM, DIMITRI.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.150
YOU'LL NEVER WIN OR LOSE
UNTIL YOU PUT YOURSELF
OUT THERE,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.152
AND THAT MEANS CREATING
YOUR OWN DECK

00:18:50.152 --> 00:18:51.653
AND YOUR OWN STRATEGIES,

00:18:51.653 --> 00:18:54.289
NOT PIGGY-BACKING
OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE'S.

00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:58.527
AFTER ALL, THERE IS NO AMOUNT
OF STUDYING THAT YOU CAN DO

00:18:58.527 --> 00:19:02.064
TO BE ABLE TO USE SOMEONE ELSE'S
DECK AS WELL AS THEY CAN.

00:19:02.064 --> 00:19:03.899
YEAH! WHAT ZANE SAID.

00:19:03.899 --> 00:19:05.901
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT.

00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:08.270
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE,
BUT JUST CUZ I BEAT YOU,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.872
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I COULDA BEAT YUGI.

00:19:10.872 --> 00:19:13.742
SO HOW 'BOUT WE PUT
THAT DECK BACK
WHERE IT BELONGS?

00:19:13.742 --> 00:19:15.477
YEAH. OK.

00:19:22.117 --> 00:19:23.619
WOULD YA LOOK
AT THAT.

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:25.253
EVERYTHING'S BACK
TO NORMAL, HUH?

00:19:25.253 --> 00:19:27.656
MM-HMM.
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

00:19:27.656 --> 00:19:30.859
AS NORMAL AS THINGS
GET AROUND THIS
CRAZY PLACE!

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:33.695
SO ANYWAY, WHAT'S THAT
YOU GOT THERE, JADEN?

00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:35.097
WHAT? THIS?

00:19:35.097 --> 00:19:37.733
JUST AN AUTOGRAPHED
POSTER OF THE KING
OF GAMES!

00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:38.867
OOH.

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:42.671
YEAH, I KNOW.
PRETTY SWEET,
HUH, CHUM?

00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:43.772
IT SURE IS.

00:19:43.772 --> 00:19:45.440
BUT, UH,
JUST SO YA KNOW...

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.608
I HEARD DIMITRI.

00:19:46.608 --> 00:19:48.276
HE WAS STILL TALKIN'
IN THE YUGI VOICE

00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:49.778
WHEN HE PUT
THAT DECK BACK.

00:19:49.778 --> 00:19:51.246
AND THEN HE GOT
INTO THE MERCHANDISE

00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:52.414
AND HE HAD A PEN!

00:19:52.414 --> 00:19:55.684
Syrus: JADEN!
JAAAAADEN!

00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:56.885
WHAT'S UP, SY?

00:19:56.885 --> 00:19:59.488
IT'S DIMITRI!
HE'S AT IT AGAIN!

00:19:59.488 --> 00:20:00.489
HUH?!

00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:03.525
HUH?

00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:05.761
Dimitri: I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU!

00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:07.162
AAH! DIMITRI?!

00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:08.163
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:20:08.163 --> 00:20:10.032
WHO'S THIS DIMITRI?!

00:20:10.032 --> 00:20:13.935

SO TURN YOUR GAME ON!

00:20:17.606 --> 00:20:19.007
AAH!

00:20:19.007 --> 00:20:21.510
IT'S "GET YOUR GAME ON!"
SAY IT RIGHT!

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.844
YEAH, WHATEVER.

00:20:22.844 --> 00:20:24.946
WE'LL SETTLE IT IN A DUEL,
SO LET'S THROW UP!

00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:26.748
WAIT, I MEAN
LET'S THROW DOWN.

00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:28.517
LOOK, LET'S JUST DUEL!

00:20:28.517 --> 00:20:30.018
COME ON!
GET YOUR DECK OUT!

00:20:30.018 --> 00:20:33.188
THIS IS GONNA BE SWELL!

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:34.523
IT'S "SWEET!"

00:20:34.523 --> 00:20:37.092
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO DOIN' MY POSE RIGHT!

00:20:37.092 --> 00:20:38.660
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.028
RELAX YOUR WRIST,

00:20:40.028 --> 00:20:41.697

YEAH, I THINK
I JUST WANT OUTTA HERE.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:49.871
Dimitri:
BUT I'M YOU.

00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:51.473
Jaden: OHH!
