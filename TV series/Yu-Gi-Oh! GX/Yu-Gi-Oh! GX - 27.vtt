00:14:49.643 --> 00:14:51.845
POLYMERIZATION!

00:14:51.845 --> 00:14:55.649
AVIAN AND BURSTINATRIX
COMBINE TO CREATE...

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:57.551
THE FLAME WINGMAN!

00:15:01.455 --> 00:15:02.723
HUH?

00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:05.192
SO DID BUBBLEMAN
GIVE ME TWO
VERY GOOD CARDS?!

00:15:05.192 --> 00:15:06.960
WELL,
SEE FOR YOURSELF!

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.630
BECAUSE...
FROM BOTH OF THEM...

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.598
CAME HIM!

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:14.134
AND THIS NEXT ATTACK!

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:17.671
UHH!

00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:20.674
UHH!

00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:23.477
DON'T EVEN THINK YOU'RE
OUTTA THE FIRE YET!

00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:26.246
CUZ FOR EVERY
ATTACK POINT
SPEAR SOLDIER HAD...

00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:27.915
YOU NOW TAKE DAMAGE FOR!

00:15:29.349 --> 00:15:33.053
UHH!

00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:36.657
NEXT, I'M GONNA SUMMON
ON UP WROUGHTWEILER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:37.925
AND THAT'LL DO IT.

00:15:41.562 --> 00:15:42.863
NICE JOB,
JADEN!

00:15:42.863 --> 00:15:44.431
WAY TO PLAY, JAY!

00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:46.767
IF WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE IT THROUGH
THIS THING, SY...

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:49.103
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE CAN PLAY!

00:15:49.103 --> 00:15:51.338
BECAUSE IF HE MAKES
EVEN A COUPLE
MORE MISTAKES,

00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:52.339
WE'RE THROUGH!

00:15:56.114 --> 00:15:57.115
Jaden: ALL RIGHT!
MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:15:57.115 --> 00:15:58.383
CUZ THE QUICKER
I CAN WIN THIS THING,

00:15:58.383 --> 00:16:00.385
THE QUICKER I CAN
GET MY FRIENDS BACK!

00:16:00.385 --> 00:16:04.389
OR THE QUICKER
THEY'LL BE SENT
TO THEIR DOOM!

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:05.991
HA!

00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:09.995
I CHANGE MY GRAVEKEEPER'S
GUARD TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:13.175 --> 00:16:15.578
AND THEN I'LL PLACE
A FACEDOWN MONSTER

00:16:15.578 --> 00:16:17.513
IN DEFENSE MODE,
AS WELL!

00:16:17.513 --> 00:16:20.282
GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW
RULE NUMBER ONE
IN DUEL MONSTERS!

00:16:20.282 --> 00:16:23.452
HA! A GOOD DEFENSE
IS A SWEET OFFENSE!

00:16:23.452 --> 00:16:26.355
AND WHO BETTER
TO TEACH YOU THE RULES
THAN FLAME WINGMAN!

00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:28.023
NOW! HERE GOES!

00:16:28.023 --> 00:16:29.391
ATTACK!

00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:31.093
[ROARING]

00:16:31.093 --> 00:16:33.195
INFERNAL RAGE!

00:16:36.198 --> 00:16:38.133
AAH!

00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:41.036
UHH!

00:16:41.036 --> 00:16:42.671
OH, YEAH!

00:16:46.842 --> 00:16:48.210
HA!

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.679
I ACTIVATE...
POT OF GREED!

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:53.582
NOW I CAN DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:16:58.216 --> 00:17:01.552
I SHALL SUMMON
GRAVEKEEPER'S ASSAILANT
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:08.025
AND SHE WILL BE JOINED
BY THE MYSTICISM

00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:10.862
OF GRAVEKEEPER'S CURSE!

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:14.198
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
THE EFFECT OF
GRAVEKEEPER'S CURSE!

00:17:14.198 --> 00:17:17.969
AN EFFECT THAT
WILL DELIVER TO YOU
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.545
THAT SOUND...UHH!

00:17:27.545 --> 00:17:29.280
IT'S WORSE'N
CHUM'S SNOR'N!

00:17:31.215 --> 00:17:32.984
Banner:
IT'S A GOOD THING
I HAVE THOSE MINTS.

00:17:32.984 --> 00:17:35.353
UHH!

00:17:35.353 --> 00:17:37.188
YOU GOTTA DO BETTER
THAN THAT!

00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:38.890
VERY WELL, THEN!

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.359
PERHAPS THIS CARD
WILL SUFFICE!

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:44.162
I CAST...NECROVALLEY!

00:17:48.332 --> 00:17:50.635
UH...NOT GOOD!

00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:00.344
AS LONG AS THIS CARD
REMAINS ON THE FIELD...

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:02.213
THE POWER
OF THE NECROVALLEY

00:18:02.213 --> 00:18:06.417
WILL ADD 500 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS
TO MY GRAVEKEEPERS!

00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:07.418
WHAT?!

00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:14.725
GRAVEKEEPER'S ASSAILANT,
ATTACK FLAME WINGMAN!

00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.829
WHAT, YOU GOT SAND IN
YOUR EYES OR SOMETHIN'?!

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:20.298
CAN'T YA SEE WINGMAN
STILL HAS MORE POINTS?!

00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:21.833
UNLESS YOU GOT
SOME SORTAAAAAAA...

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:22.900
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.236
YES, THE ASSAILANT DOES,
ACTUALLY.

00:18:25.236 --> 00:18:27.405
AND IT ALLOWS HER
TO CHANGE THE BATTLE MODE

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:29.607
OF YOUR WINGMAN
FROM ATTACK TO DEFENSE!

00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:37.248
OH, MAN!

00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:38.883
BOY,
YOU CAN REALLY DUEL!

00:18:38.883 --> 00:18:41.385
THE BEST HAS YET
TO COME!!

00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:42.386
ATTACK HIM!

00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:44.956
OH!

00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:49.927
Assailant: HA!

00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:51.896
UHH!

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.130
AND NOW,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.534
MY GRAVEKEEPER'S CURSE
WILL DESTROY THAT CUR!

00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:58.536
TAKE HIM DOWN!

00:19:02.907 --> 00:19:06.310
UHH! WHOOPSIE,
FORGET HIS
SPECIAL EFFECT?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.813
WHEN HE'S DESTROYED,
I GET TWO CARDS BACK
FROM THE GRAVE--

00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:11.716
AN ELEMENTAL HERO
AND POLYMERIZATION!

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:14.018
YOU HAVE THE WISDOM
OF DIRT.

00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:16.521
NECROVALLEY
NEGATES THAT EFFECT!

00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:18.055
HUH?!

00:19:18.055 --> 00:19:22.226
ANY SPELL, TRAP,
OR MONSTER EFFECT
INVOLVING THE GRAVEYARD...

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:24.462
IS COMPLETELY USELESS!

00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:27.031
JUST AS YOU HAVE PROVEN
TO BE IN YOUR ATTEMPTS

00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:28.900
TO RESCUE
YOUR FRIENDS!

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.101
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:33.404
BOTH YOU AND YOUR CARDS
ARE FUTILE HERE!

00:19:33.404 --> 00:19:35.606
UHH!

00:19:35.606 --> 00:19:37.909
NO, I REFUSE
TO BELIEVE IT!

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:40.144
I KNOW JADEN
CAN FIND A WAY!

00:19:40.144 --> 00:19:41.245
I HOPE!
I HOPE!

00:19:41.245 --> 00:19:43.848
OH, NO. IT'S NO USE.
WE'RE DONE FOR!

00:19:43.848 --> 00:19:45.483
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
PROFESSOR BANNER.

00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:46.784
JAY'S STILL WINNING!

00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:48.586
JUST LOOK
AT THE LIFE POINTS!

00:19:48.586 --> 00:19:50.855
FORGET THE LIFE POINTS,
LOOK AT THE FIELD!

00:19:50.855 --> 00:19:53.558
JADEN HAS
NO MONSTERS OUT!

00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:57.295
AND THE GRAVEKEEPER'S
CHIEF HAS TWO!

00:19:57.295 --> 00:20:00.631
HA HA HA!

00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:02.066
[THINKING]
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:04.068
WE SET OUT LOOKIN'
FOR RUINS...

00:20:04.068 --> 00:20:06.904
AND SUDDENLY WE'RE
ABOUT TO BECOME SOME!

00:20:06.904 --> 00:20:08.639
THIS IS NO JOKE...

00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:10.575
IF I DON'T
GET MY GAME ON...

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:13.010
WE'RE ALL
GONNA BE LONG GONE!

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.912
HEH HEH HEH.

00:20:14.912 --> 00:20:18.616
HA HA HA HA!
