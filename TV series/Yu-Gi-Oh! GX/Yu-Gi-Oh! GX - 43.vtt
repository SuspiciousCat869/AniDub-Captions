[YELLING]

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.552
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN!

00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:42.426
IT ACTIVATES
WHENEVER YOU ATTACK ME!

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:46.265
D'ABORD, I TOSS MY
PRETTY COIN INTO THE AIR.

00:08:46.265 --> 00:08:51.274
AND IF I GUESS CORRECTLY,
YOUR DAMAGE GOES TO ZERO!

00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:54.580
I CHOOSE HEADS!

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.082
HEY, IT'S TAILS!

00:08:56.082 --> 00:08:57.418

AND NOW
MON SECOND COIN TOSS.

00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:06.432
REMEMBER, I GET TO FLIP

00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:09.470
OHH.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.180
I'LL PLACE
A FACEDOWN...

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.916

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:18.685
AND I SHALL NOW
END THIS DUEL!

00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:25.297

00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:26.298
[ALL SIGH]

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.837

YOU WATCH YOUR TONGUE!

00:09:32.442 --> 00:09:34.879
I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I SEE THE SAME

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.449
SCARED BOY
FROM SCHOOL!

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:39.687
WHAT? I'M NOT SCARED,
I AM A WINNER!

00:09:39.687 --> 00:09:40.989
REMEMBER?

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:43.059
I NEVER LOST A GAME
IN SCHOOL!

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:44.795
EXCEPT TO YOU!

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:47.600
HARD FEELINGS!

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.772
JADEN...JUST WHAT

CARE TO FILL IN
THE PEANUT GALLERY HERE?!

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.051
WITH PLEASURE...
IT STARTED...

00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.688
WHEN WE WERE
BOTH REALLY YOUNG.

00:10:00.688 --> 00:10:02.558
YOU WERE THE NEW STUDENT.

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:06.731
NO FRIENDS, NO CLUE...
JUST A CUTE SMILE.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.569
BUT WE ALL PITCHED IN
AND MADE YOU FEEL WELCOME.

00:10:09.569 --> 00:10:12.541
WE WERE YOUR NEW FAMILY.

00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.579
AND HOW DID YOU TREAT ALL
YOUR NEW BROTHERS AND SISTERS?

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:18.217
YOU RIPPED US OFF ONE BY ONE!

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.987
I JUST LOVE
YOUR SCARF!

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.389
THANKS, IT WAS
MY MOTHER'S...

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:23.792

OUI...SO, DOUBLE

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.312
YOU JUST HAD SO MUCH MONEY
AND SO MANY TOYS

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:37.582
THAT YOU'D KEEP GAMBLING
AND GAMBLING AND GAMBLING

00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:40.520
UNTIL THEY FINALLY LOST!

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.358
YOU ENDED UP TAKING
EVERYTHING FROM EVERYBODY!

00:10:43.358 --> 00:10:47.766
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET
YOU GET AWAY WITH IT!

00:10:47.766 --> 00:10:49.368
ALRIGHT, PIERRE!

00:10:49.368 --> 00:10:51.438

00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:32.206
A GIFT MY MOM GAVE ME,
HER FAVORITE SCARF.

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:33.608
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:35.511
I'LL TELL YOU!

00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:37.881
CUZ YOU'RE

AND IF IT
COMES UP HEADS...

00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:28.663
THREE TIMES IN A ROW,
ALL YOUR MONSTERS ARE FINI!

00:14:28.663 --> 00:14:32.268
BUT IF I GET TAILS...
MY MONSTERS...

00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:34.405
WILL BID YOU
A SWIFT AU REVOIR.

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:36.809
THREE HEADS?
THERE'S NO WAY!

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.745

00:14:43.687 --> 00:14:45.256
HEADS.

00:14:45.256 --> 00:14:49.697
AND IF I GET TWO MORE,
YOUR BEASTS GO BYE!

00:14:49.697 --> 00:14:52.902
ERR. JUST FLIP!

00:14:52.902 --> 00:14:53.904

WITH SECOND COIN TOSS...
I NOW GET TO FLIP AGAIN!

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:07.026
IT'S HEADS!

00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:08.829
THAT MAKES TWO...

00:15:13.002 --> 00:15:14.805
THIRD'S A CHARM!

00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:16.441
WHO'S THE LUCKY ONE?

00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:17.476
IT'S NOT LEX!

00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:18.845
NO WAY!

00:15:18.845 --> 00:15:21.016

DESTROY ALL HER MONSTERS!

00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:36.808
I LOVE IT WHEN
A PLAN COMES TOGETHER!

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:40.247
LOOK AT ME!

[THINKING]
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT!

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:46.757
I REVEAL, MY FACEDOWN:
HALLOWED LIFE BARRIER!

00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:49.662
IF I DISCARD
JUST ONE CARD,

00:15:49.662 --> 00:15:52.033
ALL DAMAGE I TAKE
GOES TO ZERO

00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:53.636
FOR THIS TURN!

00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:56.339
SA-WEET! NOW THAT'S
THE, ALEXIS I KNOW!

00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:58.644

00:16:00.146 --> 00:16:03.218
WE'LL SEE
'BOUT THAT! HA!

00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:05.254
[THINKING]
I TRIED TO BE YOUR
FRIEND, PIERRE.

00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:07.625
I TRIED TO TEACH YOU
THE GAME THAT I LOVED!

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:10.296
BUT YOU JUST USED
IT TO BE A THIEF!

00:16:10.296 --> 00:16:11.898
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
ABOUT TO GET
A LESSON

00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:14.236
THAT'S LONG OVERDUE!

00:16:14.236 --> 00:16:16.473
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD:

00:16:16.473 --> 00:16:19.144
THE WARRIOR
RETURNING ALIVE!

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:23.451
I GET TO CALL UP
ONE WARRIOR MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:28.126
WELCOME BACK...
CYBER TUTU
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:29.661
THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:32.766
I ACTIVATE:
THE SPELL CARD,
PRIMA LIGHT

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:35.571
AND SACRIFICE
TUTU...

00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:37.741
SO I CAN SUMMON
CYBER PRIMA

00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.244
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:41.882 --> 00:16:44.018
AND WHEN
SHE'S SUMMONED,

00:16:44.018 --> 00:16:46.456
HER SPECIAL ABILITY
DESTROYS

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:49.828
EVERY SPELL CARD,
ON THE FIELD!

00:16:49.828 --> 00:16:53.066
OHH!

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:55.671
AND WITH ONLY
YOUR SAND GAMBLER
HANGING AROUND

00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:58.843
TO DEFEND YOU,
IF I DECIDE TO
ATTACK YOU...

00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:01.781
WELL, THEN...
IT'LL FINALLY BE
MY TURN...

00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:03.250
TO SAY "AU REVOIR!"

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.921
EXCUSE!
I HAVE MY TRAP CARD!

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:07.658
OR DID YOU FORGET?

00:17:07.658 --> 00:17:10.996
IF I CHOOSE
MY COIN TOSS RIGHT
ONE MORE TIME...

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:15.136
YOU DO NO DAMAGE
AND MY GAMBLER DESTROYS YOU!

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:16.705
IT COMES TO THIS.

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:19.009
A SINGLE COIN TOSS.

00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:20.645
CUZ AFTER ALL...

00:17:20.645 --> 00:17:24.351
YOUR SECOND
COIN TOSS
WAS DESTROYED!!

00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:25.920
I WAS WONDERING WHY
YOU DIDN'T USE

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.056
YOUR SECOND
ANGEL BUNNY'S

00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:29.159
COIN TOSS
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:17:29.159 --> 00:17:31.496
THEN I GOT IT.

00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:33.099
IT WAS CLEAR!

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:35.870
YOU...
COULDN'T RISK IT.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.974
WITHOUT YOUR
SECOND COIN TOSS,

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.743
YOU'D HAVE LOST
EVERY TIME!

00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:41.312
DON'T SAY THAT!

00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:43.082
YOU'RE NOT A WINNER.

00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:45.419
PIERRE, YOU'RE NOT,
EVEN A GAMBLER!

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:48.591
YOU'RE JUST A SCARED
KID BACK IN SCHOOL.

00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:50.027
SACRE BLEU...

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:53.666
CYBER PRIMA,
ATTACK HIS GAMBLER!

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:03.950
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO ONE COIN TOSS!

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.619
TAILS...PLEASE!

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.656
SORRY!
PLAY TOO MUCH,

00:18:07.656 --> 00:18:09.660
AND THE HOUSE
WILL WIN!

00:18:11.095 --> 00:18:13.399
OHH!

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:15.001
NOW FINISH HIM OFF!

00:18:23.181 --> 00:18:25.052
[GROANING]

00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:37.339
HA! NICE JOB, LEX!

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:38.974
YEAH!
WAY TO PLAY!

00:18:38.974 --> 00:18:40.544
THAT WAS LISHUS!

00:18:40.544 --> 00:18:41.845
I DON'T CARE!

00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:43.682
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY!

00:18:43.682 --> 00:18:45.318
FEMME FATALE...

00:18:45.318 --> 00:18:49.759
PIERRE, I BEAT YOU
BECAUSE I DON'T
BELIEVE IN LUCK!

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.764
I WORK HARD,
AND I PLAY
EVEN HARDER.

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.300
THAT'S WHY I WON.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.770
"LUCK" IS
A LOSER'S EXCUSE.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.777
JE SUIS DESOLE...
I'M SORRY.

00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:03.481
THE ONLY REASON
I WANTED TO DUEL...

00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:05.551
WAS BECAUSE
I LOVED YOU.

00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:07.454
OHH!

00:19:07.454 --> 00:19:10.059
I THOUGHT,
IF I WON...

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:13.264
THAT MAYBE YOU
WOULD FALL IN LOVE
WITH ME, ALEXIS.

00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:14.265
AW.

NOW BON VOYAGE!

00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:58.501
HUH? OH.

THAT'S RIGHT!
I KNOW SOME FRENCH.

00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:03.106
