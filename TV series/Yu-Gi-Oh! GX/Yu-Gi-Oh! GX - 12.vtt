WEBVTT

00:00:01.128 --> 00:00:02.796
(boy)
Come on, Jaden!

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:03.931
(boy)
  Hit a homer!

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:04.932
Jay!

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:06.167
Keep your eye
on the ball!

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.168
That could be tough.

00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:08.536
After all...

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:10.571
the ball's gonna
  be goin' over the rafters!

00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:11.839
He'll score.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:12.940
Then he'll score.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.575
And then
  I'll score!

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:16.161
We'll have six-run lead!

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.222
(Bastion)
  Hold on!

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:20.858
Time out!

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.561
Sorry, I was deep into
some attack point

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.130
quantum mechanics
and lost track of time.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.131
Can you throw?

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.132
Sure.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:29.133
Well, we need
  a fresh arm.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.134
Pitcher change!

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:31.135
Get in there!

00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.741
This is no
  written exam, Bastion.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.676
I hope you know what
  you're doing!

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.580
Trust me, I've done
  all the calculations...

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.849
Now get ready for
  some heat, Jaden.

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.617

  in red hot.

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:54.885
(growling)

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:55.886
Strike!

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.887
Strike two!

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:57.888
You're out!

00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:58.889
Nuts!

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:01.892
(Umpire)
Ball.

00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.730
Ball, take
your base!

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.731
Time!

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:08.265
Jaden's what's
going on?

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:09.433
You got two outs

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.336
and now you've walked
the last three batters!

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:13.738
Pretty slick, huh?

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:15.106
Slick?

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:17.608
Yeah, how else would I get
  a chance to pitch Bastion?

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:18.809
What?

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.745
So then you walked
 all those guys...

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.180
just so that you could
get even with Bastion?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.382
Nah!

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:27.451
I don't wanna just get even,
  I wanna get ahead!

00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.520
Hey, you hear
  that, buddy?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.255
You're going down!

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.190
(Bastion)
  Down the base
  paths, perhaps.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.226
Now then, give me
  your best, Jaden.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:37.261
I don't want to
  hear any excuses...

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.830
after I wallop it right
  out of the ballpark.

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:42.700
That is, if you can
  manage to get

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.503
the baseball over
  the plate, of course.

00:02:45.503 --> 00:02:46.504
Game on!

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.705
Game over, soon!

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.608
♪

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.643
Now here's some
  bite for you!

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:55.646
(growling)

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:57.848
Ooh, the Paradox Brothers
  couldn't beat Jaden,

00:02:57.848 --> 00:02:59.116
Chazz couldn't
  beat Jaden!

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:01.252
I need to find someone
  who can beat--

00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:02.653
(yelling)

00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:03.654
Uh, heads-up?

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:07.425
You!

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:08.559
Well, of course!

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.761
Who else could cause
  such intense pain?

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:12.596
Now that's keeping
  your eye on the ball.

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:13.731
Sorry.

00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:14.732
It was...

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:15.766
(Bastion)
  My fault.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.234
I was the one
  who hit the ball.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:19.970
Bastion?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.038
Of course!

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:22.940
Here I was, struggling
  to find a new accomplice

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.209
and here it smacks me
  right in the face.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.477
Well, the eye, actually,

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:28.546
but that's really
  beside the point.

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:31.081
Dr. Crowler, accept
my apologies.

00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:33.250
No, no,
  no, no!

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.986
I've been meaning to get my
  contacts refitted for ages,

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.721
now I have
  the perfect excuse.

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.757
And the perfect
  new protégé.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.461
All right,
  you two, you've caused

00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:44.695
enough trouble,
  now shoo!

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:45.796
Shoo-shoo!

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.198
(shrieking)

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:49.366
(Jaden)
  Fine.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:50.367
But that was foul, Bastion!

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:51.368
Bye!

00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:52.937
Never mind
  those two.

00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.305
Slifer slackers.

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.340
It's time you started
  consorting with those

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.275
more your class,
  don't you think?

00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:00.444
It's time you start
  consorting...

00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:01.479
with me.

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:08.647
Yo, foot rub,
iced tea, now!

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.315
Get it yourself.

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:11.650
What was that?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.651
Doesn't he know?

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:13.652
Guess not.

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:14.886
Know what?

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:17.289
Chazz, where do you
  think you're sitting?

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.490
My seat?

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.093
Sorry, but that's
  not your seat anymore.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.194
Now move!

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:23.595
What are you
talking about?

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.931
Of course this is my seat,
  it says so right here!

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.302
Sorry, Chazz, but you
were moved way over there.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.336
No way!

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.337
This is...

00:04:32.337 --> 00:04:33.638
all wrong!

00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:35.807
I don't belong over
  there with those losers!

00:04:35.807 --> 00:04:38.944
Dr. Crowler, tell everyone
  this is a mistake!

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:40.879
Tell them
  I belong up here!

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.382
But you don't, and you
haven't since you lost that

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:45.784
one duel to, oh,
 who was it now?

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.854
Ah, yes, I remember,
Jaden Yuki.

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:50.088
A Slifer!

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:53.125
Which is why, tomorrow,
you will duel Bastion Misawa,

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.528
and if you lose to him, as well,
you two will switch dorms!

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:57.729
You mean...

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.997
I'd become a...

00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:00.932
Ra Yellow duelist?

00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:03.068
Yes, very good, now if
only you could duel

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:04.069
as well as
you listen!

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.971
(laughing)

00:05:07.235 --> 00:05:09.571
(laughing continues)

00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:13.308
I won't be a Ra!

00:05:13.308 --> 00:05:14.809
(laughing)

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:19.214
(Jaden)
  All right, all right, maybe
  it wasn't a foul, Bastion.

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:21.783
(Syrus)
  Jaden, over the center field
  fence usually isn't.

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:23.885
Look, I play
like I duel!

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.220
With formulas.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.088
See, I find
that science,

00:05:27.088 --> 00:05:28.556
statistics,
 geometry--

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:31.426
they play a role in
everything that we do in life.

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:32.427
Wow.

00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:34.362
I never looked at
  it that way.

00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.599
So, do you have a formula
  for everything, Bastion?

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:38.866
(laughing)

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:42.770
And here
  we are!

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.771
(gasping)

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:45.473
(both)
  And where's that?

00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:48.776
My lab, my workshop,
  my dorm room.

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.345
That area is for Traps.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.414
That's for
  Spell Cards.

00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:57.352
And that's, well,
  you get the idea.

00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.487
Most of these I've memorized,
  and as you can see,

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:00.989
I'm running out
  of room, so...

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:01.990
(both)
  So what?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.925
So... mind helping?

00:06:04.993 --> 00:06:06.661
♪

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.131
Check it out!

00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.733
I'm Michelangelo!

00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:12.867
(laughing)

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:13.868

(yelling)
  What the...

You do realize...

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:22.076
this means war,
Jay.

00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:24.445
Now look, Sy.

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:25.847
It was an accident!

00:06:25.847 --> 00:06:26.848
That's enough!

00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:29.317
Give me that

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:32.787
Funny, is it?

(laughing)

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.198
I don't think I've ever
  such a good time paintin'!

00:06:44.198 --> 00:06:45.767
Hey, you're all right,
  Bastion!

00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:47.502
Yeah, and so is
  Ra Yellow's food!

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:48.503
Oh...

00:06:48.503 --> 00:06:49.937
You flatter us.

00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:52.473
But I'm sure it's not
that much better than Slifer's.

00:06:54.008 --> 00:06:56.044
Trust me, the closest
  we get to lobster

00:06:56.044 --> 00:06:57.712
is our dorm
  cat's breath!

00:06:57.712 --> 00:06:59.314
Speaking of
bottom-dwellers,

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:00.315
what were you talking
to Crowler

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:01.883
about back
at the game?

00:07:01.883 --> 00:07:04.986
Actually, he wants me
to test to be an Obelisk.

00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:06.254
Are you serious?

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.389
Is that why you were
  cleaning up your room?

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:09.757
'Cause you're
  switchin' dorms?

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:14.062
Well, you deserve it,
  congrats, Bastion!

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:15.029
Again, you
flatter me...

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:16.030
You're good, man.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.498
Come on.
  You're awesome.

00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:19.801
I saw you duel during
  the entrance exams.

00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:22.270
You kicked that
  duel proctor's butt.

00:07:29.177 --> 00:07:32.213
You'll totally pass Crowler's
  test and be an Obelisk Blue!

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:33.614
(both)
  And we can say we
  knew you when!

00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:34.615
Well, thank you.

00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:35.616
You're welcome.

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:36.617
Now if you'll
  excuse me...

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:43.424
<i>(Chosaku)</i>
<i>Got it, Chazz?</i>

00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:44.659
(Chazz)
  Yeah...

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.027
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:48.363
I said, yes,
  I understand.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:49.530
<i>Well, you</i>
<i>had better.</i>

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.566
<i>The Princeton brothers</i>
<i>have a plan.</i>

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:52.867
<i>Your brother</i>
<i>and I are following</i>

00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:54.802
<i>through with our</i>
<i>ends of it.</i>

00:07:54.802 --> 00:07:56.204
<i>And you had better</i>
<i>be following</i>

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:57.739
<i>through with</i>
<i>yours, Chazz.</i>

00:07:57.739 --> 00:07:59.707
Come one, just think
of it, little bro.

00:07:59.707 --> 00:08:01.442
The worlds
of politics...

00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:02.577
finance...

00:08:02.577 --> 00:08:04.178
and Duel Monsters!

00:08:04.178 --> 00:08:05.980
If we control
them all,

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.051
then we will
control the entire world!

00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:11.853
So be the best.

00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:14.756
The future of the Princeton
  family depends on it.

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:15.923
It depends on you!

00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:21.763
(Chazz)
  Be the best?

00:08:21.763 --> 00:08:23.331
How can I be
  the best?

00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:26.167
With lucky punks
  like these out there?

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.635
What is this?

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:28.703
Bastion's heading off

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:30.405
to the Slifer dorm
  for the night?

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:31.506
Hmm...

00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:33.541
Then his dorm
  room'll be all empty...

00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:38.579
(snoring)

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:41.149
Hey, Sy, what's
  the Ra doing here?

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:44.619
He painted his room today,
 so we let him crash here.

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:46.754
But, Syrus,
  he's a Ra Yellow.

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:47.922
What if he wakes up

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:49.157
and wants to
  duel one of us,

00:08:49.157 --> 00:08:50.458
or make fun of
  one of us,

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:52.026
how do you know
  we can trust him?

00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:53.594
Relax, Chumley,
he's cool.

00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:55.563
I mean, he let us
eat at the Ra meal hall.

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:56.564
Oh.

00:08:56.564 --> 00:08:57.598
He can have my bed
  if he wants.

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:00.935
♪

00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:06.174
Jaden!

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:08.476
Jaden, wake up!

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:10.478
What is it,
Ms. Dorothy?

00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:12.613
I was at the docks
  unloading some goods near

00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:15.116
the shore, then,
  I saw them...

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:17.051
Cards tossed
  everywhere!

00:09:17.051 --> 00:09:18.052
Tossed?

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.088
Careful now, boys!

00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:24.392
(Jaden)
  That's Ring Of Destruction!

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:26.327
(Syrus)
And Vorse Raider!

00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:29.263
Bastion, these are
  all of your cards!

00:09:29.263 --> 00:09:30.631
It's my own fault.

00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:32.300
This deck was in the desk
  I moved to

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.101
the hallway yesterday
  when we were painting.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.572
Who would do
  something like this?

00:09:37.572 --> 00:09:39.240
Someone who doesn't
want you to advance

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.742
to Obelisk Blue,
that's who.

00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:45.012
I mean, this was your
deck and it's totally ruined!

00:09:45.012 --> 00:09:49.116
Ah man, what in the world are
you gonna do now, Bastion?

00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:51.452
Your promotion exam
is in less than an hour!

00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:58.381
(Crowler)
  Bastion, you've made it!

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:01.184
Oh, and I see you've brought
  some friends.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.054
I hope you duel better
than the company you keep.

00:10:05.489 --> 00:10:06.490
Wait a sec.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.191
Chazz is your
  test opponent?

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.459
Bastion.

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.529
Then he must've been the one
  that tossed your cards!

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.763
Pardon?

00:10:13.763 --> 00:10:14.898
I don't know what
he's talking about,

00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:17.167
Dr. Crowler, I didn't
do a thing.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.368
(Alexis)
  Oh, is that so?

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.437
Zane?

00:10:20.437 --> 00:10:21.538
Alexis?

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.807
I saw you,
  Chazz.

00:10:23.807 --> 00:10:25.642
This morning
  by the water.

00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:27.978
You dumped them
  in and ran off.

00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:31.781
(all gasping)

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:33.183
I normally wouldn't
  snitch, but you

00:10:33.183 --> 00:10:35.151
don't mess with
  someone's deck.

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:36.553
Yeah, no joke!

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.687
That's low for
  even you!

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:38.989
Aw, come on...

00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:41.525
Who's to say I wasn't throwing
away my own cards?

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:44.694
I guess Bastion and I just
have similar decks, that's all.

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:45.896
Liar!

00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:47.564
No one calls me
a liar,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.466
and no one
calls me a thief!

00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:50.934
Fine, then
  you're not.

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:53.103
Let's just have our duel,
  shall we?

00:10:53.103 --> 00:10:54.304
But how?

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:57.007
A good duelist always has
  a spare deck.

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:58.275
Or a few of them.

00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:00.877
After all, you saw all
  of my different formulas.

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:04.814
Well, they were for all
of my different dueling decks!

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:08.351
And each one of them is as
  powerful as the next!

00:11:09.553 --> 00:11:10.554
Yeah, well, you can
go ahead

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:12.923
and have your
six stinking decks!

00:11:12.923 --> 00:11:15.158
'Cause all I need is
this one!

00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:16.159
Now let's
start this!

00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:19.763
I thought that you
  would never ask, Chazz.

00:11:21.197 --> 00:11:22.198
Duel Disk on!

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:26.169
You're just a problem
  to be solved, Chazz.

00:11:26.169 --> 00:11:27.637
A theorem
  to be cracked.

00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:28.738
You're finished!

00:11:28.738 --> 00:11:29.973
So bring it on!

00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:31.308
(both)
  Duel!

00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:34.377
Hope you're ready, 'cause
here comes the hurt!

00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:36.146
I summon
Chthonian Soldier!

00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:42.819
Then, a card facedown
and that'll do for now.

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.354
Oh, will it now?

00:11:44.354 --> 00:11:46.890
Sounds like Bastion's got
  something up his sleeve.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.258
He works quickly.

00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:50.627
I summon Hydrogeddon
  in attack mode!

00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:53.830
Rise, Hydrogeddon!

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:56.166
(growling)

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:01.805
Now, attack
  Chthonian Soldier...

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:02.939
with Hydro Gust!

00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:03.940
Destroy him!

00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.116
Thanks,
you just activated my

00:12:13.116 --> 00:12:15.552
Chthonian Soldier's
special ability!

00:12:15.552 --> 00:12:17.354
It causes you to
take the same amount

00:12:17.354 --> 00:12:19.189
of damage to your life
points that I did!

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:20.357
Not bad.

00:12:20.357 --> 00:12:22.659
Bastion sure walked
  right into that one.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.528
I activate a special
  ability also.

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.298
You see, Chazz,
  when Hydrogeddon successfully

00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:30.000
destroys a monster
  in battle,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.668
I'm allowed
  to immediately summon

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.436
another Hydrogeddon
  from my deck!

00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:35.872
So rise!

00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:36.873
Hydrogeddon!

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.111
(growling)

00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:43.613
And, my battle
  phase still continues.

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:45.181
Which means I can
  now wage a direct

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.183
attack against
  you, Chazz!

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.119
So go, Hydrogeddon!

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:50.086
Hydro Gust!

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:52.489
(yelling)

00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:01.531
You'll pay for that!

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.200
I activate my trap card
Call Of The Haunted.

00:13:05.602 --> 00:13:09.172
With it, I can summon one
monster from my graveyard!

00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:10.707
And the monster
 I summon is...

00:13:12.242 --> 00:13:13.243
That's right!

00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:14.711
Chthonian Soldier!

00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:20.617
Next I'll activate the spell
card Inferno Reckless Summon.

00:13:20.617 --> 00:13:22.552
It allows us both
to summon in attack mode

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:26.056
any monsters from our deck
hand and graveyard

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.557
that are the same
as the monsters

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:28.892
we already
have on the field.

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:32.762
(Alexis)
  It makes no sense.

00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:34.998
It doesn't matter how many
  of those Chazz brings out,

00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:36.833
they still won't
  have enough attack points

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.802
to beat those
  Hydrogeddons.

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:40.704
Not by themselves,
they won't.

00:13:40.704 --> 00:13:44.274
I activate the equip spell
 card Chthonian Alliance!

00:13:44.274 --> 00:13:46.876
The monster equipped with
 this card gains 800 attack

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:49.846
points for every monster
that has the same name as him.

00:13:49.846 --> 00:13:51.948
That brings his attack point
total to...

00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:57.387
Well, you're
the math nerd.

00:13:57.387 --> 00:13:58.922
You can figure
it out!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.091
Attack,
Chthonian Soldier!

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.230
Oh no!

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.132
Aw, Bastion's
  life points have gone

00:14:09.132 --> 00:14:10.867
down by more
  than half!

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:12.402
He's losing the duel!

00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:13.403
Bravo!

00:14:13.403 --> 00:14:14.504
Good show!

00:14:14.504 --> 00:14:16.139
But it will be
  short-lived!

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:17.974
Rise Oxygeddon!

00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:19.909
Now attack the
  1,200 attack points

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.679
Chthonian Soldier with
  Vapor Stream!

00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:27.350
Forget?

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.352
When my Soldier's
destroyed, you take

00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:30.920
the same damage
as me!

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.355
Some whiz
kid you are!

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.526
My turn's not
  through.

00:14:36.526 --> 00:14:39.863
Next, my Hydrogeddon attacks
  another of your Soldiers!

00:14:44.768 --> 00:14:47.971
That damage is still all
going back to you, loser!

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:50.607
(Syrus)
  Aw man, why does Bastion
  keep attacking?

00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:52.175
He's only hurting himself.

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:53.843
Nah, he's fine!

00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:55.645
Bastion's playing
smart.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.948
The Chthonian Soldier
with the equip

00:14:58.948 --> 00:15:01.851
magic card has
3,600 attack points.

00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.553
Bastion would have to
 summon an incredibly

00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:05.889
powerful monster
 to destroy him.

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:06.990
Unless, however...

00:15:10.026 --> 00:15:11.161
(Syrus)
  Wait, I see!

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.729
Unless he takes out
  the other Chthonians

00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:15.198
and lowers the big one's
  attack points!

00:15:15.198 --> 00:15:17.600
Right, Sy, so if Bastion's
  gonna beat that thing,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.536
he's gotta give
  up some life points.

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:23.368
Last, I'll place
  a facedown card!

00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:24.369
And that
  will do for now.

00:15:25.437 --> 00:15:26.438
Will it?

00:15:26.438 --> 00:15:28.540
I wouldn't be so sure,
Whiz-Kid.

00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:32.544
I'm sacrificing Chthonian
Soldier and all the cards

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:36.915
in my hand in order to
summon Infernal Incinerator!

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:38.917
Didn't see that coming,
did you?

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:41.353
(laughing)

00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:42.554
Infernal Incinerator?

00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:49.962
(laughing)

00:15:49.962 --> 00:15:51.463
Better break out
 your calculator

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:53.465
'cause if you can't find
a formula to beat this guy

00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:54.700
this turn, you're toast!

00:15:58.926 --> 00:16:00.427
Face it, Bastion!

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:01.762
You don't
stand a chance against

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:03.597
the Infernal Incinerator!

00:16:03.597 --> 00:16:06.467
Especially since his
attack points increase by 200

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:09.203
for every monster you have
out on the field!

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:11.705
That thing has
  3,400 attack points?

00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:13.574
That means no matter which
  monster receives

00:16:13.574 --> 00:16:15.342
the attack,
  Bastion's finished!

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:19.280
Now, Infernal Incinerator
attack with Firestorm Blast!

00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:21.479
Bastion!

00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:25.583
I activate
  my trap!

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:26.951
Amorphous barrier!

00:16:29.854 --> 00:16:31.423
When I have three
  or more monsters

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:32.924
on my side
  of the field,

00:16:32.924 --> 00:16:34.926
this trap negates my
  opponent's attack

00:16:34.926 --> 00:16:36.761
and ends the battle.

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.563
But nice try,
  Chazz.

00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:39.631
Aw, so what?

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:40.932
One turn.

00:16:40.932 --> 00:16:43.768
That's all it buys you,
then you'll be all mine!

00:16:43.768 --> 00:16:46.337
I'm afraid there
  won't be a next turn.

00:16:46.337 --> 00:16:47.839
What?

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.207
You heard me.

00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:52.911
And I activate
  the spell card Bonding H2O!

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:56.081
I sacrifice two Hydrogeddons

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:59.584
and one Oxygeddon and summon
  Water Dragon!

00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:04.756
(growling)

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:06.893
And since
  the number of monsters

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:08.861
on my side of the field
  decreased,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.831
your Infernal Incinerator's
  attack points decrease.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.967
Doesn't matter,
my monster's attack points

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:15.969
are still higher
than yours.

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:17.470
Better double-check
  your work.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.607
Because I've
  already done all the math.

00:17:20.607 --> 00:17:21.941
All the math,
you mean that...

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.710
Bastion's had all
  this planned

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.044
out since
  the very start?

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.480
(yelling)

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:36.389
No, his
attack points!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.359
Indeed, that's Water
  Dragon's special ability!

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.394
You see, when he's
  out on the field,

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.096
the attack
  points of Fire Attribute

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:46.099
and Pyro-Type monsters
  automatically become zero.

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:48.301
Now, Water Dragon,
  attack!

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.302
Tidal Blast!

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:01.547
A well-played duel,
  Chazz, but not well enough.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:02.749
Pure luck!

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.551
You drew a lucky card
and stumbled into the win.

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.552
That's all!

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.954
Perhaps.

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:09.722
But luck
  favors the prepared.

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.224
And I was prepared
  to beat you

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.092
with a half dozen
  other cards, as well.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.227
Sorry.

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:17.196
You would have lost the duel
  one way or another.

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.865
But deny it
  if you want.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:19.866
Just like you denied

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.834
throwing my deck
  into the ocean.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:22.835
Yeah?

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:23.936
Prove it.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.838
Well, if you
  insist.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.408
Here, a card
  I fished out.

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:30.543
With a formula
  I wrote on it.

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:32.278
I suppose you
  could've written it,

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.047
but then the math would've
  probably be wrong,

00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:35.715
and it's not.

00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:39.218
Chazz, you stole, you lied,
  you cheated, you lost.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.853
You deserve
  to be demoted.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:44.257
This can't be...

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:45.692
(Crowler)
  Bastion Misawa!

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:48.761
Congratulations and welcome
  to Obelisk Blue!

00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:49.796
No.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.631
I must decline
  that invitation.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.632
What?

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.733
But what for?

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.468
When I first
  arrived at the Academy

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.770
I decided I would only
  enter Obelisk Blue

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.505
when I became
  the number-one student

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.074
in the freshman class.

00:19:01.074 --> 00:19:03.576
Jaden, of all
the new freshman...

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:05.244
I think that student
is you.

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.379
Hey, thanks!

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:08.581
Does that mean you wanna
  settle this right here?

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.416
I mean, seeing you
  guys duel

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.618
really made me want
  to get my game on!

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:15.521
Sorry, but not now.

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.522
Why not?

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:17.790
Because I have
 a lot of work

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.525
to do
before I duel you.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.761
Many formulas to write,
theorems to solve,

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.062
equations to balance.

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:25.998
You're a good duelist, Jaden,
and I plan to be ready.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.366
Smart move!

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.302
He didn't have to
  prepare for me.

00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:32.205
He won with just
  one day's notice!

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:34.574
Don't worry, Jaden, soon
  my dorm room walls

00:19:34.574 --> 00:19:36.309
will be filled
  with new strategies

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.211
and we will have
  our duel.

00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.712
Just be prepared
  for it to turn out

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:40.980
like that ball game.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.082
You know, the one
  where I struck you out?

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:44.984
You just keep dreamin',
  Bastion!

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:48.121
Baseball's a pastime,
  but dueling's my life!

00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:49.322
Until then, pal!

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:50.356
All right...

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.390
Until then it is!

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:54.060
(laughing)

00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.398
(growling)
  (growling)

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:03.269
Hmm...
  Ha!
