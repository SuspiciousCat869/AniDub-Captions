00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:05.989
WHO WILL REPRESENT OUR
MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ACADEMY

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.726
IN THE ANNUAL SCHOOL DUEL?

00:00:08.726 --> 00:00:14.098
INTRODUCING FIRST
FROM THE RA DORM--
BASTION MISAWA!

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:18.135
AND THEN FROM SLIFER--
SOME KID.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.169
GOOD LUCK, PAL!

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.371
WITH THE DECK
I'VE PREPARED,

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.172
I DON'T NEED LUCK.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.274
YEAH? WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.478
I ACTIVATE
THE ALL-POWERFUL
WATER DRAGON!

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:29.613
AVIAN AND BUBBLEMAN,
GET READY TO MERGE

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.382
WITH SPARKMAN
TO CREATE

00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:34.284
THE ONE AND ONLY
ELEMENTAL HERO
TEMPEST!

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.253
I DON'T THINK SO,
JADEN.

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:39.385
GO, CURSED SEAL
OF THE FORBIDDEN SPELL!

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:41.954
I CAN NEGATE
YOUR SPELL CARD
AND DESTROY IT.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:43.956
HUH? UNH!

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.659
AND YOU CAN NO LONGER
USE THE CARD

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.027
THAT WAS DESTROYED
BY THIS EFFECT

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.795
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE DUEL.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.565
WAIT! I CAN'T USE
POLYMERIZATION
ANYMORE?

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.667
NO FUSIONS!
BUT THAT'S HOW JADEN

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.035
WINS ALL HIS DUELS!

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:58.037
COMPUTE IT
ANY WHICH WAY YOU LIKE,

00:00:58.037 --> 00:00:59.906
BUT THE ANSWER
WILL ALWAYS
COME OUT THE SAME.

IF I CAN JUST CRACK
THIS PASSWORD

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:12.929
I'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF
DUEL ACADEMY'S STUDENT FILES...

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.433

I DON'T BUY IT.

00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:41.858
THESE MUST BE
THE MISSING STUDENTS.

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:44.461
AND THE ACADEMY MUST BE
TRYING TO COVER IT UP.

00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:47.163
I SMELL A FRONT PAGE SCANDAL...

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:50.000
PLUS A MAJOR PAYDAY
FOR THE REPORTER WHO
BREAKS THE STORY!

IT'S NOT ALL BAD.

WELL...PERHAPS
WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED
BASTION.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.202
HE'S BEEN PLAYING
THIS LIKE A PRO.

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.305
AFTER ALL...
WITH JUST ONE CARD...

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:30.373
HE'S ALL BUT DISARMED

00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:33.009
COME ON...HE'S
JUST TAKEN AWAY
JADEN'S ABILITY

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.612
TO USE FUSION MONSTERS,
THAT'S ALL.

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:37.447
BUT THAT MIGHT
BE ENOUGH.

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:41.951
FUSION MONSTERS ARE HOW
JADEN WINS ALL HIS DUELS.

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.622
THAT'S IT, BASTION,
SHOW THIS SLIFER SLACKING

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:48.058
SHOW HIM HE DOESN'T BELONG
IN THE SCHOOL DUEL!

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:50.827

THIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:57.334

GONNA SWITCH SPARKMAN
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:03:57.334 --> 00:03:59.002
AND I'LL LEAVE IT
AT THAT.

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:04.107

WHEN YOU'VE BEEN STRIPPED

OF THE ABILITY
TO USE YOUR FAVORITE
MONSTERS, EH, JADEN?

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:11.047
WRONG! THERE'S
LOADS TO DO--

00:04:11.047 --> 00:04:12.582
LIKE FINDIN'
A NEW PLAN.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.185
IT'LL BE TOUGH,
BUT I'M UP FOR IT!

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.153
AND THEN, BASTION,
IT'LL BE ALL

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.558
YES, WHEN YOU WIN.

WHEN THIS IS SUMMONED,

00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:42.373
I MUST SEND ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK TO THE GRAVE.

BUT THEN, IF MATHEMATICIAN
HAPPENS TO BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE...

00:04:46.277 --> 00:04:48.012
I CAN TAKE A CARD
FROM MY DECK...

THAT DUELING IS
NOTHING MORE

00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:11.394
THAN A NUMBERS GAME?

00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:14.431
A NUMBERS GAME THAT I HAVE
CALCULATED EFFECTIVELY

00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:16.132
AND YOU HAVE NOT.

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:18.134
YOUR DEFEAT IS
IMMINENT, JADEN.

00:08:18.134 --> 00:08:20.537
NOW...MY DRAW!

00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:22.172
AND WITH IT,
THE EFFECT
A' MY SPELL

00:08:22.172 --> 00:08:25.775
MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE
ACTIVATES!

00:08:25.775 --> 00:08:27.043
CUZ A' THIS
CARD'S EFFECT,

00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:28.378
DURIN' YOUR
STANDBY PHASE,

00:08:28.378 --> 00:08:29.846
I'M ALLOWED
TO DRAW...

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:32.816
AND...KEEP DRAWIN'
TILL I HAVE
FOUR CARDS!

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:35.118
AND NOW I'LL REVEAL
MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:37.554
EMERGENCY
PROVISIONS!

00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:40.323
NOW, ALLOW ME TO
EXPLAIN HOW IT
WORKS, BASTION.

00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:43.593
BY SENDING ONE SPELL
OR TRAP ON MY FIELD
TO THE GRAVE...

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:46.162
I GAIN A THOUSAND
LIFE POINTS.

00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:49.365
SO, ADIOS...
MIRAGE OF NIGHTMARE!

00:08:52.168 --> 00:08:53.970
NOT A BAD MOVE.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.272
I MEAN, FIRST,
HE PLAYS MIRAGE...

00:08:56.272 --> 00:08:58.508
THEN DITCHES IT
BEFORE IT HURTS HIM!

00:08:58.508 --> 00:09:02.545
UM...NOT THAT I CARE ABOUT
THIS DUEL OR ANYTHING...

00:09:02.545 --> 00:09:05.115
ANYWAY...

00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:06.116
HMM.

00:09:06.116 --> 00:09:07.517
QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

00:09:07.517 --> 00:09:08.718
HE'S SWITCHED
HIS STRATEGY

00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:10.353
AND IS STILL
PLAYING WELL.

00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:13.823
YEAH...
BUT CAN HE KEEP IT UP?

00:09:13.823 --> 00:09:15.959
YOU'RE SIMPLY POSTPONING
THE INEVITABLE,

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:18.661
YOUR DECK'S A PROBLEM
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SOLVED.

00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.762
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:09:19.762 --> 00:09:21.364
PERHAPS THIS WILL
CONVINCE YOU THEN--

00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:22.866
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD,

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.767
POT OF GREED
FROM MY HAND!

00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:27.470
DUE TO ITS EFFECT,
I DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.739
FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE NOW
TEN CARDS STACKED

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:32.509
ABOVE CARBONEDDON
IN THE GRAVEYARD.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.079
BUT HE CAN HANDLE
THE PRESSURE.

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:39.249
IN FACT,
HE THRIVES ON IT.

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:41.818
BECAUSE NOW, DUE
TO THE IMMENSE
GRAVITATIONAL FORCE

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:44.821
ON CARBONEDDON,
HE CHANGES INTO DIAMOND!

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.624
AND THAT LET'S ME ACTIVATE
HIS SPECIAL EFFECT!

00:09:47.624 --> 00:09:49.159
BY REMOVING
THIS CARD FROM PLAY,

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:53.229
I CAN NOW SUMMON HYOZANRYU,
THE DIAMOND DRAGON!

00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:56.099
[SCREECHES]

00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:01.504
NOW, HYOZANRYU
ATTACK BUBBLEMAN!

00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:04.274
DIAMOND DEVASTATOR!

00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:09.846
WHOOPSIE, BASTION!

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:11.347
WHEN A MONSTER
WITH BUBBLE BLASTER

00:10:11.347 --> 00:10:12.882
IS BEATEN
IN BATTLE...

00:10:12.882 --> 00:10:15.985
IT'S THE BLASTER
THAT GETS DESTROYED,
NOT THE MONSTER.

00:10:15.985 --> 00:10:18.254
BUT NOW THAT YOUR
BLASTER'S GONE,

00:10:18.254 --> 00:10:22.089
WHAT WILL PROTECT HIM
FROM THE WATER DRAGON?!

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.588
TIDAL BLAST!

00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:25.456
[ROARING]

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:36.160
[GROANING]

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.095
AW, MAN!

00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:42.397
GOOO, TRAP CARD!

00:10:42.397 --> 00:10:44.099
HERO SIGNAL!

00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:49.337
THIS ACTIVATES WHEN
ONE A' MY MONSTERS
IS DESTROYED!

00:10:49.337 --> 00:10:51.506
NOW, BASTION...
I CAN SUMMON
A MONSTER

00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:53.208
WITH ELEMENTAL HERO
IN ITS NAME

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:55.177
FROM MY DECK
OR FROM MY HAND!

00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:58.547
AND I CHOOSE
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN!

00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:01.216
[GROWLS]

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:02.584
PHEW.

00:11:02.584 --> 00:11:05.820
MY...YOU JUST WON'T GIVE UP,
WILL YOU, JADEN?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.056
YOU CERTAINLY ARE
ONE STUBBORN DUELIST.

00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:09.591
THANKS, BASTION.

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:11.993
AT LEAST, I THINK
THAT THAT WAS
A COMPLIMENT.

00:11:11.993 --> 00:11:14.563
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:19.201
THIS IS REALLY
GETTING GOOD!

00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:21.036
I FORGOT HOW MUCH FUN
DUELING COULD BE!

00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:22.370
HERE GOES...

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.838
HYAH!

00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:25.874
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL...

00:11:25.874 --> 00:11:27.943
THE WARRIOR
RETURNING ALIVE!

00:11:27.943 --> 00:11:29.344
WITH THIS
CARD'S EFFECT...

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:32.414
I CAN TAKE ONE
WARRIOR-TYPE MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVE...

00:11:32.414 --> 00:11:34.416
AND ADD IT STRAIGHT
TO MY HAND.

00:11:34.416 --> 00:11:36.518
AND I'LL PICK...
BUBBLEMAN

00:11:36.518 --> 00:11:39.387
AND SUMMON HIM
TO THE FIELD!

00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:42.157
THEN I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD:
BUBBLE SHUFFLE!

00:11:42.157 --> 00:11:43.892
WITH THIS, I CAN
CHANGE BUBBLEMAN

00:11:43.892 --> 00:11:45.760
AND ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS...

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.896
FROM ATTACK MODE
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.568
OH, AND THEN IF I
SACRIFICE BUBBLEMAN

00:11:53.568 --> 00:11:55.203
WHILE HE'S
IN DEFENSE MODE?

00:11:55.203 --> 00:11:57.038
I'M ALLOWED TO
SUMMON ANY MONSTER

00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:59.908
WITH ELEMENTAL HERO
IN ITS NAME
FROM MY HAND.

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:01.977
AND GUESS WHAT,
BASTION?!

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.646
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO!

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:10.318
BUBBLEMAN, MOVE OVER
FOR ELEMENTAL HERO
BLADEDGE!

00:12:10.318 --> 00:12:13.054
THOSE FUSION MONSTERS
MAY BE JADEN'S BEST...

00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:14.990
BUT THAT THING IS
A CLOSE SECOND.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.758
AND THIS SHOULD BE
A CLOSE MATCH UP!

00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:18.660
AW, JADEN?!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.396
THAT BLADEDGE
ONLY HAS 2600
ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:21.396 --> 00:12:23.798
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO BEAT THAT
WATER DRAGON!

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:24.966
HE'S RIGHT!

00:12:24.966 --> 00:12:29.504
IT IS...
WHEN I USE THIS!

00:12:29.504 --> 00:12:32.140
THE FIELD SPELL
SKYSCRAPER!

00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:40.015
HUH?

00:12:43.018 --> 00:12:45.053
OHH.

00:12:45.053 --> 00:12:48.523
NOW WHEN A MONSTER
WITH ELEMENTAL HERO
IN ITS NAME BATTLES

00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:51.526
IF IT HAS LESS
ATTACK POINTS
THAN YOUR MONSTER...

00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:53.895
IT GAINS A THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:56.898 --> 00:12:58.867
SO GO, BLADEDGE!

00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:02.637
ATTACK WATER DRAGON
WITH SLICE
AND DICE ATTACK!!

00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:11.413
NOW BLADEDGE'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:13:11.413 --> 00:13:13.982
SEE, IF HE ATTACKS
A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE...

00:13:13.982 --> 00:13:15.216
AND HAS MORE
ATTACK POINTS

00:13:15.216 --> 00:13:17.185
THAN YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:13:17.185 --> 00:13:19.120
WELL THEN...
THE DIFFERENCE
IS DEALT

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.389
DIRECTLY TO YOU
AS DAMAGE!

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.926
[GROANING]

00:13:24.926 --> 00:13:27.696
WELL, MY DRAGON HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY, TOO.

00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:30.965
FOR YOU SEE, JADEN...
WHEN WATER DRAGON'S DESTROYED,

00:13:30.965 --> 00:13:33.935
I CAN SUMMON
ONE OXYGEDDON
AND TWO HYDROGEDDONS

00:13:33.935 --> 00:13:35.337
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:13:35.337 --> 00:13:38.640
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
A TRAP CARD! LAST MAGNET!

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.776
THIS ACTIVATES WHENEVER
ONE OF MY MONSTERS
IS DESTROYED.

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:43.712
THEN, IT EQUIPS ONTO
THE MONSTER

00:13:43.712 --> 00:13:45.780
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DESTRUCTION

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.516
AND CAUSES IT TO LOSE
800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:49.684
ERR.

00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:51.519
YEAH, WELL CLAYMAN
CAN STILL CLOBBER

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.655
AT PEAK PERFORMANCE!

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:56.091
'SPECIALLY WITH
SKYSCRAPER STILL
OUT ON THE FIELD!

00:13:56.091 --> 00:14:00.195
NOW, ATTACK OXYGEDDON
WITH CLAY CLOBBERER!

00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:02.130
[SCREECHING]

00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:07.302
OH, WOW!

00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:09.637
THIS IS ONE
VERY LISHUS DUEL!

00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:11.706
AND IT'S NOT
SLOWING DOWN!

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:13.475
GOOD SHOW, JADEN.

00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:15.877
I DO WHAT I CAN.

00:14:15.877 --> 00:14:19.114
HUH?

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:21.783
SKYSCRAPER...
THE CARD THAT RUINED ME...

00:14:21.783 --> 00:14:26.154
THE CARD THAT MADE ME
PUT DOWN MY DECK FOR GOOD...

00:14:26.154 --> 00:14:28.456
ALRIGHT, IT'S MY TURN!

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:32.260
FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
LITMUS DOOM RITUAL!

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.462
NOW, FROM MY FIELD
AND HAND,

00:14:34.462 --> 00:14:36.898
I MUST SACRIFICE
A TOTAL OF 8 STARS
WORTH OF MONSTERS,

00:14:36.898 --> 00:14:40.568
AND THEN I CAN SUMMON
LITMUS DOOM SWORDSMAN!

00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:48.576
BUT HE HAS
ZERO ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:50.912
DOOM SWORDSMAN
ISN'T AFFECTED BY TRAPS

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.781
NOR CAN HE BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:55.817
ESSENTIALLY,
HE'S INVINCIBLE.

00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:59.187
ALSO...WHEN THERE HAPPENS
TO BE A TRAP CARD OUT
ON THE FIELD...

00:14:59.187 --> 00:15:01.790
JUST AS LAST MAGNET
IS RIGHT NOW...

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.193
HIS ATTACK AND DEFENSE
POINTS BECOME 3000!

00:15:15.203 --> 00:15:17.906
SO NOW,
LITMUS DOOM SWORDSMAN...

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:21.843
GIVE BLADEDGE A TASTE
OF YOUR STEEL!

00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:24.746

WELL DONE!

00:15:32.954 --> 00:15:35.056
NOW, HYOZANRYU,
MAKE ME JUST AS PROUD

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.491
AND ATTACK CLAYMAN!

00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:46.601
THERE'S MORE.

00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:48.536
NEXT, I PLAY
FROM MY HAND...

00:15:48.536 --> 00:15:52.607
THE MIGHTY SPELL CARD...
A WINGBEAT OF GIANT DRAGON!

00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:56.010
NOW, BY RETURNING
ONE LEVEL 5-OR-ABOVE
DRAGON-TYPE MONSTER

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.979
ON MY FIELD
BACK TO MY HAND,

00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.249
ALL SPELL AND TRAP CARDS
ON THE FIELD ARE DESTROYED!

00:16:01.249 --> 00:16:05.153
WHICH MEANS SKYSCRAPER
IS NOW DEMOLISHED!

00:16:05.153 --> 00:16:06.154
AAH!

00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:16.564
FINALLY, I'LL END
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:18.666
AW, MAN!
THIS IS BAD!

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.068
JADEN'S LOST
HIS MONSTERS

00:16:20.068 --> 00:16:21.569
AND HIS
FIELD SPELL CARD!

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:23.571
HE'S DEFENSELESS
OUT THERE!

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.715
WELL, I'LL TELL YA,
BASTION.

00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:36.251
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER HAD
A MORE FUN DUEL!

00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:37.686
GLAD YOU THINK SO!

00:16:37.686 --> 00:16:38.753
UHH...

00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:40.789
I'VE ENJOYED IT
AS WELL, JADEN.

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:42.524
AND WILL CONTINUE TO.

00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:44.726
ESPECIALLY
WHEN I BEAT YOU!

00:16:44.726 --> 00:16:47.229
ACTUALLY...
I'M ENDING THIS NOW!

00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:49.931
HERE GOES...

00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:51.266
SWEETNESS!

00:16:51.266 --> 00:16:53.568
I'M GONNA SUMMON
A NEW ELEMENTAL HERO!

00:16:53.568 --> 00:16:55.637
AND HERE HE IS...

00:16:55.637 --> 00:16:57.872
ELEMENTAL HERO
WILDHEART!

00:16:57.872 --> 00:16:59.774
[GROWLS]

00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:00.976
NEW ONE?

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:03.078
WELL, HE WON'T MAKE MUCH
OF AN IMPRESSION!

00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:04.846
I'M ACTIVATING A TRAP!

00:17:04.846 --> 00:17:06.481
SPIRIT BARRIER!

00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.950
NOW, AS LONG AS I HAVE
A MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.418
SPIRIT BARRIER
WILL CHANGE

00:17:10.418 --> 00:17:13.755
ANY BATTLE DAMAGE
DONE TO ZERO!

00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:16.791
NUH-UH! TRAPS DON'T
WORK ON WILDHEART!

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.360
IS THAT SO?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.894
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT'S A GOOD THING

00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:22.530
THAT THEY STILL WORK
ON MY SWORDSMAN THEN.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.499
REMEMBER, WHEN
A TRAP CARD'S OUT,

00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:26.268
HIS ATTACK POINTS
GO UP!

00:17:26.268 --> 00:17:30.372
THEY SURE DO!
ALL THE WAY TO 3000!
NOT GOOD!

00:17:30.372 --> 00:17:32.440
NAH, IT'S ALL GOOD,
CUZ I PLAY

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.175
CYCLONE BOOMERANG!

00:17:34.175 --> 00:17:36.611
AND I'LL EQUIP
THIS SPELL CARD
ON WILDHEART,

00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:39.981
RAISING HIS
ATTACK POINTS
BY 500!

00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:41.616
BUT SO WHAT!

00:17:41.616 --> 00:17:42.817
HE'S STILL SHORT
A THOUSAND!

00:17:42.817 --> 00:17:44.119
YEAH, WHAT GIVES?!

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.453
[GASPS]

00:17:45.453 --> 00:17:46.655
YOU'LL SEE
WHAT GIVES

00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:49.557
WHEN THIS BOOMERANG
MAKES ITS RETURN TRIP!

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.599
AAH!

00:18:02.203 --> 00:18:05.373
PERFECT, NOW I PLAY
BOOMERANG'S EFFECT!

00:18:05.373 --> 00:18:07.742
SEE, WHEN THIS CARD
AND THE MONSTER
EQUIPPED WITH IT

00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:08.943
ARE SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:10.745
ALL SPELL AND TRAP
CARDS ON THE FIELD

00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:12.647
ARE AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROYED.

00:18:12.647 --> 00:18:14.749
AND THEN, FOR EVERY
ONE DESTROYED,

00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:16.518
YOU TAKE 500 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:18:16.518 --> 00:18:17.519
[GASPS]

00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:30.131
I GUESS WHEN IT CAME
TO JADEN YUKI,

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:32.367
BASTION
MISCALCULATED.

00:18:32.367 --> 00:18:34.536
I GUESS...
OR MAYBE SOME STRATEGIES

00:18:34.536 --> 00:18:35.770
YOU JUST CAN'T SOLVE...

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.871
Gerard: HE DID IT!

00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:38.773
WAY TO GO, JADEN!

00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:40.775
OH, WHADDA DUEL!

00:18:40.775 --> 00:18:44.346
HUH? HEH HEH.

00:18:44.346 --> 00:18:46.214
THANKS, JADEN.

00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:48.450
HEY...HMM.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.120
DOES THIS SLACKER
EVER LOSE?!

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.524
SO! THE WINNER...
IS JADEN YUKI!

00:18:56.524 --> 00:18:57.792
WELL DONE!

00:18:57.792 --> 00:19:01.963
YOU WILL BE DUEL ACADEMY'S
REP AT THE SCHOOL DUEL!

00:19:01.963 --> 00:19:03.164
WAY TO PLAY, JAY!
YEAH!

00:19:03.164 --> 00:19:05.900
GOOD JOB!

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.035
Bastion: INDEED.

00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:09.904
YOU BEAT ME FAIR
AND SQUARE, JADEN.

00:19:09.904 --> 00:19:11.506
RATHER, YOU BEAT
THIS DECK,

00:19:11.506 --> 00:19:14.275
BUT YOU CAN BE
ASSURED THAT THERE
WILL BE ANOTHER.

00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:16.544
AND ANOTHER DUEL,
I HOPE!

00:19:16.544 --> 00:19:17.746
'TIL THEN!

00:19:17.746 --> 00:19:19.647
YES, UNTIL THEN,
JADEN.

00:19:19.647 --> 00:19:23.585
HMM? UH, HMM. HA!

00:19:26.662 --> 00:19:28.397
HEY! YOU!

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:29.598
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT WAS
ASKING ME QUESTIONS

00:19:29.598 --> 00:19:31.033
AT THE ABANDONED DORM!

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:32.501
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?!

00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:34.069
WELL NOT
WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:35.437
WHAT?

00:19:35.437 --> 00:19:37.673
YOU SEE, I CAME
HERE LOOKING
FOR A STORY,

00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:40.576
BUT WHAT I FOUND WAS
SOMETHING VERY,
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:42.511
I FOUND THE DUELIST
INSIDE ME,

00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:43.946
THE DUELIST
I THOUGHT...

00:19:43.946 --> 00:19:45.481
WAS LONG GONE.

00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:47.016
LOOK,
I'M A REPORTER.

00:19:47.016 --> 00:19:48.550
A SLEAZY ONE,
I'LL ADMIT IT.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.886
I MAKE A LIVING OFF
DIGGING UP DIRT.

00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.021
BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS.

00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:53.422
I TOOK ON MONSTERS
AND SPELLS

00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:56.959
BEFORE I TOOK
TABLOID PICTURES.

00:19:56.959 --> 00:19:59.928
IT'S TRUE...I WAS...
A DUELIST...

00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:01.630
LIKE JADEN
AND BASTION.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.931
BUT I WASN'T
ANY GOOD.

00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:04.166
I GOT BEAT
ALL THE TIME.

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:05.467
THE MEMORIES
WERE AWFUL.

00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:07.036
BUT AFTER SEEING
TODAY'S MATCH?

00:20:07.036 --> 00:20:10.372
IT MADE ME REMEMBER WHAT
DUELING'S REALLY ABOUT.

00:20:10.372 --> 00:20:13.208
I HAD A GREAT LEAD
THAT I WAS GONNA SELL...

00:20:13.208 --> 00:20:16.712
ONE THAT WOULD'VE PROBABLY
RUINED DUEL ACADEMY.

00:20:16.712 --> 00:20:19.014
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
RUIN THIS PLACE.

00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:20.949
NOT NOW.

00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:22.151
HMM.

00:20:22.151 --> 00:20:24.853
NOW, I ONLY WANNA HELP.

00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:26.255
TO FIND THEM.

00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:28.457
ALL THE MISSING STUDENTS.

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:30.793
INCLUDING YOUR
BROTHER, ALEXIS.

00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:41.433
Syrus: I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU, JADEN!

00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:43.535
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
THAT SLIFER SLACKER'S

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.971
REPRESENTING US,
REPRESENTING ME!

00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:47.406
ALRIGHT!

00:20:47.406 --> 00:20:48.841
SCHOOL DUEL,
GET YOUR GAME ON,

00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:52.211
CUZ HERE I COME!
