SOUNDS LIKE TREE!

00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:17.595
NOW THEN...WHO DO WE KNOW
WHOSE NAME SOUNDS LIKE THAT.

00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:18.965
A HINT?

00:07:18.965 --> 00:07:21.205
SHE WORKS IN THE CAFETERIA.

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:22.375
YOU MEAN...?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.545
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:25.216
DOROTHY!

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:26.687
IT RHYMES WITH TREE!

00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:28.292
SHE'S A SHADOW RIDER!

00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:31.268
SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S TAKEN
OUT PROFESSOR BANNER!

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.270
OH!

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.607
AW, MAN...

00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:35.880
IT'S DOROTHY?!
SHE'S THE ONE?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.050
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.324
AND I'M GONNA CALL HER
ON IT RIGHT NOW!

00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:40.360
WHAT?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.730
SHADOW RIDER?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.035
HOW DO YOU RIDE A SHADOW?

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:44.539
IS THIS A CRANK CALL?

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.244
I'LL STAR SIXTY-NINE YOU!

00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:48.149
HELLO--ARE YOU THERE?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.565
OKAY, SO MAYBE...I WAS
JUST A LITTLE OFF.

00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:55.972
All: JUST A LITTLE OFF?!

00:07:55.972 --> 00:07:57.610
Chazz: LET'S KEEP DIGGING.

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.685
THIS A CLUE?

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:02.625
UH-UH. GUESS AGAIN.

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:04.463
HOW 'BOUT THIS?
ANYTHING?

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.268
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:08.875
COME ON, YOU GUYS HAVE
TO LOOK HARDER!

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:09.978
Chumley: SOME
BREAKFAST CRUMBS?

00:08:09.978 --> 00:08:11.216
TRY AGAIN!

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:12.486
Syrus: I FOUND
A BALL OF LINT!

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.589
YEAH RIGHT!

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:14.659
Jaden: TOENAIL CLIPPINGS?

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:16.196
UGH! GAG ME!

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.199
COME ON!

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.737
LOOK HARDER!

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:22.248
CHECK THIS OUT...

00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:25.691
OF COURSE--IT'S OBVIOUS!
THIS EXPLAINS IT ALL!

00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:27.362
WHAT? DO YOU
SEE ANOTHER TREE?

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:28.967
NO, THIS!

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.237
CHECK IT OUT!?

00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:31.708
IT'S THE MARK OF AMNAEL!

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:33.179
THE ONE WE LEARNED
IN CLASS!

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.349
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.188
SEE, NOW THIS IS A CLUE!

00:08:36.188 --> 00:08:38.594
I MEAN,
AFTER ALL...BANNER?

00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:40.835
HE'S SO INTO ALL OF
THAT ALCHEMY JUNK!

00:08:40.835 --> 00:08:42.373
THIS MUST BE WHERE HE IS!

00:08:42.373 --> 00:08:44.311
YEAH, AND IT'S IN
A FOREST, TOO!

00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:45.782
ONE WITH TREES.

00:08:45.782 --> 00:08:47.988
YA THINK MAYBE
THAT'S WHAT
THE NOTE MEANT?

00:08:47.988 --> 00:08:49.961
SHUT IT!

00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.599
Jaden: ALRIGHT!

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:54.674
LET THE RESCUE EXPEDITION
FOR PROFESSOR BANNER BEGIN!

00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:55.911
FOLLOW ME, GUYS!

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:57.181
FOLLOW YOU?!

00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:58.519
YEAH RIGHT,
I'M THE ONE

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:00.157
WHO FIGURED THIS
WHOLE THING OUT

00:09:00.157 --> 00:09:02.263
SO YOU GUYS
CAN FOLLOW ME!

00:09:02.263 --> 00:09:04.369
IF YOU CAN KEEP
UP, THAT IS!

00:09:06.308 --> 00:09:07.778
Syrus: SO, UH, CHAZZ?

00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:09.316
OTHER THAN FOLLOWING YOU.
WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE?

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:10.654
Chumley: YEAH.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:13.896
HOW DO WE FIND BANNER ONCE
WE GET TO THE ALCHEMY MARK?

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:14.966
EASY.

00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:17.272
WE FIND...HIS CAT, PHARAOH.

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:19.178
AND WITH THIS!

00:09:19.178 --> 00:09:21.384
CHAZZ, HAVEN'T YOU
TRIED THIS BEFORE?

00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:22.588
OOH, OOH!

00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:24.192
I HAVE AN IDEA!

00:09:24.192 --> 00:09:25.295
DO YOU?

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:26.633
WELL, WHAT IS
IT THEN?

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.204
WELL, CHAZZ.

00:09:28.204 --> 00:09:30.244
SINCE CALLING OUT FOR PHARAOH
HASN'T WORKED...LET'S GO

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:31.815
A DIFFERENT ROUTE!

00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:34.389
AND WHAT ROUTE
IS THAT?

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:35.926
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU!

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:39.336
THERE! PERFECT!

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:41.609
NOW PHARAOH WILL
THINK YOU'RE A CAT!

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:45.287
OF COURSE...YOU'LL HAVE TO
DEVELOP...A CONVINCING MEOW.

00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:46.958
TRY ONE.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.067
HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU
MY CLAWS INSTEAD!

00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:51.438
YOU BETTER RUN!

00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:53.076
MEOW, MEOW!

00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:09.423
ATTICUS?!

00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.680
NO...HE'S GONE!

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.828
ALRIGHT.
WHO'S THERE?!

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.075
WHERE'S MY BROTHER?!

00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:50.241
SO LET ME GUESS...
YOU'RE A SHADOW RIDER.

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:57.796
WELL LET'S GO.

00:10:57.796 --> 00:10:59.734
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU HAVE ATTICUS!

00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:03.078
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
HERE WITHOUT HIM.

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:05.418
NOW LET'S DUEL!

00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:08.092
HERE I COME, RIDER!

00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:11.301
FIRST!
I'LL PLAY THE SPELL...
POLYMERIZATION

00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:15.680
AND FUSE ETOILE
CYBER WITH BLADE SKATER
TO CREATE CYBER BLADER!

00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:20.495
YOU PICKED THE WRONG
KEY-KEEPER TO MESS WITH!

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.801
CYBER BLADER ATTACK!

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:29.721
A TRAP CARD?

00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:34.435
BLADER'S ATTACK
DIDN'T GO THROUGH.

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:35.738
NOT GOOD.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:39.917
BANNER? YOU AROUND?

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:41.890
PROFESSOR?! HELLO?!

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.093
AAH!

00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:44.196
HUH?
HUH?

00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:46.102
JADEN!! SNAKE!

00:11:46.102 --> 00:11:47.640
WE SAW A SNAKE!

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.177
SO WHOOP-DE-DOO!

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:51.751
WE ARE IN A FOREST,
YOU GUYS. YOU KNOW?

00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:52.820
NATURE.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.395
BUT THIS WASN'T
VERY NATURAL!

00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:03.451
Chumley: MOMMY!

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:39.522
OH NO...MY CYBER
BLADER'S GONE!

00:12:44.637 --> 00:12:48.114
WHICH MEANS...I'M
WIDE OPEN TO ATTACK!

00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:54.967
AAH!

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.045
Syrus: THIS AREA OF THE
FOREST SURE IS WEIRD.

00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:24.585
Jaden: YEAH,
FLYING SNAKES?

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:30.770
WE'LL FIND BANNER SOON.
I'M SURE!

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.006
I HOPE.

00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:34.179
BECAUSE I REALLY
MISS HIM, YOU KNOW?

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:36.018
ALL THE LITTLE THINGS HE DID.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.294
YOU MEAN IT?!

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:42.203
PLEASE, JADEN, WHAT'S
MINE...IS YOURS.

00:13:42.203 --> 00:13:44.676
ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT'S MINE IS
PORK FRIED RICE WITH A CHILI

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:48.320
SAUCE--YOUR FAVORITE!

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.329
NOW THAT'S A FRIEND.
DONTCHA THINK?

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:53.870
COURSE HE WAS
ALLERGIC TO CHILI SAUCE.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.907
HE WAS?

00:13:54.907 --> 00:13:56.578
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW.

00:13:56.578 --> 00:13:59.486
I'M SURE THAT HAD VERY
LITTLE TO DO WITH IT.

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:01.392
YEAH...I GUESS SO.

00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:04.467
WELL, HE WAS ALWAYS NICE
TO YOU, SY, RIGHT?

00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:06.907
I SUPPOSE.

00:14:06.907 --> 00:14:08.144
RIGHT, I KNOW!

00:14:08.144 --> 00:14:09.983
I LOVE MILK,
BUT STILL...

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.956
BUT STILL WHAT, SYRUS?

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:13.627
JUST BECAUSE IT'S EXPIRED...

00:14:13.627 --> 00:14:15.398
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT
DELICIOUS.

00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:18.507
NOW GRAB A FORK
AND ENJOY YOURSELF!

00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:22.051
OKAY...SO HE'D ACT
A BIT WEIRD SOMETIMES.

00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:24.692
WEIRD? I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT'S WEIRD!

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.536
STOP IT!

00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:30.609
I DON'T LIKE CARROTS!

00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:32.749
BUT OF COURSE YOU DO, CHAZZ!

00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:34.688
AND THERE'S NO
NEED TO THANK ME!

00:14:34.688 --> 00:14:36.493
YOU CAN SIMPLY
REPAY ME LATER,

00:14:36.493 --> 00:14:40.170
YES, BY GIVING ME
YOUR DESSERT!

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.778
HE SURE WAS SHIFTY
SOMETIMES.

00:14:42.778 --> 00:14:43.947
IT'S TRUE.

00:14:43.947 --> 00:14:47.725
LIKE WHEN HE TRIED TO
TEACH ME HOW TO SWIM.

00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:51.135
I JUST ENDED UP SPEARING
FISH FOR HIS DINNER!

00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:54.411
YEAH, I GUESS HE KINDA
HAD TWO SIDES TO HIM.

00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:56.316
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE
HIM A BAD PERSON.

00:14:56.316 --> 00:14:57.687
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:14:57.687 --> 00:15:00.796
YEAH. GUESS THAT'S WHY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.

00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:03.303
Syrus: YEP!
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO IT.

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.507
RIGHT GUYS?

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.913
SERIOUSLY--BREAK
TIME'S OVER!

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:07.950
LET'S GO...

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.588
All: AND FIND BANNER!

00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:10.624
[MEOW]

00:15:10.624 --> 00:15:11.895
PHARAOH?

00:15:11.895 --> 00:15:14.569
IT CAME FROM OVER HERE!

00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:16.976
Jaden: PHARAOH!?

00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:18.447
Syrus: HERE KITTY!

00:15:18.447 --> 00:15:19.818
Chumley: COME HERE, CAT!!

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.957
Chazz: PHARAOH!

00:15:21.957 --> 00:15:23.361
SHE'S CLOSE!

00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.167
QUICK GUYS,
LET'S SPREAD OUT,

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:26.570
THIS COULD BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.741
RIGHT!

00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.111
LET'S GO!

00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:33.123
Chazz: PHARAOH!

00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:34.661
WHERE ARE YOU?!

00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:35.830
KITTY?!

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.335
COME OUT!

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:38.505
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:39.508
I'M SCARED!

00:15:39.508 --> 00:15:41.179
YEAH, WELL, WHAT'S NEW?

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:42.249
LOOK, BOSS!

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:44.422
SOMETHING'S JUST
NOT RIGHT HERE!

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:46.494
OH PLEASE! GET LOST.

00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:48.467
[MEOW]

00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:50.740
PHARAOH!

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.481
[MEOW]

00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:56.457
WHAT THE--PROFESSOR
BANNER'S GLASSES.

00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:57.727
HE'S CLOSE.

00:15:57.727 --> 00:15:58.997
MUST BE.
