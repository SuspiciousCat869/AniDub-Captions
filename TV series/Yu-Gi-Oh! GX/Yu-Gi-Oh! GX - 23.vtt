00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:04.877
AN ATTACK OUGHTA
KNOCK SOME SENSE
INTO HIM!

00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:06.578
GO, SPARKMAN!

YOUR ATTACK
WILL NOT STAND, MAN!

00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:12.117
I GOT A TRAP CARD!

00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:14.353
IT'S CALLED
HUMAN WAVE TACTICS.

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:15.821
WRAP YOUR MIND
AROUND THIS:

00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:17.022
AT THE END OF EACH TURN,

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:19.191
I CAN SUMMON A MONSTER
THAT'S THE SAME LEVEL

00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.792
AS THE ONE THAT'S
BEEN DESTROYED.

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:22.561
THEY HAVE TO BE
LEVEL TWO OR BELOW,

00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:24.129
BUT IT'S ABOUT
THE BALANCE, MAN!

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:25.564

ALL I KNOW IS THAT
MY SPARKMAN'S ATTACK'S
STILL HAPPENIN'!

AND NOW,
WITH MOKEY MOKEY

NEXT, I PLAY

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:19.484
THEN I THINK I'LL
ATTACK YOUR SPARKMAN

WITH MY HAPPY LOVER.

WHAT FOR?!

00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:25.257

WAY HIGHER VOLTAGE
THAN YOUR LOVER.
