Syrus: AND DON'T GO EASY
'CAUSE SHE'S A GIRL!

00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:42.042
Chumley: NOT LIKE ANY
THAT I'VE SEEN.

00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:44.081
ALL RIGHT!
LET'S DO THIS!

00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:45.784
THE ONLY QUESTION IS...

00:07:45.784 --> 00:07:48.993
WHICH DECK TO CHOOSE!

00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:51.331
REALLY? I HAVE
THE SAME PROBLEM MYSELF.

00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:53.102
I HAVE TWO DECKS.

00:07:53.102 --> 00:07:56.745
ONE IS OF KNOWLEDGE.
THE OTHER IS OF COURAGE.

00:07:56.745 --> 00:08:00.052
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND DECIDE WHICH OF
THE TWO I USE?

00:08:00.052 --> 00:08:01.322
FINE, THEN.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:03.360
I'LL PICK THE DECK
OF KNOWLEDGE!

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.437
NICE CHOICE. HMM.

00:08:07.437 --> 00:08:08.639
THANK YOU,

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.312
BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY
AS NICE AS THE CHOICE

00:08:11.312 --> 00:08:13.451
THAT I AM MAKING
FOR MYSELF.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.021
I SELECT MY EARTH DECK!

00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:16.491
THEN LET US BEGIN,

00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:19.398
AND DON'T WORRY--
THIS ISN'T A SHADOW GAME.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.303
BEG YOUR PARDON?

00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:22.506
YOU HEARD ME, BASTION!

00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:26.282
I DON'T WANT YOUR SOUL!
I WANT YOU, BIG BOY!

00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:27.452
OHH!

00:08:27.452 --> 00:08:28.520
IT'S LIKE THIS:

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.826
MY TRIBE'S ALL WOMEN,
SO TO MARRY...

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.430
I HAVE TO SHOP AROUND.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.733
TO MARRY?!

00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:34.836
THAT'S RIGHT, HON.

00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:36.206
NOW LET'S DO THIS.

00:08:37.943 --> 00:08:39.113
DUEL!
DUEL!

00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:42.286
ALL RIGHT, IT'S MY TURN!

00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:44.960
AND FIRST, I'LL SUMMON...

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.502
THE AMAZONESS SWORDSWOMAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:54.282
THEN I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:08:54.282 --> 00:08:56.855
I'M UP! HA!

00:08:56.855 --> 00:08:59.729
AND I SUMMON
TO THE FIELD
MAGNET WARRIOR...

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:02.602
SIGMA PLUS!
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:02.602 --> 00:09:04.507
AND NOW, MAGNET WARRIOR,

00:09:04.507 --> 00:09:06.779
ATTACK THAT AMAZONESS!

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.385
LODESTONE BATON BASH!

00:09:13.729 --> 00:09:15.800
WHY'D BASTION
LOSE LIFE POINTS?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.674
BECAUSE OF
MY AMAZONESS' ABILITY.

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:21.748
HER OPPONENT TAKES
ALL BATTLE DAMAGE
THAT WAS DEALT TO HER.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:23.619
HE WALKED RIGHT
INTO THAT ONE.

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:25.724
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
LIKE BASTION.

00:09:25.724 --> 00:09:27.929
NUH-UH!
IT'S JUST LIKE BASTION.

00:09:27.929 --> 00:09:29.132
THINK ABOUT IT!

00:09:29.132 --> 00:09:31.104
SURE, HE HAS
FEWER LIFE POINTS,

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:32.875
BUT SHE HAS FEWER
MONSTERS!

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:33.978
SMART MOVE!

00:09:33.978 --> 00:09:37.853
YEAH, UNTIL I PLAY...
MY FACEDOWN CARD!

00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:39.524
PRIDE OF TRIBE!

00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:42.465
THIS TRAP ACTIVATES
WHEN AMAZONESS IS DESTROYED!

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.770
NOW I CAN SUMMON ANOTHER ONE
FROM MY DECK.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.379
SO TELL ME, WHO HERE
IS THE SMART ONE NOW, HMM?

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:53.324
YOU MISCALCULATED
ON THAT LAST MOVE!

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:56.231
AFTER ALL, NOW WE HAVE
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONSTERS,

00:09:56.231 --> 00:09:59.940
BUT NOT THE SAME
AMOUNT OF LIFE POINTS!

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.009
[SIGH]

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:02.446
I'LL PLAY A CARD
FACEDOWN,

00:10:02.446 --> 00:10:04.183
AND THAT
WILL SUFFICE.

00:10:04.183 --> 00:10:06.990
OH, MY!
"THAT WILL SUFFICE!"

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.098
SAY IT AGAIN!
IT SOUNDED SO COOL!

00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:11.468
YOU KNOW...

00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:13.339
I'M THINKING THAT
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE YEARS

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:15.610
SINCE TANIA'S INTERACTED
WITH A GUY.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.351
COUPLE YEARS?
TRY DECADES, SY!

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.155
THIS LADY IS MAN-CRAZY!

00:10:20.155 --> 00:10:21.959
I'M QUITE FLATTERED.

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.599
BUT I'M WELL AWARE OF
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.336
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DISTRACT ME.

00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:28.776
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, MY DEAR...

00:10:28.776 --> 00:10:30.613
IT'S SIMPLY
NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:31.950
I'M TOO FOCUSED.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.091
OH, ARE YOU? WE'LL SEE!

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:37.630
I PLAY THE AMAZONESS
BLOWPIPER!

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:42.609
AND I PLAY MY FACEDOWN!

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:44.514
MAGNET FORCE MINUS!

00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:48.557
WHEN THIS CARD
IS ACTIVATED...

00:10:48.557 --> 00:10:50.729
IT CAN EQUIP
ONTO ONE MONSTER!

00:10:50.729 --> 00:10:52.766
THEN, WHO
IT'S EQUIPPED TO...

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:54.638
GAINS
A NEGATIVE MAGNETISM

00:10:54.638 --> 00:10:57.711
AND BECOMES WHAT'S KNOWN
AS A MINUS MONSTER.

00:10:58.881 --> 00:10:59.883
OH.

00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:01.220
AND FROM THERE, DEAR,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.590
IT GETS INTERESTING.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.829
SEE...
TWO MINUS MONSTERS?

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.900
WELL, I'M AFRAID

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.237
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ENGAGE IN BATTLE
WITH EACH OTHER,

00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:10.142
BUT...A MINUS
AND A PLUS?

00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:11.846
IF THEY'RE OUT,
THEY MUST FIGHT.

00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:15.621
SO, SINCE AMAZONESS
BLOWPIPER IS A MINUS MONSTER...

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:19.331
AND MAGNET WARRIOR
SIGMA PLUS
IS A PLUS MONSTER...

00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:20.566
IT'S ON.

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:25.980
YOU'VE HEARD
THAT OLD QUOTE,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.550
"OPPOSITES ATTRACT"?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.455
WELL, I'M AFRAID
IT'S TRUE!

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.691
I KNOW IT!

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.796
AFTER ALL, JUST LOOK
AT THE TWO OF US!

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:34.166
OH, STOP IT!

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:35.770
STOP IT?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.810
WHY DON'T I JUST
STOP YOU FROM WINNING
THIS BATTLE INSTEAD?

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.417
GO, AMAZONESS SPELLCASTER!

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:44.457
NOW ONE AMAZONESS
AND ONE MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:11:44.457 --> 00:11:46.763
EXCHANGE THEIR ATTACK POINTS
WITH EACH OTHER!

00:11:46.763 --> 00:11:47.766
[THINKING]
WHAT?

00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:51.641
THIS IS BAD.

00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:54.215
NOW BASTION'S MONSTER
IS GOING TO BE
OUTMATCHED!

00:11:54.215 --> 00:11:57.188
ATTACK!
AMAZONESS BLOWPIPER!

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:04.672
[GROANING]

00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:06.009
AND NOW,

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:09.484
THE AMAZONESS SWORDSWOMAN
WILL ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:12:10.821 --> 00:12:13.226
GO, AMAZON SLASH ATTACK!

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.608
THAT WAS FUN.

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.212
BUT HOW?!

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:24.855
THAT'S TWO TIMES
THAT SHE'S BEEN ABLE
TO OUTTHINK ME.

00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:26.525
I GUESS WE KNOW
WHERE OUR KIDS

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:28.697
ARE GOING TO GET
THEIR SMARTS FROM, THEN.

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:30.034
WHAT?! OUR KIDS?!

00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:32.372
WE ARE ENEMIES!
RIVALS!

00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:34.544
DURING THIS DUEL, WE ARE.

00:12:34.544 --> 00:12:35.881
BUT AFTERWARDS?

00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:38.086
WE'LL BE BETROTHED
TO EACH OTHER!

00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:39.189
JUST THINK ABOUT IT!

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:42.029
YOU'LL BE
MR. TANIA THE AMAZON WOMAN!

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.933
YOU'RE RELENTLESS.

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.707
TRULY, ARE YOU THAT
SMITTEN WITH ME?

00:12:46.707 --> 00:12:48.143
I PREFER "IN LOVE."

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.781
YOU HARDLY KNOW ME!

00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:51.585
I KNOW ENOUGH.

00:12:51.585 --> 00:12:53.990
MY LITTLE
SUGAR BOOGER.
UGH.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.327
[THINKING]
KEEP YOUR COOL, BASTION.

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:57.299
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO DISTRACT YOU,

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:00.439
LIKE HOW THOSE SILLY
CARD CRUSHES DISTRACT
SYRUS AND CHUMLEY.

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:02.879
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN ABOVE THAT!

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.149
[GRUNT]

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:06.053
NO! GET OUT!

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.958
I'M ABOVE ALL THIS!

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.796
BASTION SURE IS
ACTING WEIRD.

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:12.368
LOVE WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

00:13:12.368 --> 00:13:14.607
QUIET!
I'M NOT IN LOVE!

00:13:14.607 --> 00:13:17.447
[THINKING]
AND I'LL PROVE IT
BY TAKING TANIA DOWN!

00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:19.585
MY TURN! HA!

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:21.724
RIGHT. I ACTIVATE...

00:13:21.724 --> 00:13:24.431
MAGNET CONDUCTOR PLUS!

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:26.569
THIS ALLOWS ME TO
BRING A PLUS MONSTER

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.607
FROM THE GRAVEYARD
TO MY HAND!

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:31.982
SO COME ON BACK,
MAGNET WARRIOR
SIGMA PLUS!

00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:34.421
HOWEVER, HE WON'T
BE OUT FOR LONG,

00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:37.563
BECAUSE HE
AND THE MAGNET WARRIOR
OMEGA MINUS FROM MY HAND

00:13:37.563 --> 00:13:40.068
ARE NOW GOING
RIGHT BACK TO THE GRAVE

00:13:40.068 --> 00:13:42.575
SO THAT I CAN SUMMON
CONDUCTION WARRIOR

00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:46.116
LINEAR MAGNUM
PLUS MINUS!

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:51.195
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
WARRIOR MAGNUM PLUS MINUS'
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:52.632
IT ADDS HALF
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:54.636
OF ONE MAGNET MONSTER
ON THE FIELD

00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:56.909
TO THE WARRIOR MAGNUM'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:00.484
HE'S GOT HER
OUTMATCHED NOW!

00:14:00.484 --> 00:14:02.088
NOW, WARRIOR MAGNUM!

00:14:02.088 --> 00:14:04.527
ATTACK
AMAZONESS BLOWPIPER!

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:07.635
WITH POLARIZING
PULVERIZING BLAST!

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.517
UNH!

00:14:14.517 --> 00:14:16.389
NEXT I'LL PLACE
TWO FACEDOWNS,

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:18.661
AND I THINK THAT'LL DO.

00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:20.064
WHAT A MOVE!

00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:21.434
NO WONDER I LOVE YOU!

00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:23.205
AND, SWEETIE,
BECAUSE I DO...

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:26.680
I MUST BEAT YOU.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.621
AND WITH AMAZONESS
SWORDSWOMAN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:33.630
WHERE EVEN IF SHE
LOSES IN BATTLE,
YOU TAKE DAMAGE...

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.967
I WILL!

00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:37.272
NOW, AMAZONESS SWORDSWOMAN!

00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:40.780
STRIKE DOWN CONDUCTION WARRIOR
LINEAR MAGNUM PLUS MINUS

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.989
WITH AMAZON SLASH ATTACK!

00:14:43.989 --> 00:14:44.991
[THINKING]
THIS IS IT!

00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:46.127
I BETTER THINK FAST,

00:14:46.127 --> 00:14:47.797
OR THIS DUEL'S
GOING TO BE OVER FAST!

00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:52.509
Tania:
AMAZON SLASH ATTACK!

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.748
SORRY!
BUT I PLAY A FACEDOWN!

00:14:54.748 --> 00:14:56.084
POWER OFF!

00:14:56.084 --> 00:14:58.055
NOW WARRIOR MAGNUM
PLUS MINUS

00:14:58.055 --> 00:14:59.325
SPLITS BACK INTO
THE TWO MONSTERS

00:14:59.325 --> 00:15:01.096
THAT ORIGINATED HIM.

00:15:01.096 --> 00:15:02.933
NO FAIR!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.943
YEAH!
TIGHT MOVE!

00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:08.681
YES, I AGREE.

00:15:12.222 --> 00:15:14.194
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO
GET YOU NEXT TURN.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.734
AND WITH AMAZONESS PALADIN
NOW OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:19.541
YOU CAN BE SURE I WILL,

00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:21.445
BECAUSE MY PALADIN?

00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:23.818
SHE GAINS AN EXTRA
100 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:25.923
FOR EVERY CARD ON MY FIELD

00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:27.593
THAT HAS THE NAME
"AMAZONESS" IN IT!

00:15:31.803 --> 00:15:34.242
NEXT, I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:15:34.242 --> 00:15:36.715
AND THAT'LL DO FOR NOW.

00:15:36.715 --> 00:15:38.319
[THINKING]
WELL, AT LEAST
SHE'S CONCENTRATING

00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:40.858
ON HER DUELING
INSTEAD OF ON ME.

00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:43.197
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S MY MOVE NOW!

00:15:43.197 --> 00:15:45.436
SPEAKING OF MOVES,
SWEETIE,

00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:46.839
I THINK THAT...

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:49.245
IT'S PROBABLY BEST
THAT YOU MOVE IN WITH ME.

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:51.116
YOU KNOW,
AFTER WE GET MARRIED.

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.823
OH, WE'LL JUST HAVE
THE COZIEST HOME SWEET HOME!

00:15:53.823 --> 00:15:55.058
OHH.

00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:57.398
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

00:15:57.398 --> 00:15:58.868
AM I DISTRACTING YOU AGAIN

00:15:58.868 --> 00:16:01.240
WITH THIS TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.014
AND HOW POSITIVELY
HANDSOME YOU ARE?

00:16:04.014 --> 00:16:05.985
HA HA HA! OH!

00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:08.090
THERE I GO AGAIN!

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.094
[GROANING]

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:13.069
I GUESS THAT I SIMPLY
CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:15.040
I'M HEAD OVER HEELS!

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.446
YES...ME, TOO.

00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:19.183
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:21.322
TANIA...

00:16:21.322 --> 00:16:24.195
YUCK. ARE THERE
BARF BAGS
ON THIS FLIGHT?

00:16:24.195 --> 00:16:27.871
AW, MAN!
BASTION'S GETTING
ALL FLUSHED!

00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:30.177
AND ALL SIDETRACKED!

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:31.547
NOT GOOD.

00:16:31.547 --> 00:16:32.716
ALL RIGHT!

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:34.152
MY TURN!

00:16:34.152 --> 00:16:35.589
FIRST OFF,

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:38.797
I SUMMON MAGNET WARRIOR
SIGMA MINUS
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:41.036 --> 00:16:43.910
NEXT,
I'LL PLAY MY FACEDOWN!

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.446
100,000 GAUSS!

00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:48.153
YOU SEE,
I CAN ACTIVATE THIS

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:52.196
WHEN I HAVE A PLUS MONSTER
AND A MINUS MONSTER
OUT UPON MY FIELD.

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:55.237
IT LETS ME SWITCH
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
TO ATTACK MODE

00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:58.210
AND REDUCE
THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 800!

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.082
ALL RIGHT!
THAT'S SWEET!

00:17:00.082 --> 00:17:01.619
NOW BASTION'S
GOT THE MONSTERS

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:03.089
AND THE MATCH-UP
HE NEEDS!

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.695
THIS DUEL IS
TOTALLY IN THE BAG!

00:17:05.695 --> 00:17:07.533
I WOULD THINK SO, TOO,

00:17:07.533 --> 00:17:10.841
UNTIL I SAW
DRAMATIC RESCUE!

00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:13.648
IT LETS ME RETURN
ONE OF MY MONSTERS
TO MY HAND

00:17:13.648 --> 00:17:16.621
AND THEN SUMMON
A DIFFERENT ONE TO THE FIELD.

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:18.158
AND AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE,

00:17:18.158 --> 00:17:20.464
THIS ONE IS
VERY DIFFERENT, INDEED!

00:17:20.464 --> 00:17:23.170
COME OUT,
AMAZONESS TIGER!

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.977
AND DON'T TRY CATCHING
THIS TIGER BY THE TOE,

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:28.249
BECAUSE SHE GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:30.454
FOR EACH AMAZONESS
OUT ON THE FIELD.

00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:32.192
SO NOT LISHUS!

00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:38.240
AND...WHEN THIS CARD'S
OUT AND ABOUT,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.216
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ATTACK ANY OTHER
AMAZONESS MONSTERS BUT IT.

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:44.255
SO...
THERE'S NO CHOICE?

00:17:44.255 --> 00:17:46.593
HE HAS TO
ATTACK THAT TIGER?

00:17:46.593 --> 00:17:47.562
[THINKING]
SIMPLE.

00:17:47.562 --> 00:17:49.934
I HAVE 3
MAGNET WARRIORS OUT.

00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:52.774
I'LL USE ONE
TO ELIMINATE
AMAZONESS TIGER,

00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:54.446
THEN, ANOTHER ONE

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:56.384
TO DESTROY
THE AMAZONESS
SWORDSWOMAN.

00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:58.321
THEN, I'LL USE
THE REMAINING ONE

00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:01.295
TO ATTACK TANIA DIRECTLY
AND WIN.

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.598
FUN DUEL!

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.338
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT'S ABOUT TO BE OVER!

00:18:05.338 --> 00:18:08.011
GO, MAGNET WARRIOR,
OMEGA MINUS ATTACK,

00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:11.285
AND TAME THAT
AMAZONESS TIGER!

00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:13.758
YOU MUST BE DISTRACTED.

00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:16.465
OTHERWISE, YOU MOST CERTAINLY
WOULD'VE SEEN THAT...

00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:18.402
I HAVE A FACEDOWN OUT!

00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:19.405
AMAZONESS ARCHERS!

00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:20.842
[GASP]

00:18:20.842 --> 00:18:22.479
SORRY, HON,

00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:24.384
BUT NOW ALL
OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:18:24.384 --> 00:18:26.155
ARE SWITCHED
INTO ATTACK MODE

00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:28.193
AND LOSE 600
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:30.498
THEY'RE ALSO ALL
FORCED TO WAGE BATTLE--

00:18:30.498 --> 00:18:32.002
RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

00:18:32.002 --> 00:18:33.071
BUT IF THEY DO THAT,

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.842
THEY'LL HAVE TO
ATTACK THAT TIGER!

00:18:34.842 --> 00:18:37.582
AND SHE HAS
MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN ANY OF THEM!

00:18:37.582 --> 00:18:39.253
HE WALKED
RIGHT INTO A TRAP.

00:18:39.253 --> 00:18:40.623
WHAT WAS HE
THINKING?

00:18:40.623 --> 00:18:42.093
THAT'S JUST IT.

00:18:42.093 --> 00:18:44.299
WITH ALL THAT LOVE TALK,
I DOUBT HE WAS.

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:45.702
[MEOW]

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:49.076
NOW, AMAZONESS TIGER!

00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:52.318
SHOW BASTION THAT OPPOSITES
DON'T JUST ATTRACT...

00:18:52.318 --> 00:18:54.055
THEY ATTACK!

00:18:54.055 --> 00:18:56.728
SIC' HIM!
FANG FRENZY!

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:03.344
[YELLING]

00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:06.184
[GRUNTING]

00:19:06.184 --> 00:19:08.657
I'M...ALL YOURS.

00:19:20.986 --> 00:19:23.025
UNH! BASTION!

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.963
KITTY?

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.566
OHH! WHOA!

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:28.438
[SHOUTING]

00:19:36.624 --> 00:19:38.696
OH, NO. BASTION.

00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:40.056
HEY!

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:41.123
Tania: HA HA HA!

00:19:41.123 --> 00:19:42.491
SORRY. BASTION AND I

00:19:42.491 --> 00:19:44.794
ARE OFFICIALLY
ON OUR HONEYMOON NOW.

00:19:44.794 --> 00:19:46.729
SO GET LOST!

00:19:46.729 --> 00:19:49.231
THIS ISN'T OVER!

00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:51.967
YOU HEAR ME?!
