LISHUS. THAT GIVES
BUBBLEMAN 800 MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:40.471
AND I'LL CALL IT
A TURN.

00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:44.141
Chazz thinking: RUMOR IS
THAT KAIBAMAN CARD WAS
CREATED BY KAIBA HIMSELF.

00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:45.642
THIS COULD BE TOUGH.

00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:47.111
[THINKING]
TALK ABOUT DREAMS
COMIN' TRUE.

00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:49.346
JUST LAST NIGHT I
DREAMT ABOUT
A BLUE EYES

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:50.614
AND HE'S GOT ONE.

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.183
I JUST HOPE THIS
DOESN'T END
THE SAME WAY

00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:56.153
THE NIGHTMARE DID
WITH MY FRIENDS
IN DEEP TROUBLE

00:08:56.153 --> 00:08:58.222
CUZ I FAILED.

00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:00.057
HELP US, JADEN.

00:09:00.057 --> 00:09:03.027
I HAVE TO WIN.

00:09:03.027 --> 00:09:04.962
WISHING YOU COULD
BACK OUT NOW?

00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:07.398
TOO LATE. MY MOVE.

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:14.071
I SUMMON FORTH MYSELF:
KAIBAMAN.

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:19.510
WHOA, I'M SEEING DOUBLE.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.445
AND TROUBLE.

00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:23.547
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
HIM TO BRING OUT

00:09:23.547 --> 00:09:26.250
THE ONE AND THE ONLY.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.484
NOT HIM.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.286
YOU BETTER BELIEVE
IT'S HIM.

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:33.524
I SUMMON THE LEGENDARY
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON.

00:09:38.462 --> 00:09:40.531
FEAST YOUR EYES
ON THE BEAST

00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.734
THAT WILL FEAST
UPON YOUR SOULS.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:44.735
[ROARING]

00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:46.036
ON OUR SOULS?

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:50.140
THIS COULD BE
A VERY SHORT DUEL.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.241
[ROARS]

00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.409
3000 ATTACK POINTS?

00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:54.978
YES, AND NOW WATCH
THEM ALL IN ACTION.

00:09:54.978 --> 00:09:58.749
BLUE EYES,
DESTROY BUBBLEMAN.

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:02.086
WHITE LIGHTNING.

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:03.754
HOLD IT, KAIBAMAN.

00:10:03.754 --> 00:10:05.622
SINCE THAT
BUBBLE BLASTER
IS OUT

00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:09.093
IT TAKES THE HIT
FOR BUBBLEMAN.

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:11.728
SO JADEN DOESN'T
TAKE ANY DAMAGE.

00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:14.031
YEAH, BUT NOW THAT
THE EQUIP SPELL IS GONE,

00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.567
BUBBLEMAN'S
POINT BONUS IS, TOO.

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:19.636
WHICH ISN'T GOOD
WHEN YOU'RE FACING DOWN
A BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.541
ALL RIGHT.

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.378
MY TURN.

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:34.650
AND I'M GONNA BE
TURNIN' TWO MONSTERS
INTO ONE.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.220
I PLAY
POLYMERIZATION TO
FUSE BUBBLEMAN

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.756
AND CLAYMAN TO
CREATE MUDBALLMAN
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:40.756 --> 00:10:42.625
TAKE THAT.

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:45.027
NO, I'LL TAKE THIS.

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:47.497
THE SPELL CARD
POT OF GREED.

00:10:47.497 --> 00:10:50.333
IT LETS ME DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.335
BUT I WILL ONLY
NEED ONE,

00:10:52.335 --> 00:10:55.238
THE SPELL BURST STREAM
OF DESTRUCTION.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.541
ISN'T THAT AN ATTACK
THAT THE BLUE-EYES USES?

00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.077
YEAH, WHAT'S THE
DEAL WITH IT BEING
A SEPARATE CARD?

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.045
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:06.048
YOU SEE, I CAN ONLY USE
THIS WHEN BLUE EYES IS OUT.

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:09.094
BUT SINCE HE IS I CAN
NOW PLAY IT TO DESTROY
ALL YOUR MONSTERS.

00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:10.260
WHAT?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.428
GO.

00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:12.862
OBLITERATE MUDBALLMAN

00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:15.498
WITH BURST STREAM
OF DESTRUCTION.

00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.370
[GROANING]

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.371
AAH! AAH!

00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:22.772
NO.

00:11:22.772 --> 00:11:24.841
AW, MAN, NOW JAY
IS ALL EXPOSED

00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:25.842
AND WHEN BLUE-EYES ATTACKS,

00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:27.510
IT'LL BE ALL OVER.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.012
READ THE FINE
PRINT--

00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:30.547
BLUE EYES CAN'T
ATTACK ON THE TURN

00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:33.817
THAT BURST STEAM
OF DESTRUCTION
IS USED.

00:11:33.817 --> 00:11:35.418
IT WON'T MATTER.

00:11:35.418 --> 00:11:39.589
I SUMMON MANJU
OF THE TEN THOUSAND HANDS.

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:41.791
AND NOW HE'LL
LEND ME A HAND.

00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:44.427
SEE, WHEN HE'S SUMMONED
HE ALLOWS ME TO SELECT

00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:45.528
A RITUAL MONSTER
OR SPELL CARD

00:11:45.528 --> 00:11:49.365
FROM MY DECK AND PLACE
IT INTO MY HAND.

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:50.934
BUT IT WON'T STAY
IN MY HAND FOR LONG

00:11:50.934 --> 00:11:52.702
BECAUSE I'M PLAYING IT.

00:11:52.702 --> 00:11:55.205
GO WHITE DRAGON RITUAL.

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:58.374
NOW I'LL SACRIFICE MANJU
TO SUMMON PALADIN
OF WHITE DRAGON.

00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:05.282
LIKE I SAID IT DOESN'T
MATTER BLUE EYES CAN'T
ATTACK THIS TURN.

00:12:05.282 --> 00:12:08.052
YOU SEE WITH PALADIN
I DON'T NEED HIM TO.

00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:10.988
HE'LL FILL IN
FOR BLUE EYES JUST FINE.

00:12:10.988 --> 00:12:12.890
SURE, HE MAY NOT BE
A DRAGON,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.024
BUT HE'S MANAGED
TO TAME ONE.

00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:17.228
AND IN MY BOOK,
THAT'S TOUGH.

00:12:17.228 --> 00:12:20.030
NOW, PALADIN
OF WHITE DRAGON, ATTACK.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.501
IONIC SPEAR BURST.

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.071
[GROANING]

00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:28.472
JADEN.

00:12:28.472 --> 00:12:30.074
AND I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:32.576
BY SACRIFICING PALADIN,
I CAN NOW SUMMON

00:12:32.576 --> 00:12:34.912
ANOTHER MONSTER
FROM MY HAND OR DECK,

00:12:34.912 --> 00:12:36.413
AND IT'S ONE YOU'VE
ALREADY MET--

00:12:36.413 --> 00:12:37.982
CARE TO GUESS
WHICH, JADEN?

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:40.518
ACTUALLY, NO.

00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:42.386
LET ME GIVE YOU
A HINT THEN.

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:44.889
IT HAS BLUE EYES,
WHITE SCALES--

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.124
THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:12:47.124 --> 00:12:49.326
[ROARING]

00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:50.327
ANOTHER?

00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:51.562
THIS IS BAD.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:52.830
DEALING WITH ONE
WAS HARD ENOUGH.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.799
NOW JAY HAS
GOTTA FACE TWO?

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:57.501
LOOKS LIKE THE CARD
CREATED BY KAIBA

00:12:57.501 --> 00:12:59.470
IS A CHIP
OFF THE OLD BLOCK.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.338
JADEN JUST BETTER HOPE
THAT DECK OF HIS

00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:05.309
ISN'T AN EXACT COPY
OR HE'S IN FOR IT.

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:07.411
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:08.412
'BOUT TIME.

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:10.181
NOW...

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:14.685
FIRST I'LL PLAY
MONSTER REINCARNATION.

00:13:14.685 --> 00:13:17.188
LISHUS--BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD FROM HIS HAND,

00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:19.657
HE'LL GET A MONSTER BACK
FROM THE GRAVE.

00:13:19.657 --> 00:13:22.092
ALL RIGHT, GOODBYE
ELEMENTAL HERO
NECROSHADE

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:23.928
AND HELLO CLAYMAN.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.430
GOING TO TRY
AND HIDE BEHIND THAT
PUNY MONSTER AGAIN?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.665
PATHETIC.

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:30.467
NO WAY, I DON'T HAVE
TO HIDE ANYMORE.

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:31.969
YA SEE EVEN THOUGH
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE
CLAYMAN BACK

00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:34.872
ON MY FIELD
I'M EVEN HAPPIER

00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:37.942
TO HAVE NECROSHADE
DOWN IN THE GRAVE.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.544
'CUZ WHEN NECROSHADE
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:13:40.544 --> 00:13:42.580
I CAN SUMMON
A HIGH-LEVEL MONSTER

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.848
WITHOUT HAVIN'
TO SACRIFICE.

00:13:44.848 --> 00:13:46.951
AND THE MONSTER
I'M GONNA SUMMON IS

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.186
ELEMENTAL HERO
BLADEDGE.

00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:54.325
BUT AS STRONG AS
ELEMENTAL HERO
BLADEDGE IS

00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:58.028
HE'S STILL NO MATCH
FOR THOSE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGONS.

00:13:58.028 --> 00:13:59.997
Jaden: DON'T BE
SO SURE.

00:13:59.997 --> 00:14:03.500
NEXT I'LL PLAY
THE FIELD SPELL
SKYSCRAPER.

00:14:10.941 --> 00:14:14.178
WITH THIS OUT IF
BLADEDGE TAKES ON
A STRONGER MONSTER

00:14:14.178 --> 00:14:18.682
HE GAINS AN EXTRA
1000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:21.952
AND THAT'S JUST
ENOUGH TO EDGE OUT
BLUE EYES.

00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:25.956
NOW GO. SLICE
AND DICE ATTACK.

00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:30.527
[ROARS]

00:14:30.527 --> 00:14:33.897

00:14:33.897 --> 00:14:36.033
WHOA, JADEN
ACTUALLY DID IT.

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:39.236
NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN.

00:14:39.236 --> 00:14:40.671
AND TO THINK.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.573
I WAS WORRIED
I'D LOSE.

00:14:42.573 --> 00:14:44.475
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:46.810
HMM. IS THAT SO?

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.480
FOR SURE.
I'M SO OVER MY FEAR.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.348
THE TRICK IS TO
TAKE WHAT YOU'RE
SCARED OF

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:52.516
AND NOT LET IT
HAPPEN.

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:54.151
NOT LET IT HAPPEN?

00:14:54.151 --> 00:14:56.620
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.189
DO YOU REALLY THINK
BY BEATING ONE BLUE EYES

00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:00.324
YOU'VE WON THIS DUEL?

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:03.193
YOU'VE AVOIDED
THAT DEFEAT YOU FEAR?

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.561
I THINK NOT.

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:07.231
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM WINNING THIS CONTEST.

00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:09.566
AND BLUE EYES
IS A LONG WAY
FROM BEING BEAT.

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:11.302
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:12.336
IT'S TRUE.

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:14.338
LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOUR FATE

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:15.406
AND THE FATE
OF YOUR FRIENDS

00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:17.174
ALL STILL HANG
IN THE BALANCE.

00:15:17.174 --> 00:15:18.909
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:20.144
AND FACE IT HEAD ON.

00:15:22.646 --> 00:15:24.248
WHAT IS THIS?

00:15:24.248 --> 00:15:26.383
THIS IS HOW
A TRUE DUELIST LIVES.

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:28.552
NOT AFRAID
OF THE THOUGHT
OF DEFEAT

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:31.055
BUT ALWAYS PREPARED
TO ACCEPT IT.

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.457
THIS IS THE NATURE
OF DUELING.

00:15:33.457 --> 00:15:36.927
AND IT IS HIGH TIME
THAT YOU LEARN IT.

00:15:36.927 --> 00:15:39.263
I PLAY SILENT DOOM--

00:15:39.263 --> 00:15:42.032
WITH IT, I CAN
BRING BACK A BLUE-EYES
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

WHAT'S THE SAME?

00:15:51.608 --> 00:15:53.844
KAIBAMAN'S DECK
IS EXACTLY
THE SAME DECK

AS SETO KAIBA'S.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.215
WHICH MEANS...

00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:00.818
WHICH MEANS I HAVE
ONE MORE BLUE EYES

00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:03.087
AND I CAN
THEREFORE SUMMON

OF THEM ALL.

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:24.274
THE MONSTER
FROM MY DREAM.

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:25.442
IT CAN'T BE.

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.177
IT CAN BE AND IT IS.

00:16:27.177 --> 00:16:28.612
AND IT GETS WORSE.

00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:30.347
WITH 4500 ATTACK POINTS
STARING AT YOU?

00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:35.519
THAT DEFEAT YOU DREAMT
WILL NOW BECOME A REALITY.

00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.719
NOW GO.

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:45.155
BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON.

00:16:45.155 --> 00:16:47.291
ATTACK WITH
NEUTRON BLAST.

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:48.959
GO TRAP CARD.

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:50.728
EDGE HAMMER.

00:16:50.728 --> 00:16:52.763
NOW BY SACRIFICIN'
BLADEDGE,

00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:55.232
I CAN DESTROY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:16:55.232 --> 00:16:56.867
AND THEN YOU TAKE
DAMAGE EQUAL

00:16:56.867 --> 00:16:59.136
TO THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:01.905
[ROARING]

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.149
YOU SAID I SHOULD
ACCEPT DEFEAT?

00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:13.484
DON'T THINK SO.

00:17:16.053 --> 00:17:17.021
ALL RIGHT.

00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:18.022
WAY TO PLAY.

00:17:18.022 --> 00:17:19.023
NO WAY.

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.580
HUH?

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.582
IF YOU WON'T
ACCEPT DEFEAT,

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.084
THEN I'LL FORCE IT
ON YOU.

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:34.253
DE-FUSION?

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:35.954
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.222
IT REVERTED
ULTIMATE DRAGON

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.825
BACK TO ITS
PRE-FUSION FORM.

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:41.293
SO SINCE EDGE HAMMER'S
TARGET WAS NO LONGER THERE,

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:44.029
IT SWUNG AND MISSED.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.968
SOMETHING MY THREE BLUE EYES
WILL NOT BE DOING.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.604
ATTACK WITH
WHITE LIGHTNING.

00:17:56.508 --> 00:18:01.547
AAH! AAH!

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.750
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.884
JADEN.

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:07.119
WHAT GIVES?

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:18.664
[CHIRPING]

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.832
OHH! SYRUS?
CHUMLEY?

00:18:20.832 --> 00:18:21.833
[LAUGHING]

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.316
DEFEAT IS NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF, JADEN.

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:34.087
WHAT MATTERS IS
IF YOU CAN GET UP AFTER.

00:18:34.087 --> 00:18:35.255
WAIT, ARE YOU
TELLING ME

00:18:35.255 --> 00:18:37.357
THIS ENTIRE DUEL WAS
TO TEACH ME THAT?

00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:39.526
TELL ME,
ARE YOU AFRAID NOW?

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:40.627
ACTUALLY NO,
I'M REALLY NOT.

00:18:40.627 --> 00:18:42.996
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:44.531
BECAUSE YOU'VE FACED IT.

00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:46.667
YOU'VE LOST,
AND YOU'RE OK.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.569
YEAH, I AM, HUH?

00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:49.870
Syrus: JAY.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.871
Chumley: JADEN.

00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:51.905
AND SO ARE THEY.

00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:53.874
SYRUS, CHUMLEY.

00:18:53.874 --> 00:18:55.943
I THINK I'M FINALLY
OVER MY BAD DREAM.

00:18:55.943 --> 00:18:57.411
OH, YEAH?

00:18:57.411 --> 00:18:59.012
WELL, I'M OVER
THIS PLACE.

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:01.481
CAN WE PLEASE GET
OUT OF THIS WEIRD
SPIRIT CAVE?

00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:03.717
IT'S LOW RENT.

00:19:03.717 --> 00:19:05.519
UH, KAIBAMAN?

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.721
THINK YOU COULD
HELP US OUT HERE?

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:10.090
HUH?

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.492
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:19:12.492 --> 00:19:13.627
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HELP

00:19:13.627 --> 00:19:16.563
ASK YOUR FRIEND KURIBOH.

00:19:16.563 --> 00:19:20.567
AFTER ALL, HE'S THE ONE
THAT BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE.

00:19:20.567 --> 00:19:24.004
GOODBYE, JADEN.

00:19:24.004 --> 00:19:26.006
[KURIBOH CHIRPING]

00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:27.374
REALLY, KURIBOH?

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:29.376
JUST CLOSE OUR EYES
AND WISH FOR IT?

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.344
OK.

00:19:35.649 --> 00:19:37.517
I REALLY WANT
TO GO BACK HOME.

00:19:37.517 --> 00:19:40.220
[YELLING]

00:19:53.433 --> 00:19:56.436
HUH?

00:19:56.436 --> 00:19:58.305
[MOANING]

00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:03.176
Syrus: THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

00:20:03.176 --> 00:20:04.444
I'VE LEFT
THE WADING POOL

00:20:04.444 --> 00:20:06.613
MORE WOUND UP
THAN WHEN I CAME IN.

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:08.215
I'M JUST GLAD WE'RE
BACK IN A WORLD

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:09.716
WHERE DES KOALA
AND WINGED KURIBOH
ARE JUST CARDS,

00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:12.152
YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

00:20:12.152 --> 00:20:14.955

YOU'RE THE BEST.

00:20:19.258 --> 00:20:20.392
