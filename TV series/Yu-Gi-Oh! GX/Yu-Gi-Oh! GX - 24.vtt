00:08:08.277 --> 00:08:13.816
I'D RATHER NOT HAVE
PEOPLE ASSOCIATE
ME WITH YOU.

00:08:13.816 --> 00:08:15.885
NOW GO AHEAD
AND GET INSIDE.

00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:18.020
THE CHAZZ LIKES TO MAKE
HIS OWN ENTRANCE.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.891
OH, YES, CERTAINLY!
WELL, THANKS AGAIN!

00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:23.292
THANKS FOR NOTHING.

00:08:23.292 --> 00:08:26.028
I REALLY ONLY
FOUND 40 CARDS.
NOW I'M ONE SHORT.

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:27.430
HA HA!

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.365
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU
WERE A NICE GUY.

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:30.900
SHUT IT!

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.302
AND WHEN YOU DO
SOMETHING NICE,
NICE THINGS HAPPEN!

00:08:33.302 --> 00:08:36.839
ALL RIGHT,
OPEN THE DOOR!

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:38.775
I GOT YOUR 40 CARDS
RIGHT HERE!

00:08:56.492 --> 00:09:00.696
THIS IS IT?
NORTH ACADEMY?

00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:02.999
WHAT A DUMP.

00:09:06.803 --> 00:09:09.739
HEY, BALDY, YOU OK?

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:11.073
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:09:11.073 --> 00:09:12.475
[MAN CHUCKLES]

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:15.578
YOU GOT THE NORTH ACADEMY
WELCOME IS WHAT HAPPENED.

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.319
AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:09:23.319 --> 00:09:25.087
THINK THAT YOU'RE UP
TO THE CHALLENGE, NEW GUY?

00:09:25.087 --> 00:09:26.422
DO YA?

00:09:26.422 --> 00:09:27.924
WHO ARE YOU?

00:09:27.924 --> 00:09:30.159
I'M THE GUY WHO RUNS
THINGS AROUND HERE.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:32.328
THEY CALL ME THE CZAR.

00:09:32.328 --> 00:09:35.298
YOUR FRIEND JUST
WENT THROUGH OUR
LITTLE HAZING RITUAL:

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:37.266
THE 50-MAN DUEL GAUNTLET.

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:38.868
FIFTY MAN WHAT'S-IT?

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:40.203
DUEL GAUNTLET.

00:09:40.203 --> 00:09:42.205
IT'S HOW WE RANK STUDENTS
AROUND HERE.

00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:44.640
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM
HOW IT WORKS, KYLE?

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.376
SEE, YOU
GOTTA DUEL
50 STUDENTS.

00:09:47.376 --> 00:09:49.312
YEAH,
YOU START WITH
THE LOWEST-RANKED,

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:51.080
AND YOU
WORK YOUR WAY UP.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.015
WHEN YOU
LOSE, THAT'S
YOUR RANK.

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:54.617
UNLESS YOU
DON'T LOSE.

00:09:54.617 --> 00:09:56.619
THEN YOU DUEL ME--
NUMBER 50!

00:09:56.619 --> 00:10:01.123
BUT EVERYBODY LOSES,
LIKE YOUR
FRIEND HERE!

00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:03.526
HE LOST THE VERY
FIRST MATCH HE HAD.

00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:05.428
GUESS WHO'S
ON LATRINE
DUTY NOW?

00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:10.099
SO I HAVE TO WIN 50 TIMES
AND THAT'S IT?

00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:12.702
EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, ROOKIE!

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.004
THE NAME IS CHAZZ,
CHAZZ PRINCETON.

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:17.773
AND SOON, YOUR CZAR
WILL FALL!

00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:20.309
AND THEN THE PRINCETON
WILL RISE!

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:25.009
GO LIMITER REMOVAL!

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.263
NOW, DES SCISSORS,

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.266
ATTACK WITH TOXIC HAZE!

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:35.268
AAH!

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.105
YOU GO BYE-BYE.

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.576
ALL RIGHT,
MY TURN NOW!

00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:43.877
UH!

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.145
UH!

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.413
OOF!

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:49.516
AAH!
AAH!

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.017
SO WHAT?

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.719
BEATING THOSE
AMATEURS DOESN'T
PROVE A THING.

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.422
YOU STILL HAVE TO GET
THROUGH THE FOUR OF US.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:57.324
ONLY THEN CAN
YOU DUEL THE CZAR.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.226
DUEL EACH ONE OF YOU?

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:01.194
THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:02.863
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU
ALL ON AT ONCE!

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:05.932
All: YOU'RE ON!

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.868
DUEL!

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.336
MY TURN!

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.338
COME ON OUT,
MARAUDING CAPTAIN!

00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:15.759
AND I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.095
WHEN THIS MONSTER CARD IS
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD,

00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:21.465
I'M ALLOWED
TO SUMMON ANOTHER
WARRIOR-TYPE MONSTER!

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:22.800
AND I'LL PLAY

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.002
ANOTHER MARAUDING CAPTAIN!

00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:26.637
HYAH!

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:28.038
AND SO WILL I!

00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:29.039
ME, TOO!

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:30.040
SAME WITH ME!

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.109
[BOY CHEERS]

00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:34.378
OH, AND IN CASE
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,
ROOKIE,

00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:36.814
WHEN THERE ARE TWO OR
MORE CAPTAINS ON THE FIELD,

00:11:36.814 --> 00:11:38.816
YOU CAN'T ATTACK
ANY OF THEM!

00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:40.350
NAH, HE DIDN'T
FORGET THAT,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.852
BECAUSE HE
PROBABLY NEVER

00:11:41.852 --> 00:11:43.387
EVEN KNEW IT IN
THE FIRST PLACE!

00:11:43.387 --> 00:11:44.822
HA! GOOD POINT!

00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:46.490
AND NOW, HE'LL
SUFFER FOR IT!

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.726
PLEASE. THE ONLY
WAY YOU SCRUBS
COULD MAKE ME SUFFER

00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:51.995
IS TO KEEP BLABBING
LIKE YOU ARE.

00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:53.897
MY TURN!

00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:59.002
I'LL PLAY TWO FACE-DOWNS
AND ONE GIANT RAT
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:59.002 --> 00:12:00.871
ALL YOU'RE THROWING IS
AN OVERGROWN RODENT?!

00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:02.239
WHAT A JOKE!

00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:05.709
PERHAPS, AFTER ALL,
HE IS A WEAKER CARD.

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:07.477
ONE THAT
THE OLD CHAZZ

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.413
WOULD NEVER
HAVE HAD
IN HIS DECK.

00:12:09.413 --> 00:12:11.515
BUT I LEARNED
SOMETHING SINCE
I ARRIVED HERE.

00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:14.885
I LEARNED THAT LIFE
DEALS YOU ALL
KINDS OF CARDS.

00:12:14.885 --> 00:12:17.221
AND SOMETIMES,
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
THE BEST

00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:19.556
OUT OF WHAT YOU GOT.

00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:20.924
AH, THAT'S
SO NICE OF
YOU, BOSS.

00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:23.093
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT ME, HUH?

00:12:23.093 --> 00:12:25.295
ACTUALLY, I WASN'T.

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:28.699
YOU'RE STILL JUST
AS ANNOYING AND REVOLTING
AND NON-EXISTENT AS EVER!

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:30.400
GOT IT?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.202
YOU'RE A DISGUSTING,
LITTLE YELLOW GREMLIN!

00:12:32.202 --> 00:12:34.938
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU,
SO QUIT BUGGING ME!

00:12:34.938 --> 00:12:37.307
DISGUSTING MAYBE,
BUT LITTLE AND YELLOW?

00:12:37.307 --> 00:12:39.009
GET YOUR EYES CHECKED.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.845
NOW BACK TO THE DUEL.
I PLAY THE ALLIED FORCES!

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.146
IT ALLOWS ALL
WARRIOR-TYPE MONSTERS

00:12:43.146 --> 00:12:45.749
TO GAIN 200 ATTACK POINTS

00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:48.418
FOR EACH WARRIOR-TYPE
MONSTER OUT
ON THE FIELD,

00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:50.988
WHICH MEANS
MARAUDING CAPTAIN

00:12:50.988 --> 00:12:53.290
NOW HAS 2,800
ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.359
NOW GO!

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:58.061
SMASH THAT RAT!

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.699
HE'S DEFENSELESS!
CHARGE IN, MEN!

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:07.204
SORRY, BUT I PLAY
MY RAT'S ABILITY!

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:09.806
IT LETS ME SUMMON
AN EARTH-ATTRIBUTE
MONSTER

00:13:09.806 --> 00:13:12.409
WITH 1,500 OR FEWER
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:12.409 --> 00:13:15.379
SO COME ON OUT,
GYAKU-GIRE PANDA!

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.881
[GROWLING]

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:21.218
LOOK AT THE BIG
TEDDY BEAR. HOW CUDDLY!

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:24.021
YOU MAY NOT
THINK SO
AFTER THIS!

00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:25.522
I PLAY PANDA'S
ABILITY.

00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:27.491
FOR EVERY MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.626
HE GAINS 500
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:34.164
NOT SO
CUDDLY NOW, IS HE?

00:13:34.164 --> 00:13:37.768
AND NEXT I'M GOING
TO ACTIVATE A TRAP--
RING OF DESTRUCTION.

00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:41.338
THIS TRAP DESTROYS
ONE MONSTER,

00:13:41.338 --> 00:13:43.473
AND THEN ALL PLAYERS
TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL

00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:45.809
TO THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:47.077
BUT WHY?

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.313
WE'LL ALL JUST END UP
WITH ZERO LIFE POINTS?

00:13:49.313 --> 00:13:54.985
I WON'T, BECAUSE I HAVE
RING OF DEFENSE!

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:57.120
THIS SPELL CARD PROTECTS
ME FROM ALL DAMAGE!

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.458
YOU GO BYE-BYE.

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.940
ALL RIGHT, GRANNY,
OUT OF THE ROCKER!

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.976
YOU'RE UP!

00:14:21.378 --> 00:14:23.246
YEAH, AND YOU'RE
GOING DOWN,

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:24.781
BECAUSE
NOW IT'S THE CZAR

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.249
AGAINST THE PRINCETON

00:14:26.249 --> 00:14:28.752
AND THERE AIN'T
NO WAY I'M GONNA GET
SHOVED OFF MY THRONE

00:14:28.752 --> 00:14:31.655
BY YOU!
GET READY FOR
A BATTLE ROYAL!

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:36.752
Together: DUEL!

00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:38.320
ME FIRST.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.891
AND I'M GOING
TO ACTIVATE TWO COPIES
OF FIEND'S SANCTUARY.

00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:45.060
NOW I GET TWO
METAL FIEND TOKENS.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.630
BUT, LIKE YOU, THEY
WON'T BE STAYING LONG.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.065
I SACRIFICE THEM
AND SUMMON ZOA!

00:14:52.034 --> 00:14:53.869
NEXT, I'LL PLACE
TWO FACEDOWNS

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:55.471
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:55.471 --> 00:14:58.240
HA! ALREADY MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD'S STACKED!

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.142
SEE HOW IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH THE CZAR!

00:15:00.142 --> 00:15:04.079
BUT IT'LL END
THE SAME! MY TURN!

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.849
AW, YOU AGAIN?

00:15:06.849 --> 00:15:08.551
NICE TO SEE
YOU, TOO!

00:15:08.551 --> 00:15:10.653
NEED ME TO FIGHT
A MONSTER FOR YA?
LET'S DO IT!

00:15:10.653 --> 00:15:13.155
WHOA. NEVER MIND.

00:15:13.155 --> 00:15:16.692
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I FINALLY FOUND A WAY
TO GET RID OF YOU.

00:15:16.692 --> 00:15:18.961
I PLAY OJAMA YELLOW!

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.529
NO! PLEASE!
ANYONE BUT ME!

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:24.300
THEN I'LL TOSS
TWO FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.468
HA HA HA! TIME OUT!

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.771
SOME GARBAGE HAS
BLOWN ONTO THE FIELD.

00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:32.408
OH, WAIT. I'M SORRY.
THAT'S JUST YOUR MONSTER.

00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:34.710
OH, WELL, HE'S GOING
TO BE TRASHED ANYWAY.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.812
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
METALMORPH!

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:39.448
AND I'LL EQUIP IT TO ZOA!

00:15:39.448 --> 00:15:41.250
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO SACRIFICE ZOA,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.219
SO I CAN SUMMON
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER!

00:15:46.768 --> 00:15:48.804
THE FEROCIOUS METALZOA!

00:15:52.874 --> 00:15:54.810
AAH!

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.280
AND NEXT I'M
GOING TO ACTIVATE
ANOTHER TRAP CARD--

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.015
CALL OF THE HAUNTED!

00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:03.285
NOW I CAN BRING BACK ONE
MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:16:03.285 --> 00:16:05.453
AND I'LL BRING BACK
REGULAR ZOA!

00:16:05.453 --> 00:16:07.789
[GROWLS]

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:09.291
BOY, OH, BOY.

00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:13.128
TWO MONSTERS WITH
2,600 AND 3,000
ATTACK POINTS?

00:16:13.128 --> 00:16:14.896
WHAT ON EARTH ARE
YOU GONNA DO, CHAZZ?

00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:16.698
EASY. I'M GONNA WIN.

00:16:16.698 --> 00:16:20.402
YA KNOW, TALKING
TO YOURSELF IS
PRETTY CRAZY AS IT IS,

00:16:20.402 --> 00:16:22.938
BUT THINKING
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN?
EVEN CRAZIER.

00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:24.272
KNOW WHY?!

00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:27.342
'CAUSE I JUST WATCHED YOU
DUEL 49 TIMES.

00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:29.110
I KNOW YOUR DECK!

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.214
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE ONE MONSTER
AS STRONG AS THESE!

00:16:32.214 --> 00:16:33.748
Thinking: MAYBE,
BUT I KNOW HOW TO MAKE

00:16:33.748 --> 00:16:35.884
THE BEST OUT OF
WHAT I GOT.

00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:38.520
ALL RIGHT, ZOA, ATTACK!

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.955
GLIMMER STRIKE!

00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:41.623
[GROWLING]

00:16:41.623 --> 00:16:42.624
[SCREAMING]

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.729
AND NOW THAT HE'S
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF,

00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:50.899
METALZOA'S GOING TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU!

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:52.968
HARDENED GLIMMER STRIKE!

00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:00.506
A PRINCE'S PLACE IS
AT THE HEEL OF THE CZAR,

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:02.675
AND THAT IS JUST
WHERE I'M GOING TO PUT YOU.

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:05.244
YEAH, DON'T BET
ON IT.

00:17:05.244 --> 00:17:07.947
SEE, I WAS
WAITING FOR YOU
TO ATTACK ME

00:17:07.947 --> 00:17:11.984
SO I COULD PLAY
INFERNO TEMPEST!

00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:15.554
WITH THIS CARD,
WHEN I TAKE 3,000 OR
MORE POINTS OF DAMAGE,

00:17:15.554 --> 00:17:17.857
ALL MONSTERS IN BOTH
OUR GRAVEYARDS AND DECKS

00:17:17.857 --> 00:17:19.992
ARE TAKEN OUT OF PLAY.

00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:22.795
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?!

00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:25.331
IF YOU KNOW
MY DECK AS WELL AS
YOU SAY YOU DO,

00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:27.333
THEN I'M SURE
YOU KNOW.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:30.236
AND YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR REIGN AS CZAR
IS COMING TO AN END.

00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:31.871
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:17:31.871 --> 00:17:33.472
I HAVE TWO MONSTERS OUT!

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:35.141
YOU HAVE NONE!

00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:37.209
AND NOW YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE ANY IN YOUR
DECK. YOU'VE LOST!

00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:39.745
MY REIGN'S NOT OVER.
IT'S NEVER BEEN STRONGER!

00:17:39.745 --> 00:17:41.113
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE!

00:17:41.113 --> 00:17:44.884
OH, AM I?
WE'LL SEE HERE!

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:48.687
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, CZAR, YOU,
MY FRIEND,

00:17:48.687 --> 00:17:50.356
ARE ABOUT TO GET
ROYALLY CROWNED

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:52.224
AND NOT IN
A GOOD WAY!

00:17:52.224 --> 00:17:54.660
I PLAY THE SPELL
CHAOS END!

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.329
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:17:57.329 --> 00:17:59.765
WELL, THAT'S THE MAGIC
OF CHAOS END--

00:17:59.765 --> 00:18:02.935
WHEN 7 OR MORE CARDS ARE
REMOVED FROM THE GAME,

00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:05.971
CHAOS END DESTROYS
EVERY MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD!

00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.307
NO WAY.

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:12.278
AND NOW I'LL PLAY
A TRAP THAT'S A BLAST
FROM THE PAST--

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:15.581
RETURN FROM
THE DIFFERENT
DIMENSION.

00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:17.516
BY PAYING HALF
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:19.318
THE MONSTERS
I REMOVED FROM PLAY

00:18:19.318 --> 00:18:22.621
ARE ALLOWED TO BE
BROUGHT BACK AND
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD--

00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:24.256
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM!

00:18:24.256 --> 00:18:27.193
NOW, COME ON BACK,
EVERYONE!

00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:33.866
HEY, THANKS, BOSS!

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:36.435
I MEANT EVERYONE,
EXCEPT YOU.

00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:37.736
[CRYING]

00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:39.839
NO, WAIT! STOP!

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.274
STOP? I DON'T
THINK SO.

00:18:42.274 --> 00:18:44.143
NOW, GIVE THE CZAR
A KING-SIZED
CLOBBERING!

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:53.185
AAH!

00:18:53.185 --> 00:18:55.521
YOU GO BYE-BYE!

00:18:57.022 --> 00:18:58.924
WELL-DONE.

00:18:58.924 --> 00:19:01.026
YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT
TO BE CALLED THE BEST.

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:04.763
IT'S YOU--THE GUY
WHO RESCUED ME!

00:19:04.763 --> 00:19:06.665
BUT HOW'D YOU GET
IN TO THE SCHOOL?

00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:09.435
WHY, YOU LET ME
IN, OF COURSE.

00:19:09.435 --> 00:19:13.505
HUH? WAIT.
NOW YOU'RE
THE BALD GUY?

00:19:13.505 --> 00:19:15.875
I'M THIS SCHOOL'S
CHANCELLOR.
THE NAME'S FOSTER.

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:18.510
AND THE CAMP OUTSIDE,
THAT SUB OUT AT SEA,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.713
IT WAS ALL JUST TO GET
TO YOU, YOUNG DUELIST.

00:19:20.713 --> 00:19:22.448
TO ME? WHAT FOR?

00:19:22.448 --> 00:19:24.183
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A GIFT, CHAZZ.

00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:27.887
AND I SENSED IT
AS SOON AS YOU HANDLED
THAT OJAMA YELLOW CARD.

00:19:27.887 --> 00:19:29.922
I HATE
THAT STINKING CARD!

00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:31.957
YOU MIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU'LL LEARN.

00:19:31.957 --> 00:19:34.226
HOPEFULLY IN TIME
FOR THE SCHOOL DUEL.

00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:36.762
YOU SEE, CHAZZ, YOU'RE
NOW THE BEST DUELIST

00:19:36.762 --> 00:19:38.330
AT NORTH ACADEMY.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.734
THAT MEANS YOU
WILL BE OUR REPRESENTATIVE
IN THE SCHOOL DUEL.

00:19:41.734 --> 00:19:44.536
SO I'M GOING UP
AGAINST SOMEONE
FROM DUEL ACADEMY?

00:19:44.536 --> 00:19:46.105
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:46.105 --> 00:19:47.773
WE HAD CHOSEN CZAR
AT FIRST,

00:19:47.773 --> 00:19:49.842
BUT CLEARLY HE'S NOT
NEARLY AS GOOD AS YOU ARE.

00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:51.810
BESIDES, TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH, I NEVER
REALLY LIKE HIM.

00:19:53.512 --> 00:19:55.180
Chazz:
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.116
I MEAN, WHAT
KIND OF DUELIST SITS
IN A ROCKING CHAIR?

00:19:57.116 --> 00:19:59.785
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU'RE THE TOP
DUELIST NOW.

00:19:59.785 --> 00:20:01.487
IT'S TO YOU
THE SCHOOL BOWS.

00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:04.723
SO WHO'S THE UNLUCKY
PUNK I'M DUELING?

00:20:04.723 --> 00:20:06.859
WHO? THE ONE
I PROMISED YOU.

00:20:06.859 --> 00:20:08.894
THE ONE CALLED
JADEN YUKI.

00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:11.430
JADEN? YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.733
NO. THIS IS YOUR
CHANCE FOR REVENGE.

00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:16.769
REVENGE! HEH HEH.

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:18.504
I CAN'T WAIT!

00:20:18.504 --> 00:20:21.340
I'M GOING TO BEAT HIM
SO BAD, HE'S NEVER GONNA
WANT TO DUEL AGAIN!

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.908
