WEBVTT

00:00:01.298 --> 00:00:03.004
LAST TIME
ON YU-GI-OH! GX...

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.477
ALL RIGHT, KAGEMARU,
GET YOUR GAME ON.

00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:08.051
I SACRIFICE
MY THREE TRAP CARDS

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:10.391
TO SUMMON THE FIRST
SACRED BEAST--

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:14.336
URIA, LORD
OF SEARING FLAMES.

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:17.545
NOW I SACRIFICE
THESE THREE SPELL CARDS

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:19.918
TO SUMMON
THE SECOND SACRED BEAST--

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:24.131
HAMON, LORD
OF STRIKING THUNDER.

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:27.941
ONCE THIS SHADOW GAME ENDS
AND YOU LAY DEFEATED,

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.950
I WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO BECOME

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.959
THE NEW MASTER
OF THE SACRED BEASTS,

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:37.269
GIVING ME ENOUGH STRENGTH
TO RULE THE WORLD.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.451
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE
A MERE FRACTION OF THEIR POWER.

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.222
[ROARING]

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.468
AH!
AH!

00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:50.974
I LIKE THIS NEW BODY,

00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:54.518
BUT SOMETHING'S
STILL MISSING.

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:56.022
AH.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.827
I KNOW.
IT'S YOUR SOUL, JADEN.

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.903
NOW LET'S FINISH
THIS DUEL.

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:02.474

STARING DOWN
TWO SACRED BEASTS

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.405
WITHOUT ONE MONSTER
ON MY FIELD?

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:12.776
NOT GOOD.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:15.116
DAUNTING, ISN'T IT?
FEAR NOT.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:18.192
MY SACRED BEASTS WILL
END THIS FOR YOU SOON.

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:21.133
WE'LL JUST SEE.
MY TURN.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.972
AND I SUMMON
A DUELIST'S BEST FRIEND.

00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:25.747
GO, WROUGHTWEILER!
GOOD BOY.

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:27.151
JUST HEEL FOR NOW.

00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:30.494
NEXT I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN.

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:32.767
HA HA HA! A FACEDOWN
AND A DUEL DOGGIE?

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.141
THAT'S YOUR BIG MOVE?

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:38.182
THAT'S HOW YOU PLAN
TO STOP MY TWO SACRED BEASTS?

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:42.061
PLEASE, DON'T INSULT THEM.
AFTER ALL, IT'S THESE MONSTERS

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.202
THAT WILL SOON EMPOWER ME
TO RULE THE WORLD.

00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:46.205
AH...

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.047
NOW, THEN, WHERE WERE WE?

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:52.323
AH, YES, DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF MY FIELD SPELL,

00:02:52.323 --> 00:02:55.532
FALLEN PARADISE,
ONCE PER TURN I AM ALLOWED

00:02:55.532 --> 00:02:58.373
TO ADD TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:01.616
AND NEXT I'M GOING TO
WAGE AN ATTACK WITH HAMON,

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:05.260
LORD OF STRIKING THUNDER.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.174
GO, CERULEAN SKYFIRE!

00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:12.413
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
HAMON'S EFFECT.

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.253
YOU SEE, WHEN HE
DESTROYS YOUR MONSTER,

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:17.395
HE ALSO DEALS
1,000 DAMAGE POINTS...

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:19.768
STRAIGHT TO YOU, JADEN.

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.306
HANG ON, JAY!

00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:22.610
AAH!

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.847
AAH!

00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:25.184
UH!

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:26.855
WHOA! UH!

00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:28.527
NICE SPECIAL EFFECTS.

00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.199
BUT I'VE GOT ONE, TOO--

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.736
MY WROUGHTWEILER!

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:34.411
IT ACTIVATES WHEN HE'S
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:36.550
NOW I CAN ADD
ONE ELEMENTAL HERO

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.857
AND ONE POLYMERIZATION

00:03:38.857 --> 00:03:41.129
FROM MY GRAVE
TO MY HAND,

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.634
AND THE HERO I'M PICKING
IS BUBBLEMAN!

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:46.646
HA! TOO BAD YOU WON'T EVER GET
THE CHANCE TO SUMMON HIM.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.651
WE'LL SEE ABOUT
THAT, KAGEMARU.

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:51.292
NOW FINISH
YOUR TURN.

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.298
FINE, BUT IT'S NOT
JUST MY TURN

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.304
THAT'S ABOUT
TO BE FINISHED.

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:56.674
IT'S YOU
AS WELL, JADEN.

00:03:56.674 --> 00:04:00.418
ATTACK, URIA!

00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:07.238
HYPER BLAZE!

00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:08.241
IT'S ALL OVER!

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:09.244
WE'RE DONE FOR!

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:11.283
JADEN, NO!

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.255
NOT SO FAST, KAGEMARU.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.258
I PLAY MY SPELL CARD--

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.799
FLUTE OF SUMMONING
KURIBOH.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.002
IT LETS ME SUMMON
WINGED KURIBOH

00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:19.005
FROM MY DECK.

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.415
AAH!

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:24.387
PURE LUCK.

00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:26.493
NAH. THAT'S
PURE KURIBOH.

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.638
HMM?

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.310
WHAT'S THIS?

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.446
IT'S BANNER'S CARD,

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.652
THE ONE THAT WAS
IN THAT BOOK OF HIS.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:37.960
HMM...

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.734
AND I GOT A HUNCH THAT
HE WANTED ME TO HAVE IT

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:42.740
SO THAT I COULD
BEAT YOU.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.247
YOU GIVE HIM
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:47.854
HE WAS A DULLARD,
A SIMPLE PAWN I USED...

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.526
LIKE YOU ARE.

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:50.930
YOU WISH!

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.768
OH, BUT IT'S
SO TRUE, JADEN.

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:54.641
YOUR SOUL--
ONCE I WIN IT,

00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.811
MY REIGN'S ASSURED.

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.318
YEAH, AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WON'T WIN IT!

00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:00.691
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO BUBBLEMAN!

00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:03.767
YAH!

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.438
AND IF BUBBLEMAN'S
ALL ALONE

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.444
WHEN I SUMMON HIM
OUT ON MY FIELD,

00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:10.687
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS.

00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:12.626
AND NOW I'LL PLAY
ONE OF THEM--

00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:14.331
THE SPELL CARD
METAMORPHOSIS!

00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:16.604
NOW I CAN SACRIFICE
MY BUBBLEMAN

00:05:16.604 --> 00:05:17.673
TO SUMMON UP
A FUSION MONSTER

00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:20.046
THAT'S THE SAME
LEVEL AS HE IS,

00:05:20.046 --> 00:05:25.328
SUCH AS ELEMENTAL
HERO NEO BUBBLEMAN!

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:28.471
HUH! YOU'VE JUST SACRIFICED
ONE WEAKLING FOR ANOTHER.

00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.446
OH, YEAH? GUESS
IT'S A GOOD THING

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.151
I HAVE THIS, THEN--

00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:34.556
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:40.974
NOW GO, NEO BUBBLE MAN!
ATTACK!

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:43.347
BUBBLE SLAMMING STREAM!

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:45.486
YOU THINK THAT LITTLE
WATER GUN MAKES A DIFFERENCE?

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:47.492
HAMON, STRIKE BACK.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.460
HAMON! HE'S BEEN DESTROYED!

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.664
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:03.672
IT'S NEO BUBBLEMAN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:06:03.672 --> 00:06:05.410
WHEN HE BATTLES
WITH A MONSTER,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.848
THAT MONSTER
IS DESTROYED.

00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:07.917
BUT HE WAS STRONGER,

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:09.890
SO YOU SHOULD STILL
TAKE DAMAGE.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.561
SHOULD'VE, WOULD'VE,
COULD'VE.

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:14.403
SORRY, BUT BY JUST DESTROYING
BUBBLE BLASTER,

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:15.940
ALL DAMAGE YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
BECOMES ZERO.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.578
NICE MOVE.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.919
WHAT'S WHAT I
WOULD HAVE DONE.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.524
YEAH! WAY
TO PLAY, JAY!

00:06:21.524 --> 00:06:23.195
NEXT, I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:24.866
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:26.604
YOUR LAST TURN.

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:29.547
FIRST, DUE TO FALLEN
PARADISE, I GET TO ADD

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:31.050
TWO MORE CARDS
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.226
AND NOW, URIA,

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:38.573
FINISH HIM
WITH HYPER BLAZE!

00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:41.681
DO YOUR STUFF!
BUBBLE ILLUSION!

00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.787
SEE, WHEN BUBBLE MAN
IS ON THE FIELD

00:06:43.787 --> 00:06:46.128
AND I USE THIS,
I CAN PLAY A TRAP,

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:49.035
AND IT COMES STRAIGHT
FROM MY HAND.

00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:51.142
AND I'LL CHOSE
THIS ONE--

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:52.546
HERO'S RULE ONE,
FIVE FREEDOMS.

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:55.587
FIVE TRAPS NOW LEAVE
THE GRAVEYARD.

00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:56.725
THEY WHAT?

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:58.931
THAT'S RIGHT,
REMOVED FROM THE GAME.

00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.237
SO GO AHEAD AND SAY
ALL YOUR GOODBYES.

00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:02.809
WELL DONE. WITH THOSE
TRAPS NOW GONE,

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:07.154
URIA'S ATTACK POINTS
WILL GO DOWN DRAMATICALLY.

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:08.859
YEAH, A THOUSAND
PER TRAP CARD,

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:11.835
WHICH MEANS URIA'S
NEW ATTACK POINTS WILL BE--

00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:14.576
ZERO, NOTHING,
A BIG FAT GOOSE EGG.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:19.523
ALL RIGHT!
NOW NEO BUBBLEMAN'S

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:21.529
GOT THE EDGE
IN THIS FIGHT.

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.136
SO GO!
LET HIM HAVE IT!

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.173
AH!

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.229
AAH!

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.867
GRR!

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:38.076
YOU'RE ONLY POSTPONING
THE INEVITABLE!

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:40.584
YOU CAN'T STOP
THE BEASTS,

00:07:40.584 --> 00:07:41.754
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS.

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:43.024
WELL DONE. WITH THOSE
TRAPS NOW GONE,

00:07:43.024 --> 00:07:44.027
URIA'S ATTACK POINTS
WILL GO DOWN DRAMATICALLY.

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:45.130
I PLAY
RESURRECTION TRIBUTE.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.601
NOW, SINCE MY MONSTER
WAS DESTROYED,

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.707
I CAN DESTROY
ONE OF YOURS,

00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:49.944
MEANING THAT BUBBLEMAN
WILL NOW BURST.

00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:52.183
AH!

00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:53.855
BUT THERE'S MORE, JADEN.

00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:56.228
I ALSO GET TO SUMMON
BACK A MONSTER

00:07:56.228 --> 00:07:59.638
FROM MY GRAVE TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:03.750
SO RISE AGAIN, HAMON!

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:11.138
AND NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
URIA'S SPECIAL EFFECT

00:08:11.138 --> 00:08:12.676
BY DISCARDING A TRAP
FROM MY HAND.

00:08:12.676 --> 00:08:17.222
WELL, THEN,
URIA, RESURRECT!

00:08:17.222 --> 00:08:18.893
[GASPS]

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:26.248
[ROAR]

00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:28.087
OH, GREAT.

00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:30.092
NOT AGAIN.

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:33.101
AND THEN I'LL
ACTIVATE THE SPELL...

00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:34.839
PHANTASMAL MARTYRS!

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.177
WHEN URIA AND HAMON
ARE BOTH OUT,

00:08:36.177 --> 00:08:40.188
I CAN SEND TWO CARDS
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:43.030
AND THEN I CAN SUMMON
THREE OF THESE--

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.004
PHANTASMAL MARTYR TOKENS!

00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:53.694
AND SINCE HE SENT THE TRAP CARD
DIVINE WRATH TO THE GRAVE,

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:56.936
URIA'S DEFENSE POINTS
INCREASE TO 2,000.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.942
JUST LIKE THAT,
MY TWO BEASTS ARE OUT AGAIN.

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:01.817
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE BACK
WHERE YOU STARTED,

00:09:01.817 --> 00:09:04.056
BUT YOU'RE NOT,
BECAUSE NOW

00:09:04.056 --> 00:09:06.898
I'M SACRIFICING
THE THREE PHANTASMAL TOKENS

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:09.840
AND SUMMONING
MY LAST SACRED BEAST.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.347
SO, YOU SEE, THINGS
ARE NOT THE SAME.

00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:15.422
THEY'RE MUCH,
MUCH WORSE!

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:16.793
[SHOUTING]

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:24.013
BEHOLD RAVIEL,
LORD OF PHANTASMS!

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:33.039
OK. DEFINITELY
NOT FRIENDLY.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:36.483
NOT GOOD. HE'S GATHERED
ALL THREE OF THEM OUT AT ONCE.

00:09:47.147 --> 00:09:49.320
WHAT THE...
THE CARDS!

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.562
[WHIMPERING]

00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:54.367
[SOBBING]

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:57.310
ALL OUR CARDS!

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.616
THEY'RE VANISHING!

00:09:59.616 --> 00:10:00.619
HUH?

00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:02.123
OJAMA YELLOW!

00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:06.134
HA HA HA! YES.
COME TO ME. COME TO ME!

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.280
COME TO ME!

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.319
THAT'S FREAKY.

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:14.359
OH, MY! WHY,
IT'S AS THOUGH

00:10:14.359 --> 00:10:17.300
KAGEMARU IS SOMEHOW ABSORBING
DUEL MONSTERS

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.206
AND USING THEIR ENERGIES.

00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:21.913
THAT'S NOT
IN THE RULES.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.053
THE SPIRITS SENSE
YOU'RE CLOSE TO DEFEAT.

00:10:24.053 --> 00:10:26.359
ALREADY THEY'RE SURRENDERING
THEMSELVES TO ME,

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.399
YIELDING TO ME
THEIR MIGHT

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:31.408
SO THAT I CAN FREE
THE THREE SACRED BEASTS

00:10:31.408 --> 00:10:33.514
AND RULE THE WORLD
WITH A NEW LIFE

00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:35.686
THAT WILL BE ETERNAL.

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:37.893
SO THEN, IF JADEN
LOSES THIS...

00:10:37.893 --> 00:10:39.330
EVERY DUEL SPIRIT
OUT THERE

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.600
WILL BE SUCKED UP.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.038
HMM.

00:10:42.038 --> 00:10:43.275
SORRY, KAGEMARU,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:47.922
THAT I'M LETTING YOU
DO THAT TO MY FRIENDS.

00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:49.593
SPIRITS AREN'T
FOR BEING FRIENDS WITH.

00:10:49.593 --> 00:10:52.134
THEY'RE FOR USING
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:54.908
AND RIGHT NOW, I'M
GOING TO USE THEM, JADEN,

00:10:54.908 --> 00:10:56.345
TO DESTROY YOU!

00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:05.706
TIME TO STEP UP.
MY DRAW.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:07.645
I PLAY
THE SPELL CARD

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:10.018
DARK FACTORY
OF MASS PRODUCTION.

00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:12.091
SO NOW I CAN TAKE
TWO MONSTERS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:15.133
AND ADD THEM
STRAIGHT TO MY HAND,

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.239
AND THE ONES THAT
I'M PICKING ARE...

00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:19.712
BURSTINATRIX
AND AVIAN!

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:22.287
AND NEXT I'M
GOING TO PLAY THIS--

00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:23.991
POLYMERIZATION--

00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:27.267
TO CREATE THE ELEMENTAL

00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:29.541
HERO FLAME WINGMAN!

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:32.182
VERY WELL, BUT NOW RAVIEL'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:11:32.182 --> 00:11:35.525
YOU SEE, WHEN YOU
SUMMON A MONSTER,

00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:38.499
I GET TO SUMMON
A SACRED BEAST TOKEN.

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:43.514
HMM...WITH THE FLAME
WINGMAN OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:11:43.514 --> 00:11:45.286
I CAN DESTROY URIA
THIS TURN,

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:48.695
BUT IF I DO THAT,
THOSE OTHER TWO SACRED BEASTS,

00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:51.003
HAMON AND RAVIEL,
WILL TAKE ME OUT

00:11:51.003 --> 00:11:52.774
NEXT TURN FOR SURE.

00:11:57.388 --> 00:12:00.329
Voice: JADEN. JADEN.

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:03.773
WHO'S THERE?
PROFESSOR BANNER?

00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:05.176
OH...

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:06.313
[MEOWING]

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.690
NOT NOW, PHARAOH!

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.267
JADEN, YOU MUST
USE THE CARD NOW.

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.506
BUT USE IT HOW?

00:12:15.506 --> 00:12:17.211
THAT IS FOR YOU
TO DECIDE,

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:19.417
FOR YOU SEE, IT IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS OWNER.

00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:21.590
IT WILL GRANT YOU
THREE CARD COVETS.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.793
THAT IS,
IT WILL TRANSFORM

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:26.270
INTO WHATEVER CARD
YOU WISH THREE TIMES.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.483
THEN, AFTER THE THIRD COVET,
ITS TRUE POWER WILL BE REVEALED,

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:33.792
AND IF YOU HAVE PLAYED
YOUR CARD RIGHT, IT WILL--

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:35.630
HUH? OH!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.803
[MEOWING]

00:12:37.803 --> 00:12:40.845
SO I JUST THINK
OF A CARD I NEED?

00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:42.617
WELL, I GUESS IT
COULDN'T HURT TO TRY.

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.835
OH, IT'S THE EXACT
CARD I WANTED.

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:52.077
HA! THANKS, BANNER.

00:12:52.077 --> 00:12:54.585
ALL RIGHT,
I'M ACTIVATING

00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:56.758
THE SPELL CARD
FUSION RECOVERY!

00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:58.764
SO WHAT? THAT WON'T
CHANGE A THING.

00:12:58.764 --> 00:13:00.702
IT COULD.
IT ALL JUST DEPENDS

00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:02.675
ON HOW HE PLAYS IT.

00:13:02.675 --> 00:13:05.684
NOW POLYMERIZATION
AND SPARKMAN

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.355
RETURN TO MY HAND
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:10.898
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
POLYMERIZATION,

00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:14.375
AND THAT MEANS
THE ELEMENTAL HERO

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:17.283
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN
IS CREATED!

00:13:17.283 --> 00:13:20.025
THEN I GET ANOTHER TOKEN.

00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:21.395
COOL, BECAUSE I GET
SOMETHING, TOO--

00:13:21.395 --> 00:13:24.371
300 ATTACK POINTS
FOR FLARE WINGMAN

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.713
FOR EACH HERO THAT I
HAVE IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:13:27.713 --> 00:13:30.655
AND RIGHT NOW, THERE'S
A TOTAL OF SEVEN!

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:36.573
THAT CAN'T BE!
4,600 POINTS?

00:13:36.573 --> 00:13:38.411
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND HE'S GOT

00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:40.249
A SPECIAL ABILITY
TO BOOT.

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:41.252
SEE, WHEN
FLARE WINGMAN

00:13:41.252 --> 00:13:43.926
DESTROYS A MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:13:43.926 --> 00:13:45.765
HE DEALS DAMAGE
TO YOU EQUAL TO

00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:47.637
THAT DESTROYED MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:47.637 --> 00:13:48.874
WAIT. SO--

00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:53.655
SO...GO AND GET HIM,
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:54.925
SHINING EMERALD ORB!

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:08.063
AAH!

00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:10.469
AND NOW, WINGMAN,
LIGHT UP KAGEMARU

00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:13.712
WITH YOUR SPECIAL
ABILITY!

00:14:15.818 --> 00:14:16.821
AAH!

00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:17.824
[GASPS]

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.797
HUH?

00:14:19.797 --> 00:14:21.868
HA HA HA. A GOOD TRY.

00:14:21.868 --> 00:14:24.877
BUT IF HAMON IS DESTROYED
WHILE IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:24.877 --> 00:14:28.788
ALL DAMAGE TO ME
BECOMES ZERO.

00:14:28.788 --> 00:14:32.633
OH! ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
MY SECOND CARD COVET.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:37.146
OK. NOW I'LL THROW DOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:38.149
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.857
AND I'LL BEGIN MINE.

00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:43.364
FIRST, DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF FALLEN PARADISE,

00:14:43.364 --> 00:14:45.637
I ADD TWO EXTRA CARDS
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:49.348
SECOND, I'LL SWITCH URIA
FROM DEFENSE MODE

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:50.952
TO ATTACK MODE.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.101
AND THEN I'LL PLAY
RAVIEL'S EFFECT

00:14:56.101 --> 00:14:59.343
BY SACRIFICING TWO
MONSTERS ON MY FIELD.

00:14:59.343 --> 00:15:01.583
FOR THIS TURN ONLY,
I CAN ADD

00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:05.594
THOSE MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS TO RAVIEL'S.

00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:08.636
SO THAT'S WHY
HE SUMMONED THOSE TOKENS,

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:10.709
TO POWER UP RAVIEL

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.547
AND POWER DOWN JADEN.

00:15:15.728 --> 00:15:22.910
GO, RAVIEL!
CLEAN YOUR CLAWS

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.063
WITH THAT SHINING
FLARE WINGMAN!

00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:30.617
I PLAY A FACEDOWN,

00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:31.795
A FACEDOWN
THAT HAPPENS TO BE...

00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:34.655
THE SECOND CARD
I WISHED FOR--

00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:36.707
DE-FUSION!

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:41.048
VERY WELL, BUT DE-FUSION
COUNTS AS TWO SUMMONINGS,

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:42.395
WHICH MEANS TWO TOKENS.

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:44.817
NOW, RAVIEL, GO ON.

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:49.124
DESTROY THE ELEMENTAL
FLAME WINGMAN

00:15:49.124 --> 00:15:52.422
WITH SHIMMERING SCRAPER!

00:15:55.216 --> 00:15:58.951
AND NOW URIA WILL
FINISH OFF THE OTHER ONE.

00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:00.028
HYPER BLAZE!

00:16:03.933 --> 00:16:05.177
AAH!

00:16:05.177 --> 00:16:07.465
OH, YEAH? HUH!

00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:09.922
I SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN!

00:16:09.922 --> 00:16:13.456
ANOTHER BEAST TOKEN
FOR ME.

00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:17.225
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT--
MY LAST CARD COVET.

00:16:19.614 --> 00:16:21.196
I PLAY MIRACLE FUSION!

00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.614
WITH THIS,
I CAN TAKE MONSTERS

00:16:26.614 --> 00:16:29.103
FROM MY FIELD AND GRAVE
AND COMBINE THEM

00:16:29.103 --> 00:16:32.266
TO CREATE
A FUSION MONSTER.

00:16:32.266 --> 00:16:34.925
SO I REMOVE THE BUBBLEMAN,
AVIAN, AND BURSTINATRIX

00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:36.843
THAT ARE IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:16:36.843 --> 00:16:40.209
AND THE CLAYMAN
THAT'S ON MY FIELD

00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:44.449
TO SUMMON ELEMENTAL
HERO ELECTRUM!

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.382
ALL RIGHT, THE THIRD
CARD COVET'S BEEN USED.

00:16:51.382 --> 00:16:53.736
TIME TO SEE WHAT THIS
THING'S TRUE POWER IS

00:16:53.736 --> 00:16:56.429
AND TO SEE IF I'VE
PLAYED MY CARDS RIGHT.

00:16:56.429 --> 00:17:02.016
HUH! ALL RIGHT,
NEXT I PLAY SABATIEL

00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:03.026
THE PHILOSOPHER'S
STONE!
