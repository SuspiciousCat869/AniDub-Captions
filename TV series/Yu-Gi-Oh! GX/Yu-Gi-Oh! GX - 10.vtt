JUST LOOK AT THEM!

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:10.143
PATHETIC SLIFERS LITTERING
THE CAMPUS LIKE VERMIN!

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.446
THE HALLOWED HALLS
OF MY DUEL ACADEMY

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.715
ARE FOR THE ELITE;
NOT THE LAME!

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.050
NOT JADEN YUKI!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.889
THAT SLIFER SLACKER'S MADE
A FOOL OF ME LONG ENOUGH!

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.223
UH-OH!

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.559

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.061
BUT SOON HE WILL PAY
MOST DEARLY FOR IT!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.098

HE WILL BE THE FOOL!

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.733

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.202
AH, CHAZZ, HOW MAY I
BE OF SERVICE?

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.937
YOU CAN PUT
ME IN THAT TAG
TEAM DUEL

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.172
AGAINST JADEN
AND SYRUS,
THAT'S HOW.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.607
YOU?

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.709
THAT'S RIGHT,
THIS TIME I KNOW
I CAN BEAT HIM

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.177
AND SEND HIM
PACKING!

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.647
SORRY, BUT YOU'LL BE
SITTING THIS DUEL
OUT, CHAZZ.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.881
HUH?

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.350
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
YOUR SKILLS ARE ADMIRABLE,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.587
BUT I'M AFRAID I'M
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES
ON THIS ONE!

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.790
IF JADEN LOSES HERE,
HE'LL BE EXPELLED
FROM THE DUEL ACADEMY

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.559
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.561

AND REMEMBER:
THESE ARE TEST CONDITIONS!

THIS IS
A SUDDEN-EXPULSION MATCH!

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.356

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.865
AND YOU'RE
ALEXIS RHODES, YES?

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.934
YEAH, I'M ALSO WHY

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.838
I SEE.

00:03:57.838 --> 00:03:59.239
BUT NOW,
IF THERE'S ANYONE

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.208
IN NEED OF HELP,

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.210

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:33.733
PERHAPS, AFTER ALL...

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.368
THEY HAVEN'T DUELED
IN AGES

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.003
AND THEIR LAST OPPONENT
WAS A CHILD!

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.840
I BELIEVE HE WENT
BY THE NAME YUGI-SOMETHING.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.675
THE KING OF GAMES?!

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.880
I'VE STUDIED
THESE GUYS!

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.682

THIS IS HARDLY FAIR!

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:54.788
I THINK THAT WAS
CROWLER'S POINT.

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:56.690
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING,
I'D PUT JADEN'S ODDS

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.525

WE CAME...

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:17.811

THEY'VE COME SO FAR!

WHAT'S THAT MATTER?

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:39.032
YOU'RE PAYING
THEIR TRAVEL COSTS!

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:43.370

00:14:52.733 --> 00:14:55.203
HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:56.637
[THINKING]
AW, MAN.

00:14:56.637 --> 00:14:58.439
I HOPE JADEN'S
GOT SOMETHIN' SPECIAL
IN THAT DECK 'A HIS,

00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.841
OR THIS MATCH IS OVER

00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.943
AND SO ARE OUR LIVES
AT THE ACADEMY!

00:15:10.038 --> 00:15:12.407
WELL, THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE HARDER THEY FALL!

00:15:12.407 --> 00:15:14.476
LET'S TAKE THIS THING DOWN!

00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:16.078
Para: I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU TRY,

00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:19.348
SO I WILL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN CARD.

00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:21.383
THEN IT'S TIME
TO GO TO WORK!

00:15:21.383 --> 00:15:23.185
HERE GOES...

00:15:23.185 --> 00:15:24.286
SWEET!

00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:26.288
HMM.

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:29.725
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GETTIN'
CALLED UP, BIG GUY!

00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:35.197
FIRST, I'M GONNA SUMMON
THE ELEMENTAL HERO--CLAYMAN!

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:42.704
AND NEXT,
I PLAY POLYMERIZATION.

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:43.872
HA!

00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:46.408
NOW I'LL FUSE THE CLAYMAN
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:15:46.408 --> 00:15:49.144
TO CREATE THE ELEMENTAL HERO--

00:15:49.144 --> 00:15:51.313
RAMPART BLASTER!

00:15:51.313 --> 00:15:52.314
HE'S BAD!

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.590
YEAH, HE'S BAD,
BUT NOT AS BAD AS
THAT GATE GUARDIAN!

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.859
HE ONLY HAS 2,500
DEFENSE POINTS!

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:06.495
THAT GUARDIAN'S
ATTACK POINTS
ARE 3,750!

00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:07.896
BLASTER
WILL GET BLASTED!

00:16:07.896 --> 00:16:11.667
DON'T SWEAT IT.
THAT'S WHAT HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY IS FOR, SY.

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:13.735
SEE, WHEN HE'S
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:17.172
THE RAMPART BLASTER
CAN ATTACK AN OPPONENT
DIRECTLY!

00:16:17.172 --> 00:16:18.173
OUR LIFE POINTS!

00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:20.809
NOW GO, RAMPART BLASTER!

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:23.111
BLAST 'EM
WITH RAMPART BARRAGE!

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:27.916
AAH!

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:30.185
SURE, IT'S ONLY HALF THE POINTS
YOU'D NORMALLY LOSE,

00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:31.854
BUT HEY,
IT'S A SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.488
WHADAYA GONNA DO?

00:16:33.488 --> 00:16:34.923
A LUCKY MOVE.

00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:37.159
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE BACK
IN THIS THING!

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:39.962
SY! WE WERE
NEVER OUT OF IT!

00:16:39.962 --> 00:16:41.430
[THINKING]
YEAH! JADEN'S RIGHT.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.866
WE CAN WIN THIS!

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:46.268
IT'S MY DRAW NOW!

00:16:46.268 --> 00:16:50.272
I'M ACTIVATING
THE EQUIP SPELL CARD'S
FAIRY METEOR CRUSH,

00:16:50.272 --> 00:16:52.941
AND I'M EQUIPPING IT
TO THE GATE GUARDIAN!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.580
NOW WHEN THE GUARDIAN ATTACKS
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.716
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HIS ATTACK POINTS

00:17:00.716 --> 00:17:02.918
AND YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:05.587
ARE DEALT STRAIGHT
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:07.022
NOT SO FAST!

00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:09.591
YOU'RE FORGETTING
THAT I HAVE
A FACEDOWN CARD OUT!

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:13.128
I'M ACTIVATING
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON!

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.667
IT DESTROYS ONE SPELL
OR TRAP CARD,

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:21.803
AND I'M GONNA USE IT
ON THE ONE THAT YOU
JUST PLAYED--

00:17:21.803 --> 00:17:23.739
FAIRY METEOR CRUSH!

00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:27.509
RIGHT INTO MY TRAP!

00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:29.878
I ACTIVATE
JUDGMENT OF ANUBIS!

00:17:29.878 --> 00:17:30.913
HUH?

00:17:30.913 --> 00:17:32.080
FOOLISH BOY.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.982
THIS LETS ME STOP
YOUR LITTLE SPELL

00:17:33.982 --> 00:17:36.218
SIMPLY BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD.

00:17:36.218 --> 00:17:38.186
YOUR TYPHOON
HAS JUST BEEN DOWNGRADED

00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:40.555
TO A COOL SUMMER BREEZE.

00:17:40.555 --> 00:17:42.424
OBSERVE!

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.361
BUT WAIT!

00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:47.996
THAT'S NOT ALL IT DOES.

00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:50.999
ANUBIS ALSO DESTROYS
ONE OF YOUR CREATURES.

00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:53.402
Dox: AND THEN
ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE DEALT BACK TO YOU.

00:17:53.402 --> 00:17:54.903
PRETTY COOL
SPECIAL FEATURE!

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:01.143
HMM.

00:18:01.143 --> 00:18:03.578
I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE
WE HAVE YOUR BACKS
TO THE WALL,

00:18:03.578 --> 00:18:05.614
BUT IN FACT,
THE WALL'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU!

00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:07.950
I PLAY THIS
TO END MY TURN!

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.685
IT'S CALLED
DEFENSE WALL,

00:18:09.685 --> 00:18:12.821
AND AS LONG AS
IT'S ON THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:16.525
ALL THE MONSTERS
YOU HAVE CAN ONLY
ATTACK HIM!

00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:26.368
THE GATE GUARDIAN ON OFFENSE
AND THAT WALL ON DEFENSE?

00:18:26.368 --> 00:18:27.803
ALMOST FLAWLESS.

00:18:27.803 --> 00:18:29.037
I GET IT!

00:18:29.037 --> 00:18:30.973
NOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE
QUIET, OR SHOULD I MOVE?

00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:37.479
IT'S YOUR TURN.
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:40.549
UH, TO BE HONEST, A MIRACLE.

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:42.050
UH...

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:45.854
I SUMMON CYCROID...

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:47.823
IN, UH, DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:51.326 --> 00:18:53.195
[THINKING]
AW, JADEN'S
LOOKING AT ME.

00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:54.363
I CAN FEEL IT.

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:56.031
I KNOW IT WAS
A WEAK MONSTER,

00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:58.934
BUT IT WAS THE BEST
I COULD DO.

00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:01.436
YOU SUMMON A BIKE?! HA!

00:19:01.436 --> 00:19:03.705
WELL, IT'S IN
FOR A MAJOR FLAT!

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:05.173
GATE GUARDIAN!

00:19:05.173 --> 00:19:06.441
TIDAL SURGE ATTACK!

00:19:11.113 --> 00:19:16.585
AND DON'T FORGET THE EFFECTS
OF THE FAIRY METEOR CRASH
I HAVE HIM EQUIPPED FOR.

00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:19.221
UHH! AAH!

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:21.256
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MY ATTACK POINTS

00:19:21.256 --> 00:19:24.259
AND YOUR DEFENSE POINTS
YOU TAKE AS DAMAGE!

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:26.661
OHH!

00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:28.497
UHH!

00:19:32.601 --> 00:19:34.603
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE FALLING!

00:19:34.603 --> 00:19:37.539
YOUR GAME PLAY'S
APPALLING!

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:39.574
Both: THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE DONE EXCEPT GIVE UP

00:19:39.574 --> 00:19:40.876
AND START BAWLING!

00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:41.943
[LAUGHING]

00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:43.745
Arena Master:
ATTENTION--JADEN YUKI.

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:45.514
IT IS YOUR TURN.

00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:49.985
YOU MUST MAKE A MOVE,
OR YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.
