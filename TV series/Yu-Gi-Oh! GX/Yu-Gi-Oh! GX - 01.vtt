JUST BE

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:53.039
THE SECOND BEST

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:54.040
HUH?!

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.380
WISH ME LUCK, GUYS!

00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:03.083
HEY, WAIT...

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:04.084
HUH?

00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:05.585
IF I'M THE SECOND BEST,

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:06.586
WHO'S FIRST?

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:08.288
HA! YOURS TRULY!

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:09.589
IT'S WHAT
I'M BEST AT!

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.458
[GASPS]

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:12.692
WOW.

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.594
HE'S SO SURE
OF HIMSELF!

00:07:14.594 --> 00:07:16.630
I WONDER IF HE'S
REALLY THAT GOOD.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.897
HE'S GOING TO
NEED TO BE.

00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:19.432
LOOK WHO
HE'S DUELING.

00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:25.939
OOH!

00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:29.676
ALL RIGHT! TEST TIME!

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:36.238
SO, SON,
YOUR NAME?

00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:37.406
HUH?

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:39.241
UH, JADEN,
JADEN YUKI!

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.143
WELL, UH, JADEN YUKI,

HERE AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.584
WOW, A DEPARTMENT CHAIR.

00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:49.652
I HAD NO IDEA--

00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:50.753
FROM HOW
YOU WERE DRESSED...

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:51.854
I WAS THINKING
YOU WERE

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:53.889
SOME KIND OF WEIRD
ACADEMY MASCOT--

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.724
LIKE A MAJORETTE,

00:07:55.724 --> 00:07:57.359
OR A CHEERLEADER.
HA HA!

00:07:57.359 --> 00:07:59.495
HEY, YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT HE
MENTIONS IT--

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.264
THIS KID'S GOT SOME

DUEL VEST ON!

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.671
WOW!

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:13.108
HEY, THAT'S PRETTY
SWEET, TEACH!

00:08:13.108 --> 00:08:14.576
HOW DO I GET
ONE OF THOSE

00:08:14.576 --> 00:08:16.211
COOL BLUE
DUEL BLAZERS?

00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.479
OH, A LOT
OF HARD WORK

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:19.348
AND EXTREMELY
HIGH MARKS.

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:20.382
[THINKING]
OF COURSE,

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:22.184
YOU FIRST HAVE TO
GET IN TO DUEL ACADEMY.

00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:23.719
AND I INTEND
TO MAKE CERTAIN

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:25.087
THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING!

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.256
WELL! I'M READY!

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.824
Both: SO, LET'S DUEL!

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.359
HERE GOES!

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:35.364
SWEET!

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:38.100
I'M GONNA SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.401
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:50.012
I'LL ALSO THROW DOWN
A FACE DOWN.

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:51.180
ALL RIGHT!

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.848
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:54.283
YES, VERY GOOD.

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:56.018
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.120
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.488
[THINKING]
AFTER ALL,

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:02.057
SINCE I'M USING
MY OWN PERSONAL DECK

00:09:02.057 --> 00:09:03.959
RATHER THAN ONE OF
THOSE TEST ONES,

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.228
I'LL BE CALLING
ALL THE SHOTS.

00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:08.630
I'LL FAIL THAT
INSOLENT LITTLE BRAT

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.599
AND SEND HIM HOME
IN NO TIME!

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.701
ALL RIGHT,
FOR THIS FIRST MOVE,

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:14.570
I THINK I'LL START
NICE AND EASY.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.371
I CHOOSE TO PLAY
THE SPELL CARD

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:18.373
CONFISCATION!

00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:20.442
OK, SO WHAT'S IT DO?

00:09:20.442 --> 00:09:24.079
WHAT IT DOES IS ALLOW ME
TO PAY 1,000 LIFE POINTS

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:26.348
FOR THE CHANCE TO
PEAK AT YOUR HAND

00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:27.816
AND TOSS ONE
OF YOUR CARDS

00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:29.318
INTO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:32.955
HMM.

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:34.957
OH, YES, I REMEMBER
SOME OF THESE

00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:37.059
FROM BACK WHEN I WAS
A NAIVE ROOKIE!

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:39.495
HMM, NOW WHICH
SHALL I BANISH?

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.431
MONSTER REBORN,
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:46.235
[GRUNTS]

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:50.005
NEXT, I'LL LAY TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:51.673
AND LAST,
BUT NOT LEAST,

00:09:51.673 --> 00:09:53.776
I'LL PLAY HEAVY STORM!

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.478
THIS SPELL CARD DESTROYS
EVERY OTHER SPELL

00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:59.248
AND TRAP CARD THAT'S
OUT ON THE FIELD!

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:01.116
[CHUCKLES]

WHOOPSIE!

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:11.994
DID YOU FORGET
THAT YOU HAD

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:14.163
TWO TRAP CARDS OUT ON
THE FIELD, YOURSELF?!

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.198
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.833
NOW, NOW,

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.903
YOU MUSTN'T SPEAK
OUT OF TURN, YOUNG SCHOLAR!

00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:22.404
[GRUNTS]

00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:23.472
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:25.140
NOTHING'S HAPPENING!

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.342
NOT YET!

00:10:27.342 --> 00:10:28.777
[HISSING]

00:10:28.777 --> 00:10:30.746
BUT THAT'S
ABOUT TO CHANGE!

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:32.714
[GASPS]

00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:34.783
UH, COULD
SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:34.783 --> 00:10:37.386
THE TWO TRAP CARDS
THAT DR. CROWLER HAD

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.721
ON THE FIELD WERE CALLED
STATUE OF THE WICKED.

00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:41.156
IT'S A SPECIAL
TRAP THAT CREATES

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:43.492
A VICIOUS TOKEN MONSTER
WHEN DESTROYED.

00:10:43.492 --> 00:10:45.327
THAT'S WHY HE
PLAYED HEAVY STORM.

00:10:45.327 --> 00:10:46.361
OH!

00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:47.529
A CARD THAT STRONG

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:49.398
COULDN'T BE IN ONE
OF THE TEST DECKS,

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:51.333
CROWLER MUST BE
USING HIS OWN!

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:52.534
THEN THIS IS OVER--

00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:54.069
NO APPLICANT COULD
BEAT THE DECK

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:56.071
OF AN EXPERT
LIKE DR. CROWLER!

00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:58.674
YEAH, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
DON'T YOU THINK, CHAZZ?

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:00.576
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU
THINK, CHAZZ?

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:02.544
I THINK I'M GONNA
ENJOY WATCHING

00:11:02.544 --> 00:11:03.745
CROWLER MOP THE FLOOR

00:11:03.745 --> 00:11:05.848
WITH OUR MOUTHY LITTLE
FRIEND DOWN THERE.

00:11:05.848 --> 00:11:07.216
I ONLY WISH HE TREATED

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:09.084

WHO APPLY TO THIS
ACADEMY THE SAME WAY.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.156
WHAT AN ELITIST SNOB--

00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:16.825

HUH?

00:11:19.294 --> 00:11:21.430

HIS DEFENSE POINTS
WERE WAY TOO LOW!

THIS ISN'T
LOOKING GOOD...

AND IT'S ABOUT TO
LOOK A LOT WORSE.

00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:03.990
WHEN THAT ANCIENT

ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

AND THE DEFENDING
MONSTER'S DEFENSE POINTS

00:13:09.662 --> 00:13:11.965
GETS DEALT TO
