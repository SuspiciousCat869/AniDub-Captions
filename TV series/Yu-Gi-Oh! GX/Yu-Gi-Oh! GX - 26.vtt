UHH! THANKS FOR THAT!

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:21.781
NOW I CAN PLAY MY TRAP!

00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:24.450
IT'S CALLED THE GRAVE
OF ENKINDLING!

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.786
AND SINCE A MONSTER
WAS DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:08:26.786 --> 00:08:29.355
IT LETS US BOTH
TAKE A MONSTER
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:31.691
AND SUMMON IT TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:33.793
AND I CHOOSE ANOTHER
ARMED DRAGON...

00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:36.329

WAY TOO EASY.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.471
IT'S PRACTICALLY
UNFAIR!

00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:47.640
ISN'T THERE
ANY DRAWBACK
TO USING IT?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.909
IF I RECALL
CORRECTLY, BY RULE,

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:52.745
THE RESURRECTED
MONSTER MUST REMAIN
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.647
OF COURSE, THAT'S
REALLY A MOOT POINT.

BY DISCARDING A MONSTER
FROM HIS HAND

A ROUND TRIP!

THAT'S RIGHT!

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.961
BY DISCARDING ONE
