WEBVTT

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.779
SYRUS HAS A BROTHER
THAT GOES TO
THIS SCHOOL, JADEN.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.615
YOU'VE PROBABLY
HEARD OF HIM, TOO.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.217
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:16.086
HELLO?

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:19.456
THIRD YEAR OBELISK BLUE
AND NUMBER ONE DUELIST
AT THE ACADEMY?

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.625
HE'S THE BIG MAN
ON CAMPUS--ZANE.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.129
AND HE REALLY IS AS GOOD
AS HIS REPUTATION.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.631
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS ZANE GUY.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.901
I MEAN, NO WONDER SYRUS
HAS ZERO CONFIDENCE.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.203
IF MY BIG BRO TOLD ME

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:35.205
THAT I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH TO USE
SOME CARD,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:36.906
I'D BE INSECURE, TOO.

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.111
WELL, THAT'S ALL
ABOUT TO CHANGE.

00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:42.445
Jaden, voice-over:
I WONDER,

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.780
DO YA SPELL "ZANE"
WITH TWO Ns?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.083
THESE DUEL REQUEST FORMS
ARE SUCH A DRAG.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.555
DUEL REQUEST FORM?

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:53.623
HEY.

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:55.558
PLANNING A DUEL,
ARE WE?

00:00:55.558 --> 00:00:57.227
AGAINST WHOM?

00:00:57.227 --> 00:00:58.228
YOU MUST BE JOKING.

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.264
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT.

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.467
I'M TAKING ZANE ON
TO HELP SYRUS GET OVER
HIS CONFIDENCE PROBLEM

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.469
SO HE'LL BE READY
FOR OUR UPCOMIN' TAG MATCH.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.470
AH, YES, OF COURSE,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.939
THE BIG
TAG TEAM MATCH.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.674
THE ONE WHERE
IF YOU LOSE,

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.209
YOU'LL BOTH
BE EXPELLED FROM
THE ACADEMY,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.244
AM I RIGHT?

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:15.779
AND YOU SAY
THAT DUELING ZANE

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:16.780
WILL HELP
YOU PREPARE?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.781
WELL THAT'S A SHAME,

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:18.782
BECAUSE THERE'LL
BE NO DUEL.

Zane, voice-over:
I WOULD HAVE NEVER
GIVEN YOU THAT CARD

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:36.593
HAD I KNOWN THAT
YOU WOULD MISPLAY IT.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.795
SURE, YOU MAY KNOW
HOW TO USE POWER BOND,

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:40.597
BUT THERE'S MORE TO DUELING
THAN JUST THAT.

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:47.904
AW, MAN,
I DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT DUEL MONSTERS.

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:49.572
I'M GOING TO
LET JADEN DOWN.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.544
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:55.778
THAT'S YOUR MOVE?

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.981
FINE, THEN I'M GONNA
USE MY SPELL CARD

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.750
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR MONSTER
AND ATTACK JADEN.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:06.756
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.229
WHY, SY? WHY?

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.131
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:18.568
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
BELONG HERE.

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:19.602
BIG BRO?

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.740
I'M TOAST.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:28.778
LOOK, IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S ME.

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:31.614
I JUST CAN'T USE YOU
IN MY DECK ANYMORE.

00:03:31.614 --> 00:03:34.017
I GOTTA MAKE ROOM
FOR ANOTHER KOALA.

00:03:34.017 --> 00:03:37.053
15 OUGHTA DO.

00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:39.789
LOUSY DR. CROWLER.

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.958
WHERE DOES IT SAY
THOSE DUEL REQUEST FORMS

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.226
NEED TO BE FILLED OUT
IN TRIPLICATE AND--

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:46.563
AND WITH A NO. 8 PENCIL?

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:50.066
WHAT IS THAT?

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:51.067
IT'S EITHER
A GIANT TREE SLOTH

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:55.038
OR IT'S CHUMLEY.

00:03:55.038 --> 00:04:01.044
HEY, WHAT UP?

00:04:01.044 --> 00:04:02.612
WOW, CHUM.

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:05.048
THERE'S LIKE A ZILLION
KOALA CARDS DOWN HERE.

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:06.616
YEAH, THEY SO RULE.

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.885
WANNA HAVE A PICK-UP DUEL
AGAINST 'EM?

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.621
HEY, A PICK-UP DUEL.

00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:13.690
WHY DIDN'T
I THINK A' THAT?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.724
HEY, WAIT.

00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:16.025
WHERE ARE YA OFF TO?

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:18.228
THE OBELISK BLUE DORM!

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:19.796
WHY YA GOING THERE?

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:21.731
A PICK-UP DUEL
WITH ZANE!

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.734
THE ZANE?

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:26.236
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:27.937
I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM,

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:30.173
BUT YOU SURE WILL
IF YOU DON'T BEAT IT.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.108
YEAH, ZANE WOULDN'T
WASTE HIS TIME
WITH YOU.

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:33.943
YOU'RE STILL PROLLY
WET BEHIND THE EARS

00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:35.211
FROM PRE-DUEL
SCHOOL.

00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.246
I AM NOT.

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.084
NOW YA ARE.

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.085
WE'RE GONNA DUEL.

00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:47.857
SO WHAT'RE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:50.059
WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING
I'M NOT GONNA DO,

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.628
AND THAT'S GIVE UP.

00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:53.763
I'LL GET ZANE TO DUEL ME
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

00:04:58.468 --> 00:05:00.503
AW, SY, ARE YOU
STILL IN BED?

00:05:00.503 --> 00:05:01.904
LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN,

00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:04.073
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE
TO ACT LIKE
SOME LAZY SLUG.

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:05.208
I MEAN, EVEN CHUMLEY
GOT UP TODAY.

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.744
YEAH, LOUSY BLADDER!

00:05:12.048 --> 00:05:13.483
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:14.484
LOOK,
HE LEFT A NOTE!

00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:15.918
WHAT'S IT SAY?

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:21.824
Syrus, voice-over:
DEAR JADEN,
I'M LEAVING DUEL ACADEMY.

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:22.825
DON'T TRY AND STOP ME.

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.694
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:27.897
I WOULD ONLY
BE HOLDING YOU BACK
IF I STAYED.

00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:29.632
SY'S NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE.

00:05:29.632 --> 00:05:32.235
YEAH, LET'S GO STOP HIM
AFTER DINNER.

00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:33.436
NO, NOW.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:35.538
BUT TODAY'S
GRILLED CHEESE DAY.

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:36.572
IF WE DON'T HURRY,

00:05:36.572 --> 00:05:37.573
IT'LL BE
SY'S LAST DAY.

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.173
SYRUS!

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:44.541
COME ON!

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:48.011
SY, IT'S GRILLED
CHEESE DAY!

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.680
WHERE ARE YA, SYRUS?

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.416
WE MISS YOU, SY,

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:54.784
AND WE'LL
MISS DINNER TOO

00:05:54.784 --> 00:05:57.153
IF WE DON'T FIND
YA BEFORE THE
KITCHEN CLOSES.

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:04.728
SO LONG, DUEL ACADEMY.

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:14.070
IT'S YOU.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.705
SO HUNGRY,
STARTING TO HEAR VOICES.

00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:23.980
CAN YOU FIND
WHERE SY'S AT?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.516
GO.

00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:28.585
C'MON.

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.187
AW, FIRST NO GRILLED CHEESE,
AND NOW I GOTTA RUN?

00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:32.722
AW, WHY ME?

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:49.072
SO, ANY NEW LEADS?

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:51.908
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S STILL GONE.

00:06:51.908 --> 00:06:54.411
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR SOME SIGN,

00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:57.747
BUT IT'S LIKE
MY BROTHER JUST VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR.

00:06:57.747 --> 00:06:59.115
DON'T GIVE UP.

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:00.850
YOU'LL FIND HIM.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.719
I HOPE SO.

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:03.720
SPEAKING OF BROTHERS,
ZANE,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.022
I SAW YOURS
THE OTHER DAY.

00:07:06.022 --> 00:07:07.991
OH, DID YOU NOW?

00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.894
YEAH, HE LOST
IN A PRACTICE DUEL
TO JADEN YUKI.

00:07:10.894 --> 00:07:12.195
YOU'RE NAME CAME UP,
TOO,

00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:13.196
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:15.865
THE BIG BAD BROTHER.

00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:18.735
WHAT, DOES JADEN
WANT TO SCOLD ME NOW?

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.171
ACTUALLY, I THINK
HE WANTS TO DUEL YOU.

00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:23.206
Syrus: STAY BACK, JADEN!

00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:26.709
LOOK, IT'S SYRUS.

00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:42.192
HELP ME!

00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:43.726
I CAN'T SWIM!

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:45.028
AND YOU WERE
ABOUT TO RAFT OUT
INTO THE OCEAN?

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:49.666
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.034
I'M COMING!

00:07:54.637 --> 00:07:55.638
IT'S SHALLOW.

00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.813
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO STOP ME, JADEN?

00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:05.415
I STINK.

00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:06.583
PLEASE,
JUST LET ME GO.

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.452
THEY'LL ASSIGN YOU
A NEW TAG PARTNER

00:08:09.452 --> 00:08:11.988
AND YOU'LL HAVE A
MUCH BETTER SHOT AT
WINNING THE MATCH.

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:12.989
SY, THAT'S
YOUR BROTHER TALKIN'.

00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:14.424
COME ON, PAL.

00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:16.860
YA GOTTA BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.528
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:20.029
I'M A LOST CAUSE.

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:22.132
Zane: HE IS RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

00:08:22.132 --> 00:08:25.902
Syrus: ZANE.

00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:28.071
SO THAT'S THE SCHOOL'S
TOP DUELIST?

00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:29.072
YOU'RE DROPPING OUT?

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:33.643
WELL, YEAH,
KINDA.

00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:35.044
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:42.051
HE'S WRONG.

00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:47.190
YOU'RE HIS BIG BROTHER!

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.191
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.927
BECAUSE I KNOW HIM.

00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:52.462
YEAH, I BET YOU THINK
YOU KNOW IT ALL,

00:08:52.462 --> 00:08:53.830
BUT GUESS WHAT.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.932
YA DON'T,
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT
RIGHT NOW.

00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:56.933
LET'S DUEL.

00:08:56.933 --> 00:09:00.170
NO, JADEN.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.839
DUEL A SLIFER?

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.474
SURE, WHY NOT?

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:06.809
AFTER ALL,
IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE
I WENT SLUMMING.

00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:08.478
THEN GET YOUR GAME ON.

00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:09.679
JADEN, HE'S GOOD.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:11.414
I'M SURE HE IS.

00:09:11.414 --> 00:09:12.949
Jaden, voice-over:
AND I'M SURE THIS DUEL

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:15.718
WILL SOLVE SY'S
CONFIDENCE PROBLEM
WITHOUT HURTING MINE.

00:09:23.862 --> 00:09:24.863
DUEL!
DUEL!

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:33.205
AW, MAN,
MY BIG BROTHER TAKING ON
MY BEST FRIEND?

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:36.107
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS
CAN TURN OUT GOOD.

00:09:36.107 --> 00:09:38.443
OK, NOW WE FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
WITH SY AND HIS BRO,

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:43.114
AND WE FIND OUT
HOW I RANK
WITH THE BEST.

00:09:43.114 --> 00:09:45.116
HERE I COME, ZANE.

00:09:45.116 --> 00:09:48.787
FIRST,
I'M GONNA SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN

00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:50.355
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.130
AND I THINK
I'LL GO AHEAD

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.699
AND THROW DOWN
A FACE DOWN
WHILE I'M AT IT.

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.302
THAT'S ALL, HUH?

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:07.539
OK, FOR MY FIRST MOVE,

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:09.841
I SUMMON CYBER DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:19.251
WHAT?

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.252
HOW CAN YOU BRING
A LEVEL 5 MONSTER OUT

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.187
ON YOUR VERY FIRST TURN?

00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:23.288
I CAN PLAY
MY CYBER DRAGON

00:10:23.288 --> 00:10:26.224
BECAUSE IT'S
MY FIRST TURN, JADEN.

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:28.393
WITH NO MONSTERS OUT,
HE REQUIRES NO SACRIFICE.

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:31.730
AND NOW I'LL PLAY
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHOON

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.165
TO DESTROY
YOUR FACEDOWN CARD.

00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:35.600
THAT WAS FAST.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.470
NOT AS FAST
AS YOUR LIFE POINT METER
WILL GO DOWN.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.639
CYBER DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.340
STRIDENT BLAST!

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:54.052
Syrus, voice-over:
I TRIED TO WARN HIM
THAT ZANE WAS GOOD.

00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:57.289
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD DIFFERENT
DIMENSION CAPSULE.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.398
IT ALLOWS ME TO PICK
ANY CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:09.367
THEN I SIMPLY PLACE IT
IN THE CAPSULE,

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.202
AND IN TWO TURNS
I GET TO TAKE IT OUT

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:12.837
AND PUT IT RIGHT
INTO MY HAND.

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:21.613
MAN, THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE BEST CARD OUT A'
HIS ENTIRE DECK.

00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:24.049
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT'S GONNA
COME OUT OF THERE.

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.083
Syrus, voice-over:
WELL I CAN,

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:26.651
'CUZ IT'S NOT GONNA
BE PRETTY.

00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:29.287
IT'S YOUR MOVE, JADEN.

00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:31.222
Jaden, voice-over:
YEAH, AND I'D BETTER
MAKE IT COUNT,

00:11:31.222 --> 00:11:33.792
'CUZ I'M STARTIN'
TO GET THE FEELING

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.827
THAT NOT ONLY
IS THIS GUY AS GOOD AS
EVERYONE SAYS HE IS,

00:11:35.827 --> 00:11:38.797
HE MIGHT EVEN BE BETTER.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:42.467
BUT STILL,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S BETTER THAN ME.

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.703
ALL RIGHT, ROUND TWO,

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:47.105
AND FIRST I'LL ROCK
POLYMERIZATION.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:54.212
AND NEXT I'LL ROLL OUT
ELEMENTAL HEROES
SPARKMAN AND CLAYMAN,

00:11:57.048 --> 00:12:01.186
AND FUSE THEM TO CREATE
ELEMENTAL HERO
THUNDER GIANT.

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.461
AND SINCE
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.230
DESTROYS MONSTERS
WITH LESS ATTACK POINTS
THAN HIM,

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.367
YOUR CYBER DRAGON
GETS VAPORIZED!

00:12:17.268 --> 00:12:18.470
YES!

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.537
LOOKS LIKE THUNDER GIANT

00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:21.039
JUST MADE
THE BIG MAN ON CAMPUS

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:22.307
GET A LITTLE BIT
SMALLER,

00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:23.375
WOULDN'T YA SAY?

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.442
YEAH,
I WOULD SAY IT.

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:27.045
WHOA.

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:29.214
AND THE BEST PART IS
THAT SINCE THAT BLAST

00:12:29.214 --> 00:12:31.549
WAS JUST THUNDER GIANT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:33.218
I STILL GET TO USE
HIS ATTACK!

00:12:33.218 --> 00:12:35.687
AND SINCE YOU'RE
NOW DEFENSELESS,

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:37.522
I'M GONNA USE IT
DIRECTLY ON YOU!

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:47.565
YA COULD AT LEAST
KIND OF FLINCH.

00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:49.968
OH, WELL,

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:52.504
MAYBE THIS FACEDOWN CARD
WILL GET YA TO LATER.

00:12:52.504 --> 00:12:55.240
Syrus, voice-over:
YEAH, IF JADEN LASTS
LONG ENOUGH TO USE IT.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.641
NICE MOVES, KID.

00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:59.277
OF COURSE, WITH MY FIELD
NOW EMPTY AGAIN,

00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.513
I CAN JUST THROW OUT
ANOTHER CYBER DRAGON.

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:05.817
OR BETTER YET, TWO.

00:13:05.817 --> 00:13:07.685
I PLAY MONSTER REBORN.

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.388
AND WITH JUST ONE MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:13.224
YOU CAN GUESS
WHO'S COMING BACK.

00:13:13.224 --> 00:13:16.327
BUT NEITHER
WILL BE HERE LONG...

00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:17.829
IN PRESENT FORM.

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:21.232
DRAGONS, UNITE.

00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:23.835
NOW, CYBER TWIN DRAGON,
EMERGE.

00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:29.374
TWIN DRAGON?

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:31.109
ONE WAS TOUGH
ENOUGH.

00:13:31.109 --> 00:13:33.778
NOW, MY DRAGON
CAN ATTACK TWICE
IN A ROUND,

00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:37.148
WHICH MEANS
DOUBLE THE TROUBLE
FOR YOUR MONSTER

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:38.349
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:45.056
TWIN DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:46.057
NOT SO FAST.

00:13:46.057 --> 00:13:49.594
I'VE GOTTA
TRAP CARD OUT--

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:53.964
A HERO EMERGES!

00:13:53.964 --> 00:13:55.966
NOW NORMALLY,
YOU'D HAVE TO RANDOMLY

00:13:55.966 --> 00:13:58.569
PICK ONE A' THE CARDS
IN MY HAND,

00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:01.772
AND IF IT WAS A MONSTER,
I'D GET TO SUMMON IT.

00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:04.341
BUT SINCE I ONLY HAVE
ONE CARD IN MY HAND,

00:14:04.341 --> 00:14:06.510
LET'S JUST GET
RIGHT TO IT, SHALL WE?

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.413
WROUGHTWEILLER,
DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:11.148
YOU'LL NEED HIM.

00:14:11.148 --> 00:14:14.151
CYBER TWIN DRAGON,
DOUBLE STRIDENT BLAST!

00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:21.926
GLAD YA DID THAT,

00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:23.193
'CUZ WHEN
WROUGHTWEILER'S
DESTROYED,

00:14:23.193 --> 00:14:25.029
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES.

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:27.264
IT BRINGS
ONE ELEMENTAL HERO

00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:29.466
AND ONE
POLYMERIZATION CARD BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:31.001
AND INTO MY HAND.

00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:32.469
AND JUST
WHEN YOU THOUGHT

00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:35.239
YOU COULD PROBABLY
STOP WORRYIN' ABOUT 'EM,
HUH, ZANE?

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:37.441
I DON'T WORRY.

00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:38.943
MAN, YOU'RE CHILL.

00:14:38.943 --> 00:14:41.378
NOT WORRYIN',
NOT EVEN FLINCHIN'.

00:14:41.378 --> 00:14:43.380
YOU ARE GOOD.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.849
YOU, TOO, JADEN.

00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:48.519
Syrus, voice-over:
WHOA, SINCE WHEN
DOES ZANE GIVE PROPS?

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:49.520
NOW WHERE WAS I?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.356
OH, YEAH.

00:14:52.356 --> 00:14:57.861
I WAS ABOUT TO SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO BUBBLEMAN
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:01.031
AND SINCE BUBBLEMAN'S
THE ONLY MONSTER
OUT ON MY FIELD,

00:15:01.031 --> 00:15:05.569
I CAN USE HIS SPECIAL
ABILITY TO DRAW TWO MORE
CARDS TO MY HAND.

00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:10.908
Jaden, voice-over:
TRANSCENDENT WINGS
AND WINGED KURIBOH--

00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:15.245
THE CARDS I USED
TO TRASH THAT DRAGON
CATAPULT CANNON.

00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:18.349
AN EVOLVED WINGED
KURIBOH WOULD TURN
ZANE'S CYBER TWIN DRAGON

00:15:18.349 --> 00:15:20.417
INTO A PILE
OF CYBER JUNK.

00:15:20.417 --> 00:15:23.921
THEN, ITS ATTACK POINTS
WOULD BE DEALT
TO HIM AS DAMAGE.

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:26.256
THAT'D BE ENOUGH TO DROP
HIS LIFE POINTS TO ZERO
AND WIN THE DUEL.

00:15:26.256 --> 00:15:29.526
BUT I CAN'T SUMMON
ANY MORE MONSTERS
THIS ROUND,

00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:32.596
SO I'M JUST GONNA HAFTA
WAIT UNTIL MY NEXT TURN.

00:15:32.596 --> 00:15:36.867
STILL, I WON'T HAVE TO
WAIT UNTIL NEXT TURN
TO USE ANOTHER CARD.

00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:40.004
ALRIGHT, ZANE,
I PLAY POLYMERIZATION

00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:44.908
AND FUSE MY ELEMENTAL
HERO BUBBLEMAN WITH
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN.

00:15:44.908 --> 00:15:48.045
NOW, ELEMENTAL HERO
MUDBALLMAN,

00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:49.580
RISE IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:52.320
'LISHUS.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.655
MUDBALLMAN'S GOT
3000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:15:54.655 --> 00:15:57.258
THAT TWIN DRAGON'S
ATTACK WON'T GET
THROUGH TO JADEN.

00:15:57.258 --> 00:15:59.327
Syrus, voice-over:
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:15:59.327 --> 00:16:00.394
JADEN MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN.

00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:02.730
NOW GIMME
YOUR BEST SHOT, ZANE.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.931
MY BEST SHOT?

00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:07.435
YOU GOT IT.

00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:08.469
Syrus, voice-over: OH, NO.

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.404
Jaden, voice-over:
THE CAPSULE.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:15.209
IT'S BEEN TWO TURNS
SINCE I FIRST ACTIVATED
DIFFERENT DIMENSION CAPSULE,

00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:19.280
AND NOW I CAN TAKE THE CARD
I FIRST PUT INTO IT
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND.

00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:28.255
YOU PLAYED WELL,
BUT NOT WELL ENOUGH.

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:29.924
HEY, GIMME WHAT YOU GOT.

00:16:29.924 --> 00:16:31.225
I'M READY.

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:32.827
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:34.895
A GOOD DUELIST IS READY
FOR ANYTHING,

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:37.665
AND THAT MEANS
NOT JUST KNOWING HOW TO USE
ALL OF THEIR CARDS,

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:40.101
BUT KNOWING
HOW TO PLAY THEM, TOO,

00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.670
AND YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS WELL, JADEN.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.440
Syrus, voice-over:
KNOWING HOW TO PLAY
YOUR CARDS?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.675
Jaden, voice-over:
THAT'S A NICE
COMPLIMENT,

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.677
BUT EVEN BETTER ADVICE.

00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:52.313
HOPE SY'S LISTENIN'.

00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:53.314
Syrus, voice-over:
OF COURSE.

00:16:53.314 --> 00:16:55.149
KNOWING HOW TO USE A CARD

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:56.417
AND KNOWING HOW TO PLAY IT

00:16:56.417 --> 00:16:58.152
ARE TWO TOTALLY
DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:16:58.152 --> 00:17:00.855
THAT'S WHAT ZANE
WAS TRYING TO TELL ME
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:02.656
I GET IT NOW.

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.725
FIRST I'LL ACTIVATE
THIS DE-FUSION CARD.

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:10.498
IT SPLITS MY MONSTER
BACK INTO TWO
SEPARATE CYBER DRAGONS.

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:13.467
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC OF POWER BOND.

00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:20.875
WITH THIS SPELL CARD,

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:24.145
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
A MACHINE-TYPE
FUSION MONSTER.

00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:27.548
AND WITH ANOTHER CYBER DRAGON
IN MY HAND AS WELL,

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:32.620
I CAN NOW FUSE 3 OF THEM
TOGETHER AND CREATE
THE CYBER END DRAGON.

00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:47.234
PLUS, ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE DOUBLED

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:50.671
BECAUSE OF POWER BOND'S
EFFECT.

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.240
8,000?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.777
AND KEEP IN MIND,
WHEN CYBER END DRAGON ATTACKS,

00:17:56.777 --> 00:17:59.847
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HIS ATTACK POINTS AND YOUR
MONSTER'S DEFENSE POINTS

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:03.250
ARE DEALT TO YOU AS DAMAGE.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.785
JUST HANG TOUGH.

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.253
IF YOU CAN SURVIVE
HIS ATTACK,

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:07.488
YOU CAN WIN FOR SURE,

00:18:07.488 --> 00:18:09.757
'CAUSE OF POWER BOND'S
NASTY SIDE EFFECT.

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:11.325
CHUMLEY'S RIGHT.

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.327
AT THE END OF THE TURN
POWER BOND IS USED,

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.563
THE PLAYER WHO ACTIVATED
THE CARD TAKES DAMAGE

00:18:15.563 --> 00:18:19.233
EQUAL TO THEIR ATTACKING
MONSTER'S ORIGINAL
ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:21.769
Syrus, voice-over:
YEAH, BUT THAT WON'T MATTER
IF YOU PLAY IT RIGHT,

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:23.571
AND ZANE HAS.

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:26.474
I JUST WISH
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
AT JADEN'S EXPENSE.

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:28.909
CYBER END DRAGON,
ATTACK MUDBALLMAN.

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:31.779
SUPER STRIDENT BLAZE!

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.824
JADEN, NO!

00:18:43.824 --> 00:18:46.193
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:48.195
HE LOST.

00:18:48.195 --> 00:18:51.232
NOOOO!

00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:53.234
THANKS FOR A GREAT DUEL,
ZANE.

00:19:07.248 --> 00:19:10.651
SO, ZANE, WHATTA YA THINK?

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.786
I THINK SY CHOSE
GOOD FRIENDS, ALEXIS.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.326
YOUR BROTHER'S
GOT MAD SKILLS.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.961
WELL, LEAST
I GOT THE LOOKS.

00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:26.300
WHAT'S FUNNY?

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.471
COME ON, LET'S GO HOME
AND WORK ON OUR DECKS.

00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:32.139
AND I SAY
WE ARRANGE YOURS

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:33.908
SO YOU CAN FINALLY USE
THAT POWER BOND.

00:19:33.908 --> 00:19:34.909
HOW 'BOUT IT?

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:36.310
FOR SURE.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.813
NOW I KNOW TO PLAY IT,
NOT JUST USE IT.

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:41.448
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD USE?

00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:42.449
A COUPLA GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICHES.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.255
NOT IF I SCARF 'EM
ALL DOWN FIRST, CHUMLEY.

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:49.423
WAIT UP!

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:50.791
AW, WE GOTTA RUN AGAIN?

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.299
SERIOUSLY,
CAN WE JUST WALK THOUGH?
