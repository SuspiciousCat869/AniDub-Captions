GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.575
[THINKING]
ZANE THINKS HE'S GONNA
OUTSMART ME AGAIN.

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:15.878
BUT NOT THIS TIME!

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:17.817

TO CREATE ELEMENTAL
HERO WILDEDGE!

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:27.312
SO DO YOUR THING,
WILDEDGE,

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.086
AND GO WILD ON THOSE
THREE CYBER DRAGONS!

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:33.462

AND WITH IT I CAN
SUMMON BACK AN OLD FRIEND...

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:38.309
THE CYBER END DRAGON.

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:40.215
[THINKING]
JUST GREAT.

00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.253
LOOKS LIKE USIN'
MY HEAD

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.461
HAS GOT ME HEADED

SO, WHAT NOW, JADEN?

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:01.614
YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT
MY DRAGON?!

00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:02.717
YOU'VE GOT ONE MONSTER,

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:05.391
AND HE IS ABOUT TO BE
BLASTED INTO OBLIVION!

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:08.834
IT'S OVER FOR YOU!

00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:11.609
[THINKING]
NO, IT CAN'T BE OVER.

00:02:12.077 --> 00:02:13.916
I KNOW I CAN THINK
MY WAY OUT OF THIS.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.086
AND I BETTER START...
OR ELSE!

00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:16.456
COME ON! WHAT'S WRONG?!

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.027
UNLESS...
YOU'RE AFRAID.

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:20.534
IS THAT YOUR PROBLEM?

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.109
OHH...

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:24.713
WELL, FINE!

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:26.920
I'LL PUT YOU OUT
OF YOUR MISERY!

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.123
CYBER END DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:30.697
NOT SO FAST!

00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:32.134
I'M PLAYING A TRAP!

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:34.508
SOUL UNION TAKES
BLADEDGE'S ATTACK POINTS

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:40.425
AND ADDS ALL OF THEM
TO WILDEDGE!

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:42.564
THAT'S POINTLESS.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.569
YOU SEE, JADEN,
WITH MY POWER BOND,

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:48.748
I STILL HAVE ENOUGH POINTS
TO TAKE OUT YOUR WILDEDGE.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.322
[THINKING]
AW MAN, HE'S RIGHT!

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:55.000
GUESS I BETTER PUT
MY THINKING CAP BACK ON.

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:56.671
OH WAIT, IT WAS ON.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.342
COME ON! THINK, BRAIN!

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.488
YOU HAVE GOT
TO FIGURE THIS OUT!

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:05.295
FAREWELL, JADEN.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.903
CYBER END DRAGON...
ATTACK!

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:13.485
AND END THIS DUEL!

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.001
AAH!

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:21.040
[THINKING]
MAN UP, JADEN!

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.414
YOUR WHOLE YEAR COMES
DOWN TO RIGHT NOW!

00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:25.252
AAH!

00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:29.331
SORRY, ZANE!

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:30.868
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE...

00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:31.771
YET!

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.144
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--
THAT HIT YOU SQUARE ON!

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.283
THIS MATCH SHOULD BE DONE!

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:38.757
Woman: NO WAY!
HOW'D HE DO THAT?

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.677
JADEN...

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.349
[PANTING]

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:50.190
AW, MAN...

00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:53.199
TALK ABOUT ACTIVATING
A SPELL JUST
IN THE NICK OF TIME!

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.542
THANKS,
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS.

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:00.887
HA...

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:02.024
HMM?

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:03.628
NOW I'LL PLAY
HERO SIGNAL!

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.643
WITH THIS, I CAN
SUMMON ANY CARD

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:11.618
WITH ELEMENTAL HERO
IN ITS NAME!

00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:14.226
AND WHO BETTER THAN...

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.398
BUBBLEMAN!

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:21.780
AND SINCE HE'S ALONE,
I GET TWO MORE CARDS!

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.223
[THINKING] I MAY HAVE
SURVIVED THIS ROUND,

00:04:25.358 --> 00:04:26.026
BUT JUST BARELY!

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:28.767
SO MUCH FOR USIN'
MY HEAD OVER MY HEART!

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.338
NOW IT'S MY TURN...

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:33.614
AND I SUMMON
CYBER KIRIN!

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:37.057
AND IF I SHOULD HAPPEN
TO SACRIFICE HIM,

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:38.428
ALL CARD EFFECT DAMAGE

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:41.169
GOES TO ZERO
FOR THIS ONE TURN.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.946
AND OF COURSE,
THAT MEANS MY POWER BOND
DAMAGE IS NEGATED!

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:49.794
A FLAWLESS PLAY!

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:51.265
YEA, TOTALLY!

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:52.903
COME ON!

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:55.409
WHERE'S THE JADEN THAT
ALMOST BEAT ME BEFORE?!

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.047
HE'S RIGHT HERE!

00:04:58.318 --> 00:04:59.321
I THINK...
I DON'T KNOW...

00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:01.193
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:02.496
HUH?

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:04.837
BECAUSE YOUR HEART
IS NOT IN THIS.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.378
UH...AND NEITHER'S
MY STOMACH.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.389
KINDA SKIPPED LUNCH.

00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:13.127
Man: QUIT?! NO WAY!

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:15.567
DOROTHY?!
YOU AROUND?!

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:21.183
HEY, THERE!
HOW 'BOUT SOME GRUB!

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.159
OKAY! YOU GOT IT!

00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:26.465
WHAT'S HE DOIN'?!
HAVING A SNACK?!

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.677
THEY SAY THE QUICKEST
WAY TO A MAN'S HEART
IS THROUGH HIS STOMACH.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.549
JEALOUS?!

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:33.552
OH, PUH-LEEZE!

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:34.688
HA HA!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.858
VERY ODD.

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:37.229
DON'T YOU THINK,
CHAZZ?

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:38.365
HELLO, IT'S JADEN!

00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:40.170
EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS ODD!

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:41.374
MAYBE!

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:43.481
BUT AT LEAST HE'S
BEING HIMSELF.

00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:44.617
HA HA! SY'S RIGHT!

00:05:46.723 --> 00:05:47.525
I WASN'T BEING ME!

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.066
AND WHAT BETTER WAY
TO BE JADEN

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.506
THAN TO HAVE
A BIG MEAL, HUH!

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.883
SO, HOW ABOUT IT, ZANE?

00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:57.954
DO YOU MIND IF I SCARF?

00:05:58.523 --> 00:05:59.192
WHY NOT?

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:00.730
GREAT ANSWER!

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:03.036
JADEN CAN'T DO THAT!

00:06:03.838 --> 00:06:04.641
THERE'S NO EATING HERE!

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.612
WHAT'S HE THINK
THIS IS?!

00:06:07.348 --> 00:06:08.150
SOME SORT OF...
SMORGASBORD?!

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.195
CAN'T YOU CUT HIM A BREAK
FOR SAVING THE WORLD?

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.499
REMEMBER?

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:15.405
I'M TRYING NOT TO.

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:17.544
Jaden: MMM,
IT SMELLS GREAT!

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:21.221
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WENT THIS WHOLE TIME
WITHOUT EATING!

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.843
HOW'S YOUR HEART NOW?

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:37.133
REVOLTING.

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:38.771
DON'T YOU THINK,
CHANCELLOR?

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:41.077
I THINK THAT WE'RE IN
FOR A MATCH NOW!

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:42.448
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:44.621
I MEAN THAT JADEN
LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON.

00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:48.767
HE TRIED TO BE SOMEONE
THAT HE JUST ISN'T!

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:50.271
AND ALMOST LOST!

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:52.143
YOU SEE, JADEN'S
A GREAT DUELIST

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:53.914
NOT BECAUSE OF
HIS BOOK SMARTS,

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:55.753
BUT BECAUSE HE PLAYS
WITH HIS HEART, HIS SOUL...

00:06:55.953 --> 00:06:56.756
AND EVEN HIS STOMACH!

00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:00.366
ZANE HELPED HIM
FIND THE DUELIST
THAT HE LEFT BEHIND.

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:02.238
LEFT BEHIND?

00:07:02.873 --> 00:07:03.542
OH, PLEASE!

00:07:04.177 --> 00:07:05.548
HE LEFT NOTHING BEHIND!

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.559
OKAY! LET'S DUEL!

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:12.266
GOOD LUCK, JADEN!
GLAD I COULD HELP!

00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:13.938
THANKS FOR THE GRUB!

00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:15.109
YOU RULE!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.548
NOW, THEN...

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.752
BRING IT!

00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:23.232
HERE GOES!

00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:24.735
I PLAY POT OF GREED!

00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:28.614
WHICH MEANS I GET
TO DRAW TWO MORE CARDS!

00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:32.090
AND NOW I'LL PLAY ONE:

00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:33.929
ELEMENTAL HERO AVIAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.001
AND HERE'S THE OTHER:

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:37.472
THE SPELL CARD SPY HERO!

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.815
IT'S ACTIVATED WHEN I
DISCARD TWO RANDOM CARDS
FROM MY DECK.

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:45.528
NOW MY SPY HERO CUTS IN

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.607
AND USES ALL HIS SUPER
STEALTH TO TAKE ONE OF
YOUR SPELL CARDS!

00:07:50.844 --> 00:07:51.847
SEEMS THE OLD JADEN'S BACK!

00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:53.116
[GASP]

00:07:56.627 --> 00:07:57.630
HEY, THANKS, ZANE!
FUTURE FUSION!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.273
NOW ALL I GOTTA DO
IS SACRIFICE
A COUPLE MONSTERS

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.847
THAT COULD BE COMBINED
TO FORM A FUSION
MONSTER AND BAM--

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:05.887
I GET WHAT THEY
WOULDA MADE!

00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:07.825
SO SAY GOOD-BYE TO
BURSTINATRIX AND CLAYMAN

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:10.834
AND HELLO TO RAMPART
BLASTER IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:17.219
NEXT I'LL THROWDOWN
A COUPLEA FACEDOWNS!

00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:20.027
IMPRESSIVE...

00:08:20.662 --> 00:08:21.665
BUT TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE!

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.339
I SUMMON FORTH CYBER
PHOENIX IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:29.989
WITH PHOENIX ON THE FIELD,

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.964
ANY SPELLS OR TRAPS
TARGETING A CERTAIN
MONSTER ARE DESTROYED!

00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:36.708
WHICH MEANS THEIR EFFECT
GETS CANCELED OUT.

00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:38.880
SEE WHERE I'M GOING
WITH THIS, JADEN?

00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:40.452
YEAH, YEAH,
I GET IT, ZANE.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:41.789
THE CYBER END DRAGON.

00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:44.697
I CAN'T MESS WITH IT
WITH TRAP OR SPELL
CARDS ANYMORE.

00:08:45.432 --> 00:08:46.636
[THINKING]
WHICH MEANS IT'S
PRACTICALLY INVINCIBLE!

00:08:48.475 --> 00:08:49.879
WILL JADEN HURRY UP
AND LOSE ALREADY?

00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:52.252
THIS IS A TOUGH SPOT.
WHAT TO DO?

00:08:52.754 --> 00:08:53.957
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
NOT DOING SO WELL!

00:08:54.658 --> 00:08:55.294
JADEN'S A FRIEND!

00:08:56.263 --> 00:08:57.467
WHO HAPPENS
TO BE A BOY!

00:08:57.634 --> 00:08:58.837
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
HIM A BOYFRIEND!

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.175
OH, SUUURE!

00:09:01.144 --> 00:09:01.813
LOOK!

00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:04.153
I'M GLAD THAT YOU GOT
TO ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

00:09:04.721 --> 00:09:05.389
BUT NOW...

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.064
JUST TRY NOT TO LOSE IT!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.203
CYBER END DRAGON,
ATTACK RAMPART BLASTER!

00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:14.750
I ACTIVATE MY SPELL!
DE-FUSION!

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:19.362
IT LETS ME TAKES
ONE OF THE FUSION
MONSTERS ON THE FIELD,

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:21.000
AND SPLITS 'EM
BACK APART!

00:09:21.803 --> 00:09:22.472
SORRY, JADEN!

00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:24.478
CYBER END DRAGON
CAN'T BE SPLIT!

00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:26.851
CYBER PHOENIX IS
PROTECTING HIM, REMEMBER?

00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:29.057
I'M NOT GOIN' AFTER HIM!

00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:31.029
I'M DEFUSIN' ONE OF MINE!

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:33.336
BY SPLITTIN'
RAMPART BLASTER,

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.710
I GET TWO MONSTERS,

00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:38.718
AND YOU GET NO TARGET!

00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:51.288
ALRIGHT!!

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:52.624
NOW THAT'S A LINEUP!

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.462
JADEN'S GOT FOUR
ELEMENTAL HEROES!

00:09:56.368 --> 00:09:58.775
[THINKING] HM. EVEN
IF YOU ADD UP ALL THESE
HERO'S ATTACK POINTS,

00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:02.219
THEY DON'T COME CLOSE
TO MY DRAGON'S 8,000.

00:10:03.455 --> 00:10:04.458
HE'S MAKING A GRAVE ERROR...

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:06.464
UNLESS...

00:10:07.934 --> 00:10:08.737
UNLESS, I'M NOT
ATTACKIN',

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.210
I'M SACRIFICIN'!

00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:14.721
AND YOU'LL SEE WHY
WHEN I PLAY THIS!

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:16.860
ONE DOOZY
OF A TRAP CARD!

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:18.431
HERE COMES...
ELEMENTAL BURST!

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.841
OH, NO.
OH, YEAH!

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.913
NOW BY SACRIFICING
AN EARTH, WATER,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.153
FIRE AND WIND
ATTRIBUTE MONSTER...

00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:31.067
EACH AND EVERY CARD
ON YOUR FIELD GETS
TOTALLY DESTROYED!

00:10:45.608 --> 00:10:46.278
AAH!

00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:48.116
[GASPING]

00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:51.024
HA HA HA!

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:52.528
SO LONG,
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:10:53.732 --> 00:10:55.537
I CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT
I'M GONNA MISS HIM!

00:10:56.172 --> 00:10:57.376
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO MISS HIM.

00:10:58.077 --> 00:10:59.080
BECAUSE BY DESTROYING
CYBER PHOENIX,

00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:02.891
I GET TO MOVE ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:04.396
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.137
THE WAY THAT I'VE
CALIBRATED MY DECK,

00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:08.876
CYBER DRAGON'S
NEVER GONE LONG!

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:11.884
I'LL ALWAYS FIND
A WAY TO BRING HIM BACK.

00:11:12.653 --> 00:11:13.321
YOU'RE BLUFFING!

00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:14.458
BUT I'M NOT, JADEN.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.163
BECAUSE THE CARD
I PICKED...

00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:17.332
WAS THIS ONE!

00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:19.004
A SPELL CALLED TIME FUSION!

00:11:20.107 --> 00:11:22.113
AND WITH IT, TIME IS MOST
CERTAINLY ON MY SIDE.

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:24.219
AND HOW'S THAT EXACTLY?

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:27.863
BECAUSE NOW BY REMOVING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND
FROM THE GAME,

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:29.534
IT ACTIVATES!

00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:32.142
MEANING I CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CALL UP
A FUSION MONSTER

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.013
TO MY FIELD NEXT TURN

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:36.354
WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT
FOR A SINGLE
SUMMONING REQUIREMENT!

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:38.494
[THINKING]
SO HE'S RIGHT?

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:41.401
THE CYBER END DRAGON
WILL RETURN!

00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:42.839
AND SOON, TOO!

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:44.844
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:47.452
AND IN JUST ONE TURN,
YOU'LL SEE WHY!

00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:51.764
AND THE ACADEMY
WILL SEE YOU'RE A FRAUD!

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.352
DON'T FEEL BAD, JADEN.

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:01.158
YOU LOST TO THE BEST.

00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:03.096
ALREADY WRITING YOUR
GRADUATION SPEECH, ZANE?

00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:05.837
NOT SO FAST!
I'M STILL HERE!

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:08.378
OH, PLEASE! NOT FOR
VERY MUCH LONGER!

00:12:09.448 --> 00:12:10.116
PERHAPS...

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:12.022
HE NEEDS
ONE GOOD DRAW!

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.527
YEP!

00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:14.763
COME ON JADEN!

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:16.268
TRY AND HANG IN
THERE!!

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:17.170
ALRIGHT, MY TURN!

00:12:19.944 --> 00:12:21.148
AND I'LL THROW DOWN...
A FACEDOWN!

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:24.358
[THINKING] YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT, JADEN...

00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:26.831
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE
WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU.

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:28.369
BRACE YOURSELF! MY TURN!

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.547
FIRST OFF THIS RETURNS
TO ME A CARD FROM
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION!

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.592
I REMOVED IT FROM PLAY
TO ACTIVATE TIME FUSION,

00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:39.668
BUT NOW IT'S BACK!
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE!

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.342
NEXT, ITS SPECIAL
EFFECT ACTIVATES,

00:12:43.645 --> 00:12:44.849
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS!

00:12:45.216 --> 00:12:46.821
WE BOTH GET TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:49.663
[THINKING] TOO BAD NOTHING
CAN HELP YOU NOW, JADEN...

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:52.337
[THINKING] ZANE MUST BE
PRETTY CONFIDENT

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.477
TO BE LETTIN' ME
DRAW CARDS!

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:59.992
AND NOW, I CALL FORTH
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:03.903
NOT AGAIN!

00:13:04.438 --> 00:13:05.241
YOU'D THINK
FOR ONCE

00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:07.581
ZANE WOULD TRY
A COMBO WITHOUT
THAT DRAGON!

00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:10.589
HEY, IF IT
AIN'T BROKE...

00:13:11.826 --> 00:13:12.495
OF COURSE.

00:13:13.263 --> 00:13:14.868
BECAUSE THE MONSTER
WAS SUMMONED
WITH TIME FUSION,

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:16.940
IT CAN'T ATTACK
UNTIL NEXT TURN.

00:13:18.578 --> 00:13:19.248
NEXT TURN?!

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.524
MAN, HOW LONG DO I HAVE
TO WAIT TO SEE JADEN LOSE?!

00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:26.969
AND I'LL FINISH
MY TURN BY LAYING
ONE FACEDOWN.

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:29.544
OH, DEAR ME!

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:31.182
I'M SWEATING BULLETS
OVER HERE!

00:13:32.218 --> 00:13:33.823
CAN'T WE JUST
DECLARE ZANE
THE WINNER YET?

00:13:33.923 --> 00:13:34.591
NOT YET, CROWLER!

00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:36.931
AFTER ALL, IF THERE'S
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED,

00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:39.940
IT'S NEVER TO COUNT JADEN OUT
UNTIL HIS LIFE POINTS ARE OUT!

00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:41.043
MY DRAW! HA!

00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:43.449
I ACTIVATE
FUSION RECOVERY!

00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:46.458
THIS BRINGS BACK
POLYMERIZATION
AND BURSTINATRIX

00:13:48.364 --> 00:13:49.032
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:13:50.002 --> 00:13:51.607
SORRY, ZANE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:53.211
WHO CAN RE-SUMMON
A MONSTER!

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:56.420
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MIRACLE FUSION!

00:13:58.593 --> 00:14:00.398
NOW I JUST REMOVE
AVIAN AND BURSTINATRIX
FROM PLAY...

00:14:05.613 --> 00:14:09.524
AND I CAN SUMMON
THE ELEMENTAL
HERO FLAME WINGMAN!

00:14:12.532 --> 00:14:13.736
BUT WAIT!
I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:14:14.806 --> 00:14:15.474
GO POLYMERIZATION!

00:14:17.246 --> 00:14:18.449
MERGE THE SPARKMAN
WITH FLAME WINGMAN

00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:26.072
TO CREATE
THE ELEMENTAL HERO
SHINING FLARE WINGMAN!

00:14:33.258 --> 00:14:34.462
AND HERE'S
THE CHERRY ON TOP.

00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:37.203
FOR EACH ELEMENTAL HERO
THAT I GOT CHILLIN'
IN THE GRAVEYARD...

00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:40.178
WINGMAN GETS 300
ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.927
NOW, LET'S COUNT OFF!
HERO ROLL CALL!

00:14:51.444 --> 00:14:55.221
ALRIGHT! NOW ATTACK
CYBER END DRAGON,
FLARE WINGMAN!

00:15:02.074 --> 00:15:03.645
OH, YEAH! BUT FLARE
WINGMAN'S NOT DONE YET!

00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:06.219
'CUZ WHEN HE DESTROYS
A MONSTER...

00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:09.060
THEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE
EQUAL TO THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:10.598 --> 00:15:11.401
AND THAT'S 4,000!

00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:13.841
AAH!

00:15:16.114 --> 00:15:16.783
SCHOOL'S OUT, ZANE.

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:18.321
NOT YET, IT'S NOT!

00:15:19.323 --> 00:15:20.326
I ACTIVATE A TRAP CARD...

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.132
DAMAGE POLARIZER!

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:24.973
DAMAGE POLARIZER?!

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:32.059
NOW ALL DAMAGE FROM
A SPECIAL EFFECT
GETS REDUCED TO ZERO!

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:36.673
[GASPING]

00:15:37.743 --> 00:15:39.347
WELL, I GOTTA HAND
IT TO YA, ZANE...

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.252
THAT'S A SWEET CARD!

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:44.595
AND AS THE "CHERRY ON TOP,"
WE NOW DRAW ONE CARD EACH.

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:47.437
AND FOR YOUR SAKE, JADEN...

00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:49.309
I HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:53.387
[THINKING]
I CAN'T BELIEVE--

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:54.289
[THINKING] I DREW---

00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:55.459
Both: BATTLE FUSION!

00:15:56.028 --> 00:15:57.030
I'LL JUST THROWDOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:15:58.635 --> 00:15:59.638
AND CALL IT A TURN.

00:16:00.306 --> 00:16:01.109
I GUESS YOU'RE UP.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:02.981
SO, WHAT'LL IT BE
THIS TIME?

00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:04.218
YOU'LL SEE...

00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:05.990
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
GOOD LUCK.

00:16:06.691 --> 00:16:07.694
'CUZ SOMETHING
JUST TELLS ME

00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:08.965
THIS IS THE LAST ROUND!

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:10.369
I AGREE.

00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:12.408
[THINKING] THE LAST
ROUND FOR YOU, JADEN.

00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:14.079
MY VICTORY IS ASSURED.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.553
PREPARE FOR THE BITTER
TASTE OF DEFEAT, JADEN.

00:16:17.322 --> 00:16:18.125
ALRIGHT! NOW! MY TURN!

00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:22.403
I DON'T LIKE THAT SMILE!

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.843
ESPECIALLY SINCE
ZANE NEVER SMILES!

00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:26.415
SOMETHING'S UP HERE.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.952
YEAH! THAT'S FOR SURE!

00:16:29.457 --> 00:16:32.064
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
SEE JUST WHAT EXACTLY
IT IS REALLY SOON!

00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:34.538
GET SET FOR
THE FINAL ROUND

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:37.647
BETWEEN THIS SCHOOL'S
TWO BEST DUELISTS!

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:42.527
JADEN, IT'S BEEN FUN,

00:16:43.764 --> 00:16:45.135
BUT NOW I'M AFRAID
THAT IT'S OVER!

00:16:46.037 --> 00:16:46.840
I ACTIVATE POWER BOND!

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.116
SO NOW, BY SACRIFICING
THE RIGHT MONSTERS,

00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:53.258
I CAN ONCE AGAIN SUMMON
THE CYBER END DRAGON!

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:55.866
BUT HOW?!

00:16:56.467 --> 00:16:57.871
YOU GOTTA HAVE MONSTERS
TO SACRIFICE THEM!

00:16:58.974 --> 00:16:59.977
CHAZZ IS RIGHT FOR ONCE.

00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:01.248
HIS FIELD IS BARE!

00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:03.888
I'M SORRY, I FORGOT...
I DON'T NEED MONSTERS!

00:17:08.066 --> 00:17:09.069
I ACTIVATE:
CYBERNETIC FUSION SUPPORT!

00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:13.014
BY TRADING HALF
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.153
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE
ANY SACRIFICES

00:17:16.357 --> 00:17:17.326
TO SUMMON MY FUSION MONSTER!

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.034
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...

00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:27.388
LET'S WELCOME BACK
CYBER END DRAGON!

00:17:34.676 --> 00:17:37.083
[THINKING] YOU KNOW,
I'M STARTING TO REALLY
GET SICK OF THIS THING.

00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:39.457
AND THANKS
TO POWER BOND,

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.295

00:17:42.398 --> 00:17:43.802
AND NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE THIS:
LIMITER REMOVAL!

00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:46.744
TROUBLE!

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.448
VERY SEVERE TROUBLE!

00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:50.153
ALL COMING
FOR JADEN!

00:17:50.822 --> 00:17:51.491
THANKS TO THIS.

00:17:52.192 --> 00:17:53.195
ALL MACHINE TYPE
MONSTERS OUT

00:17:54.098 --> 00:17:55.101
GET THEIR ATTACK
POINTS DOUBLED,

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.043
AND GUESS WHAT TYPE
MY DRAGON IS?

00:18:01.687 --> 00:18:02.422
YOU'RE THROUGH!

00:18:02.856 --> 00:18:03.525
DON'T THINK SO!

00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:04.929
GO BATTLE FUSION!

00:18:05.932 --> 00:18:06.935
IF USED DURING A BATTLE,

00:18:07.402 --> 00:18:08.807
MY MONSTER GAINS
AS MANY ATTACK POINTS

00:18:10.678 --> 00:18:12.651
AS TRIPLE-CHROME DOME
OVER THERE!

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.632
HE CAN'T DO THAT!

00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.638
IT SIMPLY MUST BE
AGAINST THE RULES!

00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:20.607
OH, PLEASE!

00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:23.650
THIS IS EVERYTHING
DUELING IS ABOUT!

00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:28.664
NICE MOVE. BUT
IT'S ALL FOR NAUGHT.

00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:30.670
I USE: THE SPELL CARD
BATTLE FUSION!

00:18:32.307 --> 00:18:32.976
THAT'S RIGHT, JADEN!

00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:34.614
I HAVE ONE, TOO!

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:36.185
UH-OH.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.531
WOW, ZANE!

00:18:41.434 --> 00:18:42.235
I'M GONNA MISS YA!

00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:43.740

00:18:44.676 --> 00:18:46.281
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M PASSING YOU THE TORCH.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.492
ONCE I LEAVE HERE
YOU'LL BE THE TOP STUDENT
AT THIS SCHOOL.

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.200
DESPITE YOUR GRADES
OR YOUR RANK,

00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:57.278
YOU'LL BE THE BEST,
SO MAKE ME PROUD.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.883
I'LL GIVE IT MY ALL,
ZANE.

00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:00.321
AND I'LL START
RIGHT HERE!

00:19:00.856 --> 00:19:01.858
'CUZ THIS DUEL'S
NOT DONE!

00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:03.530

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.535

TRICK UP MY SLEEVE!

00:19:06.371 --> 00:19:07.574
OH, YEAH!

00:19:08.377 --> 00:19:09.045
I'M ACTIVATING...

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:10.850
THE TRAP KNOWN AS...

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:12.723

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:24.623

WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:19:24.824 --> 00:19:26.295
SURE DO.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.451
[SCREAMING]

00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:38.563
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?!

00:19:39.232 --> 00:19:39.900
WHO WON?

00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:40.970
AW, MAN.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.209
[GASPING]

00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:02.631

UH, I THINK.

00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:13.128
HOW'S MY HAIR?
IS IT STILL THERE?

00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:15.067
LOOKS LIKE A DRAW.

00:20:16.003 --> 00:20:16.671
YEAH!

00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:18.991
DOES THAT MEAN
WE GOTTA DUEL AGAIN?

00:20:20.225 --> 00:20:20.892
ABSOLUTELY.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.160
AND SOMEDAY WE WILL.

00:20:23.228 --> 00:20:24.229

00:20:26.098 --> 00:20:26.765
UNTIL THEN.

00:20:28.066 --> 00:20:29.267
GOOD, I COULD USE
THE BREAK.

00:20:29.868 --> 00:20:30.535

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.739
[LAUGHTER]
