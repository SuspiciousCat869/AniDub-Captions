00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:40.152
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.219
All: CHAZZ IT UP!

00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:42.454
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.588
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:44.589
CHAZZ IT UP!

00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:45.724

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.058
IMBECILE!

00:18:47.058 --> 00:18:48.794
HOW COULD YOU
LOSE THIS?!

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.495
RELAX, JAGGER.

00:18:50.495 --> 00:18:52.464
IT'S ONLY
ONE DUEL.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.565
ONE DUEL?

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.966
JUST LISTEN TO THEM!

00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:56.468
THIS ONE DUEL

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.603
HAS TURNED CHAZZ
INTO A HERO!

00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:01.907
AND A MAJOR
HEADACHE FOR US.

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:03.575
OF COURSE, HE WON.

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:05.010
DID YOU REALLY
THINK I WOULD

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.812
GIVE DUEL ACADEMY
TO THOSE TWO?

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.347
THEY HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT WORLD DOMINATION.

00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:14.553
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.587
CATCH ME!

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.255
OH, A WISE GUY!

00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:19.424

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:20.859
QUIET!

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:21.927
GET OUT HERE!

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.195
NOW!

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.263
I DIDN'T
SIGN UP FOR THIS!

00:19:25.263 --> 00:19:26.865
COME ON, BOSS!

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.800
THOSE GUYS
JUST WANT TO
BE YOUR FRIEND!

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.902
NOW, LET'S GO
GET SOME PIZZA!

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:33.004
I CALL EXTRA
ANCHOVIES!

00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:34.172
[CHEERING]
YEAH!

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:36.208
I DON'T WANT
ANCHOVIES!

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:38.410
AND I DON'T WANT
ANY FRIENDS!

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.011
OR ANY ROOMMATES!

00:19:40.011 --> 00:19:42.013
OR PETS OR...

00:19:42.013 --> 00:19:44.115
OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU GUYS ARE!

00:19:44.115 --> 00:19:45.217
IN THAT CASE,

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.785

US FAMILY!

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:47.786
