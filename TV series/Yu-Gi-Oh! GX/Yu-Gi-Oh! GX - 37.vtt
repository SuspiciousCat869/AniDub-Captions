I SUMMON
AMAZONESS PALADIN!

00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:36.889
AND WHILE PALADIN'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.260
SHE GAINS AN EXTRA
100 ATTACK POINTS

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.164
FOR EVERY SINGLE
MONSTER OUT...

00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:43.168
WITH AMAZONESS
IN ITS NAME!

00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:47.644
AND I ACTIVATE THIS:
A SPELL KNOWN AS
AMAZONESS CHARM!

00:07:47.644 --> 00:07:50.850
NOW, ALL THE MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD THAT ARE
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.487
ARE SWITCHED TO ATTACK MODE,

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:55.193
AND THEY EACH GAIN
200 ATTACK POINTS.

00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:56.662
Crowler: I DON'T GET IT.

00:07:56.662 --> 00:07:58.299
WHY WOULD SHE PLAY A CARD
THAT INCREASES

00:07:58.299 --> 00:07:59.902
JADEN'S ATTACK POWER?

00:07:59.902 --> 00:08:02.474
FOR THE THRILL OF IT!
THE PASSION!

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:04.778
SO, ARE WE ENJOYING
THE MATCH SO FAR?

00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:06.816
NOT GETTING DISTRACTED,
I HOPE.

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.753
NOTHIN' DISTRACTS
ME FROM DUELING!

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.156
DIDN'T YA KNOW?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.596
WELL MAYBE THIS
WILL MAKE YOU RECONSIDER!

00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:16.068
THE CARD AMAZONESS ARENA!

00:08:16.068 --> 00:08:19.709
WHEN THIS CARD ACTIVATES,
WE BOTH GAIN 600 LIFE POINTS.

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:22.915
AND IT'S NOT
JUST DISTRACTING,
BUT CAPTIVATING.

00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:24.519
HA HA HA!

00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:30.062
WOW, SHE MUST BE
REALLY DESPERATE
TO FIND A HUSBAND...

00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:32.166
IF SHE'S GOTTA USE A CAGE!

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:36.442
HA HA HA!
SEE, AMAZONESS ARENA
IS A SACRED ARENA...

00:08:36.442 --> 00:08:38.880
IN HERE, YOU DON'T
JUST FIGHT
WITH YOUR MONSTERS,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.450
BUT WITH YOUR SOUL!

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.555
AND JUST HOW DO I
DO THAT?!

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.292
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT!

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:48.199
BUT FIRST: AMAZONESS PALADIN
ATTACKS YOUR AVIAN!

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:49.869
HYAH!

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.860
AAH!

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.833
NOW YOU'LL SEE
THE POWER OF MY ARENA!

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.804
AFTER OUR MONSTERS
ARE ALL DONE,

00:09:06.804 --> 00:09:08.808
YOUR SOUL
CAN BATTLE MINE!

00:09:08.808 --> 00:09:11.145
IF YOU SACRIFICE A HUNDRED
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:12.749
YOU TAKE AWAY
A HUNDRED OF MINE!

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:14.419
WATCH OUT, JADEN!

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:16.089
I GUESS I SHOULD
WARN YOU...

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:18.093
I DON'T
EVER HIT GIRLS.

00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:20.999
AND YOU SHOULDN'T,
BUT THIS ISN'T
A FIGHT BETWEEN US.

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:22.869
YOU SEE...
IT'S LIKE I SAID...

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.539
OUR SOULS WILL CLASH!

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:26.343
IF YOU SAY SO!

00:09:26.343 --> 00:09:28.214
HMM.

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:30.685
HYAH!

00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:32.722
UNH! HYAH!

00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:33.724
HYAH!

00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:41.340
AAH! AAH!

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.475
JADEN!

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:43.744
COME ON!

00:09:43.744 --> 00:09:45.949
THIS IS EMBARRASSING
FOR ALL OF US GUYS!

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.993
AAH!

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:52.730
THAT'S NOT
A BAD LEFT HOOK.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.568
WHAT THE--
SHE COMPLIMENTS
HIS ATTACK?

00:09:55.568 --> 00:09:57.338
ISN'T SHE GREAT!

00:09:57.338 --> 00:09:58.507
LIKE THAT?

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.879
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE...THIS!

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.683

REALLY NICE MOVE!

00:10:17.446 --> 00:10:19.217
THAT THUNDER GIANT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:21.387
CAN TAKE OUT A MONSTER
WITH LESS ATTACK POINTS

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.191
ON THE TURN
IT WAS SUMMONED!

00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:27.266
GUESS THIS IS
GOOD-BYE PALADIN.

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:28.435
IMPRESSIVE.

00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:29.871
I'M NOT DONE!

00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:31.608

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:58.996
UH, BASTION...I THINK

00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:00.165

00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:01.869
SHE WOULD NEVER
LEAVE ME!

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.906
UNH! AAH!

A BAD THING!

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.959

WHOA!

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:30.347
IT'S A RARE CARD,
AND I CAN ONLY USE IT

00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:32.786
WHEN YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE
OF ATTACKING A FIELD

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:35.792
THAT ONLY HAS
AMAZONESS MONSTERS ON IT!

00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:39.666
ONCE YOU DO...ALL YOUR
MONSTERS LOSE 600
ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:42.472
NOT TOO SHABBY
FOR A GIRL, HUH?

00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:48.050
NO! NOT TOO
SHABBY AT ALL,

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.253
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN...

00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:50.922

WHAT'S HE TRYING
TO PROVE?

00:13:21.518 --> 00:13:23.387
Alexis: I DON'T KNOW,

00:13:25.693 --> 00:13:28.932
YES, HE'S ENJOYING HIMSELF...
AND WITHOUT BEING IN LOVE...

00:13:28.932 --> 00:13:32.507
ALRIGHT...
NEXT, I'LL HAVE MY

BUT HEY! IT'S WORTH

FOR EVERY SINGLE
AMAZONESS MONSTER I HAVE!

PERHAPS HE'S FALLEN
UNDER TANIA'S SPELL...

THE SAME SPELL THAT
CAUSED BASTION TO LOSE.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.303
IT'S NO SPELL, ZANE...

00:15:59.303 --> 00:16:03.076

00:16:16.804 --> 00:16:17.873
WHY WOULD TANIA
ATTACK A MONSTER

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:19.610
WITH MORE
DEFENSE POINTS?

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.518
SIMPLE! TO USE
THAT ARENA ABILITY
TO FIGHT JADEN AGAIN!

00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:25.555
HYAH!
HYAH!

00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:28.796
HYAH!
HYAH!

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.402
HE'S STILL
IN THERE...

00:16:32.402 --> 00:16:34.073
FOR NOW...
HUH?

00:16:34.073 --> 00:16:37.513
NEXT...I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL AMAZONESS TRAINER

00:16:37.513 --> 00:16:39.283
TO SEAL YOUR FATE!

00:16:43.324 --> 00:16:45.362
AW, JADEN IS IN SOME
DEEP TROUBLE HERE!

00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:47.534
SINCE SHE PLAYED
THAT AMAZONESS
TRAINER--

00:16:47.534 --> 00:16:49.704
IF THAT TIGER IS
UNABLE TO DEFEAT
ITS TARGET

00:16:49.704 --> 00:16:50.973
DURING
THIS ROUND...

00:16:50.973 --> 00:16:52.277
THE TRAINER CARD
INSTILLS

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.979
A TACTICAL
ADVANTAGE OF 400

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.015
EXTRA
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.652
FOR
ANOTHER ATTACK!

00:16:56.652 --> 00:16:58.722
ALRIGHT...NOW HOW
ABOUT SOMEBODY
EXPLAIN IT

00:16:58.722 --> 00:17:00.526
TO ME IN ENGLISH?

00:17:00.526 --> 00:17:04.301
I'M AFRAID...
IF THAT TIGER ATTACKS
JADEN AGAIN...

00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:06.204
THEN THIS DUEL
IS FINISHED...

00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:07.740
Crowler: YES, JADEN
WILL LOSE...

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.377
AND WE'LL LOSE HIM
AS A STUDENT

00:17:09.377 --> 00:17:11.815
BECAUSE HE'LL HAVE TO
MARRY TANIA!

00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:13.752
DON'T SAY THAT!

00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:15.523
JADEN, NO...

00:17:15.523 --> 00:17:17.694
ERR. WHAT'S
THE HOLD UP?!

00:17:17.694 --> 00:17:20.266
OH, YOU KNOW, HUN...
JUST ENJOYING THE MOMENT.

00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:22.604
AFTER ALL, IT'LL BE
OUR ANNIVERSARY!

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:26.478
AAAAAAATAAAAAACK!

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:29.585
NOT YET!
I PLAY A TRAP--
CLAY CHARGE!

00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:31.188
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

00:17:31.188 --> 00:17:34.327
IF YOU ATTACK
CLAYMAN WHEN I USE
THIS HERE TRAP CARD,

00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:36.966
NOT ONLY DO BOTH
MONSTERS BITE
THE BIG ONE,

00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:40.340
BUT YOU TAKE 800
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.112
ERR!

00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:44.415
HEH HEH HEH!

00:17:44.415 --> 00:17:46.419
SO YOU'RE PLAYING HARD
TO GET I SEE.

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:47.821
I LIKE THAT.

00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:50.293
HEY! I'M JUST LIKING
THIS ALL-OUT DUEL!

00:17:50.293 --> 00:17:52.965
YA KNOW...I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M LIKING IT TOO,

00:17:52.965 --> 00:17:54.802
IT'S NON-STOP ACTION!

00:17:54.802 --> 00:17:57.474
AND I THINK THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT JADEN'S
GOING FOR, TOO.

00:17:57.474 --> 00:17:59.245
BEAT HER
AT HER OWN GAME.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:02.284
I GUESS. UNLESS HE'S
TRYING TO IMPRESS HER.

00:18:02.284 --> 00:18:05.257
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THIS
TANIA GIRL IS JADEN'S TYPE?

00:18:05.257 --> 00:18:07.261
WHY DON'T YOU
SHUT IT, CHAZZ?

00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:10.200
NO WAY JADEN WOULD
EVER DATE SOMEONE
LIKE THAT THING.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.569
AND UNLESS YOU FORGOT...

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:13.908
THIS IS ABOUT MORE
THAN JUST MARRIAGE!

00:18:13.908 --> 00:18:15.778
JADEN NEEDS
A MIRACLE DRAW HERE

00:18:15.778 --> 00:18:18.517
OR TANIA'S GOING TO GET
ANOTHER SPIRIT GATE KEY,

00:18:18.517 --> 00:18:20.087
NOT TO MENTION,
BASTION'S GOING TO SPEND

00:18:20.087 --> 00:18:22.992
THE REST OF HIS LIFE
IN SOME LAME LOVE LIMBO.

00:18:22.992 --> 00:18:27.335
THERE'S A LOT RIDING
ON JADEN'S SHOULDERS
THIS MOVE...

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.942
YOU FOUGHT WELL, JADEN,
BUT MY SWORDS WOMAN
WILL BEAT YOU...

00:18:30.942 --> 00:18:33.581
REMEMBER...HER SPECIAL EFFECT
MAKES IT SO YOU TAKE

00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:35.251
ALL DAMAGE
YOU DEAL TO HER!

00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:36.954
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:18:36.954 --> 00:18:40.862
WITH ONE CARD I CAN,
AND I JUST DREW IT!

00:18:40.862 --> 00:18:45.171
GO ELEMENTAL
HERO WILDHEART
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:46.373
AHH!
AHH!
AHH!

00:18:46.373 --> 00:18:48.344
THEY HAVE THE SAME
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.883
SO THEN THEY'LL
DESTROY EACH OTHER!

00:18:50.883 --> 00:18:52.485
YOU GO GET HER,
JADEN!

00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:56.493
WILDHEART,
ATTACK AMAZONESS
SWORDS WOMAN!

00:18:56.493 --> 00:18:58.364
[YELLING]

00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:04.042
NOW LET'S GO!

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.180
YEAH.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.352
THIS IS IT!
SHE'S DOWN TO JUST ONE
HUNDRED ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:09.352 --> 00:19:10.756
AND I'M BACK
DOWN TO EARTH.

00:19:10.756 --> 00:19:13.027
JADEN'S PROVEN YOU CAN
DUEL PASSIONATELY...

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.766
WITHOUT BEING...IN LOVE.

00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:18.705
NOW GO GET HER JADEN
AND WIN THIS MATCH
FOR US BOTH!

00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:20.275
AAH!

00:19:20.275 --> 00:19:21.578
AAH!

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:23.448
[BOTH YELLING]

00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:32.700
ERR!

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.802
UNH!

00:19:33.802 --> 00:19:35.205
Banner:
IT IS OVER...

00:19:35.205 --> 00:19:38.411
Crowler: NEVER...HAVE I
SEEN TWO PEOPLE DUEL

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.015
WITH SUCH PASSION
AND HEART.

00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:41.584
WELL, TELL US,
BASTION.

00:19:41.584 --> 00:19:43.054
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:19:43.054 --> 00:19:45.459
LIKE A MAN STILL IN
THE THROWS OF LOVE?

00:19:45.459 --> 00:19:47.764
OR HAS THIS DUEL
FINALLY HELPED
YOU REBOUND?

00:19:47.764 --> 00:19:51.304
STILL IN LOVE...
BUT IN LOVE NOW...
WITH DUELING.

00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:54.210
I SEE WHERE THE PASSION
LIES ONCE AGAIN.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.014
I GUESS THAT'S GAME.

00:19:56.014 --> 00:19:58.451
LEMME KNOW IF YA
EVER WANNA REMATCH!

00:19:58.451 --> 00:19:59.655
NO REMATCH.

00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:02.026
I JOINED THE SHADOW RIDERS
TO FIND A DUELIST

00:20:02.026 --> 00:20:04.464
WHO WOULD BE WORTHY
TO BE MY HUSBAND...

00:20:04.464 --> 00:20:07.236
BUT I'VE DISCOVERED
I AM NOT WORTHY...

00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:10.008
TO BE WITH SOMEONE
STRONG AS YOU.

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:13.582
TANIA?

00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:24.871
WHA?!

00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:26.809
[GROWLS]

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.612
A TIGER?!

00:20:28.612 --> 00:20:32.320
TANIA...IS THAT YOU?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.481
Tania: FAREWELL,
BASTION...

00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:39.217
WELL THEN...
I GUESS THAT THIS IS IT.

00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:43.087
BOY, BASTION...
YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO PICK 'EM!

00:20:43.087 --> 00:20:44.422
Jaden: DON'T WORRY,
BUDDY...

00:20:44.422 --> 00:20:46.657
THERE'S PLENTY
OF FISH IN THA SEA!

00:20:46.657 --> 00:20:48.926
Bastion: YES, BUT NOT
TOO MANY TIGERS.

00:20:48.926 --> 00:20:50.428
THANK GOODNESS.
