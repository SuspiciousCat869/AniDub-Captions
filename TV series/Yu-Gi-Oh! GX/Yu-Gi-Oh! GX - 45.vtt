00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:30.869
BE CAREFUL!

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.087
LET'S THROWDOWN!

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:42.270
PREPARE YOURSELF!

00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:43.908
I'VE BEEN PREPARIN'
FOR THIS

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:46.282
EVER SINCE
YOU SHADOW RIDERS
FIRST SHOWED!

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.153
AND NOW AMNAEL...

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.430
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:09.351
ALRIGHT,
TIME TO THROWDOWN...

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:11.323
CUZ I'M GETTIN'
MY FRIENDS BACK...

00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.129
NO MATTER WHAT
IT TAKES, AMNAEL!

00:09:13.296 --> 00:09:14.299
IS THAT SO?

00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:17.308
BUT WHAT IF YOU DO NOT POSSESS
WHAT IT TAKES, JADEN?

00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:21.387
BECAUSE TO BEAT ME, YOU'LL HAVE
TO REACH A WHOLE NEW ECHELON
OF DUELING EXPERTISE.

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.961
NOW WE BEGIN!

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:29.912
AND I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
CHAOS DISTILL!

00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:33.857
WHAT IS THAT THING?

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:35.663
OH, YEAH,
LIKE I'M GONNA KNOW.

00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:37.101
DUE TO ITS EFFECT,

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.277
ALL MY CARDS THAT
WOULD NORMALLY GO TO
THE GRAVEYARD THIS DUEL

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:41.881
WILL INSTEAD BE REMOVED
FROM PLAY!

00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:43.487
[THINKING]
HUH?

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:45.560
WHY WOULD HE WANT HIS CARDS
REMOVED FROM PLAY?

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:50.173
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE MY SECOND
SPELL CARD, STEEL LAMP!

00:09:53.349 --> 00:09:54.955
AND WHEN CHAOS DISTILL
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:09:55.857 --> 00:10:00.838
I CAN USE STEEL LAMP
TO SUMMON ALCHEMY BEAST...
SALAMANDRA THE STEEL!

00:10:04.784 --> 00:10:07.224
YOU SEE, ALCHEMY BEASTS
CAN'T BE SUMMONED IN
THE NORMAL MANNER,

00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:11.136
BUT THEY CAN WAGE
DIRECT ATTACKS AGAINST YOU.

00:10:12.073 --> 00:10:13.477
WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM
FOR YOU

00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:15.349
BECAUSE WITH
THESE TWO SPELL CARDS:

00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:17.254
BRONZE SCALE
AND LEAD COMPASS...

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:21.066
ALONG WITH CHAOS DISTILL,
I CAN NOW SUMMON TWO MORE
ALCHEMY BEASTS!

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:26.115
OUROBOROS THE BRONZE
AND LEON THE LEAD!

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.546
I'LL NOW END WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:39.187
THREE MONSTERS...
IN THE VERY FIRST TURN?!

00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:41.694
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:44.637
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE,

00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:46.609
JUST WAIT UNTIL
YOU SEE THEM ATTACK!

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:48.917
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE 'EM
THAT CHANCE!

00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:53.363
I SUMMON...
HERO BUBBLEMAN!

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:58.412
AND SINCE HE'S
THE ONLY ONE OUT...

00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:00.016
I GET TO DRAW
TWO MORE CARDS!

00:11:00.986 --> 00:11:03.260
AND I GOTTA FEELING
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
SOME SWEET ONES!

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.363
IT'S GOOD TO BE RIGHT!

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:08.175
I ACTIVATE
BUBBLE BLASTER!

00:11:11.217 --> 00:11:12.554
FIRE, BOMBARDING
BUBBLE BARRAGE!

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:16.667
THAT IS ONE BUBBLE THAT
I'M AFRAID I MUST BURST.

00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:19.575
I ACTIVATE A TRAP:
ELEMENTAL ABSORBER!

00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:24.791
WITH THIS CARD, I CAN REMOVE
A MONSTER IN MY HAND FROM PLAY

00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:27.265
TO NEGATE THE ATTACK
OF YOUR MONSTER

00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:29.839
AS LONG AS THEY BOTH HAVE
THE SAME ATTRIBUTE!

00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:31.177
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.314
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:36.392
NOT WHEN THE CARD I REMOVE
FROM PLAY IS AQUA SPIRIT!

00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:45.052
NO, MY ATTACK!

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:46.422
HAS BEEN STOPPED!

00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:48.095
AND IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:49.599
GO, MY ALCHEMY BEASTS!

00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:51.471
ATTACK JADEN DIRECTLY!

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:52.942
SALAMANDRA THE STEEL!

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:56.252
LET LOOSE FLAMESHOT OF ORE!

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.437
NOW, OUROBOROS AND LEON
ATTACK AS WELL!

00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:11.498
JADEN JUST GOT
CLOBBERED!

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:13.871
HANG IN THERE, JADEN!

00:12:14.407 --> 00:12:16.212
HE'S ONLY GOT ONE CARD LEFT
IN HIS HAND!

00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:18.453
IF YOU CAN HOLD ON
THROUGH THIS TURN,

00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:19.622
YOU'LL HAVE
THE UPPER HAND,

00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:22.030
AND HE'LL BE THE ONE
WHO'S ON THE ROPES!

00:12:22.665 --> 00:12:23.668
HA HA HA!

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:25.072
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

00:12:25.373 --> 00:12:26.376
UH-OH...

00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.851
YOU SHOULD HAVE PAID BETTER
ATTENTION IN CLASS.

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:31.658
PERHAPS THEN YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT AGAINST MY ALCHEMY DECK,

00:12:32.394 --> 00:12:33.598
THINGS ARE NOT
WHAT THEY SEEM.

00:12:34.334 --> 00:12:36.340
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
BLACK PROCESS... NEGLEDO!

00:12:37.476 --> 00:12:40.485
WHEN CHAOS DISTILL
IS ON THE FIELD AND THERE
ARE NO CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:45.032
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO REMOVE ALL ALCHEMY BEASTS
ON THE FIELD FROM PLAY,

00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:49.980
AND THEN DRAW TWO NEW CARDS
PER BEAST!

00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:55.564
SO THEN
YOU'RE TAKIN' OUT
YOUR OWN MONSTERS?

00:12:56.633 --> 00:12:58.874
THAT IS THE WAY
OF THE ALCHEMIST:
DESTRUCTION AND REBIRTH.

00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:03.186
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
IF YOU ARE DESTROYED HERE.

00:13:03.722 --> 00:13:05.125
THERE WILL BE
NO REBIRTH FOR YOU!

00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:07.934
NOW THEN, SINCE I REMOVED
3 ALCHEMY BEASTS FROM PLAY,

00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:10.275
I GET TO DRAW 6 CARDS!

00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:12.648
AND NOW, LET'S PLAY
SOME OF THEM.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:20.740
I ACTIVATE TIN SPELL CIRCLE,
MERCURY HOURGLASS
AND SILVER KEY!

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:36.888
ALRIGHT... NOW
IT'S MY TURN!

00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:40.365
GO... ELEMENTAL
HERO CLAYMAN!

00:13:44.578 --> 00:13:45.581
NEXT I'LL PLAY...

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.590
THE SPELL CARD...
MUD MAX!

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.802
THIS PUTS CLAYMAN
IN OVERDRIVE...

00:13:54.273 --> 00:13:56.446
TO THE TUNE OF 300
EXTRA SUPERCHARGED
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:57.216 --> 00:13:58.285
OH AND GUESS WHAT,
AMNAEL?

00:13:59.322 --> 00:14:01.997
I'M GONNA USE 'EM ALL
RIGHT NOW TO RUN OVER
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:03.602
SO HIT IT CLAYMAN!

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.841
PUT THE PEDAL TO
THE METAL AND ATTACK!

00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:12.729
I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF ELEMENTAL ABSORBER!

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.073
BY SIMPLY REMOVING
THE ROCK SPIRIT FROM PLAY

00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:20.820
I CAN NEGATE THE ATTACK
OF THAT EARTH ATTRIBUTE MONSTER!

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:26.336
[THINKING]
OH, MAN.

00:14:26.704 --> 00:14:28.510
IT'S LIKE HE HAS A CARD
TO CANCEL OUT

00:14:28.543 --> 00:14:29.948
EVERY ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
IN MY DECK.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:32.422
I WARNED YOU, JADEN...

00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:35.498
TO BE TRIUMPHANT
YOU WILL NEED TO
USE YOUR CARDS

00:14:35.564 --> 00:14:37.169
IN A WAY YOU'VE
NEVER USED THEM BEFORE.

00:14:37.504 --> 00:14:39.944
YOU WILL NEED TO BECOME
A BETTER DUELIST THAN
YOU'VE EVER BEEN,

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.850
IF NOT, YOU WILL JOIN
YOUR FRIENDS.

00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:44.257
OH, I'LL BE JOINING
MY FRIENDS ALRIGHT...

00:14:44.691 --> 00:14:45.694
WHEN I FREE 'EM!

00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:47.868
THEN YOU HAD BETTER
"GET YOUR GAME ON"

00:14:49.373 --> 00:14:51.044
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY
FALLEN FAR BEHIND.

00:14:51.813 --> 00:14:53.285
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO FALL
EVEN FURTHER!

00:14:54.253 --> 00:14:55.256
OBSERVE!

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:57.932
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
WHITE PROCESS... ALBEDO!

00:14:59.938 --> 00:15:02.010
AND THANKS TO IT, I CAN NOW
SUMMON GOLDEN HOMUNCULUS!

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:06.122
OH!
AH!

00:15:06.724 --> 00:15:07.728
FORGED IN FIRE,

00:15:08.296 --> 00:15:10.770
GOLDEN HOMUNCULUS DOESN'T WORK
LIKE ANY OTHER CARD YOU'VE SEEN.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.612
YOU SEE, HIS ATTACK POINTS
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.687
ARE EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF CARDS
THAT I'VE REMOVED FROM PLAY

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:18.226
AND THEN MULTIPLIED
BY 300!

00:15:20.332 --> 00:15:22.137
SO, SINCE I HAVE REMOVED
13 CARDS SO FAR,

00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:24.611
HIS ATTACK POINTS
BECOME 3,900!

00:15:26.852 --> 00:15:30.329
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE ABOUT TO BECOME ZERO!

00:15:33.973 --> 00:15:34.976
IT IS OVER, JADEN.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.982
AND I WAS EXPECTING
SO MUCH MORE FROM YOU.

00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:38.888
ATTACK, ALCHEMY BEASTS!

00:15:39.757 --> 00:15:40.760
SONIC SEARER!

00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:42.231
SCREAMING STREAM!

00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:44.605
SHOCKWAVE SLIVERS!

00:15:46.477 --> 00:15:48.951
OH! AH!

00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:54.334
JADEN!

00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:55.404
HE GOT NAILED!

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:56.541
BUT I'M NOT FINISHED YET.

00:15:57.878 --> 00:15:59.049
NOW, GOLDEN HOMUNCULUS
ATTACK!

00:15:59.684 --> 00:16:02.726
STONE SHARD STORM!

00:16:13.726 --> 00:16:14.729
YOU ARE BEATEN.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.203
HA HA HA!

00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:19.409
WHAT THE...?!

00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:23.221
HATE TO DISAPPOINT YA,
BUT I'M STILL HERE!

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:25.562
KNOW WHY?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.200
BECAUSE
WHEN YOU ATTACKED,

00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:28.871
I USED THE EFFECT
OF MY EQUIP SPELL:

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:29.907
MUD MAX.

00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:31.111
NOW BY DESTROYING IT,

00:16:32.984 --> 00:16:34.154
YOUR ATTACK'S
CANCELLED OUT!

00:16:35.157 --> 00:16:36.996
BUT HOLD ON, AMNAEL...
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.333
SOMEONE RATHER...

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:40.875
CUZ I ALSO GET TO SUMMON
AN ELEMENTAL HERO!

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:44.050
AND I'M BRINGING OUT
AVIAN!

00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:48.899
IMPRESSIVE.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.573
I'M NOT DONE! HA!

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.515
NEXT I'M GONNA PLAY...

00:16:55.752 --> 00:16:59.597
ELEMENTAL HERO
BURSTINATRIX!

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:02.907
NOW LET'S USE
SOME OF THESE MONSTERS!

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.813
GO AVIAN!

00:17:05.247 --> 00:17:06.318
ATTACK WITH
QUILL CASCADE!

00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:09.795
GO ELEMENTAL ABSORBER!

00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:16.581
I REMOVE
GARUDA THE WIND SPIRIT
TO NEGATE YOUR ATTACK!

00:17:21.128 --> 00:17:23.202
AND SINCE ANOTHER CARD
HAS BEEN REMOVED
FROM THE GAME,

00:17:24.405 --> 00:17:26.277
THE ATTACK POINTS OF
GOLDEN HOMUNCULUS INCREASE!

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.718
YEAH, YEAH...
NOW, BURSTINATRIX!

00:17:30.556 --> 00:17:31.559
ATTACK!

00:17:31.894 --> 00:17:32.897
FLARE STORM!

00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:36.574
I REMOVE SPIRIT OF FLAMES
TO NEGATE YOUR ATTACK!

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:39.851
GO ELEMENTAL ABSORBER!

00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:42.694
AW, MAN.

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.666
NOTHING'S GETTING
THROUGH TO DO DAMAGE!

00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:45.836
I KNOW!

00:17:46.237 --> 00:17:48.444
THAT ELEMENTAL ABSORBER KEEPS
CANCELING OUT HIS ATTACKS!

00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:49.915
IT'S COOL!

00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:52.054
I GUESS THAT I'LL JUST
HAVE TO USE SOMETHING

00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:53.559
OTHER THAN MY
ELEMENTAL HEROES THEN!

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.431
SO I'M GONNA PLAY...
BURST RETURN!

00:17:56.902 --> 00:17:58.507
SEE, WHEN BURSTINATRIX
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:17:59.443 --> 00:18:01.584
THIS CARD LETS ME
RETURN ALL OTHER
ELEMENTAL HEROES

00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.388
BACK TO MY HAND!

00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:07.134
