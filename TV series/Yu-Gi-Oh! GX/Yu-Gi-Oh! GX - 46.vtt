00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.676
Chumley:
LAST TIME ON "YU-GI-OH! GX"...

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:05.982
THIS IS...
PROFESSOR BANNER!

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:07.620
NO WAY!
PROFESSOR BANNER

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.458
COULDN'T HAVE
MUMMIFIED THIS FAST.

00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:13.234
Man: THAT IS THE BODY OF THE ONE
YOU KNOW AS PROFESSOR BANNER.

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.541
WHAT THE--?!
WHO IS THAT?

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:20.119
THE SEVENTH SHADOW RIDER.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.255
AMNAEL.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.360
LET'S THROWDOWN!

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.830
GO, MY ALCHEMY BEASTS!

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.137
ATTACK JADEN DIRECTLY!

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.942
SALAMANDRA THE STEEL!

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:32.450
LET LOOSE FLAMESHOT
OF ORE!

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.091
NOW GO,
BURST IMPACT!

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:36.126
NOW ALL
MONSTERS OUT,

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:37.396
OTHER THAN
BURSTINATRIX...

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:39.101
ARE DESTROYED!

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.576
AND THEN YOU TAKE
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE
FOR EACH OF THEM!

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.994
NO, PHARAOH!
THAT GUY'S
DANGEROUS!

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:50.697
Syrus: W-WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:53.204
BUT PHARAOH'S NEVER THAT
FRIENDLY WITH STRANGERS!

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.975
THEN...AMNAEL...

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:59.755
IS NO STRANGER
TO PHARAOH OR TO YOU.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:00.857
AHH!

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:02.595
Chumley: PROFESSOR BANNER?!

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.665
WAIT, IF YOU'RE
BANNER,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.238
THEN...WHO'S...
THAT MUMMY?

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.178
HA HA HA!
THAT MUMMY IS ALSO ME...

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:10.849
THERE IS MORE GOING
ON HERE

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:13.456
THAN YOU COULD
POSSIBLY IMAGINE!

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.965
BUT THE TRUTH WILL BE

Jaden:
PROFESSOR BANNER?!

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.500
YOU'RE BEHIND
ALL OF THIS?!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.345
OF COURSE, JADEN.
BUT BEFORE I DEFEAT YOU,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.519
I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU
THE WHOLE STORY...

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.758
HEY,
I'M ALL EARS.

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:33.964
LIKE YOURSELF, I WAS
ONCE A YOUNG DUELIST

00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:36.003
WITH UNLIMITED POTENTIAL...

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:37.473
I SCOURED THE WORLD
IN SEARCH

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:40.781
OF THE RAREST
AND MOST POWERFUL CARDS.

00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:44.725
FINALLY, MY TRAVELS LED ME
TO THE ULTIMATE PRIZE:

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:48.568
A LOST TOMB,
HIDDEN AND BURIED
IN AN ANCIENT DESERT.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.175
WITHIN, WAS
A DUELISTS' DREAM.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.082
FOR IT HELD THE VERY
FIRST DUEL CARDS.

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:58.628
LIKE PEGASUS YEARS BEFORE,
I SOUGHT OUT THEIR POWERS.

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.370
BUT THE TOMB WAS CURSED,
AND SCIENCE HAD NO ANSWER

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.679
TO THE MAGIC WHICH
RAVAGED MY BODY...

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.686
I TRIED EVERYTHING,
BUT SOON, I REALIZED

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:11.728
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE THING TO BE DONE.

00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:15.070
I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO CREATE A NEW BODY.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.545
THEREFORE, I USED ALCHEMY
TO CREATE A HOMUNCULUS,

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:20.584
AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM.

00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:23.825
AND PLACED MY
SOUL INSIDE OF IT.

00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:25.563
Chumley:
UH...SAY WHAT?!

00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:27.803
DON'T ASK ME, CHUM.

00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:30.610
Banner: BUT THIS NEW BODY
IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.150
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE I'M NOTHING...

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.656
BUT A PILE OF DUST
IN THE WIND.

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:39.433
YOU SEE...I DON'T...
HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT...

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.137
HOLD ON.
JUST WAIT A SEC!

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.276
YOU'RE SAYING...
YOU'RE A CLONE?!

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:46.919
AND TO LIVE, I NEED
THE POWER OF THESE CARDS:

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.860
THE THREE DIVINE
SACRED BEASTS!

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.302
EVEN IF YOU END UP
DESTROYING THE WORLD
IN THE PROCESS?!

00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:55.775
SORRY, BANNER,
I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT!

00:03:55.775 --> 00:04:00.320
TOO LATE!
ONCE YOU LOSE,
THE CARDS ARE MINE!

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.593
THEN I WON'T DUEL.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:04.898
OH, YES YOU WILL.

00:04:04.898 --> 00:04:06.269
[PURRS]

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.117
YOU FORGET!

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:14.690
YOUR FRIENDS REMAIN
MY PRISONERS!

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.632
IF YOU WALK AWAY,
THEIR SOULS

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.172
WILL BECOME MINE
FOR ETERNITY!

00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:21.675
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!

00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:23.346
YOU HAVE TO DUEL ME!

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.718
PRETEND IT'S
YOUR FINAL EXAM!

00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:28.826
WELL THEN...
BRING IT ON!

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:32.001
I BELIEVE...
IT WAS MY TURN...

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:33.940
WITH CHAOS GREED!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.749
IT WORKS LIKE THIS:
IF THERE ARE NO CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.390
AND IF FOUR OF MINE
ARE OUT OF PLAY...

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.231
I'M ALLOWED
TO DRAW TWO TIMES!

00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.037
AND BOTH DRAWS
I'LL PLACE FACEDOWN!

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:48.210
YOUR TURN, JADEN...

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.516
[THINKING]
BANNER DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CARDS IN HIS HAND,

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:53.190
BUT WITH HIS
ELEMENTAL ABSORBER
CHILLIN' ON THE FIELD,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.462
HE COULD NIX
ANY OF MY ATTACKS!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.570
IF I EVER NEEDED
A LUCKY DRAW,
THIS IS IT!

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.378
SO HERE GOES...
SOMETHIN'!

00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:03.784
I PLAY MY SPELL CARD
POT OF GREED!

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:10.534
NEXT, I'LL SUMMON
ELEMENTAL HERO CLAYMAN!

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:13.242
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE,
MY CLAY WRAP!

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.490
AND, WITH MY
POLYMERIZATION...

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.131
I'LL FUSE CLAYMAN
WITH BURSTINATRIX

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:26.141
TO CREATE
HERO RAMPART BLASTER!

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.981
BUT WAIT...
NOW CLAY WRAP
GETS DESTROYED!

00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:30.686
SO WHY'D HE PLAY IT?

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:31.856
I MEAN!
WHAT A WASTE!

00:05:31.856 --> 00:05:33.293
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:34.797
YEAH, I DO KNOW!

00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:36.869
SEE, SY...
THE CLAY WRAP CARD?

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.339
WHEN IT GOES
TO THE GRAVE...

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.679
I GET TO TAKE OUT
ONE OF PROFESSOR
CLONE-DOME'S

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:43.252
SPELL OR TRAP CARDS!

00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:46.427
AND NOW...I THINK I'M
GONNA DO JUST THAT!

00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:49.635
DESTROY
ELEMENTAL ABSORBER!

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:51.473
ERR!

00:05:51.473 --> 00:05:53.311
LISHUS!
TAKE 'IM JADEN!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.483
YOU GOT HIM
ON THE ROPES!

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:56.988
QUITE IMPRESSIVE...

00:05:56.988 --> 00:06:01.165
AH, BUT I'M AFRAID
IT TAKES A WHOLE LOT MORE

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:03.036
IF YOU WANT
ALL YOUR FRIENDS BACK!

00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:04.474
YA WANT MORE?

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:07.247
RAMPART,
TAKE IT TO HIM!!

00:06:07.247 --> 00:06:08.551
YOU FOOL!

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:11.191
IT IS I WHO WILL
BE TAKING YOU!

00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:13.062
OFF TO THE GREAT BEYOND!

00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:15.268
I ACTIVATE:
MACRO COSMOS!

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:18.410
THIS ALLOWS ME TO
REMOVE CHAOS DISTILL
FROM PLAY,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.980
AND NOW, I'LL BE
REMOVING YOU

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.551
FROM THIS WORLD!

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:28.335
[GROANING]

00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:30.139
[GROANING]

00:06:37.893 --> 00:06:39.597
OHH!

00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:41.369
WHOA.
OH.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.512
THE POWER OF ALCHEMY
FLOWS THROUGH ME.

00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:48.755
IT HAS BROKEN
OUR EARTHLY BONDS
AND TAKEN US HERE.

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:51.662
WELL IT'S NOT GONNA
SHAKE ME! ERR!

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.901
THEN PERHAPS
THIS WILL, JADEN!

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.111
DUE TO MACRO COSMOS,
I CAN SUMMON THIS CARD!

00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:00.384
HELIOS--
THE PRIMORDIAL SUN!

00:07:03.726 --> 00:07:05.966
OHH!
WOW!

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.480
HUH?!

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.917
CHAZZ!

00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:19.433
ALEXIS!

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:20.837
ATTICUS!

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:23.645
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU.
THEY'RE MY PRISONERS NOW,

00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:25.115
LIKE YOU WILL BE,

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.853
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY...

00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:28.289
FACE IT, JADEN...

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.361
THIS TOME IS
YOUR DESTINY NOW.

00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:32.734
SOON, YOU WILL BE
LOCKED IN IT PAGES.

00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:34.038
A PRISONER.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.244
A PATHETIC
FOOTNOTE TO MY SAGA,

00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:38.115
TO MY ASCENSION
TO GREATNESS!

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:39.619
DON'T YOU SEE, JADEN?

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.223
YOU CANNOT BEAT ME!

00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:42.827
YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES!

00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:45.668
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
ARE FINISHED!

00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.776
I PAID FOR THIS BOOK
WITH MY FLESH AND BLOOD.

00:07:48.776 --> 00:07:51.717
I WON'T LOSE IT TO
A SLIFER RED SLACKER!

00:07:51.717 --> 00:07:52.720
HEY, ARE YOU
FORGETTIN'

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.426
ALL THE MATCHES
I'VE WON?

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:58.434
YOU WERE JUST A PAWN
IN MY LITTLE GAME!

00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:01.308
ALL YOUR MATCHES
WERE...FIXED

00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:05.820
SO YOU'D BE GIVEN A KEY
AND HAVE TO FACE ME!

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.529
YOU SEE,
YOU WERE NOTHING
BUT A LOSER, JADEN!

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.334
HUH? ALL OF IT?!

00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:13.440
CROWLER?
AND THE SHADOW GAMES?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.578
IT WAS ALL JUST
A BIG SET UP?

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.553
TO MAKE ME
SEEM LIKE...
A GREAT DUELIST...

00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:21.694
SO THAT I WOULD
GET A SPIRIT KEY
TO PROTECT?

00:08:21.694 --> 00:08:24.033
CORRECT!
NOW ON WITH THE DUEL!

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.741
I PLAY PLANET ALIGNMENT!

00:08:29.314 --> 00:08:33.659
THIS CARD'S SO POWERFUL,
IT ACTUALLY WARPS SPACE!

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.864
AND DESTROYS
ALL YOUR MONSTERS...

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:40.108
WHILE DEALING YOU
THREE HUNDRED POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:42.815
[GROANS]

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:44.620
[GROANING]

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:55.648
WELL...GUESS I'LL JUST,

AND I PLAY A SPELL!

00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:02.466

YELLOW...
PROCESS KITOLENICS!

00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:08.815
BUT IT'S ALSO
A HANDFUL, JADEN!

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:12.558
FOR WITH IT, I CAN
SACRIFICE HELIOS
THE PRIMORDIAL SUN...

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:14.998
FOR HELIOS DUI MEGISTUS!

00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:16.836
AND FOR EACH
AND EVERY MONSTER CARD

00:09:16.836 --> 00:09:18.608
THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED
FROM PLAY...

00:09:18.608 --> 00:09:21.248
MEGISTUS GAINS
200 ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:25.859
THAT'S TWELVE CARDS,
SO THAT'S 2400
EXTRA ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.106
NOW ATTACK!

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:33.512

00:09:33.512 --> 00:09:34.782
OHH.

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:36.320
JADEN?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.793
I SHOULDA BROUGHT

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:43.906
OHH!

00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:45.310
Jaden: I PLAY MY TRAP!

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.312
HIS TRAP?!

00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:47.983
A HERO EMERGES!

00:09:47.983 --> 00:09:50.088
NOW YOU GET TO PICK
A CARD FROM MY HAND...

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:53.163
AND IF...
IT'S A MONSTER CARD,

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:55.403
THEN I GET TO SUMMON IT!

00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:58.243
ONE CARD?
IT WON'T SAVE YOU!

00:09:58.243 --> 00:10:01.051
THE CENTER ONE!

00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.690
NICE PICK...
LEAST FOR ME!

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.330
YOU CHOSE ONE

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.272
ELEMENTAL HERO
BLADEDGE!

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.346
ALRIGHT!

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:15.287
THIS IS, LIKE, TOTALLY
BLADEDGE-LISHUS!

00:10:15.287 --> 00:10:18.729
'N HE'S GOT MORE
POINTS THAN YOU!

00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:22.406
PERHAPS...BUT EVEN SO,
I CONTINUE MY ATTACK.

00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:23.475
NO WAY!

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.005
[GROANING]

00:10:36.642 --> 00:10:40.418
AND NOW I ACTIVATE...
HER ABILITY!

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:42.892
YOU SEE, JADEN...
IF SHE IS DESTROYED...

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.030
SHE IS IMMEDIATELY
RESURRECTED

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.570
WITH AN EXTRA THREE HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:54.588
NOW, HELIOS DUO MEGISTUS,

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:58.566
WITH SOLAR SINGE-ER!

00:10:58.566 --> 00:11:01.607
ERR!

00:11:01.607 --> 00:11:03.010
YOU PLANNED THAT!

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.082
YOU WANTED ME
TO DESTROY HER!

00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:07.322
YES, BECAUSE NOW,
SHE CAN DESTROY YOU!

00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:12.133
OH.

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:15.776
I SUMMON...
MY BUBBLEMAN!

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.180
AND CUZ HE'S ALONE?

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.085
I GET TO DRAW
TWO EXTRA CARDS

00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:22.093
AND PUT 'EM
IN MY HAND!

00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:26.003
NEXT I PLAY:
FUSION RECOVERY!

00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:28.777
THIS LETS ME
RETURN CLAYMAN
AND POLYMERIZATION

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:31.216
TO MY HAND...
AND NOW...

00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:33.455
I'LL FUSE BUBBLEMAN
AND AVIAN TOGETHER

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:35.394
TO CREATE...

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:39.370
OH, YEAH...
ELEMENTAL HERO MARINER!

00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:43.848
YEAH!

00:11:43.848 --> 00:11:47.023
NEXT I'LL THROWDOWN

00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:50.599
AND I'LL PLAY MARINER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:53.641
SEE, IF I GOT ANY SPELLS
OR TRAPS ON MY FIELD...

00:11:53.641 --> 00:11:55.044
THE HERO MARINER?

00:11:55.044 --> 00:11:57.551
HE GETS TO ATTACK
YOU DIRECTLY!

00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:59.322
SO GO GET HIM!

00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:00.959
ANCHOR AWAY!

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.767
UGH!

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:08.580
IMPRESSIVE.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.353
PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT
THE LOSER I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

00:12:11.353 --> 00:12:12.957
I'M A LOSER?!

00:12:12.957 --> 00:12:15.230
AT LEAST I KNOW HOW
TO USE MOISTURIZER!

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.669
ALL YOU EVER DO
IS MAKE JOKES.

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:20.410
THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T BE
A GREAT DUELIST.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.682
YOU LACK THE DISCIPLINE,
THE STRENGTH!

00:12:22.682 --> 00:12:25.055
LOOK AT ME.
AT MY POWER.

00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:28.531
IT'S COSMIC!
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME!

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:31.004
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF
JOINING ME.

00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:32.742
YES, AS MY SERVANT,
PERHAPS.

00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:34.814
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:12:34.814 --> 00:12:37.855
THANKS. BUT I GOT
ENOUGH FRIENDS ALREADY!

00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:41.397

JUST WATCH!

00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:49.418
MEGISTUS, ATTACK
THAT MARINER!

00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:56.035
NO WAY--
NOT THIS TIME!

00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:58.642
I'M PLAYING...

00:13:02.352 --> 00:13:04.290
DID YOU SEE THAT?!

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.195
THEIR MONSTERS
TRADED SIDES!

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:07.899
GOT THAT RIGHT!

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:10.138
SO NOW
MRS. TALL BRIGHT
AND FIERY

00:13:10.138 --> 00:13:12.945

ITS POWERFUL GRAVITY WAVES

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:34.100

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.138
AND THEN MEGISTUS...
RETURNS

00:13:36.138 --> 00:13:38.210
WITH EVEN MORE
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.118
HA HA HA!

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.699
MEGISTUS, ATTACK!

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:48.938

00:13:48.938 --> 00:13:51.544
GO SPELL CARD!

00:13:56.524 --> 00:13:58.029
SEE THANKS
TO MY FRIEND...

00:13:58.029 --> 00:13:59.967
ALL OF YOUR DAMAGE
THIS TURN

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:03.575
GOES...TO ZERO!

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:04.980
NOT BAD.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.553
GETS BETTER!

00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:13.234
NEXT...I SUMMON
CLAYMAN IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:13.234 --> 00:14:16.443
THEN I'LL THROW DOWN...
A FACEDOWN!

00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:19.484
YEP, THAT'S JUST WHAT
I WOULD'VE DONE.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.021
[THINKING]
THAT'S ALL
I COULD DO...

00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:24.329
AFTER ALL,
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO BEAT THAT MEGISTUS.

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:28.005
EVERY TIME I DESTROY IT,
IT COMES BACK STRONGER!

00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:29.844
MY TURN NOW!

00:14:29.844 --> 00:14:34.322
AND IF YOU THOUGHT
HELIOS DUO MEGISTUS
WAS FORMIDABLE...

00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:35.725
JUST YOU WAIT!

00:14:35.725 --> 00:14:37.898
I PLAY RED PROCESS-RUBEDO!

00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:41.674
AND WITH IT...
I SACRIFICE DUO MEGISTUS...

00:14:41.674 --> 00:14:48.057
AND SUMMON
HELIOS TRICE MEGISTUS!

00:14:48.057 --> 00:14:51.366

TRICE MEGISTUS GAINS
300 ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:54.307 --> 00:14:56.646
AND SINCE, THIRTEEN MONSTERS
HAVE BEEN REMOVED

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.618
FROM PLAY SO FAR...

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:02.294
THIRTY-NINE HUNDRED?!

00:15:02.294 --> 00:15:04.935
IT'S A SHAME YOU DON'T DUEL
AS WELL AS YOU ADD!

00:15:04.935 --> 00:15:06.538
NOW, MEGISTUS!

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.677
ATTACK
WITH PHOENIX FLARE!

00:15:11.618 --> 00:15:13.423
[SHRIEKING]

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:18.101
[GROANING]

00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:22.847
I PLAY A TRAP!
HERO SIGNAL!

00:15:22.847 --> 00:15:24.317
NOW THANKS
TO THIS...

00:15:24.317 --> 00:15:26.690
IF A HERO GETS
TAKEN OUT...

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.063
THEN I'M ALLOWED
TO GO SEARCH
THROUGH MY DECK...

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:31.469
AND THEN SUMMON
ANOTHER ONE!

00:15:31.469 --> 00:15:33.575
AND I GOT
JUST THE ONE!

00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:36.081
ELEMENTAL HERO
SPARKMAN!

00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:39.290
AND NOW THAT HE'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.663
I GET TO ATTACK AGAIN!

00:15:41.663 --> 00:15:43.133
THAT'S RIGHT, JADEN.

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:47.744
DUE TO TRICE MEGISTUS'
VERY SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:15:47.744 --> 00:15:49.416
WHAT?!

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.154
PHOENIX FLARE!

[GROANING]

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.475
[THINKING]
SO I GOT NO MONSTERS,
NO SPELLS, AND NO TRAPS.

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.848
AND IF I AM ACTUALLY
ABLE TO SUMMON SOMETHIN'
TO THE FIELD,

00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:03.151
THEN THAT THING
CAN ATTACK ME!

00:16:03.151 --> 00:16:04.355
FOR ONCE
IN MY LIFE...

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:05.891
I DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN WIN!

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:10.904
[THINKING]
WHAT CAN I DO?

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:11.906
I HAVE NO CARDS
IN MY HAND

00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:13.211
AND NO STRATEGY
UP MY SLEEVE.

00:16:13.211 --> 00:16:14.981
BUT IF I
DON'T WIN THIS,

00:16:14.981 --> 00:16:17.221
ME AND ALL
MY FRIENDS'LL
BE FINISHED!

00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:18.791
GOOD-BYE, JADEN.

00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:20.864
THIS HAS BEEN
QUITE A YEAR.

00:16:20.864 --> 00:16:22.735
I'M NOT DONE!

[THINKING]
OR MAYBE I AM.

00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:26.845
WHAT IF EVERYTHING

[CHIRPS]

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:33.228
WHAT IF I'VE BEEN SET UP
FROM MY FIRST DAY HERE?

00:16:33.228 --> 00:16:35.902
MAYBE I NEVER WAS
A GOOD DUELIST.

00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:37.373
MAYBE THE PROFESSOR
FIXED EVERYTHING

00:16:37.373 --> 00:16:39.378
SO I'D WIN
ALL MY MATCHES.

00:16:39.378 --> 00:16:41.583
CHAZZ...
THE PARADOX

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:44.224
ALEXIS...
EVEN BASTION...

00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:46.596
AND THE ACADEMY
WOULD THINK
I WAS GREAT.

00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:49.972
THE WISE-CRACKIN' JADEN
WHO HARDLY EVER LOST.

00:16:49.972 --> 00:16:53.414
CROWLER AND SHEPPARD
WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO GIVE ME A KEY.

00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:55.987
A KEY THAT HELD
THE FATE OF THE WORLD.

00:16:55.987 --> 00:16:58.360
NO! I HAVE FRIENDS HERE!

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.499
FRIENDS WHO HAVE RISKED
THEIR LIVES FOR ME!

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:02.403
EVEN IF
I AM SOME PAWN,

00:17:02.403 --> 00:17:04.008
I BELIEVE
IN MY FRIENDS,

00:17:04.008 --> 00:17:06.983
AND I BELIEVE
IN MY DECK!

00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:08.286
[THINKING]
ALL OF YOUR TRAINING...

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:10.558
ALL OF YOUR MATCHES
HAVE LED UP TO THIS,

00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:12.229
THIS MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:17:12.229 --> 00:17:15.704
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE...
AND MAKE ME PROUD.

00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:36.859
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:17:36.859 --> 00:17:38.931
HA! CHECK THIS OUT!

00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.238
IT'S MIRACLE FUSION!

00:17:41.238 --> 00:17:42.976
MIRACLE FUSION?

00:17:53.302 --> 00:17:54.872
PRETTY TIGHT, HUH?

00:17:54.872 --> 00:17:56.343
SEE, MIRACLE FUSION
FUSES

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:57.680
ALL ELEMENTAL HEROES

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.250
THAT ARE
IN MY GRAVEYARD...

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.263
AND CREATES
THE ONE AND ONLY...
ELEMENTAL HERO ELECTRUM!

00:18:04.263 --> 00:18:06.302
[GROWLS]

00:18:06.302 --> 00:18:10.479
AND ELECTRUM'S GOT...
ONE SWEET ABILITY!

00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:12.752
[GROWLS]

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:18.367
ALL MY MONSTERS!

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:20.237
THEY'RE RETURNING
TO MY DECK!

00:18:20.237 --> 00:18:21.942
JUST THE ONES
REMOVED FROM PLAY...

00:18:21.942 --> 00:18:23.647
WHICH MEANS
YOUR MEGISTUS
ATTACK POINTS

00:18:23.647 --> 00:18:25.217
GO BACK TO ZERO!

00:18:25.217 --> 00:18:27.891
AND NOW I ATTACK!

00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:29.963
ELEMENTAL RADIANT
BURST!

00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:31.066
[GROWLS]

00:18:35.143 --> 00:18:36.748
AAH!

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.551
[GROANING]

00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:48.277
WHOA!

00:19:08.128 --> 00:19:10.267
THAT'S GAME, BANNER.

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:14.277
JADEN...LISTEN
CAREFULLY TO ME, MY BOY.

00:19:14.277 --> 00:19:15.547
I LIED.

00:19:15.547 --> 00:19:17.719
YOU WON ALL THOSE
OTHER DUELS.

00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:21.395
I SAID YOU DIDN'T...
TO TEST YOU.

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:25.940
AND TO...PREPARE YOU
FOR THE REAL EVIL TO COME.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.447
THAT IS WHY I BECAME
A SHADOW RIDER.

00:19:28.447 --> 00:19:30.586
NOT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD...
BUT TO STOP...

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:34.161
THE ONE WHO'S
TRULY TRYING TO.

00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:36.234
TO STOP HIM
BY FORCING YOU

00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:38.640
TO BECOME
A BETTER DUELIST, JADEN.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.378
SO THAT YOU
COULD FACE HIM.

00:19:40.378 --> 00:19:42.851
AND HOPEFULLY...
DEFEAT HIM.

00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:45.625
YOU SEE...
THE THREAT'S SO GRAVE...

00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:47.730
I HAD TO DECEIVE YOU.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.838
I HOPE...THAT YOU
CAN FORGIVE ME.

00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:54.247
AND NOW, MY BOY...
TAKE THIS...

00:19:54.247 --> 00:19:55.985
BUT IT'S YOUR BOOK!

00:19:55.985 --> 00:19:58.858
IT'S MINE...NO LONGER.

00:19:58.858 --> 00:20:02.669
AND NO LONGER...
AM I OF THIS EARTH.

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.540
PROFESSOR BANNER!

00:20:07.715 --> 00:20:09.586
IT'S OVER...
HE'S GONE.

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:11.391
[PURRING]

00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:16.839
SO...WHAT NOW?

00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:18.477
WELL, FROM WHAT BANNER SAID
I GUESS WE SHOULD BE

00:20:18.477 --> 00:20:20.214
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME
TERRIBLE EVIL THAT WANTS

00:20:20.214 --> 00:20:22.787
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD
AND PROBABLY DESTROY US ALL

00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:24.759
WHILE HE'S AT IT.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.931
OKAY. BUT WHEN
AREN'T WE, REALLY?

00:20:26.931 --> 00:20:29.238
YEAH, WELL, YOU GOTTA
POINT THERE, SYRUS.

00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:31.677
NO. THIS IS DIFFERENT.

00:20:31.677 --> 00:20:34.618
YOU GUYS...BANNER GAVE
HIS LIFE TO PREPARE US

00:20:34.618 --> 00:20:36.556
FOR THIS EVIL
THAT'S COMING.

00:20:41.168 --> 00:20:42.806
[THINKING]
I JUST HOPE
WE'RE READY...

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:44.987
BECAUSE WHATEVER WE'RE
ABOUT TO FACE...

00:20:44.987 --> 00:20:46.522
IS GOING TO BE
UNLIKE ANYTHING

00:20:46.522 --> 00:20:48.524
WE'VE EVER
FACED BEFORE.
