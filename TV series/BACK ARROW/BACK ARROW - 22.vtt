00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Stop! You'll vanish again!

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
D'you see now?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
You're back to being
the old Arrow again.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.167 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Really?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, I was able
to rewrite your data.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.838 position:50% align:center
Naturally, I erased
the destroyer power.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
You should be able
to unmanifest now.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI chuckles]

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Who the hell are you?

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
Shu Bi. Did you really forget?

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
Oh, shut up! Human beings
aren't that big!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Relax Kai, jeez.
It really is Shu!

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
What?

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Glad you're back!
It's just like you said,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
except for the part
where you're huge.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yes, I didn't
exactly predict this.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
But hey, good job with
that Bind Warper.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.497 position:50% align:center
You really came
through out there!

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
Of course, man!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Though I'd expect
nothing less from the Admiral.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
By the way,
your body's safe and sound,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
so everything's good to go.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.757 position:50% align:center
He speaks the truth, the real me
is asleep in the Granedger.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
This form is actually
my Briheight!

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Welcome back, Shu!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
Did you guys know, too?

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ‰] Yes.
I thought you hated gambling.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Sorry for making you
worry. If I did, I mean.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
Of course you did!

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
How could we not worry
when we saw you disappear?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Have a little faith, I'd never
make such a dumb mistake.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
You're our secret weapon.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
When we inevitably
battle Rudolf, you can use

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
your Briheight against
him to buy me

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
some much needed time.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
Buy you time to what?

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
To return,
with any new knowledge.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Surprised?
That was my Briheight.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Briheight? But it was just you!

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. As it turns out,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
my conviction is
"I think, therefore I am."

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
Which apparently doesn't let me
turn into a giant weapon,

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
the way most people's
convictions do.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
But the upside is it has
my will and consciousness.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
So what, it's like
Muga's clones?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
I suppose you
could say that, yes.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
But what's more important,
is that by using this power,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
Arrow has a chance
at saving the world.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
Arrow can turn people
into conviction particles.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Rudolf said it's to become
God's nourishment.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
In other words, the destroyer
power less destroys,

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
and more converts
life into conviction,

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
and then sends it off to God.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
If Fine's power isn't
enough to stop him,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
then I'll purposely let
Arrow erase my Briheight.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
Then it, along with my
consciousness that it houses,

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
will turn into conviction
to be delivered to God,

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
however that works.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
There I will look
into our world.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
So your consciousness goes?
What does that mean for you?

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
I'll be asleep here.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
That's one of the main
reasons I'm telling you this.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
Oh, Admiral of Tactics.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
I need you to look after my
body for three days' time.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
If I'm not back
by the fourth day,

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
I want you to remove
my Bind Warper

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
and wake me from my rest.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
Unmanifesting should
make my Briheight vanish

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
and return my
consciousness to my body.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
D'you say "should"?

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
It's fine, if this doesn't work,

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
Arrow will destroy
the world anyway.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
So I'd die one way or another.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Then, you're
entrusting it to me?

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
You scared?

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
What? Of course!
What sane person wouldn't be!

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
Oh, please. With your
conviction, it'll work.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hang on, you know
what my conviction is?

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
Yes. I've been observing
you since we met

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
and piecing it together.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
You don't have very
much power yourself,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
but for some reason your
presence makes those

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
around you stronger.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
You're a mysterious one.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.714 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're complimenting me.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] I wouldn't say that.
You're our secret weapon,

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
and I'm simply explaining
to you why that is.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Man. You always
call yourself a genius, but...

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
Turns out you're just an idiot.
More than all of us combined.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
The biggest one I know!

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're right about that.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
Make me proud. Okay,
Admiral of Tactics?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
I have to say, I'm impressed
you planned such a gambit,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
and even more impressed
that it worked!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Is Shu up yet?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
Sure am.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Good, then hurry
over here! Arrow's in trouble!

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] You mean,
you refuse to let Arrow go?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
You heard me!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
You realize he caused the death

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
of Emperor Zetsu, right?

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
That's not something Rekka
will turn a blind eye to.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
But Rudolf baited
them in and forced Arro--.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA] So you say, but
we'd like to investigate to be

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
certain of it. If we
don't at least confirm

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
that he's innocent, our warriors
will never accept it.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, who could
have guessed Rekka

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
would be stubborn
about something?

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
Silence! No one wants to hear
from your traitorous mouth!

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
And you're just okay with this?

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
Fact is, I killed
a lot of people,

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
and that's a sin that
I'm gonna have to pay for.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
What do you mean sin?

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Rudolf was the one
who made you--

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
That's not how this works.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
All right, you've left us
with no other choice.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Granedger United demands
that Back Arrow

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
be released immediately!

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU] You'd be wise
to avoid making demands

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
too lightly, Queen Atlee.
Statements from a leader

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
are essentially a
country's policy.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Rekka and Granedger United
may end up clashing

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
if you aren't more
careful with your words.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
you're threatening us.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
It's just a warning.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[BRUH]
A moment, please!

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
People of Rekka. I'm afraid
that you're a little mistaken.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU]
And who might you be?

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
My name is Bruh Brian,

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
but I'm also the president
of the Pretty Boys.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
And I'm the
Vice-president, Gote Gordon.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
"Pretty Boys"?

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
I told you not to
worry about it. So?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
[BRUH] You may not have
realized, but this territory

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
belongs to the Pretty Boys.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
If you remove Arrow from our
land to make him your prisoner,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
you're infringing
on our sovereignty.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
We owe him so much.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
Rekka's a powerful country,
that much is certain.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
But you have no right
to impose your will here.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, Lingalind
is fractured as it--

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] This is about
justice, understand?

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
Does Rekka call entering
foreign territory

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
and acting like they own
the place "justice"?

00:07:56.643 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
As we stand here arguing,
God is planning his next move.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
We don't have time
to waste on this.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
It might interest you to know
that while inside God's domain,

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
I learned the truth
of our world.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
I'll trade that info
for Back Arrow.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
Sound like a good deal to you?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it
makes food by itself.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
It's damn good, too!

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.089 position:50% align:center
Why'd you insist on a feast
before this vital meeting?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] 'Cause people are more
easily irritated when hungry,

As Rudolf had mentioned,

our world was indeed

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] So, each one of

And there are people just

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yes. Together, these
Linds form one giant structure.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
So really, the "world"
is this entire space,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
of which, Lingalind
is just a small part.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
This also means that Lingalind
is just floating in emptiness.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
Where all the Linds connect
in the center is the holy land.

And in case you're wondering,
the purpose of Briheights
