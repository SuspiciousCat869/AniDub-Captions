[NARRATOR] Rekka was able
to quickly recover

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
the flying dreadnought
commanded by Tae.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
And the plethora of Bind Warpers
they discovered within it

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
returned them to
their former might.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
At the same time, in Lutoh,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
the flying dreadnought
Maestrog was uncovered,

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
and set out to pursue
Granedger United.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
Harassed by the new threat
of opposing dreadnoughts,

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
Granedger headed towards
Epitaph Mountain

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center

beyond the wall

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center

That makes three

I'd go beyond

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center

[PRAX CONRAD]
Well, supposedly.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
But what if it's just another

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center

[ROBES]
Don't worry.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
The walls are simply camouflage
to guard the sacred mountain.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.794 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
What? Can't Lutoh just

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50% align:center
follow us right through, then?

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:56.301 position:50% align:center

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
With Rekka back, we have
no choice in the matter.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
Besides, Arrow refuses to kill.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
We have enough Warpers
to overwhelm them

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center

The information came directly

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center

Of course I do!

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to distrust

Is that guy floating?!

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
[ROBES] That is him--
the Founder of Lind Faith.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
He's the founder?

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
So it was you.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
You're the one who called
me all the way out here.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] What are
these pillars everywhere?

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
Why the heads?

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center

The faces of all those who die

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center

onto this megalith.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center

I figured you must
have a hand in this.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
Somehow you always do.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
What did you do to Arrow?

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
Now, there's no reason
to get so upset.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
He's returning to his old
self again, that's all.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
I believe you've all heard
of the prophecy

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
that speaks of him?

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Of Arrow?

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
Arrow, don't you move now!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
You'll want to hear
this, too, trust me!

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
Rudolph has much to say!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
It's safe to assume the Supreme
Elect knew the truth all along.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLPH CONDUCTORE] I was given
a decree, you understand.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
What? From the World Wall?

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
Or is the god who
made it more accurate?

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
Very astute. The true identity

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.699 position:50% align:center
of the amnesiac man
you call "Back Arrow"

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
is a being sent by god
to end the world.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
A destroyer.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ‰] So it's true? Arrow
is going to destroy the world?

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
Yes, he will indeed.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
To put it simply, the world is
like a tree of ripening fruits

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
that god has planted.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
And one of those fruits
is our very own Lingalind.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
You can think of it
as an offering to god.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Our world is at the
whims of its creator.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
And like any fruit,
if it grows too large,

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
it must be harvested.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
Arrow was originally sent inside
the walls for that very purpose.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
But somewhere along the line,
something must have gone wrong

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
and he forgot his original task.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
He arrived in this world with
not only forgotten power,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
but forgotten memories as well.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
And so, God has ordered me
to correct this mistake.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
Behold! What you see
before you is his true form!

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
This "god" you speak of

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
is a being that's beyond
the wall, yes?

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've given it
plenty of thought yourself,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
but take my word for it, it's
pointless to speak about god.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
For our fleeting lives
both begin and end

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
by the will of that
omnipotent being.

[RUDOLPH CONDUCTORE]
In order to awaken Arrow,

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
I needed to make sure he
came to Epitaph Mountain.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
It's the closest place
in the world to god,

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
so this step was unavoidable.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
You're sick.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
Are the dreadnoughts
your fault, too?

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
Did you purposely hand them
over to Rekka and Lutoh?

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ‰]
Why? Peath, Baran, Demyne.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:04.219 position:50% align:center

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
They thought it was all for

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.474 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,
you betrayed them!

You call yourself a man

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
A "man of Lutoh" you say?
No. Why, I'm not even human.

[FINE FORTÃ‰ gasps]

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
You think my title
"Supreme Elect"

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
comes from the fact
that I'm the Supreme

don't you?

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
And in order to do that,
I'm going to need you.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
You never change, do you?

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
What are you doing, Fine?

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
I want to help.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] It's too soon
for that. Remain here.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
We trained the division to fly.
Leave this one to us.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ‰]
Very well. Good luck.

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Thanks! Are we ready?

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
--[HANS PALDIN] Yes!
--[FRITZ KRAUS] Good to fly!

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
Fire cannons!

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
Granedger, full speed ahead!

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Come on guys,
let's get this done

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
while Arrow's still himself!

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
Such a persistent bunch!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
As long as my Phantasmone
has anything to say about it,

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
you'll never get your way!

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
Go. Get out of here
while you can, Arrow!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA] Who's the naughty
boy manning the cannons?

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Could you maybe not
come over here?

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA laughing]

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
Don't act so surprised.
You're up against a woman

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
whose conviction is
"I'll manage somehow!"

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
I'll get through this,
always have and always will!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
You'll just end up getting hurt.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
You're in way over
your head, little girl.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
I'm not a little girl!

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
I'm the Queen of Granedger
United. Atlee Ariel!

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
So what? Do you think a queen's
power can rival that of god?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
Do it Prax, I've got her!

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Nice job, Queen! Leave it to me!

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Noble Hurricane!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA grunts]

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] How do you like
the full brunt of my power?

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Feel good?

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA laughs]
It's certainly something.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to show Rudolph

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
your unsightly,
pathetic struggle!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
--[FRITZ KRAUS] Hey!
--[HANS PALDIN] Wait!

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
Don't pursue them!
Focus on Arrow!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Aw, who cares about aiming
right now? Just shoot it all!

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
Arrow!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
Hey, Elsha, set course
to Epitaph Mountain.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Huh? We're going back?

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
Rudolf let some important
information slip.

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
"Epitaph mountain is
the closest place to god."

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
And if we want to learn more
about this so-called god,

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
then what better place is there
to explore than that?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
No matter how small
a clue I've got,

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
I'll turn the tables with
my extraordinary intellect.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] You're incredibly
arrogant and I've never been

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
more relieved by
that in my life.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Is that another wall?

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] C'mon, god!
Lemme go! I want outta here!

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] It's every bit as
durable as the World Wall.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Whoa! They're boxing us in!

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Uh, are we screwed?

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Rudolf, you schemer.
You never slip up, do you?

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW yells]

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
It's no use, huh?

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it's
up to you now, Shu!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
Our last chance is to ascend.
If we break through the mines--

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he knows about the sky.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
Then, what do you suggest?
It's our best shot--

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
Those odds aren't good
and I hate gambling!

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Oh hey, Shu!
Did I ever tell you about--

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up, Admiral?
I'm trying to think!

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
Uh, buddy? I'm your boss.
Did you forget that, or uh...?

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Wreckage from Edger?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
When did all this get here?

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
Eh, I couldn't part with it!

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
Thank my thriftiness if
this ends up helping!

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
C'mon, over here!

00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Is that...?
You have a Rakuho?

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
The one Arrow came in!

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
I was originally gonna
make it into my new pad,

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
but it's so packed
with contraptions,

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
it wasn't worth it!

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
It's a hell of a
trump card, Admiral.

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
I don't know how powerful
this "god" really is,

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
but what I do know is I'm not
gonna let their plans succeed.
