00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:11.928 align:middle
[NARRATOR] Lingalind,
a world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.222 align:middle
The wall enshrouds the land--

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.475 align:middle
protecting, nurturing,
sustaining.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.519 align:middle
The wall is god.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:24.024 align:middle
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.861 align:middle
Leaving Iki Territory,
Granedger headed for the wall,

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:31.114 align:middle
cutting through a Lutoh
province on the way.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.492 align:middle
There, they discovered a Lord
Walston had been performing

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.911 align:middle
live experiments on boys.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.289 align:middle
After meeting Arrow,
the boys banded together

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.207 align:middle
against the returning Lord.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.754 align:middle
Obtaining Bind Warpers, they
secured their own freedom.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.604 align:middle
[BORDER DEFENSE A]
This is Rekka Border Defense.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle
District Three HQ?
We have an update.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.485 align:middle
Dreadnought is heading north
through the neutral zone

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.279 align:middle
towards the wall.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:41.453 align:middle
[SHU BI] Without further ado,
let's begin the naming ceremony.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.121 align:middle
Take it away, Admiral.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.916 align:middle
Ah-hem. Uh, as Granedger's
officially appointed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.627 align:middle
Admiral of Tactics,
I'd like to formally announce

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle
the chosen names
for your Briheights!

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:55.425 align:middle
Briheight Muga,
manifested by Back Arrow!

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.136 align:middle
A round of applause,
if you would?

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:04.142 align:middle
[BIT NAMITAL] Briheight Shadoh,
manifested by Elsha Lean!

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:06.478 align:middle
And finally, Briheight Ryuju,

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.481 align:middle
manifested by the one
and only Atlee Ariel!

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.609 align:middle
So, no shade, but why
are we naming Briheights?

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.819 align:middle
[SHU BI] Because they're
manifested conviction.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.696 align:middle
The more personal they are,
the more likely

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.032 align:middle
they are to become
known and respected.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:22.202 align:middle
Plus, characterizing them with
individual names helps foster

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.913 align:middle
greater conviction within
those who manifest them.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.582 align:middle
Make sure to save a cool
name for me once I get one.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.418 align:middle
Yes, with pleasure! Of course,
that'll depend on you having

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.587 align:middle
enough conviction to make
one in the first place.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.713 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.674 align:middle
Now then, let's get
down to business.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.301 align:middle
Rekka's north guard has been
keeping an eye on us.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle
They're keeping their distance,
but following at 10,000 gents.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:44.474 align:middle
[BIT NAMITAL] Ten-thousand
gents? Man, this monitor

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.935 align:middle
can show a lot further away
than I'd have thought!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.813 align:middle
[SHU BI]
It gets even closer.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.564 align:middle
Whoa, who's mister huge beard?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.317 align:middle
[SHU BI] The North General,
Bai Toatsu. Knowing him,

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.986 align:middle
he'll attack the moment
he gets the opportunity.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.572 align:middle
Luckily, we should be safe here.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.701 align:middle
No one can fight near the
neutral zone. After all,

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.663 align:middle
it was expressly prohibited
in the Caravan Road treaty.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.957 align:middle
If Rekka doesn't want
to stir up trouble,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.626 align:middle
they'll steer clear
of us in here.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.129 align:middle
Which is why our
destination is right here.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.132 align:middle
Precisely where the wall
meets the neutral zone.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.842 align:middle
So that's where
we're gonna break it?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.635 align:middle
Yes. But we must remember that

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.096 align:middle
Emperor Zetsu wants us
eliminated, badly.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle
It's entirely possible that
he'll break the treaty

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.516 align:middle
and attack us anyway.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.934 align:middle
No problem.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle
Then we'll just bust the wall
as soon as we're there!

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.604 align:middle
[door opens]

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.606 align:middle
[ANNIE]
Are Elsha and Atlee here?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.235 align:middle
The villagers wanna talk
to you guys, like now!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.281 align:middle
Leave Granedger?

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.783 align:middle
Yeah. About half of us want to.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.285 align:middle
You serious?

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.746 align:middle
When we left the village, you
knew you couldn't go back!

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.997 align:middle
Everyone knew!

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.416 align:middle
You all seemed gung-ho
about leaving then!

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.418 align:middle
[VILLAGER A] I think we were
caught up in the moment.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle
Besides, if we really
do destroy the wall,

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle
then we'll all be cursed.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.258 align:middle
We'll be doomed if we go
through with your insane plan.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.052 align:middle
[BABY cries]

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.848 align:middle
[ELSHA LEAN]
What's gotten into you?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.433 align:middle
This is ridiculous!

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.353 align:middle
How are you all so sure we'll be
cursed, before we've even tried?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.772 align:middle
Are you saying you're willing
to risk all our lives

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.565 align:middle
without knowing
what will happen?

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.025 align:middle
[ELSHA LEAN]
Grandpa...

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.195 align:middle
[BURK LEAN] We can't imagine
a world without the wall.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle
But now we're stuck on
a ship trying to destroy it.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.328 align:middle
Can you really blame anyone
for how they feel?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.457 align:middle
[TOM]
I'm staying on Granedger!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.917 align:middle
Uh-huh! Me, too!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.627 align:middle
We're staying with Atlee!

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.381 align:middle
You must realize the choices you
make affect their lives, too.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.634 align:middle
But we can't stop
the ship now.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.054 align:middle
We've no choice.
We have to go forward.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.392 align:middle
[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Are the
reports we've received that you

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:54.145 align:middle
attacked the dreadnought
from Iki true, Lord Walston?

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.356 align:middle
I wouldn't say I attacked it.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.565 align:middle
We specifically prohibited

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.235 align:middle
anyone from engaging
with it, if you recall!

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.779 align:middle
I apologize, but it
just sort of happened.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.197 align:middle
[FINE FORTEÉ]
Lord Walston.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.989 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle
[FINE FORTEÉ]
I'm sad,

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.161 align:middle
but I'm not as such because
you disobeyed my orders.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.289 align:middle
I was told something horrifying.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.583 align:middle
That you performed dreadful
human experiments

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle
on dozens of live, young men.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.336 align:middle
[SEVERN WALSTON]
Well, that's...

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.754 align:middle
Princess, you must understand,

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.674 align:middle
they were just poor kids who
would've starved anyway!

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle
If anything, the shelter
and nutrition I provided

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.803 align:middle
prolonged their lives!

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.931 align:middle
[FINE FORTEÉ] Don't you do
anything like that ever again!

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.392 align:middle
I beg you, please
don't make me sad.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:37.605 align:middle
The world is so full of love.
Never forget that.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.364 align:middle
Oh, give me a break,
Princess, get real.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.783 align:middle
What kind of person whimpers,
"I beg you, please don't

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.828 align:middle
make me sad!" while tears
stream down their face?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:56.499 align:middle
If it wasn't for her lackeys,
I'd drive that woman out of--

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.423 align:middle
[SEVERN WALSTON screams]

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.383 align:middle
[GUARDS]
Hm?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:08.928 align:middle
[GUARD A]
What happened?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.096 align:middle
[COACH A]
Lord Walston!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.973 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.559 align:middle
Don't you dare make
the princess sad again.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.062 align:middle
I'm sorry! I won't!
I'm so sorry!

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle
[GUARD A]
Commander Prax!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle
Get the man some help.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.487 align:middle
The princess doesn't
like needless death.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.948 align:middle
[PEATH GLINHOUSE]
Commander Prax!

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.242 align:middle
What did you do to Lord Walston?

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD] Princess Fine's
tears are precious.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.997 align:middle
He got off easy with one arm.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.208 align:middle
You went too far, Commander.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.668 align:middle
Did I?

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.003 align:middle
Okay, I'll bite. Would you
rather I go after the people

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:46.174 align:middle
who ordered him to perform such
experiments in the first place?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle
By the way, how are things
with the dreadnought?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.013 align:middle
Is it still giving
you two trouble?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.391 align:middle
Yes. The princess wants us
to bring it to Lutoh

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.934 align:middle
without a fight,
and we haven't been able

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.477 align:middle
to make much progress on that.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD]
What's the problem?

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.021 align:middle
Why not do as she asks?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.481 align:middle
It's not that simple.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.483 align:middle
Rekka will no doubt
get in our way.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.528 align:middle
Then shall I fulfill the
princess' wish in your stead?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle
[BARAN SUJITA]
Uh?

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.698 align:middle
Huh. Fine, suit yourself.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.325 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD]
Peath. Baran.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.496 align:middle
To properly serve Princess Fine,
one needs elegance.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.207 align:middle
Don't forget that.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.127 align:middle
Says Prax the Bloodstained.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.935 align:middle
So this is the wall?

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.479 align:middle
[gasps] It feels like
it's falling.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.315 align:middle
[VILLAGERS]
Wall that shapes the world.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:49.571 align:middle
'O World Wall.
Please forgive our sins.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle
Please forgive us.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle
Let's get this started!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.952 align:middle
[BIND WARPER]

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:59.039 align:middle
[BACK ARROW]
I'll bust it open! Ha!

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.918 align:middle
[BACK ARROW]
How 'bout this?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.214 align:middle
[BACK ARROW]
Pretty tough!

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.966 align:middle

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.471 align:middle
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Ryuju Whip!

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.641 align:middle
Hey, what gives?
It's not even leaving a mark!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.102 align:middle
You're right, it's quite
interesting. Are the attacks

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:24.272 align:middle
just ineffective, or is
the wall absorbing them?

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.274 align:middle
I expected you to
have the answers.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle
How could I when no one's
attempted this before?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.196 align:middle
Let's try something else.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:37.285 align:middle
Damn, Shu! He didn't leave
a single clue behind?

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.329 align:middle
I've only got one day left.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:43.833 align:middle
Minister Kyo will lock me up
if I don't do something.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle
If only I'd been a little nicer

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.879 align:middle
to the people of
influence around here.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.465 align:middle
But Shu didn't care about that.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.805 align:middle
[REN SIN] Sir Shu,
you should really greet him.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.473 align:middle
[SHU BI]
What would be the point?

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.142 align:middle
We're the same rank,
and why should I bother bowing

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.604 align:middle
to someone who's
clearly inferior to me?

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:08.066 align:middle
Oh, right, if something happened
to me, he'd be my replacement.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.236 align:middle
But there won't be much left
after my present goes off,

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.946 align:middle
so why even think about it?

[REN SIN gasps]

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.078 align:middle
Yes, I found it!

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle
Just give the order,
Prime Minister!

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle
They're attacking the
World Wall as we speak,

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.041 align:middle
we can't waste time!

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.209 align:middle
Relax, General

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.502 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU]
Give me permission to--

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.254 align:middle
[TAE HOWA] Ah-ah!
I won't permit such a thing

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.089 align:middle
until I'm certain
our capital, Gaian,

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.425 align:middle
is safe from any of their
long-range attacks.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:34.884 align:middle
[KYO MEIKETSU]
Prime Minister.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.219 align:middle
Yes, Kyo?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.222 align:middle
We discovered a bomb we
believe was placed by Shu.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.683 align:middle
It's seemingly designed to
explode when activated

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.059 align:middle
by a remote signal.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.145 align:middle
Which means what we thought
were long-range attacks

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.521 align:middle
were nothing of the sort.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.815 align:middle
They were bombs he
placed ahead of time.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.735 align:middle
You mean it was
just a trick of his?

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.236 align:middle
And what of the bomb?

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle
Disposed of.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.073 align:middle
There are no more of Shu Bi's
bombs in the capital.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.783 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU]
Well done, Minister Kyo!

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.494 align:middle
Now we can attack without fear
of them hitting innocents.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:04.873 align:middle
Wait! Have you forgotten
the Caravan Road treaty?

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.709 align:middle
Attacking in the neutral zone
breaks our treaty with Lutoh,

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle
and we don't want to
do that. Calm yourself.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle
Got it?

yours protects the nation,

That stupid, weak, coward!

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle
Does he honestly care
about keeping his riches

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.728 align:middle

Okay.

We're dealing with
the World Wall.

It's not gonna go
down so easily.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.745 align:middle
True, but I figured we couldn't
just punch through it.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:47.791 align:middle
And unlike the other day,
I've got the cannon working now.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.554 align:middle
Right. How do I do that?

Yeah, yeah.

Make sure to give it
a good push!

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.523 align:middle
All right, cannons!

to blow up the World Wall?

Come on!

I'm pretty sure that was
the main particle cannon,

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.016 align:middle
which was our best shot.
That's quite unfortunate.

Is that some kind of
gigantic air exhaust?

Huh?

[SHU BI] If you read the

'Cus there weren't
any flying Briheights.

Lutoh thought ahead and kept
their flying-type under wraps,

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.267 align:middle
so they could abuse this
loophole in the treaty.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.313 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD] This is no
fight--it's a friendly dance!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.691 align:middle
Show some elegance, General Bai!

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.402 align:middle
Okay! Retreat,
full-speed behind!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:50.612 align:middle
I'm on it!

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.198 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU]
You won't get away! After 'em!

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.369 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD]
Whoops!

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.454 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU]
I'm gonna mow you down!

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.332 align:middle
[PRAX CONRAD] Not so fast.
Notice where we are.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.001 align:middle
It wouldn't look good if you
attacked us in the neutral zone.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle
And as one of Lutoh's Six
Supremes, I would have

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.758 align:middle
no choice but to interpret it
as a declaration of war!

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:12.967 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU growls]

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.803 align:middle
Do you wish for your axe to be

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:18.473 align:middle
what severs the treaty
between nations, General Bai?

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.017 align:middle
[TAE HOWA]
Fall back, General.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:24.062 align:middle
We're not looking to
start anything with Lutoh.

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:28.358 align:middle
[BAI TOATSU growls]

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.237 align:middle
This is a disgrace,
and someday you'll pay for it!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.239 align:middle
That was quite a wise decision.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.117 align:middle
Yes, well, I'm not about to risk
war with Lutoh at the moment.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.285 align:middle
But after the Emperor
returns from his tour

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle
subduing the rebels, and our
forces are together again,

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:43.707 align:middle
then we'll strike Lutoh.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.126 align:middle
Am I correct in assuming
that's your plan?

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.503 align:middle
[TAE HOWA]
Yes, you're precisely right.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.588 align:middle
[KYO MEIKETSU] And before we go
to war, I'm sure Tae

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.508 align:middle
will move his riches elsewhere,
to keep them safe.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.386 align:middle
What a "busy" Prime Minister.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.017 align:middle
Greetings.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.061 align:middle
I bring word from Lutoh
Princess Fine Forté.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.731 align:middle
She invites Back Arrow and
the rest of Granedger's crew

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.357 align:middle
to be her special guests.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:10.316 align:middle
[BOTH]
Guests?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.693 align:middle
Oh?

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle
We would be honored to have
Rekka's Head Diviner,

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.698 align:middle
Shu Bi, as well. If you'd come.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.366 align:middle
Don't worry. We're well aware

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.744 align:middle
that you're trying to
destroy the World Wall.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.288 align:middle
That won't come as a
shock to any of us.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.123 align:middle
It's one of the things
the Princess would like

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle
to speak about. You can
understand why she'd be curious.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle
Very well, then.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.719 align:middle
We thank you and
accept your invitation.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.429 align:middle
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.764 align:middle
We're here for the wall,
remember?

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.432 align:middle
[ELSHA LEAN]
We couldn't even scratch it.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.225 align:middle
But we barely got
a chance to try!

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.602 align:middle
You're giving up that easily?

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.103 align:middle
Don't forget that
Lutoh is a nation

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.064 align:middle
of science and intelligence.

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.899 align:middle
We might discover a way
to destroy the wall

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.484 align:middle
if we spend some time there.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.985 align:middle
He's correct, you know.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle
Princess Fine is kind, she'll
likely cooperate with you.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle
I'd rather stay here
and make a real effort

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.909 align:middle
than cross my fingers that
we'll figure it out there.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.703 align:middle
Arrow, the villagers
are exhausted.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.955 align:middle
Some even want
to leave the ship.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.249 align:middle
Rekka might attack
at us any moment.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.544 align:middle
So as the Chief,
I say we discuss with Lutoh.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.088 align:middle
It's our best bet!

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.174 align:middle
Whatever, then you guys can go.
I'm staying here.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle
[ELSHA LEAN]
Arrow!

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.552 align:middle
I get to break the wall
and you protect the village.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.096 align:middle
Everyone wins, right?

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.306 align:middle
[BIT NAMITAL]
Ugh. So damn selfish!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.349 align:middle
[BACK ARROW]
How?

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.518 align:middle
Can't you tell?
Aren't we comrades?

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle
But this way we all win.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.063 align:middle
Gimme a break!
Why are you so--

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle
Don't bother, Bit. Fine then.
Stay if you really want.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.485 align:middle
Well, that's a shame.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.696 align:middle
The Princess was emphatic
about Mr. Arrow

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.031 align:middle
making an appearance as well.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.199 align:middle
[BACK ARROW grunts]

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:47.163 align:middle
Disappointing but either way,
we will simply receive the crew

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.416 align:middle
of Granedger and be
grateful for it.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:50.583 align:middle
[BIT NAMITAL]
Yeah?

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.794 align:middle
However, you haven't
seen the last of me.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.796 align:middle
I will return to convince you.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.756 align:middle
Sure, you do you.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.767 align:middle
[KAI RHODAN]
If that bomb had gone off,

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:12.313 align:middle
it would've wrecked
the capital. Well done.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:15.191 align:middle
And in return for my efforts,
Minister Kyo is allowing me

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.235 align:middle
to serve under you,
as we wished.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle
[KAI RHODAN] You don't seem
very happy about it.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.239 align:middle
I'm sorry, I just can't
shake the feeling

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.615 align:middle
that Shu planned all of this.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:23.992 align:middle
And he's moving you
like a puppet?

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.326 align:middle
Is that what you're saying?

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle
Yes. I believe he
purposely gave me hints

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:30.999 align:middle
about the bombs, their
existence, and that he hid them.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.792 align:middle
Furthermore, I imagine
that he knew

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.252 align:middle
I would be blamed
for his betrayal,

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:37.005 align:middle
so he laid our preparations
to secure my freedom

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.299 align:middle
for once he had already
left the capital.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.301 align:middle
[KAI RHODAN]
Okay, and what if it's true?

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:42.886 align:middle
He's mocking me.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:45.263 align:middle
He thinks as long as I'm free,
he gets a pass to do whatever

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:48.308 align:middle
he pleases, and I don't
enjoy being an excuse.

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.186 align:middle
I'm sure that's how he feels.
And if I'm right,

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.606 align:middle
I'll have to show him
how flawed his insight is!

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.024 align:middle
[KAI RHODAN]
That's the spirit.

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:58.735 align:middle
His conceitedness has made him
another powerful enemy,

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:02.447 align:middle
but one we can beat!

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:07.327 align:middle
The Emperor will be returning
sooner rather than later.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.703 align:middle
You should sharpen your fangs

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.705 align:middle
until the time is right,
Ren Sin!

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle
Sir!
