have surpassed

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
And since power means
everything here in Rekka,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
I am now the most suitable
to take over as its ruler!

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
I'm sure everyone agrees.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
In accordance with our ways,

your loyalty to me now!

be loyal to me and live,

With our new power,
we can't lose!

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Normal soldiers are flying now?

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
It's possible gaining access
to the flying dreadnought

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
has somehow altered
their convictions.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
Take care of 'em,
would you Prax?

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] That's a lot to
ask of a single person.

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
[HANS PALDIN]
Sorry. I wish we could help.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
It's fine, I enjoy a challenge.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
The rest of you,
protect the ship!

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
[HANS PALDIN]
Right!

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Stay out of my sky!

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
I see Prax is still a nuisance.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Her strength doesn't matter.
Our numbers will still win.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
Looks like they sent out

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
everything they
have, right away.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Arrow. Are you ready?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Good to go.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Granedger, changing course.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
Granedger's turned to face us.

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
They must be preparing
to use GranArrow.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
We knew they'd try this,
but it's not going to work.

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
No matter how powerful it is,

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
it's still just a ground weapon
at the end of the day.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
It won't so much as
graze our Briheights

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
as long as they're in the sky.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
Baran, have all troops
attack from above!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
[BARAN SUJITA]
Yes sir! Everyone attack!

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Decimate Granedger from the air!

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
They got cocky and
came up close, huh?

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Good, that means it's our turn.

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
It stood upright? Impossible!
Dreadnoughts can't do that!

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIERS]
Whoa...

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW yelling]

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
Granarrow Vertical, fire!

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Granarrow Vertical!

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER C gasps]

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
Ridiculous. What am I even
looking at? It's absurd!

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
It's been two whole months,

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
did you think I just sat around,
twiddling my thumbs?

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
We saw it wouldn't work on
flying Briheights during

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
the war, so we looked
into ways to fix that.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
All troops, disperse!

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
[BARAN SUJITA]
Disperse, disperse!

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
Of course you can run.
Oh, wait, you can't.

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
Great Turning!

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.849 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE screams]

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
[BARAN SUJITA]
Are you all right, Peath?

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Yeah! I guess,
but I don't think we can fly.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
[DEMYNE SHAFT] And we lost
our flying Briheights!

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.696 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE]
Dammit!

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] Nice!
Let's head to the Lind Faith!

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
Uh... but how do we
get past the wall?

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
[ROBES]
Forward.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL, ATLEE ARIEL gasp]

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Just keep going--
we have no other choice.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
Let me just set a smokescreen.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Wait, we're really going for it?

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
This is gonna work, right?
You guys are positive?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN whimpers]

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
We got through it that easily?

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
What the hell...

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:14.376 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me beyond the wall
is another wall?
