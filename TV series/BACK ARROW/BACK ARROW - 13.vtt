[NARRATOR] Lingalind,
a world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
protecting,
nurturing, sustaining.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.691 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
Kai had lost his way,

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
but Ren Sin got him
back on his feet.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
When their Briheights combined,

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
he obtained mastery
of the skies.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
Kai's revival brought
with it great power,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
enough to brush aside even Shu.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Wait, Kai! Aren't
I the one you're after?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] No. I've
rid myself of that desire.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
My anger for you is nothing
but a foolish grudge.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
A grudge that has been
clouding my judgment.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
My real enemy is Back Arrow.
Even you said as much.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I'll focus
my full energy

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.274 position:50% align:center
on defeating him, not you.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
That's more like it.
Good job, Kai.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Shu. You betrayed the nation,

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
broke promises,
and led people astray.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
If Arrow is defeated, your
dreams will shatter. Yes.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
[BIND WARPER]
Manifest Armor.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
I will crush those dreams.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
Think of it as a favor
from a friend.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it,
he's back to his usual self.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps even greater.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Get up, Back Arrow!
Let's fight to the finish!

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.178 position:50% align:center
You're something else.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe
you're even stronger.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:42.018 position:50% align:center
But hey, I'll take it.
It's an excuse to go all out!

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.941 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW screaming]

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
Really? At a time like this?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.157 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW groaning]

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Heh. Hurt yourself?

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.
That's the wound I gave him!

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.957 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Perhaps, but
out of respect for the man,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
I won't be holding back!

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
I owe that much to the one
who opened our eyes.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.839 position:50% align:center
Respect?

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.174 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Remember? You said to
"think of another way to help,

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
even if it makes you puke."

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
Now Kai can fly because
of my Briheight.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to
your little speech.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
To show my appreciation, I'll do
everything I can to defeat you!

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
I knew these two wouldn't stop
being a thorn in our side.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
So that's how it is.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.233 position:50% align:center
Fine, have it your way.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.236 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to put up
a good fight myself!

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Arrow!

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA] Whoa. Not so fast
there, Chief of Edger.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN grunts]

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA] I am the Republic

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
Goh Zanga! Prepare!

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Won't you even fight back?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center

[BAI TOATSU]
Hey, Whip Briheight!

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come play with me,

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
Rekka's North General,
Bai Toatsu?

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Shu's faith in you
wasn't misplaced! Well blocked!

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
However, you can't
block forever.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
This is judgment
for your injustice!

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW grunting]

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Too slow!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] Might I remind you
that I was the first to fly?

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Don't act all high-and-mighty
because you caught up.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
I see. You're back.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.

There's no need for you
to state your name,

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center

who locked us up?

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[HANS PALDIN] Yes, but I
hope you'll forgive us.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
[FRITZ KRAUS] Lutoh and
Granedger are allies now.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
So we fight together!

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] You'd attack
without hearing my name?

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
Lutoh knights are a lowly breed!

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] Well, you know
what they say: "Ladies first!"

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center

the lady doesn't demand it!

Yeah. I won't underestimate

Are you doing all right, Ren?

I'm fine, thank you, but we
can't let them escape, sir!

embodies that.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Everyone, is there
love on this battlefield?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
It did nothing?

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
I understand how you all must
feel, as horrible as it may be.

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
There's no love in war.
You're right about that.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
Even so, I ask for that love!

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
All you are is talk, lady!

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
There's no feedback
at all! Strange.

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
If it was a barrier,
I'd still be able to feel it.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Even Arrow's defense was
tangible, but this isn't! Wait.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she's absorbing the
attack instead of blocking it?

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ] I have a duty.
A duty to protect my citizens.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
I give you the love of a ruler.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
May it reach the people of
Lutoh watching back home.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
And my precious comrades
here by my side, as well.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
What's up with this light?

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Pathetic!
Watch your "precious comrades"

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
fall as you preach about love!

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Your hand!

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Yeah, feelin' much better!

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL, ELSHA LEAN grunt]

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU] What?
Did they get a second wind?

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA]
Did the Princess do that?

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
Princess.
Now or never, Granedger!

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Push Rekka into the canyon!

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
Finally, we can win this thing!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Demyne, get ready
for the signal!

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
I am ready!

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to crush more
than half of their army!

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] The princess saved
our troops! Incredible!

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
[MAN D]
Way to go, Finè!

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[MAN E] Where's their emperor?
Is he hiding?

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
[MAN F]
I bet he's afraid!

00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Oh? Look who finally showed up.
About time, you shrew.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
Bring my Bind Warpers!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
[gasping] Please, calm down.

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
I'm just spreading love,
so I beg of you,

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
stay asleep a little longer.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
[REKKA AIDE A]
Make way! Make way!

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Our beloved Emperor Zetsu

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
is about to Manifest Armor!
Make way!

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
[BIND WARPER]
Manifest Armor.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
[BARAN SUJITA]
What is that thing? A missile?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
It can't be!

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
That's Briheight, Ogen!
Seriously? His Majesty's here?

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU, GOH ZANGA]
Your Majesty!

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Have you truly
come to fight with us?

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN] If Lutoh's
princess has shown her face,

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
I will not stand idly
by and watch.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
Now stand aside.

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
I want to enjoy this
fight to the fullest.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Such a small space.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
It's far too small to fight
Lutoh's princess in!

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
What happened?

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIER E] An earthquake?
--[SOLDIER F] No, it's Rekka!

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER G]
It's too much energy!

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
Solar furnace? Gas laser?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER F] Data shows
a massive concentration

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
of conviction particles!

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E]
From the Briheight?

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D] No way!
He can control its density?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
--That's crazy!
--[SOLDIER G] Impossible!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Hey, can anyone hear me?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
The Briheights
survived, luckily,

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
but the bombs we placed
were all blown away!

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
The plan completely failed.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed
to fight someone

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
who can literally
erase mountains?

00:19:56.112 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Good. A much better view,
if I do say so myself.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
After all, this is a
showdown between rulers.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
We'll need all
the space we can get.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN] I am the
Republic of Rekka's Emperor,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Zetsu Daidan!

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
My conviction is: "I don't
follow a path. I make the path!"

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
I hope you're prepared,
Princess Finé Forte,

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
because I've been
itching to fight you.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
I won't let you touch her!

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Silence!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD groaning]

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Stop it!

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW groans]

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Kai, punish these pests.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] That was my plan
from the very beginning!

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I must admit, Princess.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
It's been some time since
I've had an opponent

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
who might actually
pose a threat.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
Now, let's find out if you
can accept all of my love!

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
[GROUP screaming]

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Don't turn away from me!

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
You're a fool, Emperor Zetsu!

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Did you forget that
your attacks against

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
the princess do nothing
but revitalize us?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
I did forget.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
That's quite an interesting
power you've got there,

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
but it's far too pure
for my liking.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
What happened to that woman
who told me to lick her shoes?

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
I...

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN] This old geezer
wants to have some fun!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Could you ask her to come
out and play for me?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Pretty please?

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No! Stay in there!

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ]
No!

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN laughing]
With your power out of control,

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
you might just heal
both friend and foe!

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
And you wouldn't want that,
now would you? Huh?

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ screaming]

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
Now, come on out.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
[FINOIR yelling]

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
Remember, you frickin' asked
for this, you damn geezer!

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Don't tell me--?

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
[FINOIR]
Hey! Don't think for a second

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
that I'll take shit from you
like sweet little Finé did.

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
If you want a piece,
come get some.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:09.037 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN laughing]
All right! That's more like it!

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
Ha! We're two of a kind,
aren't we, old-timer?
