[NARRATOR] Lingalind,
a world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
protecting, nurturing,
sustaining.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:29.738 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
Supreme Elect Rudolf appeared

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
and revealed that Arrow is
a destroyer, sent by god.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
With his true power awakened,
Arrow inadvertently wiped out

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.876 position:50% align:center
the entire Lutoh army
in a flash.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
As Arrow anguished, Shu began
looking for ways to fight back,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
and stop his comrade from
this involuntary destruction.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
Why won't this
stupid thing come off?

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50% align:center
If I could just get outta this,
I'd be harmless!

How's Arrow doing?

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTﾃ云 Rekka's cameras
spotted him wandering around,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
over near the north World Wall.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
He followed Shu's advice.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
And Rekka hasn't deployed
their dreadnought

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
to do anything about it yet.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
I wonder how Zetsu will react.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
We'll see.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
At least we have eyes
on them to keep tabs.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center

to tap into Rekka's network.

Our feed was cut!

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Is Rudolf behind this?

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
That'd be my guess.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
Without knowing Arrow's
location it'll be difficult to

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center

might be good news.

Rudolf wouldn't bother
hindering us any further

if the situation was
so inescapable

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
as he wants us to believe.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
It's likely the walls that
surround us now are temporary,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center

went through to get here.

they're gonna be okay?

you're sending me Arrow, huh?

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Well, I didn't ask
for a gift from you,

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center

And you think
that's relevant, why?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center

that demands things on a whim.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
A World Wall that cannot
speak is far more agreeable.

Let me ask you this.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
Would you like to know
the reason that god

has decided to
eradicate Lingalind?

[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
Zetsu Daidan...

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
It's because you
shouldn't exist.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.302 position:50% align:center
When someone who has
progressed further

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
than god desires appears,
the eradication switch flips,

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
and the destroyer is sent
to clean up the mess

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
by way of total annihilation.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
It's really quite sad.
You just became too strong.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately in your case,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
your growth influenced
those around you,

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
and they began
to change as well.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
God had no other choice
but to nip this in the bud.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
Let me guess.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50% align:center
The reason you so tactlessly
interrupted our conversation

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
and offered to give us Arrow's
location is because you hope

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
that I'll fight him and die?

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
[laughs] How amusing!
This is truly a surprise!

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
You and your pathetic
god are afraid

of the great Zetsu Daidan.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
That arrogance of yours

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
is what's going to get
the world destroyed.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
It's god who's arrogant if
he thinks he can beat me!

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
And to prove it,
I'll slaughter you and Arrow

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
with my bare hands,
and then I'll kill god!

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
The world will perish.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
Because the Republic of Rekka
will dominate the world!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
And there will be nothing
left outside of our reach.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
Guess I've got a ways
to go before I

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
fix our communication system.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
Now, I've got an idea
I'd love you to hear.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
As I said before,
the only god that Rekka

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
believes in is the
World Wall itself.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
So, we shall destroy Rudolf
and his fake god,

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
as they have done nothing
but bring chaos to Lingalind.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
You said it, Emperor!

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
Let's make that foolish Rudolf
wish he never messed with Rekka!

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
Minister Kyo, I have plans
for this dreadnought.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
Can it move yet?

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU] Yes.
But it was modified by Rudolf

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
to be piloted by
a single person.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
If it's anything like Granedger,
I bet I could figure it out.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
Then you're the one
I want running it.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
With pleasure.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
Is it smart to have
the prime minister fight?

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
The Emperor
essentially is Rekka.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
And a good prime minister
serves his country.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
Plus, if we lose, everyone
will disappear anyway.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
My, what an honor that would be!

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
We'd be absolutely delighted
to be your opponents.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
Just know, Granedger
United is strong,

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
not that I need to remind you.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN] Then it's a good
thing I like strong opponents.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI exhales]

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
You okay?

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.886 position:50% align:center
Why'd that tire you out?

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
It's nerve wracking.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
But a small price to pay
to keep Rekka at bay.

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
Now we can focus on Arrow!

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Sure, but now if
we win, we gotta fight Zetsu!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
Look guys! It's Arrow!

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW grunting]

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Arrow!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Granedger!
You thought of a plan, Shu?

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
Obviously, or I wouldn't
be here! Admiral!

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Leave it to me!

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] You idiot! You know
that's not enough to kill me!

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
What are you screwing
around for?

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm well aware. Be patient.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
After all, she's
the star of the show.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
Fritz! Hans! It's time to go!

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
It doesn't feel
right to do this.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
But if you're sure, Princess.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
All right. Energy maxed!

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Granarrow...
Lovsolute, fire!

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTﾃ云
Granarrow... Lovsolute!

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Will that work?
They're trying to use

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Lovsolute's healing power
to return Arrow to normal.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on!

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Muga's killer beam is
nullifying her attack!

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTﾃ云
You leave me no choice.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
I'll use my love
and heal you myself!

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Princess, don't!
It's too dangerous!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Your power won't work on me!

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
[FINOIR]
Y'think I don't know that?!

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
You don't gotta tell me!

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to get
up close and personal!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
And now that I'm here,

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
I'll tear apart your annoying
little Briheight's armor!

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
Yes. Granarrow
Lovsolute was a ploy.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
Our real goal was
to get her near Muga.

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
Give 'em one for me, Fine!

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Stop it, Princess! You'll die!

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
[FINOIR]
You think I care?

--[FINOIR laughing]

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW screaming]

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[FINOIR] Fine can endure
your destruction!

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
And I can get in here
and take care of you!

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] So that's the plan...
What do you think?

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
But won't the other me
inside me be killed?

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yes. Finoir will die.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
I won't force you, but this
may be our only hope.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] If you can,
talk it through with her

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
and tell me your decision.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Arrow's Briheight is
vanishing! They're doing it!

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Her split personality is
what made this possible.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
Good plan.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Finoir!

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
Don't mention it.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
The whole reason I was born
was because of Rudolf,

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
so stickin' it to him one
last time feels pretty good.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
What better way
is there to go out?

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
Thank you again.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW panting]

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
Princess...

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
That went well.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Shu...

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
I figured out how
Muga's killer beam works.

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
It deconstructs conviction
particles, which means

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
the manifested conviction
used to create Briheights

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
get broken down into energy,
and dissipates.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
And since Lovsolute
restores said particles,

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
it works against it,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
and can at least partially
neutralize the beam.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
Only Fine could negate your
attack and get close to you.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
We're lucky to have her.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
So everything worked out
just like you planned, huh?

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
I promised, didn't I?
So of course it did.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
Cause with my brains,
and your tenacity,

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
we'll surpass even god.

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
Man, you are really
somethin' else.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] The problem is, with
Rekka having access to-- What?

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW gasping]

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
Too bad!

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
Even without a Briheight,
your power remains!

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
You'll destroy everyone
you touch. How fun!

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
No. You're kidding!

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE] Tell me,
Shu Bi, in these final moments

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
of yours, do you regret trying
to outwit god?

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
Stupid mistake...
