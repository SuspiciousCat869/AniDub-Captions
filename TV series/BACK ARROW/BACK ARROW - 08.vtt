00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:17.058 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Lingalind, a world
surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
protecting, nurturing,
sustaining.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
Arrow and crew have finally
reached the north wall.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
However, neither Briheights, nor
the Granedger could damage it.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
There, they were attacked
by General Bai Toatsu

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
and the Rekka army.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
Before the conflict could
escalate too greatly,

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
the Supremacy of
Lutoh's Commander Prax

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
came to their aid.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
Though Arrow decided to remain
behind and focus on his goal,

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
the rest of the crew was invited
to be guests of Maestrog Castle.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
Damn, what's with this gun?

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
It's got no recoil.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.108 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Bit! Where are you? Let's go!

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
We're getting close to Lutoh!

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
All right, I'm on my way back.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Huh?
How's Granedger moving?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
It's pretty much all inertia.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Since we're on flat land now.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
With the Admiral's
fashionably late arrival,

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
I'll continue explaining.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
As the "supremacy"
in its name suggests,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
the Supremacy of Lutoh
is controlled by

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
six nobles who have
been given the title

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
of the "Six Supremes."

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] And luckily for
you, the current head of state,

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
Princess Fine,
just so happens to be

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
a fervent advocate for peace.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
Unlike those in equivalent
positions in Rekka,

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
she will warmly welcome you
and your blasphemous ideas.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
What's more, the commander
here is actually one

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
of the Six Supremes herself.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
Wow, so, you're a noble, then?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yes, and not only that,

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
but a Briheight commander
high in Lutoh's ranks.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
Like the top?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
It's quite an honor to be given
this invitation personally.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure you picked up
on that, right, Admiral?

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL laughs]

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
Sir Bit, I see that you
rank above Shu Bi,

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
who's rumored to be the
smartest in all of Rekka.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
Very impressive.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
Please, treat me as an equal.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
Uh. You got it.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
So, they're not gonna shoot us?

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
No, those are just in place
to ward off enemies.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
Unlike Rekka, Lutoh
doesn't seek out war,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
so we've no reason
to be aggressive.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
For that, you can thank
our Princess Fine.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
Do you think leaving Arrow
behind was a good idea?

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
I don't know,
but the village comes first.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but Dr. Sola
stayed with him.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Atlee, keep
pushing and I'll get upset.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
And that goes double
for if you leave us, too.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
Please. I need you
right now. Here.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Elsha.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
We've been tricked, attacked,
and gone through all sorts

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
of bad things lately,
and half the time we get out

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
by the skin of our teeth.
So, will we be okay this time?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
We will. We'll be fine.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
I know it.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Dang, this thing is tough!

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
What is all this?

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
They're welcoming you
into our nation, that's all.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Thank you!

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased to have you,

Well done, really.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
[TEAM]
Yes, Commander!

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
Well then, I have
matters to attend to,

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
so I'll take my leave.

come here personally.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
I simply missed the smell
of battle and came.

it was an honor

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
As such, all that
remains is love.

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
I believe that's the best
way to build relations.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree?

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's some upper-class
thing? That's all I got.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Your skin's so
pretty and smooth,

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
it's unbelievable!

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
I have a favor to ask.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ]
About the villagers, right?

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Yeah.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
First, let me ask you,
are they full of love?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
What? Maybe?

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
"love" is the right word,

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
but they do care for each other,
and try to enjoy every day

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
to the fullest.
That much I can guarantee.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
Every day, huh? Wonderful!
Sounds like love to me!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
Very well. That settles it,
then. Lutoh is vast,

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
so we have plenty of land
for your people to live on,

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
if you'd like.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
You'll give us land?

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Wow, thank you!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ]
Love makes all possible.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] Hey, is she not
gonna wash our backs, or what?

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me,
I don't understand

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
this "diplomacy" thing.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÃ] They're very
nice people, those two.

That's good to hear.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center

to meet Back Arrow as well.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.935 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
I understand. Leave it to me.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You truly are
my holy knight, aren't you?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
You honor me, my lady.

Having comrades is a tough deal.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.655 position:50% align:center
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I care about the Edger guys,

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
and I wanna help 'em out, but...

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Not everything is easy.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
You can say that again.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
I can't remember
anything other than that

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
I wanna go beyond the wall.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
And if I lie about that, then,
I'm not myself anymore.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
Now that you've left them,
do you regret it?

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
My heart kinda feels queasy,
if that's what you mean.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Hey, life is full of regrets.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering,
is there a particular reason

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
you didn't go to Lutoh either?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Kinda.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
It won't break by running away.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
That's why I've gotta stay
here and hit the thing.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
Once I know I can go beyond it,
I'll apologize to 'em.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
That's how I see things
playing out at the moment.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
I see.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Arrow. Behind you!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Uh?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] As I thought.
You're still here.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
To take you to Lutoh.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware that people like
you won't listen to others.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
So I hope you'll forgive me
for being forceful.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] You know,
from the tone of your voice,

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
it doesn't sound like
you really mean that.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
My conviction is
"Devotion to the Princess."

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
Which means that protecting
Princess Fine's heart

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
is my duty!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
Whatever!
I'm breakin' the wall!

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.232 position:50% align:center
And I'll fight anyone who
tries to get in my way!

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
So it's a fight then?

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
That works for me!

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
Ugh, we get it, you can fly--

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center

you're gonna win!

Impossible!

[BACK ARROW] I'm sure you
realize that if I beat your

to the ground and die!

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center

fly above the wall now!

[PRAX CONRAD] You're going
to try to use my Briheight

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center

Brilliant deduction.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Fine. If that's what you want,

I understand your surprise.

It shocked me
the first time, too.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
To think such danger
would be in the sky.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
And if you go any higher...

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] I always thought
the stars in the night's sky

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
were reflections of ice stuck
to the World Wall, but no.

It's like it's saying,
"You can't go any farther."

You can't break the wall

we saw each other

was the Caravan Road Treaty?

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
Let's get straight to the point.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
If you so desire, Lutoh
will grant you asylum.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] That would be in
exchange for Rekka's secrets,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
I take it?

I'm glad you already understand.

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
Very well then, that's doable.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
But in return, I want
to know your process

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
for improving Bind Warpers.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Rekka has fought with
Commander Prax many times

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
in the past, but as far as I'm
aware, that Briheight never had

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
the ability to fly before,
or at least never used it.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
Which means that
sometime recently,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
Lutoh must have artificially
added the ability

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
to fly to at least
that one Bind Warper.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
Now would you say I'm
correct in my assumption?

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
No matter.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
I'm sure only
Commander Prax can use it.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
Otherwise,
we'd see it in battle.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
Judging from your reaction,
it's safe to say

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
it only works for
one individual.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
