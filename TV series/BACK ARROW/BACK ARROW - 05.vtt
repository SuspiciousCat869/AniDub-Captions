Do it, Shu.

Huh?

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Kai! That's enough!
Stop! Stop!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:50.795 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] We can run all day,
but the Rakuho's not here.

What?

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
It landed farther south.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you calculate it?

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Considering its sign,
speed and angle,

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:03.099 position:50% align:center
and of course, taking
the wind into account...

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
That's the place we
should look.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center

Okay. Let's go.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
Just us two?

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Yeah. We've
gotta take risks to rise up.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] I guess, but
I've never liked gambling.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
What have we here?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
You from the local rebel army
or something? Leave it to me.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
I can take care of
this many myself.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center

They rebel backstabbers?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
It's Rekka's official army.

Hold on, don't be so hasty!
We're not enemies, I swear!

[KAI RHODAN]
It's true.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
The rebel army
came for the Rakuho,

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center

Upon closer inspection,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center

wall tribe filth.

Well, have you taken
a look around?

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
These "backwoods peasants" were
able to defeat the rebel army,

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
in case you haven't noticed.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
And yet Rekka's response
is to have us killed?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I got
the emperor's permission.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
General Kai, you must find
out why Shu did this.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware!

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
is similar to ours in Rekka.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps this is
the original model?

nonsense, aren'tcha?

Yes, maybe it is nonsense.

over the details,

a new ship to set off upon.

here to do somethin' about it.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Let me guess.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
You're the one who claims
to be from outside the wall?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
And I'm planning on going
back beyond it, too!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Sorry, Arrow!
It's all up to you again!

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
No prob! Watch me work!

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
So this is the rumored

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
conviction-less Briheight?
Hideous.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Whoa, whoa.
You're squarin' up already?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
Don't you Rekka guys
introduce yourselves first?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] There no need
to for scoundrels like--

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Well, I'm
Granedger's Back Arrow!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Republic of Rekka's
invincible general, Kai Rhodan.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
Briheight Gigan
has come to fight!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Not gonna work!

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
[grunting] What the hell?

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Do you see why
I didn't want to waste my time

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
introducing myself?

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Because you're about to vanish!

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Arrow!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
Oh, I won't vanish!
I'll multiply!

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
Let's do this!

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] No matter how many
there are, I'll beat you!

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Found an opening!

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
I made four clones!

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
And that's only possible
because I'm

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
"conviction-less" like you said!

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Arrow's
got this in the bag!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW grunting]

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Nice try, newbie!

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
But against me,
your attacks are futile!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Futile! Futile!

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Did you think my conviction

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
would be crushed by a man who
doesn't even know who he is?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
You must have deluded yourself.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
Shu! This is the man
your dreams rely on!

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
Look at him now!

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Arrow!

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Atlee, don't!

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
I can't just watch him die!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Hey! Can't you do something?

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
Wasn't warning you enough?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
I said a stronger foe
would show up.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] He only came
because you're here!

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
It's the opposite.
You can't beat him without me.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
Stop it! You and Arrow are
nothing but a curse to us!

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
Just leave us alone
already. I beg you!

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
Even if the two of us
up and left,

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
you'd still be the
target of attacks.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
The head of Rekka,
Emperor Zetzu,

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
believes this dreadnought
is a bad omen.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
You can't go back to
your old way of life now.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
In fact, from the moment
you left the village behind,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
your fates were forever sealed.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN gasping]

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
And the only person who
can stop that man is me.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN] Bit, release him
from his bonds.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh-- Okay.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Doctor Sola, can you
do me a favor?

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Why me?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Because, I think you'll
be the quickest to catch on.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
If you all want to live,
then do exactly as I tell you.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Now. Ready to come
to your senses, Shu?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Let Arrow go first!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Or you'll have to fight us!

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW groans]
Don't do this, guys!

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] That's enough.
At this rate, you'll all die.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
I've got something to say.
Will you hear me out?

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Fine then.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
Everyone, unmanifest your armor.
That means you, too, Kai.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Arrow?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm all right.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I didn't think anyone
could be that strong.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
You just started
using Briheight,

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
we can't expect you to
kick everyone's butt.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
As much as I hate to,
we've gotta leave this to him.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Have you truly abandoned
the Republic, Shu?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Of course.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
I made sure to hammer
the point home

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
by destroying a bunch
of Briheight when I left.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
Just how much of
Rekka's might was lost

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
to your theatrics
and selfishness?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Well, surely
not as many Bind Warpers

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
as I've helped them
attain over the years.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
The only reason Rekka
can collect Warpers

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
faster than Lutoh or
the rebels is because

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
of my formula to predict
where Rakuho will land.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
Without it, they'd
have no advantage.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
Even considering the losses
I've caused recently,

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
I think I've contributed plenty.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:36.483 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Shu! Have you
forgotten about this promise?

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
Our north wall promise,
remember?

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Warriors of Rekka.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
Show me, Zetsu Daidan, the
depths of your conviction!

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
[BIND WARPER]
Manifest Armor.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
[REKKA SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
Oh? I thought everyone
would be the same again,

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
but this time, one is not.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
What is your name
and conviction?

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Kai Rhodan!
My conviction is "Unrivaled"!

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
To protect our country,
I will be a rock without equal!

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
--[ZETSU DAIDAN] Gigan.
--[KAI RHODAN] Sir?

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
In that case, I will name

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
your Briheight "Gigan."

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the honor, sir!

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
Ahh, yes. You're that wall
tribe child from back then.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
[TAE HOWA growls]

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
You have grown stronger.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
Use that strength and
dedicate your life to Rekka.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
Sir! I will!

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
That's my Kai.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
To think you've reached
the role of general already.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Same to you.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
You're in the Arcanum now,
aren't you?

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yes, but just you wait.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
I'll be Head Diviner
within a year's time.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And from
our new positions,

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
we'll change the
country together!

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
Look at it.
This capital is marvelous.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
It's nothing like our village
where people fought

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
for scraps everyday
just to get by.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
We'll fix Rekka's crookedness.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
I know. You and me.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
Together.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
The two of us will never forget
the north wall's pain!

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Huh?

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
Because I'll never forget
the pain you took for my sake.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
This is a symbol of our promise!

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI grunts]

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] I know you haven't
forgotten our promise!

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
You couldn't have!

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Mine healed up.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
It what...?

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
I guess I recover quickly, huh?

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yeah? So what?

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
I'm asking what
your conviction is!

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
Don't dodge the question!

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
Kai. I know you can
change the country,

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
but my ambition is to
change the world now!

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
The world?

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] And for that,
it's not you that I need.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
But you need him?

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
A man whose Briheight is
leagues weaker than mine?

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
You'll bet on him
more than you will me?

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
I've never liked gambling.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
I just choose the higher
probability. So...

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
Well then. In that case,
so be it!

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Not good.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
Shu, you're the worst person
to have as an enemy.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
So for the sake of Rekka,
I'll have to take your life!

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Don't move!

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less if you're
Rekka's general!

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
Without a Briheight,
you're nothin' but a normal guy!

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
Now drop the sword
and put your hands up!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center

This isn't your doing, is it?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
Of course not, I would never.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Good. I didn't think you would

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
try and pull something
this stupid on me.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
You're stupid!
It's over, bonehead!

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Get on your knees
unless you wanna die!

[BIT NAMITAL gasps]

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
He got Bit!

[gasping]

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
Hey, so, don't kill the boy.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Obviously.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:01.062 position:50% align:center
I don't waste my time
on small fry.

00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
This sword of mine only swings
towards the worthy.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
While that unfortunately means
you now, I won't waver.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
I figured.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW grunts]

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Not a bad block!

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Well I wasn't
just gonna stand by.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
This man is prepared to
completely abandon his past!

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
If me with no past can't
protect him, who will?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous!

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Thanks!
Now I can shoot this thing!

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
You're a fool. You only
managed to misfire!

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Bought me enough
time to put on a Warper.

[gasps]

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:42.062 position:50% align:center
An act of desperation, huh?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
I guess we're about to find out!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Very well!

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
I'll wipe you off
the face of Lingalind!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
That's enough, Kai!

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
Doctor Sola, you're up!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
Got it! Preparing the
conviction particle cannon

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
to fire immediately!

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
Ha! What are you aiming at?

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] If you'd like to know,
just ask the capital.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
General! There's been an
explosion by the palace!

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
What? Could it be the
cannon they just fired?

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
Keen observation.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
With the power of
this dreadnought,

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
we're able to strike
the capital from here!

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
That's impossible!

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
It seems that you need
further convincing!

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
Nonsense! Do you know how far we
are from the capital right now?

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
Again! This one was closer!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
This massive battleship is
mentioned in banned texts.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
It's said that it will
destroy the world.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
So of course it would have
weapons this strong.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
If you insist on fighting,

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
we'll use these cannons not
only to destroy the palace,

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
but to scorch
the capital as well.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
You bastard! Was it
this power you wanted?

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Begone! Get out of my sight!

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
I understand your anger,

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
but if you truly wish
to drag innocent people

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
into our personal quarrel,

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
you're not fit to
change the country!

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't dare!

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
You're a coward, Shu! I know it!

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
A coward? Perhaps I am.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
And since I can't beat you
with normal means,

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
I have to resort to this.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Bastard!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
You're not to fit to speak
of changing the world!

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Give it a rest!

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
You swine!

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
You said you're Kai, right?

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
Aren't you supposed
to be his friend?

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
Then stop going after him!

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
What?

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
He's only doing what he
believes is for the best!

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center
A long-time friend like
you should get that!

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Who are you to
speak as if you understand

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
our friendship?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
I'll remember this, Shu.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
I wish it weren't so,
but from now on,

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
you're my biggest enemy.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
You're just a little off.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
From now on, your biggest
enemy is Back Arrow.

00:19:57.864 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
It's over.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:03.286 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL gasping]
That was terrifying!

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
He always falls for
these obvious lies.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
But that's just
the kind of guy he is.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?
Weren't you tricking us, too?

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
Was I?

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Hey! I swear I
came from beyond the wall.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
So do you believe me or not?

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
I believed you from
the very beginning.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Great! Then let's head for

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
the outside together, eh?

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
Of course. That's why
I'm here, after all.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Huh?

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
we can trust this guy?

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
He risked his life for us
like we told him to.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
Isn't that reason enough?

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
You're not wrong, but...

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Yeah.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Good work, everyone!

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.323 position:50% align:center
You did a wonderful job,

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
It's a good thing he
left when he did.

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
He could've found out we
were firing blanks if not.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Huh?

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
But we saw a blast shoot off!

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
That was just the air
from inside the barrel

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
being pushed out.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
Really? Then what gives?
Didn't Rekka get hit?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
You flatter me with your faith,
but even I haven't figured out

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
this dreadnought yet.
The explosions were charges

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
I placed in the capital
ahead of my departure.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
I just timed it.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
I've got the switch
right here on my person.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
So this crazy bluff of yours
put our lives on the line?

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
It's not a bluff. It's strategy.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
I knew he'd retreat if it put
innocent people at risk.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I know Kai Rhodan
better than anyone,

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
and that's who he's always been.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Okay, but won't he
be angrier once he finds out?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Absolutely.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
And that's why we
need to head to the wall

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
as soon as possible--
before Rekka calls my bluff.

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Hey! What happened
to "it's strategy"?

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI laughs]

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] Is this really
the time to laugh?

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
[TAE HOWA] Unsurprisingly, he
failed his mission to destroy

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
the dreadnought
and execute Shu Bi.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
Kai Rhodan did?

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
[TAE HOWA]
Yes. What shall we do?

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
Prohibit him from
any missions for now.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
And tell him I said to
discipline himself.

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Yes. I want you to investigate

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
the bombardment in detail.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.861 position:50% align:center
I take it they were
Shu Bi's doing?

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
I see you're through
calling him "sir," huh?

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
He's not my boss anymore.
He back-stabbed the country.

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:11.706 position:50% align:center
I want to see that traitor die
just as much as you do.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.003 position:50% align:center
I see. Then will you serve me
from now on, Ren Sin?
