Uh. Yes.

You'll never be able

the same Briheight

Once we defeat him,
it won't matter anyway!

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
Granedger's gonna be too slow.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
But if we combine,
we can make it.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
Let's form Granrekka.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Ren.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
I made a promise to the Emperor.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
That I'd defeat
Back Arrow myself.

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
[BRUH]
Arrow, why?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
It's over, nobody out
there can stop me now.

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
I'll erase them all. Everyone.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Hm?

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
He erased my attack, too?

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Well, it did seem like
Rudolf and Emperor Zetsu's

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
fight powered him up somehow.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
That may be,

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
but all the more reason
that I have to beat him!

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Kai, huh? What,
have you come to stop me?

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Yeah.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
What's even the point?

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
Shu and Zetsu
couldn't take me out,

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
and you're not gonna
be any different.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
You're that hopeless?

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
You would be, too.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
But if you really think you've
got a chance at beating me,

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
then hurry up and do it already!

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
That's Emperor Zetsu's move!

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
How did he find the time
to teach it to you?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
He didn't, I'm just winging it!
But it's working pretty well!

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
So what?

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
Even he couldn't
completely seal my power.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] You forget
that he was fighting Rudolf.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
Alone, he could have
beaten you easily.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Anyone can make
grand claims like that!

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] The Emperor
used you to defeat Rudolf.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
That was how he defied God.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
Once his goal was achieved,
His Majesty fell.

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
However, I'm still here
to carry on his will!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Good for you, but
your attacks can't even hit me.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
Your beams and swords vanish

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
before they even
make it to Muga.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
So how are you gonna beat me?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Like this!

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Dark Heaven Destroyer!

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
The hell is that?

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
If you wanna know,
I'll tell you.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
That darkness is
conviction particles

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
compressed to the limit.
Even you can't completely erase

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
such a concentration
before it hits.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
That's incredible!

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
With a strong enough will,

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
one can surpass God.
Make a path where there is none.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
That's Zetsu's conviction.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
I took his conviction
and combined

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
it with mine of
"Unrivaled!" to create this.

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
No hesitation. No fear.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
One blade to pierce the heavens!

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
Now witness the depths
of my spirit!

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN grunting]

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
Muga looks battered.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Kai's unbelievable.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU] Seriously.
When did he learn that skill?

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
C'mon Arrow.

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] I see.
Perfect, now I can finally die.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
I had hoped to fight
the original you,

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
long before this happened,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
before God claimed you,

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
and you became the destroyer
to fulfill his whim.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
You can do it.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
But that time has passed!
I won't hold back!

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
That's a bit of a problem, Kai.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
See, I kind of said
that I would save Arrow.

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
Shu?

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
About time you came back,
man! But, uh...

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Why're you so big?
