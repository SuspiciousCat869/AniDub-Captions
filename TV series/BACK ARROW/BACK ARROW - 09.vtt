[NARRATOR] Lingalind.
A world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,
protecting, nurturing,

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
sustaining. The wall is god.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
Invited to Lutoh
by the princess,

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
the Granedger crew received
a warm welcome.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
Arrow was subjected to
human experimentation.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.125 position:50% align:center
The mysterious knight
who ordered this testing

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
was none other than
Princess Fine's alter ego.

[SHU BI grunts]

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Didn't the princess
invite us to come here?

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
Why's she attacking us?

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
I dunno!

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
Didn't know she was
so crazy, either!

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Maybe it's a split personality?

Die! Die!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center

Stop!

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
Arrow! You can't
fight back, dude!

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
Atlee and the other Edger
villagers are guests here!

If you piss off the princess,
they're gonna be screwed!

What else can I do?

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.536 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you so quickly you
won't have time to feel pain.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
That's how I show love!

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
The love of a ruler!

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
No thank you!

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
My, such manners!

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
Leaving so soon, Arrow?
There's no need to hold back!

Can't you do something
about this, Shu?

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid not.
I'd only make it worse.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
I can't deal with
people like that--

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
I found you.

[BIT NAMITAL screams]

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Great! I'm not very
good at running, either!

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center

I'm gonna pee! Leave me alone!

--[BIT NAMITAL] Don't stop!

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Princess.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Leave these fools
to me and head back.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
That almost sounded like you
were giving me an order.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] Of course not,
I would never. I serve you.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's go! Like, now!

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
Good, that's more like it.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
Now, go chop them
into bits for me.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
As you wish.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Man, first you serve me up

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
to some mad scientist
and now this?

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
You're just full of
villainous ideas, huh?

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
I simply carry out
the princess' wishes

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
with as much elegance
as possible.

[FINOIR laughing]

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
Surprise. It seems
even this country

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
has a few deep, dark secrets.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
Well you were never supposed
to peek behind the curtains.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Oh? Then I
take it you already knew

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
about the princess' condition?

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, anybody else
who knows the secret must die.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
And you three are no exception.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shu, anything
up your sleeve?

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
The fact that you're
asking that worries me.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Is it because you think
if you fight them right now

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
you'll probably lose?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
Pretty much. All of that damn
zapping took a lot out of me.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
I keep telling you, we should
be running instead of talking!

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center

you're fine now, right?

for everyone to live,

[BACK ARROW] It won't work
with you guys in here!

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
My guess is he would have
to clone you and I as well,

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
and since he can't do that,
he can't clone anything?

I had a feeling I was
missing something.

So what, then?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
Did you run away from
your responsibilities

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
and hide in Edger Village?

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
Fitting for a coward.

becoming this way

was my fault, we both know that.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
to find her a cure!

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] I'm not
interested in your excuses!

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
And it's thanks to my leaving,
I found these guys.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
Granedger's computer
is incredible.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
There's knowledge we can't
even fathom dwelling within it.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
There may be something in there
that helps us cure the princess!

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
And in order to understand it,
we need a genius, like Shu!

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Correct. It's quite complicated.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
And Arrow.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
For some reason he
can destroy Briheights

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
without killing the operator.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
Can't you see? That ability
is proof that it's possible

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
to wipe out conviction
without hurting

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
the person in the process!

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
We're so close! We can stop
her crazed personality!

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
Yeah? We can?

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
Shut up, just nod
and agree, you idiot.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
What's that pee-pants?

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then what's that
little man good for?

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
Convince me.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Huh?!

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
Oh, him? He's, uh...

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
Why can't you think
of an answer, man?

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
I'm the Admiral of
Tactics, for one!

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
If I don't give permission,
Shu can't do anything!

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, sort of.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] The princess gave
me orders to chop you to bits,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
and I must obey them,
no matter what.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Prax...

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] All you do is
repeat the same silly pleads!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
You have no integrity left!

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
--[SOLA ATHIN] Please!
--Shut up, Werner!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN grunts]

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
They got away? No matter.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
The Edger villagers
are captives now.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
How can you be so sure
they won't find us here?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Well, I always won

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
at hide-and-seek
when we were kids.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
But we're dealing
with royalty here,

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
couldn't they just
send the army?

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
They won't.
This is a well-kept secret.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
Prax, the princess, and I are
the only ones who know about it.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
You think to keep
the secret safe,

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
they won't risk deploying
soldiers and drawing attention?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN] Yeah. At most,
they'll send underlings.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a relief, at least.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I never would have
pegged you as a former noble!

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
About that.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could
fill us in on what happened?

00:10:56.406 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well, for starters,
my real name is Werner Conrad.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
I was Lutoh's Armored Supreme.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
It was five years ago.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
The ruler's sudden death
left a vacancy in the throne.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
There were 40 successors
and Princess Fine

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
was the last in line.
She was the least likely pick.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
But she seemed to
enjoy that freedom.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
She was an innocent girl
who warmed up to us quickly.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE laughs]
Werner! Prax!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE]
I wanna fly, too!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
I've seen you do it, Prax.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you fly around
on those big wings, right?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to do that, too!

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
Back then, she was
training to fly on a kite

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
that looks quite like
a bird from a distance.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
We were trying
to outclass Rekka.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
Mobility seemed like
an appropriate avenue.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE giggles]
Whoa, awesome!

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] Don't get
too excited. It's dangerous.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE] Look!
I can see the castle below!

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
Feels so good!

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD laughs]

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE] There's Werner!
Over here! Werner!

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
What is he...?

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTE screams]

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Princess!

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Brother! What were you doing?

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
Why would you shoot at us?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN] I'm sorry!
I-I thought it was a bird!

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
I thought a bird was attacking
you, I was trying to help!

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] I don't
believe that for a second!

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
At the time, I truly did
think it was a bird,

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
but I know that's just an
excuse.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
I shot them both out of the sky,
and that's a fact.

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
Ever since, they stopped
flight training.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
So, was the princess okay?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Yeah. Soon after she was chosen

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
for the throne,
as Princess Supreme.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
She and Prax were delighted.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
The terrible aftereffects
showed up later.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
I assume you mean her
split personality, then?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
As luck would have it,
that side of her

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
only revealed itself
around Prax and I.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
I proposed we reveal her secret,

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
since she was too frail
for the throne anyway.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
But Prax just kept on saying,

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
"If we do, she'll be stripped of
the crown!" not to mention...

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] If you go through
with this, you're going to die!

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
an exaggeration,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
but it was a threat.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
One day, when I had finally
decided to tell Baran and Peath

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
what was happening,
I discovered that

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
my meal had been
slightly poisoned.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
It wasn't fatal, just a warning.

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
Prax will protect the princess'
crown at all costs.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
Something inside me
broke that day,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
and I ran away that same night.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] You said you left
to find a cure.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
Is that why you became a doctor?

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Yeah, more or less.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
Okay, but what's our plan now?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
We can't make any moves as long

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
as the others are
still in the castle.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I'll go check out
the city tomorrow.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
Welp. Sounds like
you've got a plan!

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
Let's get some sleep then.

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN] You safeguarded
the nation while I

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
was away, Prime Minister Tae.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
[TAE HOWA]
You honor me, sir.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
It's a privilege to
receive your praise.

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN laughs]
You think it's praise, huh?

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
[ZETSU DAIDAN]
This nation still has a need

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
for cowards like you,
for the time being.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
However, you'll soon
be of very little use.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center

the rebels in the west,

Rekka is ready to conquer.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
All of Lingalind
will soon be ours.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Tae! The time has come for you

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
to spew out the fortunes
you've hoarded for so long.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
[TAE HOWA]
Yes, My lord.

That's Zetsu for you.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center

Not bad, Kai. [laughs]

Your Majesty!

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
To think your roar
has become this strong.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
All that training has
certainly paid dividends.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
There's something that I
would like for you to see.

the general's seating?

Are you nervous?

You're my retainer,
it's only natural

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
that you should
be here by my side.

Seriously? A public execution
of the rebel chief?

I swear, His Majesty does
everything on a whim.

was able to rise to power
in a single generation.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Not exactly what I pictured.
