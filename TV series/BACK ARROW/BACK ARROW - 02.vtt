[NARRATOR] Lingalind,
a world surrounded by a wall.

This man of missing memories

beyond the wall."

put those on, please?

President Garay.
Might it interest you to know

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
that unlike our
kind-hearted princess,

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
many of us here are itching
for the chance to battle?

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
I understand. What exactly
are you asking us to do?

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
What's with all this meat?

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] I wonder if
this is Arrow's doing.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
If it is, he's sure
hung up on paying debts.

We're from the Iki Territory's

Military? What for?

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
I, Commander Tyrone Duster,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
have been given authority
to do what I please!

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
And I order the village

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What? Why?

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
Ahh! I'm sorry!

[TYRONE DUSTER]
Don't panic!

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
If you just do what I say,
nobody gets hurt!

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
This is awesome! I've
always wanted to say that!

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, what's
the point of this search?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
You must be the chief!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
Then I'll get right
down to business.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
Hand over the man who
landed in the Rakuho

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center

He what? I imagine you heard
that? Right, Mr. President?

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
Enough. Make the
problem disappear.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
We've already got
Lutoh on our case,

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
we don't need Rekka, too.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
Erase Edger Village

I've always wanted

Come on Atlee! Not this again!

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] All right?
So stop harassing our village!

[TYRONE DUSTER] You brought
out a Briheight, huh?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're resisting!

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
I'll destroy the village!
I know that sounds bad,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center

having to make a sacrifice

Why does everyone who has
a bone to pick with us

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
have to fight like
an utter maniac?

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Yes! I actually
found one! Talk about lucky!

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling there might
be another Bind Warper

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center

two Briheights in this place?

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who told Arrow
he had to leave the village.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
So I've gotta step up!

had two Briheights!

I'd stay here for a bit,

Huh... Looks empty inside,

Is that which appeared
the world's hope?
