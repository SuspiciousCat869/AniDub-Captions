[SHU BI] We've managed

without too much trouble,

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
but Walston here is
an autonomous province.

I'm undecided on whether we
should risk it for a shortcut.

Automowha?

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
Lutoh lets the lord self-govern.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
As long as they pay
their due taxes, of course.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
And compared to Lutoh
proper, its defenses are,

[BACK ARROW] Thanks again
for lending your smarts.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.045 position:50% align:center
Oh, all I did was improve
your idea a little bit.

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
We still would have been

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
in a lot of trouble
if the pretty boys

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
hadn't noticed the Warpers
and gone to steal them.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad to know you're not
the kind of guy

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
to waste time
offering sympathies

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
when you can act.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
Would you leave if I was?

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
--You're something else.
--Hm?

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
I mean, you left your country

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
and betrayed your
friend for this,

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
but you'd walk away
at the drop of a hat.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.647 position:50% align:center
I'd just move on.

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
I'm a genius,
so I'd get by somehow.

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center
But for the time being,
you interest me.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
That right? I'm glad to hear it.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
Plus, you'd leave
just as quickly.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Huh. For me,

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
getting past the wall is all
that matters right now.

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
Hey! Good luck with
everything, you guys!
