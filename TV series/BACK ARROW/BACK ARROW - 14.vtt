And pretend to get pushed back

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center

suspect it, please!

Why are we retreating?

give us such crazy orders!

I've got other plans
for the two of you.

tell us what it is?

[SHU BI] No time, quit your

don't you?

had finally learned

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center

you at a safe distance!

Send everyone!

Their chain of command
is falling apart,

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center

take advantage of that!

back for a siege?

Then we'll crush 'em,

[ZETSU DAIDAN] Warriors, get
into formation immediately!

So awesome!

[SHU BI] That was Granedger's
giant particle cannon,

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
but we gave it a boost.
We were able to combine it with

the merciful power
of Arrow's Saberblow.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
And with this little
trick of ours,

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
we beat their Briheights
without killing their soldiers.

was that one attack.

then we'll kick!

For nothing?

If there's even the slightest
chance of success,

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
then we will fight!

We take pride in our
endless tenacity!

Don't bother with him, sir.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
He doesn't understand
and never will!

Don't waste the energy.

I know you refuse
to kill anybody,

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
but they won't stop
until they're dead.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
They believe pride
is more important

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
than their own lives.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
You're not going
to convince them.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
They won't see reason
when it comes

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
They'll push themselves to
the limit and then some.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
It's the greatest respect
we show to our enemies!

It's no use, Princess Fine!

are over your kindness!

Even so... In fact,
because of their endless will,

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
I'll keep sending
them my endless love.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
I'll help out with the love!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Me, too!

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
What the--?
The hell is happening?

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
I do this because there lies

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
another self hiding
deep within me.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
A terrifying me, who would
consume her enemy

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
and allies alike,
in order to heal herself.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
But I'm here.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
So as long as I remain myself,
I'll keep being kind!

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Yeah, that's right!

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
And kindness is beautiful.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with
striving to be kind?

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
There's a reason women
are drawn to those

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
who shine through
their kindness.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center

[FINE FORTÉ] If there's no
love on the battlefield,

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center

my limitless supply.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
it's rejected.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center

Love is everything!

That is my--Princess Fine

You dare to heal even me?

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
You'd cast your
pity on me, girl?

I, Zetsu Daidan,
have been defeated

by Princess Supreme Fine.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU] But your Majesty!
We can still be victorious!

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
That's right! If we can
defeat the dreadnought,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
we still have a chance at--

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Goh. Bai!
The emperor has spoken!

[GOH ZANGA] Dammit, Kai!
Are you not angry?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
The emperor has spoken.

[BAI TOATSU gasps]

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
Do you want to bring him
even further shame?

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Rekka wouldn't be what it is
today without His Majesty.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
I was so thirsty for blood,
I nearly forgot that.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ] Lutoh wishes
only to defend our lands

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
and live in peace.
As long as your army leaves,

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
we will not pursue any
further conflict with you.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
From this moment on,
the Republic of Rekka

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
shall not attack or invade
Lutoh's borders in any fashion,

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
under any circumstances.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
Will you agree to this?

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Very well.

[PRAX CONRAD]
I'm glad it worked out,

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
but I still can't believe
you came to

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
the front lines yourself. What
if something had happened?

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ]
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD chuckles]
A splendid victory, Princess.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
We won this peace
because of you,

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
and don't you ever forget it.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
Do you think so?

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
Elsha. Atlee. Thank you both!

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
If not for you, Lutoh couldn't
have won this war.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's not true.
Your power did it, Fine.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It was your love.
That's what ended the war.

[BIT NAMITAL laughs]

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
My brave soldiers of Lutoh,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
Rekka's forces have officially
left our lands!

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
And what's more, they will
never attack us again!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
We were able to
regain Lutoh's peace,

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
and it's all thanks to you.
Thank you, truly!

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
However, while we
rightfully celebrate,

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
let us not forget the many
who lost their lives in battle.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
Whether from Lutoh, or Rekka,
all lives are precious.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
In their honor. I hope to
shoulder their sacrifice,

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
and build a better future
for the people of Lutoh!

[REN SIN]
Your Majesty.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
If I may ask, when you
faced Princess Fine,

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
what did you make
of her Briheight?

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Did I think it was
a beautiful sight?

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
Did I think it vile to the core?

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
Did I want to kill it,
immediately?

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
I don't think it really matters
at the end of the day.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
I'm just looking forward
to next time.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Huh? Something's
wrong with Granedger?

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yeah, the main system.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
It's probably because
we used Arrow

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
to amplify those
conviction particles.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
Man, this sucks!

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
Now the people of Lutoh
will have to postpone

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
my welcome parade
and all the festivities!

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
So, can't we fix it?

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
Well yes, but it's going to take
a substantial amount of time.

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
So we won't be getting a big
victory feast and a nice bath?

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
I was looking forward to it.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ]
Prax. Once we're back,

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
I've decided to tell the
citizens the entire truth.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] You mean
about your other self?

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ] Yes. I can't keep
deceiving them forever.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
Admirable.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
We won the war,
so perhaps the good news

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
will soften the blow
and they'll understand.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
I sure hope so!

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center

What is this?

We saw you pickin' a fight
with Rekka with our own eyes,

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
so don't even bother denying it!
