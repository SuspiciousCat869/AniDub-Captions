Huh?

Do you know what's
fascinating, Werner?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
If you take the Briheights
made from the citizens

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
who hate the princess now,
and compare them

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
to the soldiers who love her,
they're quite similar.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
Do you know why?

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
Because love and hate
stem from the same roots.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
Which makes their Briheights
practically identical,

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
save for the color.

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
And it's for this same reason
that a façade of love

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
can swiftly change to hate.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
So you admit you manipulated
people's hearts!

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center

Besides, a reasonable

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
call what I do "manipulation."

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
It's simply swaying
and influencing.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
Lightly nudging people on
the scale of love and hate.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
