It's only natural.

When standing
before the emperor,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
loyalty is one's
greatest conviction.

Am I mistaken,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
or is your Briheight
different from the others?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
You're correct.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center

the name "Gigan."

What are you referring to?

The man can be rather
frightening when he tries,

so I'll make sure I
report to him soon.

Good, that's the
answer I wanted.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
Just be quick about it.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
Be quick about that, too.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry?

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Just ignore what he said.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
Believe me, he doesn't know
the first thing about romance.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
You say that as if you're
an expert on the matter.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center

All right. After we eat,

I bet this whopper can
reach the wall, no problem!

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
Still going on about that?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] I mean, only your
Briheight makes it move,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
so, yeah.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Oh, gimme a break!
Our village was completely

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Well, uh,
I feel bad about that.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, honest.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
But still, I've got to go back.
I had a little chat with Shu,

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
and it made me realize
I can't scale the wall alone!

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
But something tells me
it's possible with some help

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
from my friends! All my new
friends from Edger Village!

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Since when is anyone
friends with you?

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
And who's this "Shu"
you're talking about?

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
I'm not entirely sure,
but he's very annoying.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center

Uh! Hey, Elsha!

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
I guess Elsha's
a tough one, too.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
You'd think she'd be exhausted

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
after moving that
enormous thing, but nope.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
It's no surprise,
considering her upbringing.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
The frontier will
do that to you.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
I know you're fairly new here,
but you'll learn that quick.

I suppose.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
I have to ask. Have you
learned anything about him?

[SOLA ATHIN] I haven't had
much of a chance to yet,

but other than his
lack of memories,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
he seems to be just fine.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center

examination might tell us more.

[BURK LEAN]
There's no need for that.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
Besides, the real
problem with him

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
is the delusion he has about
being from beyond the wall.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center

True.

want Commander Tyrone

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
In exchange for a new place
to live, we're turning you in.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're not bluffing--
the president promised us,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
and all of us heard him.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Are you really gonna hand 'em

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
the guy who inherited the spirit
of the former sheriff?

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Shut up about the man panties!

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
You in on this, too?

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
Um. Arrow... I...

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
It's not like we were actually
going to let you

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
become a sheriff!
Besides, there's no choice,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
the village is gone,
we need a place to go!

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Put your hands up
and roll over, "buddy"!

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW exhales]
Yeah, yeah.

Hm?

[BIT NAMITAL gasps]

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Untie him, now.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
A-Atlee?

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.446 position:50% align:center
I said, untie Arrow. Hurry!

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
But we have to hand him over!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
So you're okay with sacrificing
an innocent person

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
just so we can have
a nice, new start?

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
Innocent?
He destroyed the place!

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
He didn't mean to.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
And did you forget he
also saved everyone?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
It's my turn to save him now.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hurt you!
Just untie him.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
Drop the gun, right now.
Bit's right about this.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
Sacrifice is just
a part of life.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
I know, but--

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
Tyrone said they'll hand him
over to Lutoh, that's it.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
It's not like they
plan on killing him.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
And you actually
believe that guy?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
He tried to kill me, remember?

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
That's enough.
Don't bother, Atlee.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, but
I'm not gonna run away.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
But you might die!

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
At this point if I did run,
they'd blame you.

[grunts]

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
I wanna go beyond the wall,

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
but if I gotta make someone
suffer to do it, I'm out.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Yeah, we have
suffered, though! Plenty!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
And because you think that,

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
as you can see,
I'm not resisting.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
It's fine.
No hard feelings. But...

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
Elsha, what would
you say is your dream?

Is it protecting the village?

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
What if that guy
is lying to you?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
There's not much
we can do about it.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
We're just a tiny village
they'd rather didn't exist.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] But you're the only
one who can move that behemoth.

You guys have power now.
Something you never had before!

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
And what, you want me to
use it to blow up the wall?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
Pathetic. You're just pushing
your own agenda onto a stranger.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
You're right, that's
exactly what I'm doing.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Is that really so wrong?

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
It's all sorts of wrong!

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
Try considering
other people's feelings!

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
Why, y'think it would
change anything if I did?

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
Is your conviction:
"I'm easily swayed

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
by other people's opinions"?

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
It turns out I don't
even have convictions.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
And yet, I refuse
to deceive myself.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
Cus I'm a guy who doesn't have
a clue who they are. Y'know?

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
If I ignore my gut feelings,

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
then I'd truly have
nothing left at all.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center

massive ship sure is high, huh?

Man, Bit always gets
so carried away.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Time to go to our new home.

There wasn't much to
love about the place,

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center

We're handing him over

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
[PRESIDENT GARAY]
The existence of Edger Village,

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
and that massive ship,
must be wiped from history.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But why?

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Think, if Rekka or Lutoh
were to learn of that weapon,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
they would race to
attack us and claim it.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
If we picked one side to
hand it over to, the other

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
would hate us for it. Thus,
we must erase the existence

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center
of such a thing for the sake
of Iki Territory's safety.

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
Brilliant, President!
I still can't believe you knew

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
what I was getting at
when I contacted you.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
You read my mind and
just went with the flow.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
You tricked me!

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
Maybe so, but you're a
fool for being tricked.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
