[NARRATOR] Lingalind,
a world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds
the land, protecting,

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
nurturing, sustaining.
The wall is god.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:34.034 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] On that fated day,
a man fell from the sky

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
on the remote village
of Edger in Iki.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
His name: Back Arrow.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
Concerned about their
diplomatic balance

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
with larger nations, President
Garay of the Iki Territory

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
attacked Arrow
and the dreadnought

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.924 position:50% align:center
that came from
below the village.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
However, Elsha and friends
escaped his trap,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
and headed for
Arrow's destination:

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
The wall.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, in the
Republic of Rekka--

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
one of the world's
two great nations--

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
Shu Bi declared he
would eliminate Arrow.

Did I say you could talk?

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
Don't, Kai.
We are livestock now.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] The village couldn't
pay its taxes to the government,

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
so they offered us up
instead of money or food.

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
What are we, if not livestock?

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
But Shu--!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
No, we're even less than that.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
Look, all the villagers
are just standing there,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
watching us from the shadows.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
They've completely abandoned us.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
Ha. They're this afraid
of government goons?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
[REKKA SOLDIER A]
I said no talking!

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
This is awful.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
Not even cattle would eat this
if it was in front of them.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
we don't have a roof.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
This treatment is inhumane.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] It's so the weak
ones are weeded out

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
and only the strong
become soldiers of Rekka.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
That's rough.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
I'm not gonna stand for this!

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
Give it up, Kai.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
No way! I'm getting
out of here!

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
And what's gonna happen
to you once you leave?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
At best, you'll become a thief.
This is a chance for us.

To what, be a slave forever?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
It's true, we may
be slaves right now.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
But if we prove ourselves,

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
we might be able to catch
the eye of the capital

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
and start moving up
in the world.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
It's not gonna work like that--

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
It will. 'Cause it's you and me.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Well, the more
impossible something seems,

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
the more I wanna do it.

Let's rise to the top, Shu!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yeah! Someday,
the Republic of Rekka...

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
...will be ours for the taking!

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
Oh, what's up?

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
"What's up?"
I was looking for you.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
Where'd you go?

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] For a walk.
This being my first foray.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
I may not see the capital again.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
I'm kidding.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
Did you really think I'd put
myself in danger like that?

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
No, perhaps not.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
But hey, will you be
all right without me?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center

I'll be fine.

Plus, if you come,
you'll get all the credit.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
That isn't true!

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
You may think that,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
but unfortunately,
it is the truth.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
That simpleton prime
minister is on my case,

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
and I'd like to use this
as an opportunity

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
to make a name for myself.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center

I take it?

Yep, to change
the country from within.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
I've enlisted the help of
the Four Fiends for this.

You mean that pack of
mercenaries gone astray?

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
They're quite powerful.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
If I'm able to defeat
the dreadnought

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
with their help,
even the prime minister

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
will find it difficult
to complain.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center

for business.

it's a neutral zone,

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center

around Edger Village,

Man, you sure know a lot, Doc.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
Well, before I found myself
in Edger about a year ago,

for quite some time.

You pick up a lot of things
when you do that.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
Edger didn't have
a doctor before,

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
so we're eternally
grateful for him

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
and all that he's done for us.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center

--Huh?
--[SHU BI] Guess not.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
Well, for your information,
liquid metals

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
flow underground like a network
of interconnected rivers.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
Those rivers have the power
to repel certain types

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
of metal, and since they're
below, they repel upwards.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
Iron steed, dreadnoughts,
and all Lingalind vehicles

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
utilize this repelling power.

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
It's how they float
and move around.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
And earlier,
the Four Fiends used

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
what is called
a "decouple spray"

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
that breaks that
repelling property

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
between the metals.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
Forgive the complicated
explanation,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
but that is why this dreadnought
won't float or move anymore.

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center

it'll wear off after an hour.

get worse from here.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
There's a much stronger
foe they'll send us.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.035 position:50% align:center
Enough outta you!

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
First, he attacks us,
and now he acts as if

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
he's our best friend
all of a sudden?

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
It's the same deal as last time!

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Tyrone.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
I won't be tricked again.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
He's planning something,
I know it!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
And if you think I'm
just gonna stand here

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
and let him talk his way outta
this, you're dead wrong.

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
Ahh. Something like that
happened to you before?

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, so if you want
us to trust you,

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
you're gonna have
to risk your life for us.

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
Like he did.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
Oh dear, I've never been
a fan of gambling,

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
but if I must.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? And where's Shu?

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.784 position:50% align:center
He betrayed us!

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
What did you say?
