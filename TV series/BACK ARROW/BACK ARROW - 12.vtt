[NARRATION] A war between
the Supremacy of Lutoh

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
and the Republic
of Rekka has begun.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
When faced with Shu and
Arrow's coordinated attack,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
Kai found himself
utterly defeated.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
However, Emperor Zetsu's
power knows no bounds,

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50% align:center
and even Prax couldn't
compete with his strength.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
In the end,
how will this war unfold?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
No way!

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Isn't that Prax's Briheight?

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
What's it doing back here?

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Are we losing?

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
--[MAN D] Impossible!
--[MAN E] You sure?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
[MAN F]
But what if it's true?

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] How could that be?
What's going to happen to us?

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
Good to see you,
elite soldiers of Lutoh!

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.486 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the one
and only Granedger!

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've heard
how we easily defeated

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.742 position:50% align:center
Rekka's invincible general,
and I know you're excited

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
to become heroes yourselves!

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Lutoh reinforcements?

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
We are at war.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Try to take it easy, okay?

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
Got it. Thank you.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.878 position:50% align:center
So, what were you saying again?

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
Something senses conviction
and then manifests--

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
The particles.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50% align:center
According to Lutoh's
extensive research,

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
these "conviction particles"

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
are what make up
your Briheights.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
And when sensed,
a person's spiritual foundation

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
acts as the core for
their Briheight's abilities,

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
which means near
infinite prospects.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
In a battle between
two Briheights,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
the reason that
the loser vanishes

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
is because their spirit is
destroyed with the Briheight,

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
and their body breaks down

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
into conviction particles
that proceed to scatter.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
It's thought that Bind Warpers
play some part in this,

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
but we're not sure how.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
but when Arrow defeats people,
they don't disappear.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
We're still looking into that.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
Every time you don't know
something, I'm caught off guard.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
I did join you to
learn more, didn't I?

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
Can't argue with you there.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
The thing is, your Briheight
affinity is exceptionally high

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
when compared to
your average person's.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
Which is what lets you
shapeshift and make clones.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
That said, with your
right hand hurt like this,

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
we can't be sure
that you can use

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Saberblow like usual.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
Sorry, "Saberblow"?

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yes. That's what I'm calling

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
your "finishing blow"
you deal to Briheights.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
You named it? Really?

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
It'll be quite helpful
when giving orders.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
We're going to name all of
our attacks for that reason.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what happens
if you're right,

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
and he can't use Saberblow?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
He'll have to use
his other attacks

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
to immobilize the enemy without
actually defeating them.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
And if that doesn't work
for some reason,

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
then he'll just have to
shatter their conviction.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
By that, you mean I'll
have to kill them, right?

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
I'm afraid so.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we'll be engaging
with Rekka's army again.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
Let's make smart
decisions out there.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
Arrow?

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Rekka's a lot
stronger than we thought.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
Our only real victory
we pulled off today

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
was the Granedger
beating their general!

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
It's still kind of hard to
believe Prax was defeated.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Does our
army stand a chance, at all?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we do, with the
plan we've come up with.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow morning, Rekka
will likely push an attack.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
We and the Granedger
can lead them

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
into the Viola Canyon
and block their exit.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
We then destroy the canyon

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
and bury their forces
in the rubble.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] That's the same
strategy Iki used on us.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Do you think it'll work?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Yes, I believe so.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
The Granedger may have
been able to survive it,

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
but their army will not.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
Well, that works for me.
I have no problems with it.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center

[PEATH GLINHOUSE]
Yes. At this stage,

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
it's more like concern about the
war than actual civil unrest.

But hear me, we won't lose.

with each other!

Yes!

My intolerance for injustice
remains unchanged,

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
but I've gained new power!

is now called Reppu!

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
Well done, Ren.

Now, let's go!

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
This new Briheight of
mine will be your wings.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
Let's fell Shu,
the villain, together!

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center

Huh.

Sir Kai?

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center

Go do it on your own.

[REN SIN]
Huh?

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] It's astounding
how much you've grown

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
in such a short time.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center

No! We have to fight together!

I can't go any farther.

Listen! I just said that
you can use my wings--!

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] No! If I use your
strength to return to the fight,

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
Shu will ridicule me!

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
General.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
You think I'd readily borrow
someone else's power?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
Do you want me to embarrass
myself even further?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN grunting]
Such ignorance, Kai Rhodan!

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
You're still defending your
dignity at a time like this?

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Does your pride matter
that much to you?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
No, I misspoke.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
It's not pride, but arrogance!

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Not dignity, but ego!

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
We have to win, whatever
it takes! Shu thinks so.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
And isn't that a much more
righteous way to live?

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Think of me as your tool,
the same as a spear or sword!

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
What's the shame
in using a weapon?

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center

makes you a warrior!

from the brink of death

to help a man
who can't even find

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center

as you say. Incredible.

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
Since when did my vow to become
an invincible warrior mutate

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
into arrogance
and an inflated ego?

Sir Kai.

00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
I thank you. But you
better not regret this.

I won't waver anymore.
If you're my weapon,

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
then I won't hesitate to use
you until you fall apart!

Of course!

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
