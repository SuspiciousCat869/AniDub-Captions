[NARRATOR] Lingalind--a world
surrounded by a wall.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
protecting,
nurturing, sustaining.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
But what is Lingalind?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
Shu Bi discovered the truth--

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
that it's one of many "Lind"
in a giant structure

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
created by God, which seems
to make up all of existence.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
Though Lingalind was one of many
lands serving a special purpose,

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
Zetsu and other
irregularities caused God

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
to deem it unwanted,
and as a result,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
initiated its destruction.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
To thwart this cataclysmic fate,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
God must now be challenged.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
While most were
prepared to do so,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.274 position:50% align:center
Arrow's resolution wavered,
but in battling Kai,

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
he finally realized
who he truly was.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN] Are you sure?
You won't let us come with you?

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Sorry, Grandpa. Not this time.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.459 position:50% align:center
But Atlee, we wanna go!

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:25.960 position:50% align:center
[ANNIE]
Take us!

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I really am, you guys.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
Cut it out, kids, don't make
the Queen's job harder.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:32.717 position:50% align:center
[ANNIE]
Uh?

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
Listen. We're trying
to save the world,

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.264 position:50% align:center
and to do that, we gotta go
have a nice long chat with God.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
But if, for some reason,
we don't make it back,

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
then it'll be your
turn to step up.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
Tom. Jim. Sam. Annie.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
You gotta protect Edger.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.484 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Bit.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.610 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Understand?

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.862 position:50% align:center
Since when did you
get all confident?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kinda cool!

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
Pretty cocky.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50% align:center
For a scaredy-cat!

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well this scaredy-cat
needs you to stay here, okay?

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
You'll be on standby!

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.247 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
Okay!

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
Are you two sure you can take
care of things from here?

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50% align:center
I wish we were as strong
as all of you,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.879 position:50% align:center
then we could get out there
and help you directly.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
Knowing we have
people waiting for us

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
back home is gonna help us
a lot more than you think.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.635 position:50% align:center
[BRUH]
Come back safe, okay?

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50% align:center
That's the plan. I promise.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna save the world
no matter what.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.581 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] The sickle of death
is an incredible thing, huh?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Hey, Shu.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
What was the quote again?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
"Only under the sickle of
death is a person revealed"?

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
That was one of
Zetsu's teachings.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
What, you think I tested Arrow?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yes, but also no.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
It was me you tested.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
That is, my decision
to abandon our dream

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
and team up with Arrow

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
to uncover the secrets
of the world.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Not everything
has to be about you, you know.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] With Emperor Zetsu
gone, you'll rule Rekka someday.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure you'll make
a prosperous country

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
without any social classes.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
I drafted some policies.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
They're pretty much all from
before I abandoned your dream.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
So I wrote them down to free up
some room in my head. [gasps]

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
You really didn't think
I would notice this?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
That's my bad.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] I'm not going
to read your policies.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
But don't forget them.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
After we defeat God,
I expect you to tell me

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
about them yourself.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
As someone who knows
all about the world.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
You're going to help me
fulfill my dream first?

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
What are you crying for, Ren?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
I'm not! Am I?

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
I didn't even notice you there!

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
You've gotten so good
at sneaking around.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] I'm guarding Kai.
Had you been hostile,

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
I was at the ready
to take you down.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
Still wanna kill me
after all this time?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
If you do anything shady--

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
remember, I've got my eyes
on you at all times.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
Heh. That sounds like
a confession to me.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Kai doesn't know the
first thing about romance.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
Ignore him.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
They're both so dumb in
their own special ways.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
Let's renew our promise. We'll
build an ideal country together.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Right! May these
dreams of ours...

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] No time to waste. Our
destination is Epitaph Mountain.

Got it!

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center

[BACK ARROW]
What's that mean?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
That fake walls aren't
needed anymore,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
so why bother keeping
us out? Fine by me.

Peath. Baran. Demyne. Werner.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
What? Then us falling from
the sky wasn't an accident?

It was all orchestrated
by Rudolf?

Yes.

So Werner blamed himself for
what happened all these years,

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
Your fate cannot be avoided!

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Can you not see?

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
He's obviously
trying to stall us.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
You know what that means.
Kai, strike right through it!

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
What?

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! That Rakuho's
coming out of a hole

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
that leads to the outside!

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Exactly!

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
Cut through it and we can make
our way out of here right now.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
I see! Ren!

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
Right!

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Let's open a path!

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Martial Arrow!

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
Spinning Dark Decay!

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
[ALL yell]

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
You'll never make it
you insignificant scum!

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
Wha--? Impossible!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
Full speed ahead!

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
We're on it!

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL] Let's go! This is
our one chance to get to God!

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
This is blasphemy!

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU]
You like that, God's lackey?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA]
You let your guard down!

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
Look what you've done. Fools.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
You've left me with no
choice but to destroy

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
the world and every living
being in it myself.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA] Allow me to be
of assistance, Lord Rudolf!

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
What is this?

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Where Rondo of Ruin
are launched, I presume.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
It actually worked!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Wait, that wasn't a sure thing?

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Give me a break,

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
it's hardly been a
predictable battle.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] We'll have
to destroy the next one.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
Waste of time. I say we
just blow the whole place!

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
But if we do that, we'll lose
our one way back to Lingalind!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] If I study the Rakuho
system, given enough time,

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
I should be able to get us home.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
So no need to hold back then!

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Right!

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess we're
in God's realm.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Which means you're
finally, truly beyond the wall.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
And Lingalind is
one of those spheres?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yes. It's this one
here. Our whole world.

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
And that is the holy land.

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
If we break the wall
and go inside,

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
we'll find God waiting for us.

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
It's about time
that we met the guy.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We'll try and negotiate.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
And if not, then we beat him!

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
Let's not forget we have to
make our way inside it first.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
I'll take care of that. [yells]

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
What now?

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
A person?

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
His face!

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
Begone. People from a Lind

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
do not belong anywhere
near this place.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Keep your altered convictions
and egos out of God's realm.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Would ya look at that.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:01.529 position:50% align:center
So the final enemy is me, huh?
