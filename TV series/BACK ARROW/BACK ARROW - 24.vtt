The only one who escaped
infection was a newborn boy.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
To protect the newborn,
they created the "Lind" system

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
that we live within. Gambling on
the slim hope that he's rescued,

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
the Linds prevent his growth.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
However, it takes an enormous
amount of conviction

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
to sustain a life on that scale.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Yeah! I'll take
care of your God for you.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
Lingalind doesn't
deserve destruction!

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
So leave them alone!

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN] That's impossible.
You cannot perceive God,

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
let alone understand him,
or look after him.

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
No! If anyone can, it's Arrow!

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
He's the best helper
in the whole world!

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN]
Helper? You have no proof.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
Just look! It's right
in front of you!

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
The fact we're here, speaking
to you is proof enough!

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
Well it better be!

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
Some country kids from Edger
are fighting God's final guard!

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
We'd never have gotten
this far without Arrow's help!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] That's why we know
he can take the baby home, too.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
You guys...

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN]
This is nonsense.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Malignant life
must be eliminated.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
It's no use talking!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
Let's finish this, Arrow!

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
Guess there's no choice.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Ren!

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Prepare yourself!

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
Saberblow!

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN yells]

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN]
Eliminate.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Take this!
Bright Heaven Beaheader!

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN] Malignant life
must be eliminated.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
How is he still kicking?

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
C'mon, trust me!
You can believe in us!

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
[GUARDIAN gasps]
It cannot be...

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
What? You're really
permitting this? Why?

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
What happened?

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] He's just another part
for managing the system,

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
technically. I guess he's
not needed anymore,

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
so he was done away with.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW] Then does that mean
they'll go along with my plan?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
So, then, what? What now?

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
We happily accept
this invitation

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
to go inside, Admiral.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
[gasping, screaming]

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
What? Where are we?
Where's Reppu?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
I don't know. My best
guess is our Briheights

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
disappeared because they
aren't needed at this point.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
But we need clothes?

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
The system thinks
it helps identify us,

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
so we got to keep them.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
Interesting. This architecture
looks very human.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
I think God's realm adapts
to ease our understanding.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
It's like the scene
we were shown earlier.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
Which would make this...

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
It's space, no doubt about it!

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL]
Whoa! What's that?!

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
[BABY A grunts]

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
The baby?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
It looks so normal!

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] Yeah, except
it's massive and glowing!

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
What is all this?

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU]
It can't be... Can it?

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
Shu! Are you seeing this?

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It turns out this
baby has been sleeping

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
for the past 2,000
years, at least!

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
Two-thousand years?

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] That's a long time
to keep protecting him.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
What is this boy, some kind
of prince or something?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
It's anyone's guess, really!
Perhaps he's just a survivor!

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
We'll find out when
we go to his world.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] I imagine this
is where he's from?

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
What would you
like to do, Arrow?

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
What else is there to do?

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
The kid put his faith
in us, didn't he?

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Then we gotta bring him
where he belongs!

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
Agreed! And maybe
if we're lucky,

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
we'll meet whoever created
this crazy system along the way!

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy. There he goes again.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Nothing can stop Shu
now that he's like this.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone.
The best of luck!

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
Sorry for leaving you behind.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
Being in charge of restoring
Lingalind isn't gonna be easy.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.387 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN] Turns out going to
the ends of space is gonna be

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
a little harder
than we thought.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
And who knows
when we'll return?

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
Don't wantcha waiting for us!

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
Take care of everyone,
kay? Till we get back.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Just leave it to us!

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
Sailing a sea of stars to
return a child to his home.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
Arrow, I never knew you were
such a romantic deep down.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
Well, if I am,

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
it's only 'cus all of
you guys made me that way.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Okay! I've
successfully canceled

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
the Linds' world
destruction system.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:13.083 position:50% align:center
Now our preparations
are complete.

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
Not only did you revise
the conviction cycle

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
in a single month of work,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
but you somehow found
the time to develop

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:20.799 position:50% align:center
an interstellar
warp system, too.

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
My, my, what a
fearsome man you are.

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:27.514 position:50% align:center
I'm so lost! What did he say?
What do all these words mean?

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.974 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:33.103 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Shu. I'll keep our
promise and make Lingalind

00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:35.939 position:50% align:center
a peaceful, thriving land,
with all kinds of people.

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
So don't bother worrying about
us, focus on your voyage.

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:40.402 position:50% align:center
You've got it.

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.821 position:50% align:center
And hey, Ren?
Take care of Kai for me.

00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:45.949 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you really asking
me to do you a favor?

00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:48.368 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Maybe I am!

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:49.494 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:52.247 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's time to
head out, everyone!

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:33.913 position:50% align:center
Initializing warp sequence.
Destination: God's home planet!

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:37.459 position:50% align:center
It's the third planet of
the Solar System... Earth!

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:38.918 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's go!

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.879 position:50% align:center
The next wall we're
busting through

00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:44.299 position:50% align:center
is space, the sea of stars!
