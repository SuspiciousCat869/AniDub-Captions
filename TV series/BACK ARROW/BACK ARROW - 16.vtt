[NARRATOR] The riots that
have inundated Lutoh

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
were orchestrated
by Supreme Rudolf.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
And to protect
the Edger villagers,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
Doctor Sola sacrificed his life.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
Just when Fine was to be killed,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
Atlee's quick
thinking saved her.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
She declared the dreadnought

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
an independent nation
and granted her asylum.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
Since then,
two months have passed.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
[TOM]
Meat!

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
Hey, there been
any Rakuho news?

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] No, still none
predicted to fall.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.437 position:50% align:center
That's two months
without one now.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.355 position:50% align:center
It's unprecedented.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
Would've thought you'd
have some explanation,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
but guess it's a mystery.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
I bet Rekka feels defenseless.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
If they can't replace
their Warpers,

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:35.780 position:50% align:center
they'll remain at
lessened strength.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ]
Sorry to interrupt.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
An official letter from
Lutoh just arrived.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.037 position:50% align:center
Sovereign Peath has finally
decided to cooperate.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
He's agreed to attend
the signing ceremony.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it! That makes
both Rekka and Lutoh now.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
We'll officially be
an independent nation!

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
Direct your gratitude
towards Fine and I.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
We're the ones who
handled the negotiations,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
and none of this would have
happened without them.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, we're well aware.
Thank you.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
Hey. I'd like to thank
you guys, as well.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
You helped me realize that
if I keep moving forward,

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
new doors and paths
will open for me.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
This is the first step
in finding my new life.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:15.779 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD]
Sorry for the wait.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
I present Granedger United's
Queen... Atlee Ariel.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
[CROWD gasping, applauding]

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center

It's my ceremony dress.

[FINE FORTÉ]
Oh, it looks lovely on you!

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
You think?

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
It feels weird. Am I really
the right person for this?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
[FINE FORTÉ]
You are.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
Be confident! This whole nation
started because of you.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
We're just aboard a ship
instead of on land!

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
We're an independent
nation on the Granedger!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
Ugh. That's ridiculous!

--[ringing]
--Huh? Yes?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
What an intriguing development,

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you say, Peath?
Leave the girl be and withdraw.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
Yes. Fall back everyone!

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
Peath! Why?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Because Supreme Rudolph
ordered it! I can't argue!

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
Is it time for something fun?

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
[RUDOLF CONDUCTORE]
Indeed, it is.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
We now have the
Republic of Rekka,

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
the Supremacy of Lutoh,
and the Granedger.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
The more powers there are,
the more seeds of war.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
Go, spread war in the lands.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
For that is god's will.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN] What do we do now?
We've left Lutoh.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
[BIT NAMITAL] We can raise
livestock and farm right here!

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yes, we have precise
control over the water

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
and climate. So the
crops will grow well.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Well, Grandpa?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN]
Don't worry.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
We know better now than
to rely on other people.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
That got us nowhere before.
We've made up our mind.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
From now on,
this is our village.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center

quite. This is our country.

By the way, don't we have to
pick someone to like, lead us?

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
If Granedger's a country,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
we need a ruler of
some kind, right?

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
Welp, if no one else
is up for it--

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center

I'm busy enough steering
Granedger as it is.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
Don't want to
overload the ruler.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50% align:center
They'll have enough
responsibilities on their hands.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
Then how about Fine?

She's got the resume
for this kinda thing.

It wouldn't feel right. You guys
risked your lives for this ship.

You can save your breath.
I refuse any role

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center

Good idea!

I've told you before,
you're always the first to act.

yours that drives us, in a way.

[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Who's "we"?
You mean the villagers?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
Not only them.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What the--
The Armored Division?

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is correct.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
As of today, we have
joined Granedger United.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
No. You're kidding.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
You're all defecting?
You'd abandon Lutoh?

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
We are the Prax
Armored Division.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
We belong with our commander,
it's in our name.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
[PEATH GLINHOUSE] Don't you care
what happens to Lutoh at all?

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
You traitors!

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Traitors? Compared to
your previous misdeeds

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
towards Lady Fine,
this is patriotic.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
[GOTE laughs] We actually
declared independence

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
from Lord Walston, too.
Right. Mr. President?

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to you guys.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't have the power
to fight back without you.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Y'mean your Briheights?

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
No, no. Heart. Arrow taught us
to believe in ourselves,

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
and to believe we can
accomplish our goals, too.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
I have to say, you guys
have really matured!

00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
'Course we have!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
My brother represents
the Pretty Boys now,

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
so he kinda had to!

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
We're looking forward to
working with all of you!

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
[BRUH]
Yeah!

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Look over there! Is that
the infamous new Queen?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Yes! She came from nothing,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
but ended up defeating Rekka!

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] She's like a paragon
of hope for us all.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Just listen to these idiots
fawning over her.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
Yeah, tell me about it.
Look at how fancy they dress

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
and act now. They're nothing
like they were in back in Edger.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
[PRAX CONRAD] Fritz was able
to get his hands on it.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
Obviously without Peath
or anyone finding out.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Thanks for this.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
Until things settle down more,
I'd like us to be prepared.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Careful.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I won't
let it happen anymore.

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
Conviction shatters mountains!

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
Train with the ferocity
to destroy a Briheight

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
with your bare hands!

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[REKKA SOLDIERS]
Sir!

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA] We shall prevail,
even without Briheights!

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
Even if most of us die!

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Rekka shall
conquer the whole world!

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
[REKKA SOLDIERS screaming]

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
Not enough! You'll need
to do more than that.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
You can't beat a Briheight till
you crush a boulder to dust!

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
Sir!

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
General Bai.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's a
little early to be drinking?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA]
Pour me one, too.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
--[REN SIN] Huh?
--[BAI TOATSU] Uh?

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA]
Today's training is over.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU] Goh, you've
gotta realize something.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
No matter how hard you train,

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
no one but Emperor Zetsu
can beat Briheight

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
with their bare hands.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA sighs] Yeah,
I know, but we have to try.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
Look at 'em.

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
It's like every soldier we've
got has lost all heart.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Probably because they have.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Granedger
and Back Arrow

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
breaking most of our Warpers,
Rekka's no longer the strongest.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
I doubt anyone here
is happy about that.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
I only wish to rekindle
their confidence,

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
but it's not easy. You know?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
No one knows what to do.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
Even the officials are panicking
about all the power we lost.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
By the way, where's Kai?

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] I'm sure he's
still in the library.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
The library?

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] I know. But he
believes that if we can learn

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
the truth about
conviction particles,

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
then we can restore Rekka,
with or without Briheights.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
[BAI TOATSU]
He's reading the texts.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
[GOH ZANGA]
That's such an arduous task.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
"One who comes from beyond,

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
Wait, perhaps it's speaking
of Edger village?

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
And then we have:
"When the newcomer reaches

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
self-realization, the world
will be"... flattened?

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
No, destroyed?

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
I knew Arrow was.
Oh, hold on, there's more!

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
Yo! It's been a hot minute,
how you guys doin'?

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
How dare you come, Shu!

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
Just the welcome I expected.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
Stand down! These men are
ambassadors of Granedger!

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
You will not bring harm to them.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
Ambassadors? This traitor, Shu?

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
Such a dishonor.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
Has our beloved Rekka truly
fallen this far from grace?

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU] Sir Shu. I'm glad
to see that you're doing well.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
And it's a pleasure to
finally meet you, Sir Arrow.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
I am Rekka's Prime Minister,
Kyo Meiketsu.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
You are? What about Tae?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
He up and abandoned the nation.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
Clutching his fortune
all the while.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
It's my money, not yours!
Damn that Zetsu!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
You won't get a morsel
of my fortune!

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
I don't care how you
fund your stupid army!

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Just find a way
to do it yourself!

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
Uh, where to, my lord?

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
To Lutoh!
I'm leaving this place.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
And as a result, I'm stuck
being prime minister

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
in his place. Come, this way.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA]
We've arrived.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
That seemed quick.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
Hm? Hold on, I know this place,
it's Rekka's execution grounds!

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
after my fortunes, too!

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
I won't be executing you.
Quite the opposite.

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.986 position:50% align:center
The Supreme Elect
sends a message.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.656 position:50% align:center
The Supreme Elect? You mean
that guy from Lutoh?

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
[DISSONANZA] He says, "The
Republic of Rekka is all yours."

[KYO MEIKETSU]
I know we've exchanged letters,

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
but I'd like to hear your
request in person, if you would.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
Granedger United wishes to be
granted a section of territory.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
Specifically, an area in the far
north of Rekka's vast land.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
Need I say more?
You've read the details.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
What does Rekka get out of this?

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
It's simple.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
The assurance that we
will not attack you.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
[KYO MEIKETSU]
I see.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] I believe that's a
fair trade in your current--

[SHU BI gasps]

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
I see you've been
training, Ren.

--as full of yourself as ever!
--[SHU BI] Me?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] You're not here
to negotiate at all!

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
Do you think just because
Rekka lost the war,

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
you can come here
and intimidate us?

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
You're trying to
mask it in formalities,

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
but this is far from diplomacy!

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
Stop Ren, like it or not,
the man is an ambassador.

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Yes, but more importantly
he's a traitor!

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] And more importantly
than that, an utter genius.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
Even with a knife at your throat
you think you're tough?

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
Rekka still hasn't
lost its fangs!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
We'd rather die
than live in shame!

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
That's the Rekkan way!

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] You'll die
if it means I will, too?

[REN SIN] If you don't
want it to come to that,

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
retract your proposal!

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center

Hold up!

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.439 position:50% align:center
Not another step,
unless you want

his blood splattered
on you, Back Arrow!

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
I can slice his throat
much faster

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
than you can hope to manifest.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
[BACK ARROW]
I'm aware.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
But don't you think
he's too smart

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
to not anticipate
something like this?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
C'mon don't be like that.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
Shu knows how much you
hate him, he isn't stupid.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center

it says "but a new,"
