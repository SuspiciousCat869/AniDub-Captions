00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Lingalind...
a world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
protecting, nurturing,
sustaining.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.715 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Lingalind is largely
divided into two nations.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
One that takes pride
in intelligence:

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
the Supremacy of Lutoh.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
And another one that
honors valor above all:

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
the Republic of Rekka.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
On that fated day, what one
could call an omen occurred.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
This omen was observed
by Rekka's High Diviner,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.742 position:50% align:center
known as Shu Bi.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI laughs]

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Sir Shu Bi,
I think this Rakuho is...

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
Yeah. It's the sign of the Hori.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
And it's predicted to fall...

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN]
East of Gentosho,

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.880 position:50% align:center
not far from the border
of Lutoh, I believe.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.715 position:50% align:center
That's right.
Would you ask the throne

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.176 position:50% align:center
to send soldiers to
retrieve it for me, Ren?

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] No need!
Gotta hand it to you Shu,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
your prediction was
spot on this time.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] You're already
on the move, General Kai?

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.602 position:50% align:center
Impressive as always.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.104 position:50% align:center
Of course I am.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
If I don't uphold my vows
and retrieve it, no one will!

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's the sign of
the Hori! That means this

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
Rakuho's got the best possible
treasure inside, right?

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
The Rakuho's officially
within our borders!

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] I know!
Let's step on it, guys!

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] Whoa!
Look at all the Bind Warpers!

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B] This haul is
gonna make fighting Lutoh

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
a whole lot easier.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
Nice work, Shu Bi.
Load 'em up, everyone!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
His Majesty will
be pleased with--

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A]
I take it you goons

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
are from the Republic of Rekka?

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B]
A Briheight!

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
How'd Lutoh get here so quick?

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN growls]

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A]
Lutoh will be taking possession

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
of that Rakuho. Stand down.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A laughing]

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] I'll dispatch
reinforcements immediately--

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] He's fine. Try to
have some faith in Kai.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
You guys are to
guard the Rakuho!

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Bring me a Bind Warper!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
What kind of savage are you?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
Men introduce themselves
before a fight!

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
But if you need someone
to teach you manners,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly accept.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.337 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A]
Oh, yeah?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] I'm the Republic
of Rekka's invincible general,

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
Kai Rhodan!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
Now, behold as I
manifest my conviction.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
For you won't see it again!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
[BIND WARPER]
Manifest Armor.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A grunting]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER B] We got
ourselves a Briheight battle!

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
My conviction is: Unrivaled!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] As colossal as
the wall guarding our world!

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
As immovable as a boulder!

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
[BIND WARPER]
Manifest Armor.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Relying on numbers, are we?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A] We're only
after the Rakuho. Hand it over.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] Heh. Every last
one of you looks the same!

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Briheight are the physical
embodiment of one's conviction!

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
I guess that means
your conviction

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
is mass-produced blind
faith, doesn't it?

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
You don't deserve to lay
your hands on Rakuho! Come!

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A]
You underestimate

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
the power of numbers!

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN] It's basic
warrior's etiquette to take

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
the first hit. Those afraid to
die don't belong in a Briheight!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
It shows you're prepared
to lay it all on the line.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
As a warrior should!
In other words...

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIERS groaning]

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
No second chances!

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
Face the power of
my Gigan and begone!

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIERS groan]

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
[LUTOH SOLDIER A]
I don't wanna die!

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought!
There's another Rakuho falling!

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
But that's impossible,

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
they're only supposed
to fall once a month!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN grunts]
Where?

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
The remote south. Iki.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
[KAI RHODAN]
Iki? The abandoned lands?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] Yep. The place
isn't much use to anyone.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
But since it's not
our territory,

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
sending troops
would be trouble.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Come on home, General Kai.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
[growls] All right, fine.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI]
I, on the other hand, can go.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
You'll upset His Majesty again.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
This is more than just
a second Rakuho.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a
sign like that--

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
All the more reason to get
permission before you go!

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
This is unprecedented!

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
I'd never make it in time!
I can just set the precedent.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS chattering]

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
Okay, where'd you go?
There it is!

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN] Hey, Bit!
Think you can handle it?

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me! I've got this!

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[BEAST A screeches]

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center

Help! Help, help, help!

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
[ELSHA LEAN]
Sheesh!

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
[BEAST A grunts]

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
Did you get it, Elsha?

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
At that distance,
it's child's play!

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
Good grief, Bit. Could you stop
being afraid of everything

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.295 position:50% align:center
that moves already?
It's getting old.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
I wasn't scared,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
I just didn't expect it
to run at me like that!

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Is that
what happened

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
when you chickened out of
your "coming of age" test?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
Shut up, will ya?

Atlee!

Hey, Atlee!
Let's play chopscotch!

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
[ATLEE ARIEL]
It's hopscotch.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
No, that's different!

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
You can be the chopper!

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
You just gotta split this
in half with your head!

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
Uh? With my head?

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Here we go!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
Uh, no thanks. This game
of yours is kinda weird.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
[ANNIE]
Whoa!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center

You saved me, Atlee!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
You need to learn that me
catching you isn't a game.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
I've told you that before!

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center

I know, sorry, sorry!

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center

what I got! Sweet, right?

Meat, too!

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't pretend like you're
the one who shot the thing.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.410 position:50% align:center
Welcome back. Good work
out there today, Chief.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN]
Not good enough.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
All that work and we
could only bring back

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
one measly hornhare.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
I guess that's true.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
It sounds like it's rougher
than usual this year.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
[JIM]
Really? Our meal is just this?

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
[ANNIE]
What gives?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Sorry, guys.
If I'd only gotten serious,

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
I could have brought back at
least two of them for you.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
Again, you didn't even
get the one we do have.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
I helped!

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
Putting on a tough guy act
doesn't make us any less hungry.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
I am tough.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Hey, one's better

You tell 'em, Atlee.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
[SHU BI] What made you want
to come with me, Ren?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
[REN SIN] Well, mostly
because it's my duty

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
to assist and protect
the Head Diviner.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.789 position:50% align:center
But also because you'll get
there sooner if I tag along.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? You're not wrong,

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
but we still won't be
there for when it lands.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center

What is this thing?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.117 position:50% align:center
[SOLA ATHIN]
Could it be a Rakuho?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
[BURK LEAN] A Rakuho? As in
a treasure from the heavens?

[SOLA ATHIN] I've only ever
seen one, so I'm no expert,

Hey! I bet it's lotsa food!
I think I see some inside!

Yeah! Like the stuff
that Bit brings back!

[ELSHA LEAN]
Dr. Sola?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he's talking about
the preserved food we get

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
from the trade point? In a way,
that is sort of a treasure.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
Oh! Like that stew in those
pouches we have sometimes?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I getcha! Then there's a bunch
of delicious food inside?

Yeah. Edger Village.

Yep.

Hey-yo, Chief!
Can we open it or what?

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
Sure, once you make sure it's
cooked all the way through--

Yeah, I'm sure
it's done by now!

Woo! Let's crack
it open and eat!

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center

Maybe a festival?

Most likely.

We're out in the sticks,

from the sky, remember?
