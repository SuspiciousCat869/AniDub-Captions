[NARRATION] Lingalind...
A world surrounded by a wall.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
The wall enshrouds the land,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:24.066 position:50% align:center

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.943 position:50% align:center
The wall is god.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:31.490 position:50% align:center
It is at the very center
of life in Lingalind.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
On that fated day,
a man fell from the sky

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
at the remote village
of Edger in Iki.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:42.209 position:50% align:center
His name: Back Arrow.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.628 position:50% align:center
This man, lacking his memories,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
left on a journey to
go beyond the wall.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:51.802 position:50% align:center
With him, he took the Granedger,
with the Edger villagers in tow.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
After overcoming many trials,
the Supremacy of Lutoh,

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.808 position:50% align:center
one of the two great
powers within Lingalind,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.645 position:50% align:center
invited the villagers into
their borders with open arms.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.856 position:50% align:center
However, Lutoh's Princess Fine

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
had been hiding
an alter ego for years.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
This other personality
pushed for war

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
with the second great nation,
the Republic of Rekka.

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.827 position:50% align:center
Then, Arrow and the
others met with Lutoh's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.873 position:50% align:center
Supreme Elect Rudolf and
found out Fine's other self

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
was caused by his
transfused blood.

deep within her,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
Fine confronted her alter ego,

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
sealed away the bloodthirsty
lunatic in a Bind Warper,

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
and formed an alliance
with Elsha

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.851 position:50% align:center

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
The Republic of Rekka,
against the Supremacy of Lutoh.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.985 position:50% align:center

the history of Lingalind

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.737 position:50% align:center

The hell's gotten into him?

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.196 position:50% align:center
Lutoh's princess called him
a geezer, as I understand it.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.197 position:50% align:center
Wait, she did what?

It's all my fault for not being

I think we've kept
it a secret long enough.

covered up my cruel behavior

for so long, and I've
never felt good about it.
