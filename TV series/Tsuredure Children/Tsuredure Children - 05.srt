00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,125
[KANDA] Today's the day.
I'm finally going to do it.

2
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:15,166
I am going to tell him
I like him. By text.

3
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,541
"Hey there, Takase.

4
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,416
I know I'm being a wuss
for saying this in a text,

5
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,166
but I keep freaking out
and getting tongue-tied

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,375
whenever I try to
tell you in person.

7
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,583
So here goes nothing.

8
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,541
I like you."

9
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,625
[whines]

10
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,583
[KANDA]
I can't.

11
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,375
[TAKASE]
Kanda's texting me.

12
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
Crap. What do I say?

13
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,333
[TAKASE]
"I just dropped a big one."

14
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,875
Wait, no. I can't say
that. She's a girl.

15
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:59,208
[KANDA] I'm so nervous.
I can't mess this up.

16
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,708
Stay calm, Kanda.
Don't rush. Just go in order.

17
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,000
"It's not a big deal,

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,208
but you seem surprisingly
popular with girls,

19
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,166
but you don't have a girlfriend.

20
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,708
Why's that? Are you gay?"

21
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,333
[TAKASE]
"I'm not popular! I'm not gay!

22
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,875
I want a girlfriend!"

23
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:21,458
Yes! Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes!

24
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,541
[KANDA] "Oh, yeah?
You want a girlfriend, huh?

25
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,458
I want a boyfriend, too!"

26
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,791
[TAKASE'S BROTHER]
Mind if I play some video games?

27
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,166
[KANDA'S MOM]
Sweetheart, want some peaches?

28
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,583
[KANDA]
No thanks!

29
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,791
[TAKASE]
"Why don't you find a boyfriend?

30
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,541
Aren't you interested
in anyone?"

31
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,291
Actually, yes!

32
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,166
[TAKASE]
She stopped replying.

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,541
Was that a bad thing to ask?

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,666
[KANDA]
I should just tell him

35
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,500
I have feelings
for him right now.

36
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,208
But confessing by text? Uh!

37
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,375
But if not now, when
am I gonna do it?

38
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,916
Oh, but what if he doesn't
feel the same way?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,458
Dammit!

40
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,000
Tell him! Tell him! Tell him!
Tell him! Tell him already!

41
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,541
[TAKASE] She's been droppin'
some pretty clear hints.

42
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,583
Is it safe for me
to just tell her?

43
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,916
No. I can't do that in a text.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Can I?

45
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,541
[squeals]

46
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,375
[KANDA]
"Someone I'm interested in?

47
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,833
I'm interested in you, Takase.

48
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,833
Sorry to tell you like
this, but I like you.

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
Please go out with me."

50
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,916
Even if it's "no,"
just please don't hate me.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Even if it's "no,"
just please don't hate me!

52
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,250
[TAKASE]
Can I text her that I like her?

53
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,125
Can I text her that I like her?

54
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,750
This is going well,
but one wrong move.

55
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,666
"Are you asleep? Passed out?

56
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,000
About what we were saying, there
is actually someone I like.

57
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:53,083
I like you, Kanda.
Please be my girlfriend."

[phone buzzes]

60
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,750
[KANDA]
A reply? That was quick.

61
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,791
Maybe he sent me something
at the same time.

62
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,791
[KANDA]
"Are you asleep? Passed out?

63

About what we were saying,
there is actually...

64
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,208
[KANDA, TAKASE]
"...someone I like.

65
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,166
I'll tell you at
school tomorrow."

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,166
[TAKASE] "Can you wait
for me after school?

67
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,875
You know those people
who confess by text?

68
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,416
I think that's pretty lame.

69
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,833
Where did that even come from,
right? Okay, good night!"

70
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,000
I think that's pretty lame.

71
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:36,416
I think that's pretty lame.
I think that's pretty lame.

[TAKASE'S BROTHER]
Takase, I'm gonna go to sleep,

73
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,875
so turn off-- Takase?

74
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,916
[KANDA'S MOM] Honey, I need
to wash the peach bowl.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,791
Kanda? Are you asleep?

76
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,750
[KAGA] Don't mind my
childhood friend, Nanase.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
She always looks like
she's in a bad mood.

78
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,625
[NANASE]
I look just fine, thank you.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
[SASAHARA]
Great job, Kaga!

80
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,541
You went and found Astronomy
Club a really cute new member!

81
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,875
[KAGA]
I didn't really do any--

82
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,500
That's our future
club president!

83
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,625
Your shoulders must hurt
after all that hard work.

84
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,875
That's okay, Sasahara.
I don't need a back rub.

85
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,166
Let me be clear.

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,666
I'm only here because
I'm interested in stars.

87
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,583
It's not because
Kaga invited me.

88
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,500
[SASAHARA] Really? The two
of you seem to close.

89
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,958
I totally thought
you were dating.

90
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,291
[KAGA]
Well, we aren't!

91
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
Nanase and I happen to be
neighbors, that's all.

92
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,333
Why do people always
assume we're a couple?

93
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,541
We've been friends since we
were kids. It's not like that.

94
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,791
And it's not like
that for me, either.

95
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,166
Besides, Kaga over there

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,791
seems to have a crush
on somebody else.

97
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,750
Really? Kaga's got a crush?

98
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,791
[KAGA]
What? Of course I don't!

99
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,875
Are you sure? Because
it seems pretty obvious.

100
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,958
Should I say it out loud?

101
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,250
[CLASSMATE A] Sasahara!
Mr. Sakamoto is looking for you.

102
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,833
[SASAHARA]
Aww.

103
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,916
And just when it was
getting good, too.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,083
Be right back, and we'll
pick up where we left off.

105
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,416
[KAGA sighs]

106
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,083
[NANASE] She's the one
you like, isn't she?

107
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,375
I mean, there's no way you'd
ever be interested in stars.

108
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,833
So it's gotta be Sasahara.

109
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,458
I'm not interested in her!

110
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,083
Not that that's really
your business.

111
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,833
Why are you pushing
this, Nanase?

112
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,708
Because I want her
to break your heart.

113
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,750
[gasps]

114
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,250
Why would you want that?
What'd I do to you?

115
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,125
You've been ignoring me
since middle school.

116
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,708
We've hardly spoken.

117
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,750
'Cause you thought
people might tease you.

118
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,500
Would you have wanted
everybody to comment

119
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,250
about us being
"joined at the hip"?

120
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,375
You really don't like it

121
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,208
when people think
we're close, do you?

122
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,583
What? Of course I don't!

123
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,916
Oh, so you admit it?

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,916
You don't want there
to be rumors about us.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,958
What's your problem?

126
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,583
Anything I did,
I did for your sake.

127
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,333
What do you mean, "for my sake"?

128
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,041
You just suddenly
started ignoring me.

129
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,416
Yeah, well, so did you.

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
You always act like you hate me.

131
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,000
I only did because you did.
You hated me first.

132
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,791
Who cares either way? We still
both totally hate each other.

133
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,750
If I hated you, why would I
go to the same high school?!

134
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,375
Uh.

135
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,583
I don't have any idea what
you're talking about.

136
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,500
Dammit, Kaga, how dumb are you?

137
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,125
You didn't seem to have a
problem talking to other people,

138
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,500
yet you choose to ignore me.

139
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,041
That's not true, Nanase.

140
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,166
But it was okay.

141
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,708
You were indifferent
to everyone,

142
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,916
so I was certain you'd never
be interested in anyone else.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
"Interested'? What
are you getting at?

144
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,333
Why her? Why'd you
fall for Sasahara?

145
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,791
[KAGA]
Oh.

146
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,833
All right. I'm sorry.
I was dumb.

147
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,833
I never considered
how you might feel.

148
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:37,250
You've cared about me all
this time, haven't you?

149
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,000
And you're worried about me,

150
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,875
like any friend would be.

151
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,250
"Like any friend would be"?
You really don't have a clue!

152
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,791
Uh! I don't?

153
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,208
Do you honestly think I'd do
all this 'cause we're friends?

154
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,708
But you just said
you don't hate me.

155
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,208
I totally hate you!

156
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,583
So-So then you do hate me?

157
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,750
Then why did you join
the Astronomy Club?

158
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,250
To piss me off?

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,125
[SASAHARA]
I'm back!

160
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,166
So who's this girl
Kaga's got a crush--?

161
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,916
[SASAHARA]
My bad.

162
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,166
[KAMINE] I confessed my
feelings to my crush,

163
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,958
and now we're dating.

164
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:26,500
But since then, things have
been... a bit awkward.

165
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,750
Hey, Goda. Wanna
walk home with me?

166
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,958
I can't. I have
practice today. Sorry.

167
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,833
[KAMINE] Maybe he and I
should've just stayed friends.

168
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,083
Then again, we haven't
been dating very long.

169
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,583
I probably just need
to take the initiative.

170
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,666
Something wrong, Kamine?
Why are you still here?

171
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,750
[KAMINE]
I didn't mean to surprise you.

172
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,833
I had stuff to do,
so I thought I'd wait.

173
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,791
Oh. Sorry you had to
wait here so long.

174
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,875
Oh, I always stay late
doing club work.

175
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,583
We should walk home
together more often.

176
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,875
Bad idea. It's not
safe this late.

177
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,208
I think it's safe enough.

178
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,083
After all, you're
walking with me.

179
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,708
Part way. Just
until my bus stop.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,583
[KAMINE] Maybe he never
wanted to go out with me

181
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,083
in the first place.

182
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,666
What if I'm only making
him uncomfortable?

183
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,833
No. Goda's always been
a nice, caring person.

184
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,125
He's just looking out for me.

185
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,166
[KAMINE] Wait. Did he
just move away from me?

186
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,125
He did, didn't he?

187
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,416
Maybe he's worried because
he's still sweaty from practice.

188
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,541
Is that it? That has to be it.

189
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,500
He couldn't have been
avoiding me, right?

190
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,291
Kamine. I think we need
to stop doing this.

191
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,958
[GODA]
Sorry.

192
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,958
I probably should've
said something earlier.

193
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,041
But I've never dated
anyone before.

194
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,333
I wasn't sure what it was
supposed to be like.

195
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,208
Even so, the more I think
about it, the more I realize:

196
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,791
This isn't good.

197
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,416
So I want to make things easy
for you before things get worse.

198
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,250
[crying]

199
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,333
--[KAMINE] All right.

200
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
--Forgive me.
--[KAMINE] All right.

201
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,208
I know this really
isn't the best way

202
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,541
to do this kind of thing.

203
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,708
[KAMINE] No. I appreciate
you saying something.

204
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you for going out with me.

205
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

206
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,041
Please. Don't cry. I didn't
mean to make you cry.

207
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,291
[KAMINE]
I'll be okay.

208
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you think we can go
back to how things were?

209
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,541
I guess we could, but
maybe not exactly the same.

210
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,333
[KAMINE] I know. This is all
my fault. I'm so sorry...

211
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,416
Like what if we tried
holding hands or something?

212
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,333
The way other couples do?

213
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,125
[gasps]

214
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,208
[KAMINE]
Wh-What do you mean?

215
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,166
I'm sorry. Is it too
soon for that?

216
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,333
So you're not going
to break up with me?

217
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,583
[GODA] Break up with you?
When did I say that?

218
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,041
I just meant we shouldn't be
so tense around each other.

219
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,208
After all, we are
in a relationship.

220
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,291
Wait, was I the only
one getting tense?

221
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,791
I thought it was both of us.

222
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,416
I was afraid you might
think it'd be weird

224
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,541
if I started acting like
your boyfriend right away.

225
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,958
And so, I've been
trying hard to act like

226
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,000
everything's how it always was
and that nothing's changed,

227
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,250
but it didn't feel right.

228
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,583
I've been thinking
maybe I should start

229
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,708
walking you home and stuff.

230
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,416
But... then why'd you
avoid me a minute ago?

231
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,458
When I tried to get close?

232
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,708
Sorry.

233
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,666
I'm still kind of
sweaty from practice.

234
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,375
And also I'm really shy.

235
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,083
[NANASE]
I am an idiot. Such an idiot.

236
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,375
[SASAHARA yelps]

237
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,583
Whoops! I didn't see
anything! I'll come back!

238
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,625
But it wasn't me!
It was all Nanase!

239
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,958
[KAGA] I'm awful.
I'm a terrible human being.

240
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,458
[KAGA'S MOM]
Kaga.

241
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,833
Can you take these apples over
to the neighbors, please?

242
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,083
[KAGA] Ugh! No way!
Can't you just do it yourself?

243
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,333
[KAGA'S MOM]
What's gotten into you?

244
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,041
Did you and Nanase have a fight?

245
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,333
We didn't exactly fight,
but she kind of hates me now.

246
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,500
What? I thought Nanase
had a crush on you.

247
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,958
[KAGA grunts]

248
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,375
Uh.

249
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,583
Was that still a secret?
Sorry. Forget I said anything.

250
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,666
Hey.

251
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Hey. It's me.

252
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,916
