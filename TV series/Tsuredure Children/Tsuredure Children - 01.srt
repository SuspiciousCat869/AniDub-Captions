1
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,166
[TAKASE] The girl I like said
she wanted to talk to me.

2
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,333
[TAKASE] She must wanna
confess her feelings.

3
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,708
I couldn't be happier.

4
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,833
[shivering]

5
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,833
[TAKASE] We've been out
here for ten minutes.

6
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,250
Are you scared? Say something.

7
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,125
[TAKASE]
Hey, um--

8
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,583
Please wait!

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,166
[TAKASE gasps]

10
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,625
Do you, uh, do you have a crush
on anyone or anything, Takase?

11
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,166
[TAKASE]
Uh...

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,750
[TAKASE] What's the right
answer in this situation?

13
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,875
Should I be honest with
her and say, "You"?

14
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,083
But then I'd be robbing her
of her chance to confess to me.

15
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,916
Though it's not like
I don't have a crush.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,125
Oh! So you do?

17
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,166
[TAKASE]
Wait. No, I didn't mean that.

18
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,833
Takase, you aren't making sense.

19
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,666
Do you have a crush
or don't you?

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Fine, then I don't have a crush.

21
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,583
[KANDA]
What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,666
It means I don't have
a crush on anyone.

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,666
You really don't?

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,041
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say to me?

25
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:29,916
[KANDA yelps]

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
Not really.

27
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,166
Just what I said. I wanted
to know if you liked anyone.

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,333
'Kay, I told you. So now what?

29
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,958
[TAKASE] So, are you done then?
'Cause I should get going.

30
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,875
[KANDA]
What? No. I'm not done.

31
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,083
There was more.

32
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,916
But I guess I kinda
blew it for today.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,875
All right. Then I'm gonna leave.

34
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,000
[KANDA]
Huh?

35
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,375
[KANDA]
Takase, wait!

36
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:06,291
[KANDA]
Hey, um... Would-Would you...?

37
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,000
[TAKASE]
Yes! Here is comes!

38
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,958
Would you be willing to
meet up again tomorrow?!

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,208
[sighs]

40
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,041
[TAKASE]
Maybe I should just do it.

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,875
I'll tell you tomorrow, okay?

42
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,458
Yeah, sure.

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,166
I'll come back, but first
there's something...

44
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,250
You mean it?
You'll come tomorrow?

45
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,125
Sorry about dragging
you out here today.

46
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,666
I wanted to say something,
but I kinda forgot.

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,333
Yeah, about that...

48
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,583
Come back tomorrow, Takase!

49
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,500
And I'll tell you I like you!

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,958
[TAKASE]
uh...

51
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,625
Okay, bye! See you tomorrow!

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,208
[FURUYA]
Minagawa is the class rep,

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,958
but she doesn't do her job.

54
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,250
[FURUYA] Could you help me out
a little with this, Minagawa?

55
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,291
[MINAGAWA]
Help?

56
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,125
But I'm lazy. You know that.

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,583
Then why on Earth did you
become the class rep?

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,375
Because I like you, Furuya.

59
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,833
Could you please not
mess with me like that?

60
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,125
Hold on. Are you mad?

61
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,291
That wasn't my intent.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.

62
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,291
[FURUYA] It's not like
I'm angry or anything.

63
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,833
Good, 'cause I
really do like you.

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,875
[FURUYA] So is that supposed
to be a confession?

65
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,250
[MINAGAWA]
Yup. Will you go out with me?

66
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,875
[FURUYA]
I-I don't know.

67
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,833
There are rumors you go out
with lots of guys, Minagawa.

68
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,833
So? I'm still a virgin.

69
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,250
[grunts]

70
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,541
Yeah, I have a lotta guy
friends, but we just hang out.

71
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,125
There's nothing like
that going on.

72
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:01,958
Oh, is that all?

73
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,458
Do you think that I'm lying?

74
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,583
Not really. I just think that--

75
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,833
[MINAGAWA]
You think I'm easy

76
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,791
and that I'd just sleep
with anyone, is that it?

77
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,458
No. Well, not exactly.

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,291
Now you're getting horny
just sitting here

79
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,125
thinking about me having sex.

80
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,458
[FURUYA]
No, I'm not!

81
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,666
I knew you were just toying
with me. Cut it out!

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,458
[MINAGAWA]
Ha-ha. Sorry.

83
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,958
But these things are always
kinda awkward, ya know?

84
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,208
That's why I can't tell
if you're serious or not.

85
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,291
Then if I asked you
without any joking around,

86
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,375
what would you say?

87
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,125
[FURUYA]
You mean will I go out with you?

88
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,541
But why me? You could
be with anyone.

89
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,750
I don't even know you that well.

90
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,291
I don't have a clue
who you really like--

91
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,666
You.

92
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,958
What about you? You like me?

93
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,250
Um.

94
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,583
I kinda don't know anything
about dating yet,

95
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,875
but if you want, we could,
maybe, I dunno... Hm?

96
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,166
[giggles]

97
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
[grunting]

98
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,333
What are you smiling about?!

99
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,125
Oh, Furuya, you really
are too adorable.

100
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,541
That's it. We're done here.

101
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,375
Done? But you still haven't
given me an answer.

102
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,625
No matter what I say,

103
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,041
you're just gonna laugh
at me more, aren't you?

104
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,250
[MINAGAWA]
Mh-hm.

105
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,875
Uh-oh. You're mad.
Did I make you hate me?

106
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,166
Well, I definitely hate
how cheeky you are.

107
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,666
Then reject me and
get it over with.

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,708
Can we just not talk
about this right now?

109
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,750
So you don't totally hate me!

110
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,541
Maybe I do now!

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,875
[KAJI] The student council
president caught me smoking.

112
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,250
Dammit.

113
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,625
[AKAGI] You know
that's not good for you.

114
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,541
Oh, great! You're gonna
rat me out, aren't you?

115
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,583
Relax. I'm not a total monster.

116
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,708
Just this once, I'm
willing to let it slide.

117
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
Thanks. I appreciate
you being cool.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,708
That is, I will if you kiss me.

119
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,416
[KAJI]
Huh?

120
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,666
Is that a joke?

121
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,125
[AKAGI]
I'm totally serious.

122
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,625
In fact, it has to
do with something

123
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
that's been on my mind.

124
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,625
You see, I've never been
in love with a woman.

125
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,166
Ha. Are you gay or somethin'?

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,333
I'm not gay. I tested that.

127
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,958
What? Tested?

128
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,416
I don't understand what's
so fun about dating.

129
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,333
I've had a hard time
finding interest in girls.

130
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,583
And you wanna kiss
someone to try and find out?

131
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,166
Sure, why not? Sounds fun.

132
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,708
Since you don't know how to kiss
a girl, I'll be your teacher.

133
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,875
No. When it comes to
kissing, I know how.

134
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,625
Oh, sorry.

135
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,500
You're surprisingly cooperative.

136
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,500
Well, yeah. It's not like
it's my first time.

137
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,083
I'll lock lips with
anyone for the right price.

138
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,208
[AKAGI] Really? What do you
charge to go all the way?

139
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,041
[KAJI]
Uh...

140
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,416
A hundred thousand yen?

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Perfect. You take cash?

142
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,541
[KAJI]
You've got that much on you?!

143
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,041
What's wrong? Are you scared?

144
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,416
Hell no! I'm ready to
go whenever you are.

145
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,500
[AKAGI] You've never actually
prostituted yourself, have you?

146
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,458
What? You callin' me a liar?

147
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,583
The going rate,
it isn't 100,000 yen.

148
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,583
If you'd ever really
done it, you'd know.

149
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,458
A hundred thousand is far too
little. Especially for you.

150
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,416
I think you're worth
a lot more than that.

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
Akagi.

152
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,500
[AKAGI] Regardless,
I do still expect that kiss.

153
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,791
[KAJI]
You do?

154
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:13,541
Of course. That was
our agreement, wasn't it?

155
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,583
Unless now you're too scared.

156
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,916
I'm not scared. I'm totally
not scared at all.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,375
Good. Let's go.

158
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,583
Wow. You reek.

159
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,041
You smell like an ashtray.

160
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,791
Shut up! What did you expect?!

161
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,375
[AKAGI]
You should really quit smoking.

162
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,583
Bite me! What are you,
my boyfriend?

163
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,208
Why not? Sounds good to me.

164
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
[AKAGI]
Yes.

165
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,666
I think you are someone that
I could fall in love with.

166
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,750
That is, as long as
you quit smoking.

167
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,333
[KAJI]
Piss off!

168
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,166
[SASAHARA]
This is Yukawa.

169
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,750
He's a third year and
he's graduating tomorrow.

170
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,750
Pretty please. Show me the
stars just one last time.

171
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,875
No. You're way too annoying.

172
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,208
You suck, Yukawa. I was gonna
confess my love for you.

173
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,291
This would be, what,
like the thousandth time?

174
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,041
[chuckles]

175
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,250
Yeah, maybe.

176
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,958
[YUKAWA]
Well, I'm sick of it.

177
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,041
[SASAHARA]
This is a bad habit of mine.

178
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,666
I tell him how I feel,
then pretend it's a joke.

179
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,500
[SASAHARA]
But tonight I want to tell him

180
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,916
I have feelings
for him for real.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,500
First, though, it's important
to set the right mood.

182
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,791
Hey. It's cold.

183
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,916
Would it be okay
if I sat with you?

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,250
[YUKAWA] Whatever.
Just stay out of my way.

185
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,000
[chuckles]

186
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,375
Do you maybe wanna
cuddle a little bit too?

187
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,041
What?

188
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,125
Nothing.

189
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,500
This is our last time
stargazing here.

190
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,791
It is.

191
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,708
This is my last time
stargazing with you, too.

192
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,416
It is.

193
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,541
But, I mean, it
doesn't have to be.

194
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,208
We could always do it
again if we really tried.

195
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,791
[YUKAWA]
Please quit yammering.

196
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,625
Haven't you learned any of
the stars' names by now?

197
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:12,208
Names? I, um, well,
uh... I know Spica.

198
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,208
Spica? But that's the very
first one I taught you.

199
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,250
Of course!

200
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,541
If it's a star that
you showed me,

201
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,208
there's no way
I'd ever forget it.

202
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,291
All right then, point out Spica.

203
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,083
It's, uh, in the...

204
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,541
[sighs]

205
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,958
Get it together, huh?

206
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,333
Come next year, you'll be
the only one in this club.

207
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,208
Don't blame me.
That's all your fault.

208
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,125
You always look like
you're in a bad mood.

209
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,833
Then why'd you join?
Why weren't you scared away?

210
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,833
Me? Well, I joined because
I'm in love with you.

211
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,416
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,125
All the first- and second-years
worship the ground I walk on.

213
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,875
How would... you feel
if I really did?

214
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,041
Like you, I mean.

215
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,666
[SASAHARA]
I did it! I finally did it!

216
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,833
I told Yukawa how I felt about
him without making it a joke!

217
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,833
But what if he's not happy about
it? What's with that look?

218
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,166
Was this a mistake?
Did I blow it?

219
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,750
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

220
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,541
Sasahara.

221
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,083
Ha! Got ya! You thought
I was serious!

222
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,666
[laughing]

223
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,708
[SASAHARA] That's it. I blew it.
I can't ever tell him the truth.

224
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,000
There's no way he
would believe me.

225
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,666
I've said I liked him a million
times over the past two years,

226
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,250
but never that I
really meant it.

227
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,333
Now he's graduating tomorrow,

228
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,541
and I just messed
up my last chance.

229
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,208
[SASAHARA]
I think I'm going to cry.

230
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,125
No. No! I can't cry
in front of him.

231
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,166
He'll worry! It'll be awkward!

232
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,666
I just want him
to smile like when

233
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
he first showed me the stars!

234
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:49,416
Keep it together, Sasahara.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

235
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,541
[SASAHARA]
Don't let him see you cry.

236
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,416
[YUKAWA] I'm sick of
hearing you say you like me.

237
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,916
Yukawa. You're awful.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,125
[YUKAWA] That ends tonight.
No more joking around.

239
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:13,083
I wanna hear you say it.
Just one more time.

240
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,333
If you won't, then I will.

241
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,375
Oh, Yukawa!

242
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,250
I love you! I really do!

243
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,958
[YUKAWA]
Stop crying.

244
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,333
[SASAHARA, KAGA]
