00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:08,750
[KAMINE]
More than once,

2
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,291
my new boyfriend has
made the same comment.

3
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,083
You're easy to get
along with, Kamine.

4
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,333
[KAMINE]
I am?

5
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,916
To be honest, I thought
being in a relationship

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,375
would be a lot more work.

7
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,791
But you aren't
selfish or clingy,

8
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,041
or act like you own me.

9
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,333
I didn't know there
were girls like you.

10
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,166
[KAMINE]
But the truth is, I am selfish.

11
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,208
I wanna be clingy. And I'm much
more jealous than I let on.

12
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,125
It upsets me when I see
him talking to other girls.

13
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,041
And I wanna text him to
see what he's thinking

14
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,708
all day and night.

15
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,458
Just now, I'm aching to grab him
and hold him here on this bench.

16
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,000
But I'm scared if
I said any of that,

17
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,250
he'd be annoyed
and think I'm a pain.

18
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,833
And what about you?

19
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,500
Are you ever jealous
or possessive of me?

20
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,000
No. Or at least not so far.

21
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,458
Which is probably good.

22
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,458
I hear relationships
like that don't last.

23
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,916
Yeah. You're right.
I've heard that, too.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,625
But what about being
a little clingy?

25
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,250
Sure. A little's probably fine.

26
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,666
[KAMINE]
So what's "a little"?

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,958
I dunno. Maybe we could
hold hands when we walk?

28
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,875
[KAMINE] But not when
we're sitting together?

29
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,916
You mean like now?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,208
[KAMINE] No, we don't have
to, if you don't want to.

31
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,000
[GODA]
It's okay. Go ahead.

32
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,291
I'm your boyfriend. You don't
need to be that cautious.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,791
Are you sure?

34
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,583
And if I came a little
closer, would that be okay?

35
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,875
That's fine. You can come
as close as you want to.

36
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,666
What about now? Am I
getting too close for you?

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,041
You're okay.

38
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,166
How 'bout if I lean
on you like this?

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,250
Doesn't bother me. But I might
smell a bit from practice.

40
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,500
No. I like the way you smell.

41
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,333
Are you all right?
What's gotten into you today?

42
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,583
[KAMINE gasps]

43
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,833
Sorry! Do you mind me
being so touchy-feely?

44
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,958
No. I don't mind.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,291
But you said before

46
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,416
that you didn't really
want a clingy girlfriend.

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,833
Actually, this is fine.

48
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,958
And isn't it what most couples
do when they're alone?

49
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,708
Yeah, I guess you're
right. They do.

50
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,916
You see, it's just that,
you didn't seem to want

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,291
to be close or cuddle
or do any of that stuff.

52
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:12,916
[gasps]

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,291
[KAMINE]
Huh?

54
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,583
What? Why'd you say that?

55
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,083
You're always quiet and shy.

56
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,416
I didn't think it would be
something on your mind.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,958
Are you saying
you've been wanting me

58
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,666
to be more cuddly
and clingy with you?

59
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,083
Yeah. A little.

60
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,500
I will then.

61
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,958
I wouldn't have
held back this long

62
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,750
if you'd told me that earlier.

63
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,958
And while we're at it, could
we try something else, too?

64
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,375
[KAMINE]
Sure. What is it?

65
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,583
[KAMINE coughs]

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,666
I just wanted to do that
once. Please forgive me.

67
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,125
[KAMINE]
I coughed on my first kiss.

68
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,750
I coughed on my first kiss!

69
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,750
[KAMINE] It's all right. Just
that was my first kiss ever.

70
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,416
I wasn't really prepared.

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,208
[GODA]
Oh. Sorry.

72
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,916
[KAMINE]
I coughed on my first kiss.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,708
How could I cough
on my first kiss?

74
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,000
Did you want me to try again?

75
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,250
[CHIAKI] I heard a rumor that
this guy, Goda, in my class,

76
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,791
kissed his girlfriend.

77
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,416
And they've only been
together for three months.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,541
Can you believe it?

79
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,750
I sure didn't think
he had it in him.

80
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah. I know. I heard.

81
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
So where are we, Chiaki?

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,958
[CHIAKI clears throat]

83
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,291
Well, about that,

84
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,125
I've actually been meaning
to talk to you, Kana.

85
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,041
The home team's had a
lotta opportunities,

86
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,625
but they still can't
get on the board.

87
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,958
Your thoughts?

88
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,708
The power forward, Chiaki,
keeps chickening out.

89
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,125
He won't take it to the hole.

90
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,708
Ouch! Oh-ho-ho. Aren't you
bein' a bit brutal, coach?

91
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,166
It can't be all on him.

92
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,666
Chiaki's not the only
one on the team.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,416
Somebody's gotta pass him the
rock before he can drive.

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,875
If I passed it to you now,
would you take the shot?

95
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,500
Goda and Kamine alley-ooped
into a slam dunk.

96
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,750
Now?

97
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,333
[KANA] Why not? We've
been dating for a while.

98
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,458
Everyone already thinks
we've at least kissed.

99
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,875
Yeah, but does it really matter
how long we've been together,

100
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,416
or what's been going on
over on another team?

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,875
It's not a competition.
We should focus on our own game.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,583
'Kay. Fine then. Do you want to?

103
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,041
You mean right here?

104
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,250
Well, you said "now."
Thought that's what you wanted.

105
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,666
[KANA] Not if you feel
like I'm forcing you.

106
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,916
You aren't forcing me.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,791
You just keep bugging me
about it all the time.

108
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,541
Forget it. I'm not in the mood.

109
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,291
Wait, are you angry?
I'm so sorry.

110
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,625
Hey, Kana? Please don't be mad.

111
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,791
[CHIAKI]
Crap. Technical foul.

112
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,875
Here comes the silent treatment,
Chiaki. Game over.

113
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,125
[KANA]
Hm.

114
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,291
[CHIAKI]
Huh? Is this only a time out?

115
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,375
Is there still a little time
left on the clock?

116
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah! I think there is.

117
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,458
Now's my chance! Shoot!

118
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,833
[CHIAKI] This is a difficult
angle. I can't line up the shot.

119
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,458
What am I gonna do?

120
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,708
All eyes are on me, and I can't
get anywhere near the basket.

121
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,125
But you're so close, Chiaki.

122
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,583
Just go for a layup
before the buzzer!

123
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,541
I'm not mad, I--

125

--[KANA] He missed!
--[CHIAKI] I missed!

126

[CHIAKI] Still, I did just kiss
a girl for the first time.

127
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,625
Awesome. Awesome!

128
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,083
Please, coach! Let me
take a free throw.

129
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:22,833
I can do it!

130
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,750
A what?

131
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,291
I won't mess it up this time.

132
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,833
Just give me one more chance.

133
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,875
Okay. Shoot.

134
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,583
Or maybe not.

135
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,458
Yeah.

136
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,666
[AKAGI]
Yup. That's the right answer.

137
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,625
I gotta say, I think I'm
gettin' pretty good at English.

138
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,916
And it may all be thanks to you.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,416
Then... wanna go
to second base?

140
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,625
We're in the Library.
You know that, right?

141
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,500
Yeah.

142
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,625
Didn't we agree to study here

143
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,916
because when we try
to study at home,

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,958
we end up fooling
around too much?

145
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,166
Yeah.

146
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,958
So, what was that?

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,625
I wanna squeeze your boobs.
You gonna let me?

148
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,166
For a guy who's as
smart as you are,

149
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,750
I'm amazed at the dumb stuff
that can come out of your mouth.

150
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,583
What's dumb about it?

151
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,875
There are other people around.

152
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,166
Why would I let you
cop a feel in public?

153
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,666
I figure that if I'm
persistent enough,

154
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,708
you'll eventually cave.

155
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,416
[KAJI grumbles]

156
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,250
Right? Don't you always
tend to give in?

157
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,125
What? No way! Of course not!

158
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,208
Are you certain?

159
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,333
You usually buckle
under pressure.

160
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,375
I may give in,
but I'm no pushover.

161
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,708
I know you're not.

162
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,583
But you're restraining yourself.

163
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,000
Aren't you? Or is it just me?

164
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,666
It's not like it's that hard.

165
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,166
Don't you want me to put
my arms around you

166
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
and hold you close?

167
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,833
Not really.

168
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,458
[KAJI]
What-What are you doing?

169
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,208
Don't hold back.
Indulge yourself.

170
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,458
I told you already.
Not in public.

171
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,791
[AKAGI]
Come on. You know you want to.

172
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,958
[KAJI]
Well, no one's watching.

173
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,333
So I guess there's no
harm in a little cuddle.

174
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,125
[AKAGI] But in return, you have
to let me have a little feelski.

175
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,083
What? Like hell I will!

176
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,458
[AKAGI] So I have to hold
back while you go nuts?

177
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:13,125
I won't then. Not like I'm
dying to be in your arms.

178
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,750
Here.

179
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,458
[KAJI]
Dammit!

180
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,208
[AKAGI]
Ah-ha. You were holding back.

181
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,250
[KAJI]
You tempted me. It's your fault.

182
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,666
Does this mean that I'm free
to squeeze your boobs?

183
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,875
Is that a "yes"?

184
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,708
Yeah. Sure. Fine.
Do whatever you want!

185
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,125
Great. Then let's go
back to studying.

186
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,958
What? But you said--

187
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,333
I didn't mean it.

188
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,625
I didn't really intend
to feel you up.

189
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,083
Even though you were quite
clearly ready to let me.

190
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,291
Then what the heck
was with all that?

191
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,916
I hold back a lot.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,791
More than you realize
and I wanted you to know.

193
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,375
What? You've got nerve.

194
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,583
You say that like I
made it all about me!

195
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,708
No, but I do want more.

196
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,166
And now that you understand
that, I feel a lot better.

197
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,416
What? Did you want
me to kiss you?

198
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,291
[HOSOKAWA]
My love was like a firework.

199
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,333
The fragile spark of passion
blazed bright, then burnt out.

200
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,750
But the memory of that gleaming
moment still shines in my mind.

201
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,375
I can't forget it.

202
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,458
This is the spot where
I first saw him.

203
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:26,958
Why did I come back here?
He already turned me down.

204
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,500
[HOSOKAWA]
Katori! You're back!

205
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,541
Are-Are you okay?

206
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,916
Hi there. Who are you?

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,541
It's me, Hosokawa!
We met the other day!

208
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,500
I fell from a tree!
You caught me!

209
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,583
I save a lot of girls.

210
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,958
And I'm sorry, but I can't
remember all their faces.

211
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,291
Do you think you
could smile for me?

212
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,041
That might help jog my memory.

213
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
[HOSOKAWA]
He's gorgeous!

214
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,250
Ah-ha. Now I see.
You're that little kitten.

215
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,041
[HOSOKAWA] What happened?
How'd you get hurt?

216
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,041
I got in a little
bit of a tussle.

217
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,625
[HOSOKAWA]
I'll call an ambulance!

218
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,541
No, my little kitten.
You mustn't.

219
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,833
If you draw attention,
they'll find me.

220
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,125
[HOSOKAWA]
People are after him!

221
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,500
[KATORI]
I brought this on myself.

222
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,666
Another girl, who was
already taken, fell for me.

223
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,791
[HOSOKAWA]
That's not your fault!

224
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,666
They shouldn't blame you!

225
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,958
Oh, kitten, but it tis my fault.

226
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,041
I'm just to much.

227
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,416
How can I stop girls
from falling for me?

228
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,333
[HOSOKAWA] There's nothing.
He's perfect! It's impossible!

229
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,666
I should go.

230
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,500
If I stay here too long,
they'll catch up with me.

231
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,250
Where will you go?
You're a mess!

232
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,458
[KATORI]
Dunno.

233
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,541
Chances are they're
waiting for me at home.

234
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,416
Guess this tom cat's gonna
be a stray for a while.

235
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,458
Then come with me
and hide at my place!

236
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,083
Stay away from me,
kitten. Or you'll die.

237
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,083
I'm not afraid of
some jealous boys!

238
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,541
Poor little kitten.
You don't understand.

239
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,166
The real threat is
not from those boys

240
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,541
trying to hunt me down.

241
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,916
Why do girls keep
falling in love with me?

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,416
What cursed me to
be so irresistible?

243
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,291
There is only one who
could've done it.

244
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,916
Him, and him alone.

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Are you talking... about God?

246
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,541
[KATORI]
Cupid!

247
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,791
As long as the god of love
continues to make me so popular,

248
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,000
more girls will keep getting
shot through the heart.

249
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,458
And I really just don't
wanna hurt anyone anymore.

250
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,708
No! You're the one who's hurt!

251
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,958
Let me make you better!

252
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,541
Sorry, kitten, you're caressing
the echo of my beauty again.

253
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,791
You caught me this time.

254
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,916
I must admit, I'm
quite impressed.

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,708
Mew miscalculate
my cat reflexes!

256
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,916
That's enough for today.

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,250
Quit while you're ahead.
You can't handle my moves.

258
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,125
They're far too intense.

259
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,500
[HOSOKAWA]
I don't care!

260
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,500
I have to be with you!

261
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,916
My poor, little kitten,
you're out of your league.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,750
You may be roaring like
a jungle cat now...

263
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,208
...but with one
finger, just one,

264
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,791
I can stop you in your tracks.

265
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,416
Who do you think
your talking to?

266
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,791
What do you plan to
do with that finger

267
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,708
that you think's gonna work?

268
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,166
[HOSOKAWA screams]

269
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,666
I'm warning you; the flames
grow higher and hotter

270
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,541
the deeper and deeper you fall.

271
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,083
Is it me, Katori?

272
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,500
Is it that I'm just not
good enough for you?

273
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,000
If you can handle the
heat, then come burn.

00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,750
[gasps]

275
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,125
Just kidding.

276
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,250
I'd never let a kitten play
with fire. Never ever!

277
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,500
Please! I'll be careful!

278
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,250
No. I'm going to find Cupid.

279
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,125
Then I'll beat the crap
out of him to make sure

280
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,416
no more fragile
hearts get singed.

281
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,041
But until I do, beware
the flames of love.

282
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,916
[HOSOKAWA]
I adore you, Katori!

283
