1
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,125
[HOTARU] Furuya's been
smiling a lot lately.

2
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,458
I bet it's a girl.

3
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,208
[HOTARU] Bathroom's free,
Furuya. Your turn.

4
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,125
Mom says remember not
to take too long.

5
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,708
[FURUYA]
Okay.

6
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,833
[HOTARU] Now then, let's see
what big brother's been up to.

7
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,666
Passcode is still his birthday.

8
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,541
Oh, Furuya, so careless.

9
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,875
Yuki Minagawa. Ha! I knew it.

10
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,333
Evil witch, seducing my innocent
brother. I will make you suffer!

11
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,375
[FURUYA] "Sorry, but can you
please stop talking to me now?

12
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,875
I'm trying to study,
and it's very distracting."

13
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,291
Oh! It's Hotaru!

14
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,375
[MINAGAWA] "What? Why?
Did I do something wrong?

15
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,333
Is it because of,
well, you know,

16
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,750
'what happened' the other day?"

17
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,000
[HOTARU]
"What happened"?

18
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,208
Did she do something
to piss him off?

19
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,583
Bet she did.
Wouldn't surprise me.

20
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,791
[FURUYA]
"It is."

21
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,208
[MINAGAWA] "But what
happened only happened

22
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,083
because you wanted to."

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,458
[HOTARU]
"Wanted to"? Wanted to what?

24
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,000
Did he ask her to help with
his homework or something?

25
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,041
Whatever. I'll just
pretend to be mad.

26
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,166
[FURUYA] "I don't care anymore.
Forget it. It didn't matter."

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,625
[MINAGAWA] "You're despicable!
It was my first time!

28
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,750
How could you say that?"

29
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,041
[HOTARU] I'm totally lost.
First time doing what?

30
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,416
Let's see,

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,666
something that would've
been the first time for her

32
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,541
that he would've wanted.

33
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,375
Oh! That must be it!

34
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,500
[FURUYA]
"What's the big deal about me

35
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,583
wanting to go out on a date?

36
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,833
Everybody dates.

37
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,291
Besides, it was my first time

38
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,916
going out with
someone else, too."

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,708
Adorable! She doesn't
get it at all!

40
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,208
[MINAGAWA]
"Hmph.

41
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,041
So does that mean our date
didn't mean anything to you?"

42
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,250
Just as I thought.

43
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,791
No wonder he came home
late the other day.

44
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,375
He was with her!

45
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,541
[FURUYA]
"Nothing."

46
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,666
[MINAGAWA]
"And I suppose sleeping with me

47
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,166
meant nothing, too?"

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,708
Huh...?

49
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,833
[HOTARU] They like took a
nap together? Is that it?

50
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,125
Sleeping on a date? Really?

51
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,166
My big brother is so weird.

52
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,708
[FURUYA]
"All we did was sleep."

53
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,666
[MINAGAWA] "Then how did I
end up carrying this baby?"

54
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,708
[HOTARU]
Huh?

55
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,041
She is what?!

56
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,291
[HOTARU]
But-But--

57
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,333
A guy and a girl need to
have sex to make babies.

58
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,250
And there is no way my
brother would do that.

59
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,833
[FURUYA] "Are you
absolutely sure it's mine?

60
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,375
What proof do you
have that it is?"

61
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,541
"I haven't slept
with anyone else.

62
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,000
O-N-L-Y you."

63
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,541
[screams]

64
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,291
[HOTARU]
This can't be true!

65
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,541
Furuya's only in high school.

66
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,083
What the--?

67
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,125
Hey, Hotaru, what are you
doing with my phone?

68
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,375
Mom! Mommy!

69
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,333
Okay?

70
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,583
What did she do?

71
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,875
[HOTARU] Mom! Furuya and
some girl made a baby!

72
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,666
I did what now?!

73
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,916
[GODA] I'm in a relationship
with this girl in my class.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,166
After a while, the feelings
just get stronger. You know?

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,958
But I'm not sure what that means
or what I'm supposed to do now.

76
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,375
Kamine, do you like
spending time with me?

77
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,291
What? Yes. Of course I do.

78
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,500
Uh. Good.

79
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,541
I'm still not great
at relationship stuff.

80
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,250
So let me know if there's
anything I can do better.

81
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,666
Well, there is one thing.

82
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,208
Something wrong?

83
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,208
Oh, no. I'm fine. It's
nothing like that. Really.

84
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,333
It's just, I think I understand
what you've been feeling,

85
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,583
and all I want is
to hear you say it.

86
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,916
I want you to tell me
that you love me.

87
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,083
Sorry, Goda.

88
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,833
I didn't mean to put you
on the spot like that.

89
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,958
[GODA]
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

90
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,291
But you already know,
so why bother?

91
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,541
That's true.

92
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,500
And I do feel kinda
silly for asking,

93
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,791
but I still wanna hear it.

94
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,708
You're right, Kamine.
Please forgive me.

95
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,166
The reason that I'm quiet

96
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,708
is because I'm not very
good at expressing

97
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,458
what's on my mind.

98
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,208
But I'm going to be
better from now on.

99
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,541
No, "from now on"
isn't what I meant.

100
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,750
[GODA] I'm confused.
When did you mean?

101
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,958
Um, well, now might
be a good time.

102
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,125
Oh, I see now.
You need me to prove it.

103
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,708
I should make a
show of good faith.

104
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,625
Uh. I don't think
you understand.

105
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,875
Help me, then. What can
I do to show you I care?

106
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,125
What if, maybe,
I took you somewhere?

107
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,125
We haven't had our first
actual date, yet.

108
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,666
Would that make you happy?

109
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,291
Listen to me! I don't want
you to take me on a date!

110
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,375
[GODA]
What?!

111
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,083
I want one simple thing.

112
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,500
In your own words,
say that you love me!

113
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,750
But why?

114
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,291
Because I can tell that you do,

115
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
but you still
haven't said it yet.

116
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,250
[GODA]
I-I haven't?

117
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,000
Going on a date would be nice,

118
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,000
but hearing you say "I love
you" means a lot more.

119
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,916
All right. Here goes.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,291
Wait. No, don't.

121
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,708
But you said you wanted me to.

122
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,166
[KAMINE]
But you don't want to.

123
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,125
I'm pretty much
making you say it.

124
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,250
So forget it. I'm sorry
I made things complicated.

125
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,208
[GODA]
No. It's okay.

126
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,500
About that date though,
if the offer is still go--

127
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,208
[GODA]
I love you, Kamine.

128
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,166
I mean it. Kamine, I love you.

129
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,041
And I'm not saying it
because you asked me to,

130
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,125
I'm saying it because, well...

131
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,625
I love you!

132
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,250
I do. From the very
bottom of my heart.

133
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,916
I love you!

134
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,750
I know I should've
told you a lot sooner,

136
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,875
but I'm just a big, dumb jock.

137
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,958
What's wrong now?
Your face is red.

138
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,833
Are you angry at me?

139
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,916
[TAKASE] "You know those
people who confess by text?

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,083
I think that's pretty lame.

141
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,791
Okay, good night!"

142
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,958
[KANDA]
"I'm interested in you, Takase.

143
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,333
Sorry to tell you like
this, but I like you.

144
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,083
Please go out with me."

145
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,916
[TAKASE] We had a texting snafu
and now things are awkward.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kanda.

147
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,333
Minagawa! How was
your English test?

148
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,583
Huh? I had an English test?

149
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,458
[TAKASE]
This is so, so bad.

150
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,875
[TAKASE] I wonder if she read
the message I sent after.

151
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,041
Maybe I should send it again.

152
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,291
No, I should tell her
in person, not by text.

153
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,791
But she won't talk
to me. What do I do?

154
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,041
[TAKASE]
Uh... Hello?

155
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,791
Sorry. I'm a little curious.

156
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,916
[TAKASE]
Oh, yeah? About what?

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,333
Well, I'm pretty, so I'm not
clever enough to elucidate,

158
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,541
but you, you look just like I
once did, ya heart-breaker.

159
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,541
[TAKASE] Okay. That was odd.
Who is this guy?

160
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,083
Listen, pal, I'm flattered
and all, but not interested.

161
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,833
It's a girl, and
things got messed up?

162
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,541
[TAKASE]
Wha--?

163
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
Hey! How'd you know?

164
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,416
I didn't, but like I said,
you remind me of me.

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,666
And I, too, have left many a
woman devestated and in tears.

166
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,083
[TAKASE] Hang on. I haven't
left that many in tears.

167
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,041
But you did make her cry, right?

168
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,166
The last one in the world
you wanted to hurt.

169
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,958
[gasps]

170
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,708
[TAKASE] Maybe I should ask
this guy for some advice.

171
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,125
You want my help, don't you?

172
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,916
Do I look like a dating master?

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
[gasps]

174
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,750
Well, I am.

175
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,958
A dating... What?
Never heard of one.

176
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,333
[KATORI]
Ah. Seeing you takes me back.

177
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,666
So many days like a lost puppy,
wandering in the rain.

178
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,500
What am I supposed to do?

179
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,041
I screwed up. And now,
she won't even talk to me.

180
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,375
No clue. I'm dumb.

181
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,750
I've got no idea
what to tell you.

182
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,083
But I would go to her,
wrap my arms around her,

183
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,125
hold her tight,
and never let her go.

184
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,500
[TAKASE]
Wow!

185
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,416
You know, I think you
might be on to something.

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,541
Then isn't there somewhere
else you need to be right now?

187
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,666
Hey, uh, thank you
for the advice and all.

188
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,958
I really appreciate it.

189
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,458
I gave you advice?

190
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,625
What advice? I don't recall any.

191
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,583
I just prattle on about myself.

192
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,916
A dumb, pretty-boy, pleebs like
to call: The Dating Master.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,125
Teach me your ways.

194
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,625
Now, now. Hurry up
and go to her.

195
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,083
Catch her before she leaves.

196
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,416
Right! I will!

197
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,666
But before I do, will you
tell me who you are?

198
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,458
[TAKASE]
No!

199
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,708
[KATORI]
See ya!

200
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,250
[TAKANO] Lately, I've been
feeling kinda listless.

201
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,000
And I find myself staring
at random things in class.

202
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,083
[TAKANO] Something in my chest
hurts a little bit, too.

203
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,375
Takano, are you all right?

204
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,166
Uh. Oh, sorry.

205
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,166
You've been acting weird
recently. Are you sick?

206
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,541
Yeah. I've got something.

207
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,375
[TAKANO]
And I don't know why,

208
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,708
but I keep thinking
about Sugawara.

209
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,083
I can't seem to stop.

210
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,750
It's strange. This has never
happened to me before.

211
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,041
[TAKANO]
I think I may be sick.

212
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,500
[heart beating]

213
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,875
[TAKANO] My heart's
pounding. I know I'm sick.

214
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,291
Oh. Takano. Is something wrong?

215
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Yeah. I feel like
I have a fever.

216
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,833
What about you? What happened?

217
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,291
Not much. I, uh, hurt
myself at practice.

218
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,583
Where's the nurse? Do you know?

219
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,625
Oh. She left a few minutes ago.

220
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,083
So she's gone?

221
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,416
Yeah.

222
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,333
Uh, do you like being
on the soccer team?

223
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,291
Yeah. I guess so.

224
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,750
[TAKANO]
What am I doing?

225
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,500
I can't make small talk like
this. My head is spinning.

226
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,750
I should try to focus and carry
on a better conversation.

227
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,166
Hey, Takano.

228
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,791
Do you need to have your
temperature taken or something?

229
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,166
[gasps]

230
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,458
Oh. That's right I did.

231
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,583
I think I might have
a little fever.

232
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,208
Oh. I hope it's not bad.

233
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,958
Well, I should get
back to practice.

234
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,708
Wait. Don't go.

235
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,125
What? How come?

236
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,916
[TAKANO]
Uh...

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,541
I don't know.

238
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,958
That came out wrong.

239
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,125
I mean, I don't know where
the thermometer is?

240
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,833
Oh, okay. I'll go
get it for you.

241
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,291
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,916
You had such a red
face when you said that,

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,791
I thought you might
have been blushing.

244
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,708
[gasps]

245
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,291
Really? My face was
actually that red?

246
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,375
[SUGAWARA] Yeah.
At least, compared to usual.

247
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,666
But I wasn't--
Or I didn't mean to.

248
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,375
[SUGAWARA]
I know you weren't.

249
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,291
You aren't the kind of girl
who would get lovesick.

250
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,625
It's new. State-of-the-art.

251
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
Supposed to only
take five seconds.

252
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,166
Oh, yeah?

253
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,000
I really hope you aren't sick.

254
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,375
Me, too.

255
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,208
[TAKANO] But... what does
it mean if I'm not?

256
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:01,916
If a fever didn't make my
face red then what did?

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,875
[thermometer beeping]

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,583
[TAKANO]
It's normal.

259
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,500
Looks like I do have
a slight temperature.

260
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Seriously? You should
go home right away.

261
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,625
[COACH A]
Water break's over, boys!

262
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,208
[SUGAWARA] I better be
getting back to practice.

263
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,041
'Kay.

264
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,125
[SUGAWARA]
Get well soon.

265
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,583
Thank you.

266
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:31,166
[TAKANO] If it's not a fever,
then what is it?

267
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,958
