1
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,000
[HOTARU]
My name is Hotaru.

2
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,708
Today is my very first
day of high school.

3
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,666
I also have a big brother,
Furuya. He's awesome!

4
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,416
[HOTARU] Furuya's the
class representative.

5
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,208
It's his job to take care
of the whole class.

6
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,666
Too bad he's so serious
and can't get a girlfriend.

7
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,375
Ha-ha! Furuya!

8
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,833
[MINAGAWA] Isn't it great?
We're in the same class again!

9
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,708
What are you doing?
Let go of me.

10
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,041
[HOTARU]
Big brother.

11
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,750
What? Uh, Hotaru.

12
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,541
Your sister?

13
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,750
Yeah.

14
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,916
Thank you for being
so nice to my brother.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,416
Oh! That's so sweet.
You're welcome.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,958
Don't read into it.
I'm just being polite.

17
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,041
Furuya! Who is this?
Is she your girlfriend?

18
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,416
Are you two dating? Are
there others besides her?

19
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,166
Hotaru, stop. Don't be rude.

20
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,666
You really love
your brother, huh?

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,500
[HOTARU] What do you
mean? Of course I do!

22
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,708
It's normal!

23
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,250
[FURUYA] She's a bit
over-attached. Sorry.

24
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,958
Don't apologize. It's cute.

25
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,000
What exactly are you
to my brother, anyway?

26
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,416
That's a good question.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,250
What is she? Just spit it out!

28
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,208
It can't be what I think.
but just to be sure,

29
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,791
tell me you're not dating.

30
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,125
We're not. Your brother
and I are just friends.

31
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,000
I thought so.
What else would you be?

32
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:20,708
He's not really--

33
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,291
For now, anyway.

34
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,125
[FURUYA]
Hotaru, you're hurting me.

35
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,750
I confessed that I
really, really like him,

36
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,083
but he hasn't told
me how he feels,

37
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,375
so nothing has happened yet.

38
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,583
She's trolling me, right?

39
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,625
You can't possibly
have feelings for her.

40
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,916
Well, um...

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,833
Why are you hesitating?

42
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,541
Just reject her and
get it over with.

43
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,375
You'll only hurt her
if you lead her on.

44
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,416
Hotaru, you don't--

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,583
No, your sister's right.

46
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,250
If you're not
interested, say so.

47
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,583
Well, um, it's hard to say.

48
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,375
I can't find the right words.

49
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,750
And hurting you is the
last thing I'd wanna do.

50
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,666
Let's go! Let's go!
Kick her to the curb!

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,541
The thing is, it's not
that I don't like you.

52
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,250
Furuya, you idiot!

53
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,041
I'm trying to look out for you,
like a good little sister.

54
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,500
Can't you see that?
She's just toying with you.

55
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,916
If you date her,
you'll only get hurt.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,791
Hotaru. I wasn't
planning on dating her.

57
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,583
Does that mean I've
just been shot down?

58
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,750
Bullseye!

59
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,291
You don't need
a girlfriend, do you?

60
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,708
'Cause you already have me.

61
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,250
I'm sorry, Minagawa.

62
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,041
But I can't date you without
thinking it all through, first.

63
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,791
I mean, if I were
to go out with you,

64
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,416
it might lead to marriage,
and to kids, and all that stuff.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,583
[MINAGAWA] You're that serious
about me? I had no idea.

66
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,041
[FURUYA] No, wait.
That's not quite what I meant.

67
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,333
Of course he is!
My brother's always serious!

68
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,541
You're absolutely right.
He is always really serious.

69
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,291
That's why I like him.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,916
How about I give you some more
time to think things over?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,666
That's totally up to you.

72
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,541
[MINAGAWA] You'll be rooting for
me and your brother, right?

73
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,708
No way! You can't
take him! He's mine!

74
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,958
Well, if that's the case,

75
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,583
then I'll just have to
adore both of you.

76
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,666
I freakin' hate you!

77
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,291
[KAGA] Is there a point
in joining any of these?

78
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,166
There's nothing I'm
actually drawn to.

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,750
I don't have any
interests or hobbies.

80
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,458
Basically, I'm boring.

81
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,875
But then again, does anyone
really care about what they do?

82
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,083
[SASAHARA]
Hi there!

83
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,166
[KAGA]
Uh.

84
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,875
Hey! You look like
you're into stars.

85
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,166
Wanna join the Astronomy Club?

86
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,416
Thanks, but no. Not interested.

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,291
[SASAHARA]
Wait!

88
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,333
Come on, at least hear me out.

89
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,666
Now then, what's your name?

90
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,666
It's Kaga.

91
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,541
Have you chosen
a club yet, Kaga?

92
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,791
Uh. Not yet.

93
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,666
Then why not join me
and feast your eyes

94
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,583
on an orchestra of stars?

95
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,083
Jeez, he's not even
cracking a smile.

96
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,666
Stargazing: Be honest
with me, is it fun?

97
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,333
Of course it is!
Stars are pretty!

98
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,333
But don't you get bored
just watching them?

99
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,083
[KAGA]
I'll take that as a yes.

100
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,833
Any other reasons I
should join this club?

101
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh, yeah. Members
are super popular.

102
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,708
So far, 100% of them
have hooked up!

103
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,000
How's that for a reason?

104
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,583
[KAGA]
Yeah, right.

105
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,083
I get the feeling that you don't
actually like stars that much.

106
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,041
So why are you in
the Astronomy Club?

107
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,208
Well, I guess that...
I just like it.

108
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,500
Hard to beat the view, y'know?

109
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,666
Yeah? How many are in
the club besides you?

110
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,000
[SASAHARA]
Uh...

111
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,291
[KAGA]
Oh, don't tell me "zero."

112
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,750
Please consider it.

113
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,625
None of the other clubs
interest you, right?

114
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,833
[KAGA]
Well, no.

115
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,125
Then let me tell you
a story about the stars

116
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,791
that's sure to excite you!

117
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,916
Look there! Up in the sky.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,333
There's a star
somewhere up there.

119
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,250
A bright star called Spica.

120
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,750
It looks like one big star,
but it's actually two.

121
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,291
They spin around and around,

122
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,541
and they're always like pulling
on each other or something.

123
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,125
Like this.

124
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,375
Two stars helping one another
become one big ball of light.

125
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,250
Doesn't that sound
philosophical?

126
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,083
Maybe.

127
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,166
[SASAHARA]
Interested now?

128
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,416
Not really.

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,625
Dang. That's should've worked.

130
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,125
Anything else you wanna try?

131
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,750
Think. Think, Sasahara!

132
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,208
[SASAHARA]
Mars! That's it!

133
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,833
The other day I had octopus
balls while watching Mars!

134
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,541
My friend who just
graduated was like,

135
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,875
"Octopuses kinda look like
Martians, don't they?"

136
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,625
So I made octopus balls
while we watched Mars.

137
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
Actually, he watched Mars.
Stared at it the whole time.

138
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,291
He couldn't take his eyes off
it. Not for hours. That ended...

139
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,875
[KAGA] This isn't even
about stars anymore.

140
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,958
...I ate all the
octopus balls myself.

141
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,916
My friend was kind
of annoyed that I ate...

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,708
[KAGA] She must really
love the Astronomy Club.

143
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,750
I've never seen
anyone so excited.

144
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,291
She's so absorbed
and passionate.

145
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,833
I wish I could be the same way.

146
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,500
[SASAHARA]
Come on, Kaga, join!

147
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,916
You'll love it! I guarantee!

148
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,250
[KAGA]
There's not really anything

149
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,125
I've been interested in.

150
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,375
But I'm so boring,
and I'm sick of it.

151
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:42,375
So I've been looking
for something to like.

152
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,125
Could this be what I've
been searching for?

153
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,708
Something I finally care about?

154
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,625
Maybe. Maybe not.

155
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:55,916
But I know one thing.
I wanna see more of her smile.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,375
[KAGA]
Okay.

157
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,625
[GODA] Kamine sits next to me.
Yet she often avoids me.

158
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,416
Why?

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,541
[KAMINE gasps]

160
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,958
[GODA]
Why?

161
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,083
Kamine, aren't you going home?

162
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes. I will. In a minute.

163
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,291
[GODA] She won't even
look me in the eye.

164
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,708
Did I do something
to offend her?

165
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,083
[KAMINE gasps]

166
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,083
[GODA]
Guess I should go.

167
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,458
[KAMINE]
Goda!

168
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,291
What's wrong?

169
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,625
Well, I, um,

170
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,791
I just realized I lost
one of my contact lenses,

171
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,125
and um, I wanted to...

172
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,833
I see. I won't step
on it. I'll leave.

173
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
No, please don't leave!
Help me look for it!

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,583
All right, then.
Let's look for it.

175
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,125
[GODA] Maybe she doesn't
completely hate me.

176
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
Do you lose your contacts a lot?

177
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,125
Just sometimes. Like if I'm
sweating and I wipe my face.

178
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,583
You are sweating quite
a bit right now.

179
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,625
Kamine. Did you want
to talk to me?

180
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,208
Is there anything you would
like to confide in me?

181
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,500
What?

182
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,500
Whatever it is,
I promise you can tell me

183
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,958
and it will be all right.

184
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,416
So go ahead. Just say it.

185
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,166
Um, it sounds like you don't
really need me to say it.

186
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,041
Given what you said,
you already know.

187
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,625
[GODA]
Hm?

188
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,625
I'm still not sure I
understand how we got here.

189
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,333
Was it something I did to you?

190
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,916
Remember a while back?

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,958
When I was having a hard time
in class because of my eyesight?

192
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,125
And you let me borrow
your notebook?

193
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,541
[GODA]
Yeah. What was wrong with that?

194
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,833
Nothing. It was very kind.

195
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,250
[GODA]
Now I'm more confused than ever.

196
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,083
[GODA] Sorry, Kamine.
I didn't realize--

197
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,333
[KAMINE] Please, you
don't need to apologize.

198
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,958
Why don't we just
find your contact?

199
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,666
It's the least I can do.

200
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,583
[KAMINE]
Goda?

201
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,416
[GODA]
Hm? Did you find it?

202
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,250
[KAMINE]
How do you feel?

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,416
About what?

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,958
Oh. Never mind.

205
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,375
I just wanted to
tell you how I felt.

206
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,666
If you've got nothing to say
to me, that's fine. Really.

207
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,166
[GODA] Are you telling me you
won't be happy unless I own up?

208
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,583
Not at all!

209
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,750
I just wanted to know what
your feelings were, Goda.

210
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,666
[GODA] Fine then. If that's
what you really want.

211
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,166
[GODA]
I'm sorry. It's me, not you.

212
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,791
And well, to be
completely honest,

213
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,125
I don't understand
how girls feel.

214
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,083
Oh. That's okay.

215
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,833
[GODA] I'm sure that every
moment I'm near you,

216
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,375
I'll just make
even more mistakes.

217
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,583
[GODA] But if you could find it
in your heart to tolerate me...

218
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,625
[gasps]

219
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,541
Look! It's your contact.

220
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,791
Why are you crying?

221
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,625
[KAMINE] Does that mean
you'd be willing to like,

222
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,375
go out and spend time with me?

223
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,833
Of course it does.

224
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,958
That was pretty much implied
by everything I just said,

225
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,333
wasn't it?

226
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,500
[KAMINE]
Thank you, Goda!

227
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,500
What's the matter, Kamine?
Are you all right?

228
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,791
Have I gone crazy or something?

229
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,500
You're fine.

230
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,833
I'm sorry. I know this
doesn't make any sense.

231
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,166
And I still haven't
come right out

232
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
and told you how I
really feel, have I?

233
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,791
If there's anything left

234
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,708
that you still wanted to say
to me, feel free to go ahead.

235
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,166
I like you.

236
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,541
[TAKANO] It wasn't
supposed to rain today.

237
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,875
[SUGAWARA]
Takano? No umbrella?

238
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,916
[TAKANO]
Sugawara is a guy in my class.

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,375
I've never really
talked to him before.

240
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,000
[SUGAWARA]
Here. Take mine.

241
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,708
I'll just make a run for it.

242
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,208
But it's wet.

243
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,083
[TAKANO]
I felt bad for him.

244
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,708
So I suggested we walk
part way home together.

245
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,750
I'm sorry. Must be embarrassing
walking home with a girl.

246
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,916
No. Or, at least,
with you, it's not.

247
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,541
[TAKANO]
Hm?

248
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,541
[TAKANO] I guess he means no one
would think anything of it,

249
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,041
if it's just me.

250
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,333
That's good.

251
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,875
Your shoulder's getting wet.

252
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,875
Oh. It's fine. Don't worry.

253
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,458
No. Come closer.
Get all underneath.

254
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,250
[TAKANO]
Almost.

255
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,416
A little closer.

256
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,041
[SUGAWARA yelps]

257
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,958
[SUGAWARA] Aren't you a
little self-conscious?

258
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,000
Huddling under an
umbrella with a guy?

259
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,291
[TAKANO] Not really.
There's no one around.

260
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,458
But what if someone was
here and they saw us?

261
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,750
Like maybe your crush.

262
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,958
I don't know. I don't
have a crush on anyone.

263
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,125
Why are you smiling?

264
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,041
I've never thought
much about dating.

265
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,250
What if someone told you
they had feelings for you?

266
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,750
There's no one who
would do that.

267
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,833
Hypothetically, what if someone
confessed their love?

268
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,333
Uh... I think I'd
probably turn them down.

269
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,750
Why say no?

270
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,833
Because there must be
something wrong with anyone

271
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,708
who'd have feelings for me.

272
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm not pretty or cute.
I'm just gloomy.

273
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,500
That's not true. You are cute.

274
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,083
And you have plenty of
other attractive qualities.

275
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,875
You help people clean and
take care of the pupfish.

276
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,666
I've seen you.
You're a hard worker.

277
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,583
Those are some of the
reasons I, uh, uh...

278
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,208
[TAKANO]
Hm?

279
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,125
So this is where I catch my bus.

280
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,875
Was there something
else you wanted to say?

281
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,250
No. It wasn't important.

282
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,000
[TAKANO]
Okay. See ya.

283
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,291
[TAKANO] Dating, huh?
I'm not sure I could.

284
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,500
Sugawara was nice, though.
I bet he dates a lot.

285
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,458
[TAKANO gasps]

286
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,750
What are you doing here?

287
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,791
I started to tell you something,

288
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,958
and I figured I'd finish it.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,583
I have something
to confess to you.

290
00:12:55,666 --> 00:13:00,375
I like you, Takano.

291
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,625
Thanks, Sugawara.

292
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,500
I know you're trying to cheer
me up, and I appreciate it.

293
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,666
What? You weren't?

294
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,916
Well, no, I...

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Nevermind.

296
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,291
[SUGAWARA]
So this is my stop.

297
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,125
Oh. Bye then.

298
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,583
[TAKANO] Sugawara's nice.
He's a really good guy.

299
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe I'll bake him some cookies
as a thank you for the umbrella.
