1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,125
Takase!

2
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,666
[TAKANO] Lately I keep catching
myself watching Sugawara.

3
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,375
I can't seem to help it.

4
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,416
What's the matter with me?

5
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,666
[YOSHINAGA]
Takano? Is something wrong?

6
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,541
You've been really distracted.
Anything you wanna talk about?

7
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,708
Oh. Sorry. It's
nothing. Don't worry.

8
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,291
Yeah? So then are you in love?

9
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,916
[saxophone squeaks]

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,458
[YOSHINAGA]
Oh my gosh! So you are?

11
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,416
[TAKANO] What? No,
I'm not. How could I be?

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,083
I don't know anything about
love and all that stuff.

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,250
[YOSHINAGA]
But when you see couples,

14
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,583
doesn't it make you jealous?

15
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,166
Especially Kamine and Goda.
They're so cute.

16
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,291
I haven't really
thought about it.

17
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,458
Hey.

18
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,541
Hi, Kamine! Your ears
must've been burning.

19
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,791
The two of us were
just talking about you.

20
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,208
Really? You were?

21
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,458
We wanna know,

22
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,125
how did everything start
between you and Goda?

23
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,500
What?

24
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,625
[YOSHINAGA] Come on, Takano.
Aren't you curious, too?

25
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,500
No. Not so much.

26
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,583
What are you doing here, Kamine?
Did you need something?

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,583
Oh. No. I was just looking
for the music teacher.

28
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,916
Aww. You don't even wanna
gossip a little bit?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,625
We really shouldn't.
It's rude to pry.

30
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,666
[KAMINE]
Well...

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,166
...if it's a little,
I don't mind.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,375
[TAKANO]
She doesn't?

33
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,125
[YOSHINAGA] Yay! We're gonna
get some juicy details!

34
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,625
I don't care.

35
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,250
[YOSHINAGA] Okay, so who told
who they liked them first?

36
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,333
[KAMINE] Well, this is kinda
embarrassing to admit,

37
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,166
but I told him before
he confessed to me.

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,333
[saxophone squeaks]

39
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,625
Miss your fingering
there, Takano,

40
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,041
or could it be that
you're interested?

41
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,458
No, I'm not.

42
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you have a crush
on someone, Takano?

43
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,833
She's been spacing out
and sighing nonstop.

44
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,875
What? That's not true!

45
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,166
Ah, I remember that.

46
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,541
I would do those
things all the time.

47
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,791
[gasps]

48
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,291
It's what happens when
you like someone.

49
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,291
You just can't help it.

50
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,458
[YOSHINAGA]
Yeah.

51
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,875
But there isn't anybody
I have a crush on.

52
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,416
At least, I don't think I do.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
[KAMINE] With Goda, I'd catch
myself watching him

54
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,041
no matter where he was.

55
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,416
Or thinking about him
without even realizing it.

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,708
And during club,
I was always distracted.

57
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,041
Sounds like you, Takano.

58
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,166
Are you sure you
don't like anyone?

59
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:06,458
[TAKANO] Sugawara is a boy
in my class. He's a good guy.

60
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,416
He's helpful.
And nice to everyone.

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,166
[KAMINE]
Is the guy you like Sugawara?

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,416
No, it can't be.

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,625
It's not him.

64
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,458
But if I did like a guy,
why'd you guess him?

65
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,583
No real reason.

66
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,875
There's just a rumor
I heard about him

67
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,041
that's been going around.

68
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,541
People are saying he
has a crush on you.

69
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,750
[YOSHINAGA]
Yeah, Takano.

70
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,125
I heard the same thing.
Sugawara likes you.

71
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,833
[TAKANO] The girl Sugawara
has a crush on is me?

72
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:34,458
Someone actually likes me?
And that someone... is him?

73
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,166
[KAMINE] It's just a rumor
though. Who knows if it's true?

74
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,375
Maybe you should tell him
you like him and find out.

75
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,000
[TAKANO]
No way. I couldn't do that.

76
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,250
Anyway, tell us more about

77
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,625
how you confessed
your feelings to Goda.

78
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,666
Yeah? You want me to?

79
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,125
No thanks. I'd rather practice.

80
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,083
[CHIAKI]
My girlfriend dumped me.

81
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,958
I hate this. Can't we
just get back together?

82
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,708
[KANA]
That's so totally ridiculous.

83
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,208
[CHIAKI] Kana! I'm sorry
about the other day.

84
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,500
Let's go.

85
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,416
What about Chiaki?

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
[KANA]
I don't care. C'mon.

87
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,916
Sorry!

88
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,041
[CHIAKI]
I want to die.

89
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,291
What? Why did you break up?

90
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,791
Because he gave me the
weirdest first kiss ever.

91
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,083
That is a big screw
up, but it's Chiaki.

92
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,333
You sure you really
wanna end it?

93
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,875
Yeah. We're through.

94
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,625
[CHIAKI groans]

95
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,208
[CHIAKI] Still no reply.
Not even marked as "read."

96
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,250
I should stop messaging her.

97
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,583
[KANA] I've been ignoring
Chiaki for a while now.

98
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,375
Should I let it go
and forgive him?

99
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,833
I mean, it's not like he
was trying to be awful.

100
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,625
I'm going to text her one
more time, then I'll give up.

101
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,333
[KANA] I'll forgive him, if he
apologizes one more time.

102
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,583
[CHIAKI]
Would an e-mail be better?

103
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,458
Or would that be creepy?

104
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,458
[KANA]
What's keeping him?

105
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,625
He's messaged me every day since
that kiss. Why not today?

106
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,208
Hurry up and apologize, idiot.

107
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,291
[CHIAKI] Yeah. This is
the best way to do it.

108
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,750
I'll say I'm sorry
with my own voice.

109
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,416
[phone rings]

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,458

[KANA screams]

112
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,250
What? Come on! No way!
Are you serious?

113
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
[gasps]

114
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,875
No! I wasn't able to
read it! What did he want?

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
[CHIAKI]
She's not answering.

116
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,291
And she always has
her phone with her,

117
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,875
even when she takes a bath.

118
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,125
So she must be ignoring me.

119
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,833
[KANA]
It's okay. Don't panic.

120
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,791
I bet that was just
his daily apology.

121
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,041
I can reply to him tomorrow.

122
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,625
[CHIAKI]
Guess I'll give up, then.

123
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
[KANA] But what if that
text was the last one?

124
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,583
What if he's ready to give up?

125
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,333
After how long I've ignored him,
I wouldn't blame him if he did.

126
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
He might even hate me now.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,541
I don't want him to hate me.

128
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,916
He pisses me off sometimes,
but I love him.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And he's my best friend.

130
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,291
I wanna say I'm sorry
for ignoring him.

131

Please. Please turn on. Please!

[KANA'S MOM]
Kana! Are you ever coming out?

134
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,333
Why are you sitting
on the floor naked?

135
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,125
I dropped my phone
in the bathtub

136
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,875
and now it won't turn on.

Don't worry.

I'm sure it just
needs a good whack.

I'm not-- Ah!

Stop it, Mom! What are you
doing? You're gonna break it!

141
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,750
No way! It turned on.

with technology.

He hasn't given up!

Please, please pick up!

on me? What the hell?

00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,125
Fine! Have it your way!

00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,083
No more calls!
I'm blocking you, too!

155
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,083
What happened? Did it die?

Well, that's technology for ya.

00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,333
Did I forget to bring enough
pencil lead for the test today?

159
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,125
I could've sworn I
put some in my bag.

160
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,791
[BOTH]
What if...?

161
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,500
[TAKASE] What if I offered to
give her some of my pencil lead?

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,333
Would she think I had
an ulterior motive?

163
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,083
[KANDA] What if I asked
Takase for some of his lead?

164
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,250
Would that be weird?

165
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,875
Would he think I had
an ulterior motive?

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,541
[BOTH] Then again, I do
have an ulterior motive.

167
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,708
[ENGLISH TEACHER] All right,
class, take your seats.

168
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,791
[KANDA]
Minagawa. Got extra pencil lead?

169
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,916
I do. But I'm afraid that
it's all .4 millimeter.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,250
[KANDA gasps]

171
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
Why don't you ask
Takase for some?

172
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,666
I mean, you're sitting
right next to him.

173
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,333
Well, I could.

174
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
Come on, ask him for some lead.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,666
Minagawa!
Don't say it like that!

176
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,583
[bell ringing]

177
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
[KANDA]
Crap. I'm out of lead already?

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,833
I should've asked
Takase earlier.

179
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,875
What am I gonna do now?

180
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[ENGLISH TEACHER]
Time's up.

181
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,833
Everyone pass your
exams to the front.

182
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,125
Thanks for the lead.
That was nice.

183
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,875
No problem.
Happy I could help.

184
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,958
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

185
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,375
You don't have to.

186
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,541
[sighs]

187
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,666
[MINAGAWA]
They'd sure make a cute couple.

188
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Why aren't they going out?

189
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,041
[KAJI]
Okay.

190
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,083
So if "a" times "x" equals "b"

191
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,458
and "b" divided by
"a" equals "x,"

192
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,958
then what the heck is "x"?

193
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,708
[KAJI'S MOM] So now you do
want to go to college?

194
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,375
But you're a third year?

195
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,541
Aren't you too late to
start studying for that?

196
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,750
Well, I'm studying
'cause I wanna go now!

197
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,958
Ryoko, you know we
don't have money.

198
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,000
Especially not for
a private school.

199
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,833
You don't have to remind me.

200
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,250
[KAJI] I told her I'd find
a way, but she's right.

201
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,833
I've always been a slacker.

202
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,416
And this late in the game, can
I even get in to public school?

203
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,000
I heard that "you-know-who"
is gonna be there too.

204
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,291
[KAJI]
Damn it!

205
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,791
Up to now, I always slept
through all my exams

206
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,500
or just skipped them.

207
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,833
Now that I'm actually trying,

208
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,541
everybody else looks so
much smarter than me.

209
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,958
They're all calm and focused.

210
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,000
Uh.

211
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,000
[KAJI] Maybe I did start too
late, and this is all pointless.

212
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,375
[KAJI]
C'mon, Kaji! Concentrate!

213
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,250
[KYOUKO] Kaji reviewing
notes before a test?

214
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:43,958
That's new.

215
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,458
Yeah, I'm surprised too.

216
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,083
But good on her that she's
taking school more seriously.

217
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,666
You might wanna try
that yourself, Kyouko.

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,041
It's the boyfriend.

219
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Uh?

220
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,333
She's been dating the
student council president.

221
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,166
Didn't you know that?

222
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,541
[CLASSMATE A]
Uh-uh.

223
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,500
[KATORI] Your lady over there
looks a bit tense, Akagi.

224
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,833
Aren't you going
to go talk to her?

225
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,000
Give her a few last words
of encouragement?

226
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,333
No. It's good practice
for the test.

227
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,333
I can't help her.
She'll be on her own.

228
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,083
[KATORI]
Hmm?

229
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,458
You say that,

230
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,000
but you look like you wanna
jump up and run to her.

231
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,833
If I try, you have to hit me.

232
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,958
Knock me out cold.

233
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,583
With pleasure.

234
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,500
[MATH TEACHER]
Time for the test!

235
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,875
Everyone, take your seats.

236
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,458
[KAJI]
Okay. Just stay calm.

237
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,583
Try to remember what
you studied with Akagi.

238
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,291
[AKAGI] That problem you're
working on there.

239
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,500
What? Is it wrong?

240
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,291
After you're done with
it, can I kiss you?

241
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,666
Just die.

242
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,250
[KAJI]
Never mind. Forget it.

243
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,250
[KATORI] If "x" equals sexy,
then "x" equals me.

244
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,625
And done.

245
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,208
[KAJI]
Is this the right answer?

246
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,583
I mean, I think it is.

247
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,041
But wait, did I forget a
step in the calculations?

248
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,083
No. Get outta your head, Kaji.

249
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,958
You reviewed this over and over.

250
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,666
You are going to pass this test
and go to college with Akagi!

251
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,041
[KAJI]
Uh-oh.

252
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,333
I'm not supposed to get outta
my seat so what do I do?

253
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,583
Oh, right! Ask the teacher!

254
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,125
[KAJI] But if I raise my hand,
people will notice.

255
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,375
They'll say to themselves,
"What's that juvenile delinquent

256
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,583
doing taking the
entrance exams?"

257
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,041
"Why is she trying
to go to college?

258
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,000
She doesn't have a chance!"

259
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,916
And they'd be right.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,208
No matter how hard I try now,
it won't be good enough.

261
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,750
[CLASSMATE A]
Excuse me!

262
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,416
Someone dropped their eraser.
Could you pick it up please?

263
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,750
[MATH TEACHER]
Sure. No problem.

264
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,125
I'll come get it for you.

265
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,208
Oh. No, sir. It's not my
eraser, it belongs to Kaji.

266
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,583
[MATH TEACHER]
Ah. Here ya go, Kaji.

267
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,708
It's nice to see you really
applying yourself.

268
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,458
You'll do great.

269
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,250
Um. Thank you.

270
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
[CLASSMATE A]
I know you can do it.

271
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,541
You got this, Kaji.

272
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,041
What's wrong, Kaji?
Are you feeling unwell?

273
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,833
[KAJI]
No. I'm fine.

274
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,625
[CLASSMATE A] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

275
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,875
[KAJI]
I'm not upset!

276
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,125
[MATH TEACHER]
You wanna go to the nurse?

277
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,458
[KAJI]
I said I'm fine!

278
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,708
[SANO]
Can I go to the nurse?

279
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm sleepy.
I wanna take a nap.

280
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,250
[MATH TEACHER]
You can nap in college.

281
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,458
[STUDENTS laughing]

282
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,250
[MATH TEACHER]
Settle down. Back to your exam.

283
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,541
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

284
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,625
[TAKANO, CHIAKI] Next episode:
"Summer Is Coming."
