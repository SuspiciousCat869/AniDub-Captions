1
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,333
[SWIM TEACHER]
All right, last safety check

2
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,666
before we hit the pool.

3
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,083
If you think you
might be sick...

4
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,333
[TAKANO]
During swim class,

5
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,083
whenever I look over at
Sugawara, our eyes meet.

6
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,041
Almost like he was
looking back at me.

7
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,291
It seems like it's
been happening a lot.

8
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:25,041
Is it just a coincidence?
Or was he...?

9
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,500
No. There's no way he'd
actually be looking at me.

10
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,583
[SUGAWARA] Takano just caught
me staring at her again.

11
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,875
I have to stop, or
she'll get creeped out.

12
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,166
But I can't help it.

13
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,083
She looks so cute
in her swimsuit.

14
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,708
I can't take my eyes off her.

15
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,375
[gasps]

16
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,291
[SWIM TEACHER]
Okay. Time for warms-ups.

17
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:47,375
Here we go: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

18
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,208
[TAKANO]
But if Sugawara wasn't looking,

19
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,666
then why do we keep
making eye contact?

20
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,458
Maybe he's looking
at someone else?

21
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,041
[SUGAWARA]
Crap. We locked eyes again.

22
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,833
Now she knows I'm
staring at her.

23
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,125
I guess I should say "hi"

24
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,083
instead of trying to
pretend nothing happened.

25
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,625
[chuckles]

26
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,125
[groans]

27
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,750
[TAKANO] He just waved at
someone. I wonder who.

28
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,458
It doesn't look like anybody
waved back to him.

29
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:18,166
Unless... Was he waving at me?

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,333
That was embarrassing.

31
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,000
[SUGAWARA] What should I do?
Should I apologize?

32
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,291
Yeah. I'll tell her
I'm sorry after class.

33
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,791
[TAKANO] He wasn't looking at
me. He couldn't have been.

34
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,666
I feel stupid for waving back.
It wasn't meant for me.

35
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,791
[SUGAWARA]
But the longer I leave it,

36
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,291
the worse things could get.

37
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,375
I'll try to do it quick,
and not make a big deal.

38
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,333
[TAKANO] I think I'll ask him
who he was looking at

39
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,083
so that next time
I don't get confused.

40
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,250
[SWIM TEACHER]
Two at a time on my mark. One...

41
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,291
Hey, so... I'm sorry about
what happened back there.

42
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,916
What are you sorry for?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,875
Well, you caught me
staring a few times.

44
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,791
And I didn't mean
for it to be weird.

45
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:57,125
Oh, no. You're fine.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

46
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,083
Wait. You interrupted something?

47
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,208
Yeah.

48
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,416
You were trying to
look at another girl

49
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,875
and I got in the way, right?

50
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,208
Was she behind me?

51
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,458
Or was it the pretty
girl next to me?

52
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,125
No. It was you.

53
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,625
[TAKANO]
Uh... What did he just say?

54
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,791
[SWIM TEACHER] C'mon, Takano!
You're holding everyone up.

55
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,750
Oh. Sorry!

56
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,375
[TAKANO]
So it was me.

57
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,833
He was actually
staring at me? Why?

58
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,958
Sure, I'm in a swimsuit,
but my body's not that great.

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,333
There's nothing to
look at. So why?

60
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,083
And why does the thought
of him looking at me

61
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,958
make my heart race?

62
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,208
Hey, Sugawara.

63
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,625
I think maybe...

64
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,958
I noticed you staring
because I was looking at you.

65
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,833
That's nice.
But I'm not Sugawara.

66
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,750
[SUGAWARA]
I told her.

67
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,000
Did you want me to pass that on
to him next time I see him?

68
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,166
[TAKANO]
Mh-mh...

69
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,458
Forget it.

70
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,166
[KANDA]
I told Takase that I like him,

71
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,750
and ever since then,
things have been awkward.

72
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,333
If he doesn't like me,
I can give up on dating him,

73
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,708
but I hope we can go
back to being friends.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,416
Still, I'd rather be his
girlfriend if I could.

75
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,333
[bell chimes]

76
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,750
[TAKASE] It's been a month since
Kanda texted that she liked me.

77
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,541
I haven't be able to
say I like her back.

78
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,000
When I try to talk to
her, she avoids me.

79
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,208
And when I tried to message her,
this was her only reply.

80
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Should I keep at it,
even though she doesn't seem

81
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,750
to wanna talk to me?

82
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,500
Would that just be annoying?

83
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,041
Can I tell her how I really feel
about her? Or is it too late?

84
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,625
[KANDA]
I'll apologize to him.

85
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,083
I'll say I'm sorry and
everything will be normal again.

86
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Here goes.

87
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,958
[KANDA]
Oops! Dropped my eraser.

88
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,958
Here. I got it.

89
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,791
Uh. Thank you.

90
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,875
How are you?

91
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,375
Oh. I've been okay.

92
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,625
[KANDA] This is weird.
How do I talk to him?

93
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,541
I know I used to.

94
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,875
[TAKASE] Okay, it didn't feel
like she avoided me that time,

95
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,250
but maybe it's nothing.

96
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,416
Crap is--

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,666
I mean, class is starting.

98
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,250
[KANDA]
You try to say something to him,

99
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,500
and that's what comes out?

100
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,166
Hey, Kanda?

101
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,333
What's wrong with you?
Did I do something?

102
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541
No. It's me. I'm sorry.

103
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,000
What? No. It's okay.
I'm sorry, too.

104
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,625
No, no. Everything was my fault.

105
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,875
[TAKASE]
No, really, it was me.

106
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,791
No, no, no! It was
totally me! I'm sorry!

107
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,416
I've been meaning to apologize,

108
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,541
but the timing just
never seemed right.

109
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,833
It's okay. There's somethin'
I've been meaning to say, too.

110
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,166
[KANDA] I can talk to him!
I can be honest with him!

111
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
Please, don't worry about it.

112
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,791
I don't really care anymore.

113
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,083
[KANDA] Wait. That may
have come out wrong.

114
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,541
It almost sounded like I
don't like him anymore.

115
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,541
But maybe it'll be
easier to make up

116
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,750
and go back to being friends
if he thinks that I'm over him.

117
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,250
So you really don't
care anymore?

118
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,500
Is that what you're telling me?

119
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,541
[gasps]

120
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,625
[KANDA] Is he asking
because he's relieved?

121
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,083
Or is he disappointed?

122
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,000
But if there's still a
chance, I have to take it.

123
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,583
Um. Would you...?

124
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,375
If it's fine with you, Kanda.

125
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,083
[chuckles] Yeah,
let's be friends again.

126
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,125
[grunts]

127
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,416
Sure. Love to.

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,708
That's a great idea. Really.

129
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,000
It's just that, uh...

130
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,416
[KANDA]
Huh?

131
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,416
That's what I wanted, too,
and I'm so happy about it.

132
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Great. I'm so glad.

133
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,166
[KANDA]
If he's happy, I'm happy.

134
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,666
[TAKASE]
Ah! It's too late!

135
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,041
Why couldn't I have just told
her how I felt about her?

136
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,041
[KANDA] Guess I was being set up
to get friend-zoned all along.

137
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm glad I didn't
lose him completely,

138
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,166
but now I'm not sure how I feel.

139
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,541
Now that things are back to
normal, can we hang out again?

140
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,708
Sure. I'd like that.

141
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,208
[chuckles]

142
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,208
[KAMINE]
The other day in the park,

143
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,875
my boyfriend and I
had our first kiss.

144
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:04,333
But it happened so out of
the blue that I choked.

145
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,750
Who on Earth coughs
on their first kiss?

146
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,000
I wanna kiss him again.

147
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,666
And this time, I'll do it right!

148
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,250
[GODA] Kamine's been acting
a little weird lately.

149
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,333
She's got this look on her face
like she wants to say something,

150
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,958
but she never does.

151
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,166
Is it about that kiss? Is she
mad that I did it so suddenly?

152
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,708
Was it too soon to
have done it at all?

153
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,875
[KAMINE] I wonder if Goda is
planning to kiss me again today.

154
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,416
Maybe I should ask him.

155
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,750
[GODA]
Of course she's mad.

156
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,750
It's not like she ever
asked me to kiss her.

157
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,291
She must be upset about it.

158
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,708
[KAMINE] I really hope he tries
to kiss me like that again.

159
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,666
I don't wanna have to ask
him to. That'd be weird.

160
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,166
[GODA] I can't be impulsive
like that. Not ever again.

161
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,250
Hey, we're back at the park.

162
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,541
And look, Goda, it's empty.
Nobody's here.

163
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,375
Nope. Not a soul.

164
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,625
Just the two of us.
We're the only ones here.

165
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,000
That we are.

166
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,333
It kinda reminds me of
the last time we were here.

167
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,958
That time when we kissed.

168
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,916
Wanna go somewhere else, then?

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
No. I'm fine.

170
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,458
But doesn't this
place bother you?

171
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,958
Why would it bother me?
I love being here in the park.

172
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,625
Don't you like it here, Goda?

173
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,791
Doesn't it make you
wanna, you know?

174
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,041
Nah. I'm good. We don't
need to go any further.

175
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,250
Oh. Well, I'm happy if you are.

176
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,416
Yeah. Happy!

177
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,750
[KAMINE]
Darn.

178
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,791
It doesn't look like he's
gonna go for it today.

179
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,500
Maybe I didn't set
the right mood.

180
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,041
[GODA] She seems pretty anxious
I might try something again.

181
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,375
I should be careful

182
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,583
or she'll think I want her
for the wrong reasons.

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,500
Oh, boy. Today was exhausting.
I'm already sleepy.

184
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,833
Wanna go home?

185
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,083
No. I just wanna shut
my eyes for a bit.

186
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,500
Okay.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,750
[GODA]
She's laying there?

188
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,125
[KAMINE] I can't believe it.
My head's in his lap!

189
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,625
My heart's beating so
fast it might explode!

190
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,416
But if this is what it takes to
get him in the mood, so be it.

191
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,958
[breathing heavily]

192
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,708
[KAMINE]
Oh my gosh. He's sleeping!

193
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,875
He's actually sleeping!

194
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,625
I suppose he must be
tired from practice.

195
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,625
Guess another kiss
isn't in the cards.

196
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,375
[GODA gasps]

197
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,166
Whoops, sorry.
Dozed off for a sec.

198
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,000
Good thing I woke up.
I nearly got ya in the face.

199
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,875
Are you all right, Kamine?

200
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,500
What is it?
Is something wrong?

201
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,208
[KAMINE squeals]

202
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,916
[FURUYA] So, Minagawa, the
other class rep for our grade

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,041
has been telling me she
likes me for months.

204
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,166
I like you.

205
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,583
Please, Minagawa.
Are you serious or not?

206
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,458
[gasps]

207
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,958
Definitely not.

208
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,791
You're not? So you've been
kidding me this whole time?

209
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,791
Wha--? No! I'm not joking.
Don't misunderstand.

210
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,708
I do like you, Furuya.
That's the honest truth.

211
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,250
But this is not
me being serious.

212
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,750
[FURUYA]
Huh? I don't get it.

213
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,208
[MINAGAWA cackles]

214
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,375
You have not seen serious
yet. Not even close.

215
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
But guys prefer "light
and fluffy," don't you?

216
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,208
[FURUYA] Depends on what you're
calling "light and fluffy"?

217
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,500
Usually it's something like:

218
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,000
"Hey, you, you're
so totes adorable."

219
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,291
So you are messing with me.

220
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,541
I like you.

221
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,833
Now see that one was more of a

222
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
"You look so cute
when you're mad."

223
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,708
How am I supposed to
finally answer you

224
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,791
when you act like you're
playing some kinda game?

225
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,583
Wait, you were finally going
to give me an answer?

226
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,166
Well, I never intend on
dragging this thing out forever,

227
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,291
so yeah.

228
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,333
Then I shall seriously listen.

229
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,958
But I can't talk
to you seriously

230
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,791
unless you're serious about me.

231
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,625
If you really think that you
can handle me being serious,

232
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,958
then fine, I'll be
completely serious.

233
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,958
[MINAGAWA yells]

234
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,500
Hey! You're making a
joke out of it already!

235
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not trying to, but this
isn't easy for me either.

236
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,083
Hmm. Okay.

237
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,750
You ready?

238
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,625
Yes.

239
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,291
I like you.

240
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,500
And... I like you, too

241
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,916
Sorry. I take it back.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,875
That one was actually more of a

243
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,916
"I also like your serious face"
kind of "I like you."

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,083
Being completely
serious is really hard.

245
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,625
[FURUYA]
Oh? Was it?

246
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,166
I didn't think it was that hard.

247
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,625
I like you.

248
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,291
I like you.

249
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,500
I like you!

250
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,333
I like you.

251
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,875
I don't know. None of
them feels right.

252
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,833
It's not coming out
how I really mean it.

253
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,541
Maybe I just can't
say it in words.

254
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,375
I'm not sure I understand.

255
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,083
Quick. Close your eyes.

256
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:38,958
Close my eyes?

257
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,875
Just do it.

258
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,958
I can't be serious with
you staring at me.

259
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,541
Are they closed tight?

260
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,416
Now don't open them
again until I say.

261
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,666
Keep them closed just
a little bit longer.

262
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,333
[FURUYA]
Wait, what? She's kissing me.

263
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,333
Is this okay? We aren't
even dating yet.

264
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,333
But I like her. I just need
to make it official.

265
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,500
[MINAGAWA]
Okay. Open them.

266
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,291
So? Was that being
serious enough for ya?

267
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,083
How was that at all serious?

268
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,583
You used your fingers to pretend
like you were kissing me!

269
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,250
Why do you think you
kissed my fingers?

270
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,875
I didn't say that.

271
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,041
You can tell the difference

272
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,000
between someone's lips
and their fingers.

273
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,791
So which do you think
you kissed? Well?

274
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,583
[MINAGAWA giggles]

275
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,916
