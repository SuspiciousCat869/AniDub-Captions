1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,750
Morning, Kana.

2
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,791
[KANA]
Chiaki!

3
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,500
Why'd you ignore
my text yesterday?

4
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,166
I just didn't feel like it.

5
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,375
You're all, "So, what'cha
doin?" like every day.

6
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,791
[KANA]
Oh, shut your hole!

7
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,375
[CHIAKI]
Sorry!

8
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,750
[KANA] Chiaki and I have been
dating for almost a year now.

9
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,666
However, we still
haven't even kissed.

10
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,250
What? You two still
haven't kissed yet?

11
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,541
Well, no. But it's only been a
year. It's still early for that.

12
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,916
More like a bit late.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,041
Hasn't Chiaki said
anything to you?

14
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,541
Not really. He's more like...

15
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,958
Man. I just totally
blew up the bathroom.

16
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,208
[KANA]
Seriously?

17
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,166
--You took a dump?

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,250
--Yeah. So?
--You took a dump?

19
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,583
Everybody poops!
There's a book about it!

20
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,541
[KANA]
You are such a two-year-old!

21
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,833
[KANA]
Now that I think about it,

22
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,291
it's more like we're
brother and sister.

23
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,583
Hey, Chiaki. We get
along okay, don't we?

24
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,625
Bang!

25
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,333
Uh! I've been shot!

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, we're in sync,
that's for sure.

27
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,958
A hundred percent.

28
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,625
Are you happy with how
things are with us?

29
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,625
Relationship-wise?

30
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,041
What? Are you not?

31
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,208
I'm fine, it's just
sometimes I wish things

32
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,875
were more physical, ya know?

33
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,458
Ohh.

34
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,250
Ready to rumble?

35
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,541
I kid! I kid!

36
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,791
[KANA]
Ugh!

37
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,000
No! That's not what I
meant and you know it!

38
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,916
You could've said so
without smacking me.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,916
You're so violent. It's awful.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,041
You just wanna beat me up
for your own amusement!

41
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,833
I'm trying to be serious.

42
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,791
I'm talking about
kissing and stuff.

43
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,750
[CHIAKI] Hold up. Why
would you wanna go there?

44
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,333
It's not like we're dating.

45
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,875
Look, I know it's embarrassing,
but we're in a relation-- Wait.

46
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,000
What'd you say?

47
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,250
Yeah, why kiss me?

48
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,916
Wouldn't that just be
a waste of your time?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,625
Save that stuff
for your boyfriend.

50
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,375
But... you're my boyfriend.

51
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,333
What? Who is?

52
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,125
You are.

53
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,083
Whoa! Back up a sec!
We're dating?

54
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,333
I told you I had feelings
for you last spring!

55
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,166
Don't you remember?

56
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,916
Hey, Chiaki. I just want
you to know, I like you.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Whatevs. I totally
like you more.

58
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,125
I thought we were
doing a bit. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,083
I knew something wasn't right.

60
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,291
You wouldn't even
try to hold my hand.

61
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,416
I figured maybe you were
embarrassed or something,

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,125
but I was okay with that.

63
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,125
Because you've always
been my best friend.

64
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,666
No matter what, you're
right there next to me.

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,166
We hang out all the time.
We make each other laugh.

66
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,166
We've always been close, but
I guess not that kind of close.

67
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,166
What? Kana, why are you crying?

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,833
[KANA]
Because, because...

69
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,125
I've been texting you
practically nonstop,

70
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,833
and smacking you and
horsing around with you...

71
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,583
...as if we were
boyfriend and girlfriend.

72
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,000
Except that we aren't.

73
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,833
[CHIAKI] Then let's be
boyfriend girlfriend.

74
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,250
Is this just another bit?

75
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,666
Hell no!

76
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,583
I've kinda thought about dating
you for a long time now.

77
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,458
But I couldn't tell how you
felt, so I didn't say anything.

78
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,208
But I really do like you.

79
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,250
Will you go out with me?

80
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,958
You mean that?

81
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,208
Absolutely.

82
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,083
I'll be texting you constantly.

83
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,083
Text all you want.

84
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,583
Can I still smack you around?

85
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,000
Sure. Go ahead.

86
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,541
Okay. Then why don't
we give it a try?

87
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,750
[CHIAKI]
Ha, ha! Psych!

88
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,000
That was another bit.

89
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,291
You idiot!

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,666
[CHIAKI]
Bad joke.

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,083
[MATSUURA] I told the guy
I had a crush on how I felt.

92
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
[MATSUURA]
It didn't go so well.

93
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,000
[MATSUURA] I'm gonna go
home and crawl into bed.

94
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,250
[KATORI] Matsuura!
You're not leaving are you?

95
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,000
Where are you going?
We've got club!

96
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,708
Is this sabotage?
Or just skipping? Both?

97
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,833
[MATSUURA]
I'm feeling a little sick

98
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,208
so I thought I'd go home early.

99
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,375
Really?

100
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,625
Because judging by
the look on your face,

101
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,166
I'd have guessed your
heart was broken.

102
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,625
[laughs]

103
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,625
No way!

104
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,250
Did I nail it?

105
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,583
I'm so sorry. My bad.

106
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,333
Should I not've said anything?

107
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,875
No. It's fine.

108
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,666
[KATORI] You told him
you liked him, right?

109
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,875
Yeah.

110
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,333
[KATORI] That took guts.
It's pretty awesome.

111
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,250
I guess.

112
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,958
Too bad he can't see you now.

113
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,083
You're beautiful when
you're embarrassed.

114
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,666
Are you messing with me,
Katori? What's going on?

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm not messing with you.

116
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,416
I'm just trying to figure out
how to get you to stop crying.

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,041
You don't need to do that.
I'm not crying.

118
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, yes you are.

119
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,708
On the inside.

120
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,250
I didn't mean to
hit you that hard.

121
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,541
Hit me as hard as you want.

122
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,750
[MATSUURA]
Huh?

123
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,083
See, while you are
physically hitting me,

124
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,250
you really wanna hit yourself.

125
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,083
You are messing with
me. Knock it off.

126
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,708
I promise you, I'm not. Really.

127
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,083
And didn't beating me up
make you feel better?

128
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,125
[MATSUURA] Wait, Katori
did that on purpose?

129
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,625
Not that I'm going to thank him
for acting like a total jerk.

130
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,875
[KATORI] Anything else
you wanna take out on me?

131
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,541
I'm good for now, but why
do you even care so much?

132
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,916
I'm a senior. You're young and
naïve. I look out for you.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,291
Now, think you can make club?

134
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,458
[MATSUURA]
Yeah.

135
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,291
[MATSUURA]
Deep down, Katori is a nice guy.

136
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,041
Nice. But annoying.

137
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,708
[KATORI]
Great! Then let's get going.

138
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,375
Can't leave the club without
its resident "pretty boy."

139
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,166
[MATSUURA]
Really annoying.

140
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,416
What's up? Come on.

141
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,583
Nothing's up. Now
quit staring at me.

142
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,666
[KATORI]
Uh-oh.

143
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,125
You've fallen for
me haven't you?

144
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,333
Sorry for being so hot.

145
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,000
[KATORI] Huh? Something wrong?
Where's she going?

146
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,625
Am I a badass?

147
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,375
Oh, hi?

148
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,875
[YAMANE] My crush pulled me
aside, and asked to talk to me.

149
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,375
Would you like to have
lunch with me this weekend?

150
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,041
[YAMANE]
What? Why?

151
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,625
I wanted to thank
you for what you did

152
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,666
for me the other day.

153
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,125
I hope you don't
already have plans.

154
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,541
[YAMANE]
N-Nope. I'm free as a bird.

155
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,875
[KURIHARA]
Thank goodness!

156
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,708
Okay then, see you
Sunday afternoon!

157
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,041
[screams]

158
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,750
[YAMANE] Why is such a cute
girl asking out a guy like me?

159
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,791
[YAMANE]
Uh?

160
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,000
[YAMANE]
Did I get here too early?

161
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,250
[YAMANE] I've been secretly
in love with this girl

162
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,708
who takes the same bus as me,

163
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,958
but never been brave
enough to talk to her.

164
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,708
Then the other day--

165
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,625
[YAMANE]
A groper!

166
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,416
Oh good morning, Kurihara!
I didn't know you took this bus!

167
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,166
What a coinkydink!

168
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,291
Hey! How's up?

169
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,666
I mean, what's life
been treating you?

170
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,500
[YAMANE] I thought I'd
totally creeped her out.

171
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,166
I never imagined
she'd wanna thank me.

172
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,041
Wait, could I have imagined it?

173
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,041
'Cause there's no way
she'd 've asked me out.

174
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,666
Yup. Must've been all
in my mind. Case closed.

175
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,958
[KURIHARA]
Sorry I'm late.

176
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,333
[KURIHARA yelps]

177
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,166
[YAMANE] What the hell?
How could she be this cute?

178
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,625
Is something wrong? Why are
you staring at me like that?

179
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,583
Ah! No, I wasn't staring at all!

180
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,750
I don't think you're
cute or anything!

181
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,250
No! That's not what I meant!

182
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,458
I meant your outfit! I think
your outfit's cute! Well...

183
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,208
Don't stress so much, Yamane.

184
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,250
What do you wanna
eat? It's on me.

185
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,375
Eat?

186
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,875
[YAMANE]
What am I supposed to do here?

187
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,916
I know I shouldn't pick
something that's too pricey.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,875
Maybe some cheap fast-food?

189
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,291
How about soba?
Would that work for you?

190
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,708
[KURIHARA]
Yeah! That sounds great.

191
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,750
There's a standing counter
right over there.

192
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,125
What would you like?

193
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,333
Actually, is it okay if
I pick the restaurant?

194
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,041
Uh, sure.

195
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,916
Go ahead and get
whatever you want.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,083
Okay then.

197
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,625
Should we order
something to drink first?

198
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,208
Don't worry. I'll go home
immediately after we're done.

199
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,416
Not a problem.

200
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,916
Of course, it's not
that I want to go home!

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,541
I'd stay with you
forever if I could!

202
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,875
Oh, wait! That was creepy!
Forget I said that!

203
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,583
I'll go home as
soon as possible!

204
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,666
Please don't freak out!

205
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,708
[KURIHARA]
You probably didn't realize it,

206
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,375
but I actually noticed you
on the bus all the time.

207
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,583
[YAMANE]
What?

208
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,125
[KURIHARA]
If an elderly person gets on,

209
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,875
you always give them your seat.

210
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,416
[YAMANE]
Well, with a mug like mine,

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,916
ya kinda have to be a nice guy.

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,416
And the other day,

213
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,708
you came to my rescue when
that guy tried to, you know...

214
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,500
[YAMANE] Forgive me for
reminding you of it!

215
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,166
[YAMANE]
What the hell is wrong with me?

216
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,458
She asked me to lunch
and I'm ruining it!

217
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,166
Has anyone every told
you how funny you are?

218
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,958
[YAMANE] You mean my face?
Yeah, I get that a lot.

219
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,333
I think you have a lovely face.

220
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,833
[YAMANE]
Maybe during the Dark Ages,

221
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,583
but this is the 21st Century.

222
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,708
People can see!

223
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,875
She's got to be kidding.

224
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,833
Or maybe she's just
into dorky mascots.

225
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
Yamane.

226
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,375
[YAMANE] Why does she have such
a serious look on her face?

227
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,958
You've gotta be kidding!

228
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,041
This can't happen to me. No way!
Girls have ignored me for years.

229
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,333
Don't get your hopes up, Yamane!

230
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,250
Would you maybe want to...

231
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,458
[YAMANE] Don't hope! Don't
hope! You'll only regret it!

232
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,000
But what if she really is?

233
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,083
[KURIHARA]
...be my...

234
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,250
[YAMANE]
Wait, I'm not prepared for this!

235
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,458
[KURIHARA]
...boyfriend?

236
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,666
[WAITRESS]
Yes?

237
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,833
We'd like two sodas.

238
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,958
[TAKANO] The other person on
cleanup duty went home already.

239
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,083
This sucks.

240
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,875
[SUGAWARA]
Takano?

241
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,791
[TAKANO]
Oh. Hey, Sugawara.

242
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,125
[TAKANO] Sugawara and I
are in the same class.

243
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,458
Lately, we've been
talking a little.

244
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,958
[SUGAWARA]
You cleaning by yourself?

245
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,000
Why don't I help with that?

246
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,291
No. It's okay.

247
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,000
That's way too much
for one person.

248
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,458
I'll go get a broom.

249
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,500
[TAKANO]
He's a good guy.

250
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,041
What? Why are you
cleaning, Sugawara?

251
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,333
Practice is about to start.

252
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,041
I know. I won't be long.

253
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,208
Okay.

254
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,791
If there's something
else you have to do,

255
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,958
I don't wanna
keep you from it.

256
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,458
Don't worry. It's fine.
I'll go in a bit.

257
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,708
[TAKANO] Why is he so
determined to stay and help?

258
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,500
Does he like doing
school chores?

259
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,000
Or maybe he's a clean freak.

260
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,500
Do you help with
clean up duty a lot?

261
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,333
[SUGAWARA]
Uh, no. Not usually.

262
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,000
But, like, since it was you...

263
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,958
[TAKANO] Since it was me?
I don't understand.

264
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,791
Am I doing a crappy job
and he's afraid to tell me?

265
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,666
Sorry. I'll stop talking
and get back to work.

266
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,916
All right.

267
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,833
[SUGAWARA]
Did she just figure it out?

268
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,541
Just so you know, I didn't
mean anything weird.

269
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,000
Sorry if I made
you uncomfortable.

270
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,875
No. It's my fault for
not realizing earlier.

271
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,458
What do you think I should do?

272
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,916
What to do? I can't tell
you that. It's up to you.

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,208
[TAKANO]
Oh, I see. Never mind then.

274
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,458
But you are helping because
you saw me cleaning

275
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,666
and you noticed me, right?

276
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
Yeah, I've noticed
you too, Takano.

277
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,916
For a while now.

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,041
[TAKANO]
knew it.

279
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,375
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,041
I never really learned
the right way to do this.

281
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,541
That's okay.

282
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,500
I never learned about this
kinda thing either, but still,

283
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,000
moving forward,
what did you wanna do?

284
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,041
I'd like to get better at it.

285
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,041
Better at it? How?

286
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,500
I don't know. I just think
I could clean up better.

287
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,958
Clean up? That's ridiculous!

288
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,666
You're pretty just the way are!

289
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,291
If you say so.

290
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,708
But then what should I do?

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,541
Well, I've been
wanting to tell you--

292
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,916
No, it's probably best
not to rush things.

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,250
You take your time.
I'll wait for you.

294
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,708
[TAKANO] Does that mean
I'm cleaning too slowly?

295
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,708
[TAKANO] I'm sorry this
is taking me so long.

296
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,583
Don't apologize.
You did nothing wrong.

297
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,125
I shouldn't be in such a hurry.

298
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,875
But I'm glad you
know how I feel.

299
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,250
And maybe next time I see you,
you can tell me how--

300
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,666
No. You're right.

301
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,916
I'll learn to clean faster
now that I know the truth.

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,916
Thank you.

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,833
[SUGAWARA]
Hm?

304
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,958
Sorry. What?

305
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,666
It's hard to tell
people these things.

306
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,916
You're a nice guy to
be so honest with me.

307
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,458
Wait, honest about what?

308
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,416
How I need to get
better at cleaning.

309
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh.

310
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,208
Right?

311
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,250
Oh, totally! Cleaning!

312
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,375
That's what we
were talking about.

313
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,666
