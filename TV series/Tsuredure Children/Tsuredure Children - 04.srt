1
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,041
[CHIAKI] My girlfriend found
my stash of American porn,

2
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,708
of all things.

3
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,000
Uh, hey, Kana,

4
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,041
aren't we supposed to
be studying for exams?

5
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,583
Ha! "Study," my ass!

6
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,041
Obviously this is the reason you
asked me to come over today!

7
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,750
No. That's not true at all.

8
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,375
If you're that
desperate and horny,

9
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,416
then let's just do it!

10
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,166
Don't you think
it's way too early

11
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,791
to be taking things
to this level?

12
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,208
Things aren't gonna go anywhere
if you never make a move.

13
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,375
We haven't even kissed.

14
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,416
That's not my fault.

15
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,666
The mood's never
been exactly right.

16
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,750
What are you, chicken?!

17
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,666
[CHIAKI]
H-Huh?!

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,125
Chicken?

19
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,125
Who the hell are you calling
"chicken"? I'm not scared!

20
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:47,208
Then get your butt over here
and let me give you a hickie!

21
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,750
Okay.

22
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,000
[CHIAKI]
Kana's got pretty big boobs.

23
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,458
I really wanna squeeze 'em.

24
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,041
This means I can, right?

25
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,166
Okay. Here goes.

26
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,000
Aren't you gonna kiss me first?

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,791
Wait, never mind,
forget I said that!

28
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,083
No, no! You're right!
We should go in order!

29
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,666
[CHIAKI]
I have no clue what I'm doing.

30
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,083
How do other people handle this?

31
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,625
[CHIAKI]
Just start with a kiss.

32
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,791
She said that's what
she wanted anyway.

33
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,458
How's my breath?
Are my lips chapped?

34
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,125
Am I sweaty? Did I put on
boxers or briefs today?

35
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,333
Should I have shaved my
chest? What if I fart?

36
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,291
Wait, I gotta poop.

37
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,041
You just pooped a minute ago!

38
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,250
Quit stalling already!

39
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,291
I only wanted to make
sure I was prepared!

40
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,541
They say that you're
not supposed to try

41
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,916
and rush this stuff, ya know?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,375
And like, just because
we're dating,

43
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,666
doesn't mean we have
to jump into bed.

44
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,541
[CHIAKI yelps]

45
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,375
[CHIAKI] Kana, a lady
shouldn't be so quick

46
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,958
to take her clothes off
in front of a man.

47
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,416
Shut up, you moron.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,833
I don't just wanna
make out with you.

49
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,208
I want more than that.

50
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,375
I wanna be closer to you and
to learn more about you.

51
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,291
And I want for you
to really know me too.

52
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,458
I just want us to have
an intimate connection!

53
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,208
Kana.

54
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:53,833
[KANA]
Close your eyes!

55
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,208
They're shut.

56
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,583
If you want me to know you,
then why can't I look?

57
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,041
[KANA] Shut up, you perv.
Go turn the lights off.

58
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,125
Just so you know, I don't
have that good of a body.

59
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,250
And I didn't get a chance
to shower today,

60
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,833
so I might be a little sweaty.

61
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,333
You looked smokin' hot when
I caught a glimpse a second ago.

62
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,458
[KANA]
Idiot!

63
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,875
Ow! Hey, that was
a compliment, Kana!

64
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,416
Wait! We can't do this.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,916
I just realized I don't
have any protection.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,958
[KANA] Don't worry
about that. It's fine.

67
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,416
No, it isn't!

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,291
I'll go run out real
quick and buy some.

69
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,750
[KANA]
Wait.

70
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,250
You don't have to. My mom
made me bring some with me.

71
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,375
They're in my bag.

72
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,791
Oh.

73
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,041
So then, I guess we're all set.

74
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,208
[KANA]
Hey. Chiaki.

75
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,708
I love you.

76
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,458
And I love you, too. Kana.

77
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,833
[KEIKO] Chiaki! I brought some
snacks for you and Kan--

78
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,333
Oh, boy, I should've knocked.

79
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,958
I'll just leave these
here for you kids.

80
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,500
You can eat them
when you're done.

81
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:50,083
Honey! Don't come upstairs
right now, okay?

82
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,416
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,250
Don't worry about it.
My family's the same way.

84
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,125
Should we pick up
where we left off?

85
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
Yeah.

86
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,666
I love you.

87
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,000
[KEIKO] Kana, did you take
your pill today, dear?

88
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,333
D'ya need one of mine?

89
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,875
Really, Mom?!

90
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,125
[KAJI] The student council
president caught me smoking,

91
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,291
but instead of turning
me in, he kissed me.

92
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,583
Now we're dating, but only
on condition that I quit.

93
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,000
Damn, I want a cigarette.

94
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:23,125
Wait a sec, why the hell
am I doing this to myself?

95
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,791
[KAJI]
I didn't agree to it.

96
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,791
I never even said
I'd go out with him.

97
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,250
Hello, Kaji.

98
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
Was there something
that you needed from me?

99
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,333
Listen to me.

100
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,833
You may know my weakness, but
I won't let use it against me.

101
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,083
Like when I pay you a
compliment and make you blush?

102
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,416
No! My smoking you moron!

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,125
I never agreed to
quit or date you!

104
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,041
Oh. Well then, let's
make it official.

105
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,750
Hell no! One kiss does
not mean we're dating.

106
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,666
We've kissed twice.

107
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,125
[KAJI]
Whatever!

108
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,541
It's not like that was even
my first kiss or anything.

109
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,583
If you think you can get a girl
that easily, you've got--

110
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,708
I'm going to win your heart.

111
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,750
Tell-Tell me why you're
interested in me.

112
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,916
[AKAGI] Let's start
with physical intimacy.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,750
Come here.

114
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,166
I don't want a hug!

115
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,500
Why do you want to go out with
me? Do you even like me?

116
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,916
I can't say that I don't.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're such a liar!

118
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,208
How can you like
someone you barely know?

119
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,208
You have a point.

120
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,791
I don't know that
much about you.

121
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,291
Well, duh. Told ya so.

122
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,208
Other than all I've
observed at school.

123
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,250
Like what?

124
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,291
[AKAGI]
You don't have many friends.

125
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,958
You're always sleeping in class.

126
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,583
You don't do any after
school activities,

127
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,250
so you could go home, but you
stay and smoke instead.

128
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,500
I caught you out
here on purpose.

129
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,375
You've been on my
mind for a while.

130
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,750
Because what,

131
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,166
you thought I'd let you
sleep with me if you asked?

132
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,500
[AKAGI]
Mh-hm.

133
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,833
You seemed lonely.

134
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,750
So I figured you'd throw
yourself at the first guy

135
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,500
who paid you any
kind of attention.

136
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,375
As it turned out, I was right.

137
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,916
Had I been a player, you
would've been played.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,291
Still...

139
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,666
Even though you're skinnier
than my usual type, I--

140
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,000
[KAJI]
I knew it!

141
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,500
You walk around like you're
all high and mighty,

142
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,500
but deep down you're
a horny bastard!

143
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,458
Yes, I find you attractive
and would sleep with you

144
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,958
if I could.

145
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,833
I see. Then why don't
we just get on with--?

146
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,750
That's why I wanted to
make you my girlfriend

147
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,125
before someone came and
took advantage of you.

148
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,916
Your girlfriend? Dude,
what are you talking about?

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,833
[AKAGI]
I want you to be mine, Kaji.

150
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,333
Let go of me! You're the
student council president!

151
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,041
You could have any
girl that you want!

152
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,291
So why me?

153
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,708
[AKAGI]
Probably because I like you.

154
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
What do you mean, "probably"?

155
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,541
Honestly, I don't know.

156
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,125
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

157
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
This has to be love, right?
If not, you tell me what it is.

158
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,208
How the hell should I know?

159
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,333
Then why don't we
find out together?

160
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,916
If that's all right
by you, of course.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,166
I'm not going to force you.

162
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,666
[KAJI]
I, uh--

163
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,083
What do you say? D'ya wanna try?

164
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,166
I wasn't really looking
to date anyone, but I--

165
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,208
But you what?

166
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,083
I'm, uh, I'm not sure.

167
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,750
Just say, "Yes, Akagi."

168
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,875
It looked so cute and fluffy...

169
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
[FURUYA]
Minagawa told me she liked me

170
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,458
and asked me to go out with her.

171
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,791
But I've been putting off giving
her an answer for months now.

172
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,000
[FURUYA] I really should
give her an answer.

173
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,125
[MINAGAWA]
Hey there, Furuya.

174
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,416
I've waited long enough.

175
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
Are you ready to finally
give me an answer?

176
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,541
But class is about to
start; we can't talk.

177
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,041
That's fine.

178
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,166
See? Now we can
message each other.

179
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,375
So you gonna answer or what?

180
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,750
Please don't say it like that.

181
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,791
When you do, it feels like

182
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,250
you're just playing
with me again.

183
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,416
Sorry, sorry. I'm going to
try and ask more seriously.

184
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,875
What is your answer?

185
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,291
Well, Minagawa. The thing is...

186
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,125
--I, um...
--That's a "no," isn't it?

187
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,791
All right then, if
you're not interested,

188
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,875
I'll stop bugging you.

189
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,250
That's not true, Minagawa.

190
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,833
It's not that I'm
not interested.

191
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,666
I just can't seem to
get the words out.

192
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,708
Are you trying to mess
with me now, Furuya?

193
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,583
Because saying "yes"
or "no" isn't hard.

194
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,791
I swear, I wasn't.

195
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,750
[MINAGAWA]
Forget it. I give up.

196
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,916
Class is about to
start anyway. Bye.

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,458
[FURUYA]
H-Huh...? What just happened?

198
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,666
I didn't think she would
give up so easily.

199
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,416
Then again, what if
this is a ploy?

200
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,333
What if she's acting and
wants me to try to stop her?

201
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,208
[FURUYA]
Idiot! Stupid, stupid Furuya!

202
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,541
I made her wait too long.

203
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,500
Maybe I should try talking
to her after class.

204
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,625
She's been pining for me for
months, she might regret it.

205
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,166
She's not gonna
regret it, is she?

206
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,458
She didn't give up.
She lost interest.

207
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,041
Can't say that I blame her.
I'm so indecisive.

208
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,500
[FURUYA]
How could she tell?

209
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,833
Wait, wasn't she
was angry at me?

210
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,791
[screams]

211
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,916
[MINAGAWA] "Just kidding. I felt
like teasing you a little.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,541
I'm not in any hurry for
an answer. Besides..."

213
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,875
[FURUYA]
"Actually never mind."

214
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,083
[MINAGAWA]
Ah! Thank goodness!

215
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,750
He was actually staring at me.

216
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,916
[TAKANO] My friend, Yoshinaga,
handed me a love letter today.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,625
And begged me to
deliver it for her.

218
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,250
[TAKANO]
Sugawara?

219
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,125
Yeah. What?

220
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,041
I hate to do this in
the middle of exams,

221
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
but we need to talk.

222
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,166
Can you make time after school?

223
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,583
Yeah. Totally!

224
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,916
That's no problem at all!
If you need me, I'm there!

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,333
[TAKANO]
He really is a nice guy.

226
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,041
[SUGAWARA]
A letter? For me?

227
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,500
[TAKANO]
Mh-hm.

228
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,333
Wow. I mean, thank you.

229
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,416
I never thought you'd
write me a letter.

230
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,291
[TAKANO]
I didn't. That's from Yoshinaga.

231
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,708
Oh, that's so nice
of her. I'm flattered.

232
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,125
I just thought...

233
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,708
She asked me to give it to you,
wait while you read it,

234
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,500
and then go back and
give her your answer.

235
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,250
Don't worry. I won't
make you wait long.

236
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,750
I know that this must be
pretty awkward for you.

237
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,333
That's very considerate.
You're so nice, Sugawara.

238
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,041
Please tell her I'm sorry,
but I'm not interested.

239
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,833
There's someone else I like.

240
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,083
There's someone else?

241
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,916
Have you told her how you feel?

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,250
[SUGAWARA] Yeah, I confessed
I had feelings for her,

243
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,541
but she kinda didn't notice.

244
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,333
I didn't realize
that could happen.

245
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,041
You gonna try again?

246
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,291
[SUGAWARA]
Not sure.

247
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,458
She seems to think of me
as just "a nice guy."

248
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,791
She sounds like someone
who's a lot like me.

249
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,416
[SUGAWARA]
Then maybe you can help me.

250
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,708
What if I told you I
had feelings for you?

251
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291
Oh, I'd tell you "No way."

252
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,916
I don't know the first thing
about being in a relationship.

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,125
You wouldn't have
fun dating me at all.

254
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,458
Yeah. That's what I think
she might say, too.

255
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,833
Seriously? Wow.
Sounds like a pain.

256
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,333
Got any suggestions?

257
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,083
Maybe you should try
something that's more obvious

258
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,666
and super hard to miss.

259
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,958
Like make a move on her.

260
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,000
What if you tried putting
your arms around her

261
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,125
and whispering in her ear?

262
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,708
You know, like they
do in the movies.

263
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,750
So then, if someone did that
stuff to you, you'd like it?

264
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,083
Of course not. It's creepy.

265
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,000
I figured.

266
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,541
But you're a nice guy, Sugawara.

267
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,583
So it might be okay
if you did it.

268
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,416
Want more ideas?

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,708
Then we should
be getting home.

270
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,625
Come on. We've got
more exams tomorrow.

271
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,833
Yeah. We need to study.

272
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,000
[SUGAWARA] I've decided to
give up on telling my crush

273
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,958
I have feelings for her.

274
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,250
Oh? How come?

275
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,625
[SUGAWARA]
I'd rather just stay friends

276
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,458
than risk losing her completely.

277
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,541
Like you said, if I tried
making a move on you,

278
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,791
it might scare you off.

279
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,625
Why does it matter that
it could scare me off?

280
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,041
I'm not the girl you like.

281
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,833
[SUGAWARA] If you'd be
creeped out, so would she.

282
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,125
So it's hopeless.

283
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,541
Was it a mistake for me
to have told you that?

284
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,875
Not at all. Your input
was really helpful.

285
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,333
And about my answer
to Yoshinaga's letter,

286
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,333
I'll tell her myself tomorrow.

287
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,833
Really?

288
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,750
You may have been the messenger,

289
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,625
but she had the courage
to say how she felt.

290
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,000
And I have a lotta
respect for that.

291
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,583
That's sweet.

292
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,041
[TAKANO] Sugawara is
so kind and thoughtful.

293
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,125
He really is a good guy.

294
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,875
If I was the one he wanted
to put his arms around...

295
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,500
I like you.

296
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,041
[TAKANO]
...I wouldn't mind.

297
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,083
But that'll never happen.

298
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,583
[GODA, KAMINE] Next episode:
"Watching You From Afar."
