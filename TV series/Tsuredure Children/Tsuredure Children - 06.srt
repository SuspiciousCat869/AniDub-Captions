1
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,333
[AKAGI]
So, if you divide by--

2
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,291
What? I still don't get it.

3
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,208
Akagi... what made you
decide to go out with me?

4
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,958
Akagi? You're supposed
to call me "Masa" now.

5
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,125
Seriously? You're gonna make me?

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,833
I'm not answering till you do.

7
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,750
No more last names.

8
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,916
Masa.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,958
I didn't catch that.
Come closer and say it to me.

10
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,166
Masa.

11
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,916
Hey! I was trying to talk to you
about something important!

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,750
[AKAGI]
You knew I was going to do that.

13
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,791
Be serious! What do you
even see in me anyway?

14
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,375
Huh. I wonder.

15
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,750
Dammit, I'm trying to
have a real conversation!

16
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,625
I'd rather make out,
but if you insist.

17
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,250
What do I like about you?

18
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,833
Your face, I guess.

19
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,083
[KAJI] What? So my personality
doesn't matter to you at all?

20
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,208
But your face is cute.
Wouldn't you agree?

21
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,666
What about what's on the inside?

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,916
Don't you care about that?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
[AKAGI] You are cute,
though. That's a fact.

24
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,208
My cuteness is not the point.

25
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,291
[AKAGI]
You're so adorable.

26
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,250
Ugh! Shut up!

27
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,375
Wait, what if you found
someone cuter than me?

28
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,750
Would you dump me for her?

29
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,750
I guess it's possible.

30
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,833
[KAJI]
Drop dead!

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,416
[AKAGI]
No need to get upset.

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,833
You've got a lot of things going
for you. Your chest for inst--

33
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,083
Face, boobs: That's
all you care about!

34
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,375
You don't give a crap
about who I am, do you?

35
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,083
[AKAGI]
When did I ever say that?

36
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,625
Because I'm pretty
sure I do care about

37
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,916
what's on the inside too.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,041
Then tell me what's
so good about it.

39
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,500
Nothing.

40
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,666
Nothing? Nothing at all?

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,083
Nothing.

42
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,583
You've said it yourself.
You're rude and short-tempered.

43
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,875
Well, excuse me.
Sorry, I'm not--

44
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,208
And you're a real
pain in the ass

45
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,958
when you get
defensive like that.

46
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,041
Oh, yeah?

47
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,916
Then why don't we
break up already?

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,041
[AKAGI]
There goes that temper again.

49
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,375
You're much more than
just rough around the edges.

50
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,166
Shut up! I don't
wanna hear any more!

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,291
But I like you anyway.

52
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,708
Yeah, right. You just
like my boobs and junk.

53
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,666
[AKAGI] I like your
personality, too, Ryoko.

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,541
You're brash,
hot-blooded, feisty,

55
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,875
and you're always telling me
where I can shove things.

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,583
I'm obsessed.

57
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,458
[AKAGI] If you're happy,
you could show it.

58
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,666
Jeez! Shut up!

59
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,250
Fine, but that's the truth.

60
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,541
You're so cute, it makes
me wanna tease you.

61
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,625
Then say it again.
Tell me you like me.

62
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh? You don't want me
to say "I love you"?

63
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,833
Fine then, tell me you love me.

64
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,958
"Would you please
tell me, Masa?"

65
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,375
Would you please tell me?

66
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,458
Please "Masa."

67
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,916
Just hurry up and
say it already.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,041
Ryoko. I love you.

69
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,416
[KANA] Things were getting good
with my boyfriend the other day.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Then we were interrupted.

71
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,041
[CHIAKI] Like, even the
primetime dramas are using...

72
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,750
[KANA] Neither one of us has had
the guts to try and make a move

73
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,208
or anything else since.

74
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,708
It's like we've been avoiding it

75
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,125
and pretending it
never happened.

76
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,958
And I'm not sure why.

77
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,458
Maybe he's embarrassed because
his mom put a stop to things,

78
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,291
but it's not like
that was his fault.

79
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,625
Stuff like that happens.

80
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,666
We could try again
if he wanted to.

81
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,875
On the other hand,

82
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,916
I'd feel totally embarrassed
bringing it up.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
So did you see it?

84
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,666
[KANA]
Hm?

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,958
Uh, what were we talking about?

86
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,500
Bang.

87
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,333
[KANA screams]

88
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,833
The new primetime cop show.

89
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,333
"Bang" is getting old,

90
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,583
so we decided to look for
some fresh material for bits.

91
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
Oh. Yeah.

92
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,416
Let's try it. I'll be a
detective and you be the perp.

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,791
Wait, but I still
haven't seen it yet.

94
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,000
You're gonna be fine.

95
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,500
It's not complicated.
Just follow my lead.

96
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,041
[KANA]
Another bit. Great.

97
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,041
Just what I wanna
be doing right now.

98
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Freeze! FBI! Hands behind
your head, punk!

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,166
I'm unarmed. Don't shoot!

100
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,083
[CHIAKI] Start cooperating.
Shut your eyes!

101
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,458
Ha, ya dumb Fed!
You let your guard down!

102
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,666
[BOTH]
Uhh...

103
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,208
Uh, despicable scum-bag.

104
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,416
Yeah, Mr. FBI Agent.

105
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,416
Uh. I think maybe
we've broken character.

106
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I think so.

107
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,833
[BOTH chuckle nervously]

108
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,958
[KANA] Was he actually
trying to kiss me just now?

109
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,833
[KANA] He was going kiss
me while doing a bit?

110
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,666
No, no, no. You gotta
be kidding me.

111
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,625
Hey! I'm gonna be an alien!

112
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,416
[KANA]
He can't be serious!

113
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,916
And this time,
you be the FBI agent.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,958
Uh. Okay. I'll try.

115
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,541
[KANA] Assuming he really
was trying to kiss me before,

116
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,916
this set up can only
mean one thing.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,875
[screams]

118
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,208
[KANA] Is he for real right now?
What the hell is he doing?

119
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,333
[KANA] Stay back, evil alien!
Stay back, or I'll shoot!

120
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,541
Bang! Bang! Bang!

121
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,541
[BOTH scream]

122
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,125
[KANA]
Has he lost it?

123
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,291
Yeah, something like that.

124
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,041
Still needs work I think.

125
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,625
What's a bit without
a punchline?

126
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,666
We had probably better
come up with something.

127
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,333
Maybe we should.

128
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,541
Let's just go home.

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,958
[KURIHARA] I heard you like
movies, so if you're up for it,

130
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,708
would you like to go see
one with me tomorrow?

131
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,500
[YAMANE]
Well, I'd love to but, you see--

132
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,708
All right! That's great!

133
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,541
See you at the theater.

134
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,291
[MOTOYAMA]
There you are, Yamane!

135
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,583
How did your big exam go?

136
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,416
Hey, Motoyama, good to see ya.

137
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,583
Don't tell me you tanked it

138
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,125
'cause you were thinkin'
about tomorrow?

139
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,958
Tomorrow? Um, I dunno.
What's tomorrow?

140
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,416
You and I have plans
to see a movie, remember?

141
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,791
I've been so excited about it,

142
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,083
I couldn't focus on the
test and totally blew it.

143
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,208
Can you believe that?

144
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,708
Oh, yeah. The movie.
Was that tomorrow?

145
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,291
You didn't forget
about it, right?

146
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,708
We're supposed to see the
new <i>Magic Shin-chan</i> .

147
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,291
[SHIN-CHAN]
Honor and a penis.

148
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,375
I've never missed an episode
in the entire freakin' series!

149
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,333
Could we maybe go the
day after tomorrow?

150
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
Got plans?

151
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,583
They better not be
with a jezebel.

152
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,916
Um.

153
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,416
[laughs]

154
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,833
I was totally joking.
You with a girl? Ridiculous.

155
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,416
Yeah. Absolutely.

156
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,958
[MOTOYAMA] Those vile swine do
not deserve pearls such as us.

157
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,833
Though we are odd and misshapen,
we are no less valuable!

158
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,333
Oh, I know! I hate girls, too.

159
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,916
It was a last minute invite
from another guy friend.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,708
You have other guy
friends besides me?

161
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,291
I didn't know that.

162
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,208
My, uh, my friend
from middle school.

163
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,000
He texted and asked me
to meet him and catch up.

164
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,208
A middle school friend?
Really? You don't say.

165
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,583
If that's the case,

166
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,625
then I hereby release you
from our prior plans.

167
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,000
We are misfits the
world deems repulsive.

168
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,875
Thus, we must treasure the
sacred bonds of male friendship.

169
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,416
I must meet your friend someday.

170
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,958
I don't deserve you, Motoyama!

171
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,916
[YAMANE] You're such a
good friend, Motoyama.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,416
An all-around nice guy,
who's one in a million.

173
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,125
And yet, here I am lying to you,

174
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,333
just to spend some
time with a cute girl.

175
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,583
[KURIHARA] That's great!
See you at the theater.

176
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,958
I'm worthless. I don't
deserve anyone!

177
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,083
I'm sorry, Motoyama!
I'm lying through my teeth!

178
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:54,958
[MOTOYAMA]
About what?

179
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,416
I don't have any other friends.

180
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,791
The only numbers in my phone
are yours and my parents!

181
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,250
[MOTOYAMA]
Say no more!

182
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,958
You are brave to confide
in me such a dark truth!

183
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,250
I'm honored. I've never known
the joy of a bro-mance before.

184
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,791
Yes! I love you, bro!

185
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,333
Do whatever you must tomorrow,
my dearest brother.

186
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,000
If you feel you must
hide what that is,

187
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,500
I shall let you keep your
secret and pry no further.

188
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,125
It's fine. You're like a
brother to me, so I'll tell you.

189
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,500
It's really not that big a deal.

190
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
Just, this girl asked me
to out to the movies.

191
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,166
[yelps]

192
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,666
You see we take the
same bus every morning.

193
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,083
And I sorta saved
her from a groper.

194
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,625
And she took me out
lunch to thank me,

195
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,125
but it didn't go so well.

196
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,541
So I'm not entirely sure why
she wanted to see me again.

197
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,625
You were hiding
a woman from me.

198
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,833
You lied about it. Now
you're ditching me for her?

199
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,375
Motoyama! I'm sorry!
I'll text her and cancel!

200
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,416
Under no circumstances
are you to cancel!

201
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,875
Go with her!

202
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,208
[MOTOYAMA] I need not mention
how much I despise women.

203
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,000
I would like nothing more
than to render blind

204
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,708
those fair eyes that gaze
upon me and find me hideous.

205
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,125
Nevertheless!

206
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,791
How could I possibly find
fault in so pure a maiden,

207
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,458
who would look upon the ghastly
face of my brother, Yamane,

208
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,000
and consider him
worthy to go to lunch

209
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,625
and to the movies with her?

210
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,458
The angel! I'm so happy!

211
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,375
Thank you for being so
happy for me, Motoyama!

212
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,875
So are the two of you
officially in a relationship?

213
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,083
No way. It's nothing
like that at all!

214
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,416
Honestly.

215
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,208
We're just friends, and
even that's a bit too far.

216
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,291
I still haven't the foggiest
idea what she's thinking

217
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,500
or why she wants
to be around me.

218
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,708
I see. So it's merely
a platonic thing.

219
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,166
Hey, Motoyama, why
don't you come with us?

220
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sure she'll bring
her own friends, too.

221
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,375
Could you stand hanging
out with a few girls?

222
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,625
Any friend of my brother,
Yamane, is all right with me.

223
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,458
[HOSOGAWA] A lot of people
ask me for dating advice.

224
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,958
But I've never been
in a relationship.

225
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,125
[sighs]

226
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,333
Why does everyone
come to me for advice?

227
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,125
I wish there was
someone I could ask.

228
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,500
[KATORI]
Come again?

229
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,416
Who are you?

230
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,833
Hang on.

231
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,916
When I talk to girls, I prefer
to do it face-to face.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,875
[HOSOGAWA] What's with this guy?
And why was he up a tree?

233
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,041
Come on out. We're down now.

234
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,250
[KITTEN meows]

00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,166
[gasps]

236
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,666
[HOSOGAWA]
That's why you were in the tree?

237
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,333
You were helping a stuck kitten?

238
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
Not really. I more just
felt like climbing a tree.

239
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,375
So tell me, what's on your mind?

240
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,375
[HOSOGAWA]
You were eavesdropping on me?

241
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,916
No.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,458
You just look a bit like that
poor little stuck kitty.

243
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,541
[chuckles]

244
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
Meow.

245
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,708
[HOSOGAWA] So now I'm some poor
little kitty who needs his help?

246
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,458
Who is this guy?

247
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,625
I can guess what
you're thinking.

248
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,833
"Is he the 'dating
master' I wished for?"

249
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,875
What? You're a dating master?

250
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,208
Bingo. You got it!

251
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,500
[HOSOGAWA]
Yeah, right. Sure.

252
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,333
What do you think you are?
God's gift to women?

253
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,333
Of course not. I only
look like an angel.

254
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,500
It's really more a
curse than a gift.

255
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,000
I've left far more girls
in tears than smiling.

256
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,666
Then again, if I keep calling
myself the dating master,

257
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,583
the gods of love
may strike me down.

[gasps] What's this
strange feeling?

261
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,000
Could I possibly be
falling for this guy?

But go ahead. Ask me anything.

been waiting for?

I can't do that, kitten, sorry.

be everyone's prince.

and you'll get hurt.

the echo of my beauty.

You're wasting your time.

all my fault for being stupid.
