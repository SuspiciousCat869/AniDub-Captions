00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,458
[MOTOYAMA]
My name is Tomomichi Motoyama.

2
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,583
I am a nerd, who's not
remotely good-looking.

3
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,708
My friend asked me to
meet him behind the school.

4
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,458
I wonder what he could want.

5
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,125
What's up, Yamane?

6
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,458
Hey, Motoyama.

7
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,333
[MOTOYAMA]
Uh.

8
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,458
[MOTOYAMA]
This sweet girl is Kurihara,

9
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,958
the kindly angel who has
shown affection for Yamane,

10
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,291
repellant though he is.

11
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,250
You guys are all alone
out here, Yamane.

12
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,291
Why did you want me to
come along and meet you?

13
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,416
Well, ya see, Kurihara
asked me to meet her here

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,416
and it's the first time
a girl's asked to meet me

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
behind the school.

16
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,125
I felt nervous
coming all by myself,

17
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,541
so that's why I asked you.

18
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,416
[MOTOYAMA]
Huh?!

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,625
So here we all are
behind the school.

20
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,000
What did you want from me?

21
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,208
[gasps]

22
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
Oh, I made too much
pudding the other day,

23
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,541
so I thought I would share it.

24
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,208
[MOTOYAMA] She's adorable.
What a flimsy excuse.

25
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,708
Oh. That's nice.

26
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,666
But you really shouldn't
have. I don't deserve it.

27
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,750
[MOTOYAMA]
Wha--?

28
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,000
Poor Yamane.

29
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,750
He's so hung up on
his own hideousness,

30
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,166
he has no idea what
she's trying to do.

31
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,541
Nonsense. Accept it with
the greatest of gratefulness.

32
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,041
I'm sure she made it
with you in mind.

33
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,416
Are you saying she's lying?

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,541
Of course she didn't!
Don't insult her like that.

35
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,250
[MOTOYAMA]
Yamane, you fool.

36
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,458
Maybe I'll have
better luck with her.

37
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,750
Kurihara, please excuse me.

38
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,125
I think perhaps I may have
interrupted something.

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,250
I'll just be on my way.

40
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,250
Uh. No, please. You can stay.

41
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,666
[MOTOYAMA]
What? You're chicken, too?

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,333
Yamane, Kurihara
made you pudding.

43
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,833
Accept it and say "thank you."

44
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,041
[YAMANE]
Huh?

45
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,125
But it wouldn't be fair
if only I get some.

46
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,791
Oh. No need to worry.
I brought two jars of it.

47
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,458
Wow! You brought two?
How 'bout that, Motoyama?

48
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,500
Are you in fact the stupidest
man on the planet?

49
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,083
She made that pudding for you!

50
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,625
[BOTH gasp]

51
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,666
What the heck are you
talking about now?

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,708
Kurihara made extra.
She's just being nice.

53
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,958
Open your eyes.

54
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,500
She asked you to meet
her behind the school.

55
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,083
She's not just being nice.

56
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,500
If you haven't noticed by now,
you're blinder than I am.

57
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,958
She obviously has
feelings for you.

58
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,000
What? That's ridiculous!

59
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,166
She only asked me back here

60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
because rumors
would start flying

61
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,125
if she gave me pudding in
front of the whole school!

62
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,375
Little miss sugar is
offering you her sweets.

63
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,125
Accept it and take
the damn pudding.

64
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,833
How...? How could you?

65
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,666
You're being incredibly
disrespectful.

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
[MOTOYAMA yelps]

67
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
All right. Ya got me.
Point taken.

68
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,291
Huh? What?

69
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,583
How'd I "get you"?
I didn't push you that hard.

70
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,625
[MOTOYAMA] I can see
the writing on the wall.

71
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,875
Your lover has obviously become
more important to you than me,

72
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,541
your best friend.

73
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,166
Now then, if you don't mind,
I'll be on my way.

74
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,041
Yamane has made his choice.
You two enjoy your pudding.

75
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,791
No, Motoyama! Don't leave!

76
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,625
[KURIHARA]
Hang on.

77
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,041
[MOTOYAMA]
Please take a hint already!

78
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,125
My acting is so terrible,
it's embarrassing.

79
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,291
I'm trying to leave you alone!

80
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,750
Motoyama.

81
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,250
Next time, I'll make some
pudding for you, too, 'kay?

82
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,375
[MOTOYAMA] She's even more
caring than I imagined,

83
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,750
practically a saint!

84
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,333
Best of luck, you lovebirds.
I'll leave you to it.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,666
Here ya go. I have to
hurry and get home now.

86
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,083
Thank you. I'll see you later.

87
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,625
[growls]

88
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,125
[GODA] I think my girlfriend's
been a little on edge lately.

89
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,875
Goda, you're strong.
Open this for me?

90
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,958
[GODA]
Here ya go.

91
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,291
Wow. Thanks. That
was easy for you.

92
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,541
[growls]

93
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,458
I wonder what's wrong.

94
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,916
Kamine, did I do something
lately that bothered you?

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,416
Uh, why do you ask?

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,625
I keep getting the sense that
you're somehow mad at me.

97
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,416
No. I'm not mad.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,375
You've done nothing wrong.
Why would I be?

99
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,166
Okay then.

100
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,125
[PATRICIA]
Yo! Takeru!

101
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,833
Let's you and me arm wrestle!

102
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,583
You ready? One, two three.

103
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,916
[growls]

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,125
[GODA]
Despite what she said,

105
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,666
I'm certain she's angry
about something.

106
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,166
Hey! Goda!

107
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,708
[GODA]
I must've upset her.

108
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,500
I'll meet her at our
spot and apologize.

109
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,583
She's not here.
Is she running late?

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,041
[GODA] Is she blocking me or
something? She's that mad?

111
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,041
[KAMINE]
Guess who.

112
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,625
Kamine. It's you. You're here.

113
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,958
Of course. Did you
think maybe I went home?

114
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,541
More like I thought
you were blocking me

115
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
and you were done
with me forever.

116
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,666
Oh. So sorry you thought that.

117
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,583
I wanted to make
you worry a little,

118
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,666
but I guess I was
being a bit mean.

119
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,500
[GODA] You're so angry at me
that you're being mean to me?

120
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,625
I'm sorry, Kamine. We can
just go home if you want.

121
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,708
Don't you wanna stay
and hold hands with me?

122
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean, you held hands
with Patricia in class.

123
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,375
[GODA]
Hm?

124
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,875
Did you not like that I arm
wrestled with Patricia?

125
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,333
Is that why you're so upset?

126
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,875
You could've told me.

127
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,125
You're my girlfriend. I'd have
arm wrestled with you, too.

128
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,583
That's not it! I don't
wanna arm wrestle with you.

129
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,750
In fact, that's kinda
the last thing I want.

130
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,166
What does that mean?

131
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
Forget it. You'd probably hate
me if I told you anyway.

132
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,041
So don't worry. I'm sorry
I troubled you.

133
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,708
There is nothing you could ever
do that would make me hate you.

134
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,458
Understand? I'm your
boyfriend. I love you.

135
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,375
You can always say
anything to me.

136
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,083
You-You really mean it?
Promise you won't hate me?

137
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,708
I won't.

138
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,041
Okay, then.

139
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,083
Don't be too friendly
with the other girls.

140
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,625
Starting today, call me "Ayaka."

141
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,291
And I don't blame Patricia.
She didn't know.

142
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,708
But going forward
I'm the only one

143
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,291
who gets to call you "Takeru."

144
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,333
And don't hold hands with other
girls, not even to arm wrestle.

145
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,916
You can only hold hands with
me. Just me and no one else.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,416
You can help other girls open up
bottles if you really want to,

147
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,125
but if you're nice to them,
then you have to promise

148
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,500
to be even nicer to me!

149
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,625
[GODA]
So that's what it was.

150
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,541
I'm really needy and
demanding, aren't I?

151
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,250
[GODA] It's fine.
Just a little surprising.

152
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,250
It's not fine. I know I'm being
totally stupid and jealous.

153
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,375
[GODA]
Honestly, I don't mind.

154
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,125
Does that mean you'll
start calling me Ayaka?

155
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,458
Uh. Whatever you want.

156
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
Why not?

157
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,666
[CHIAKI]
It's been a while

158
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,000
since my girlfriend
and I started dating,

159
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,041
but we haven't even kissed yet.

160
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,791
I want to, but I don't know
how to make it happen.

161
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,208
Hey, Chiaki, stop for a sec.

162
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,833
What's up, Kana?
Something wrong?

163
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,833
You gotta poop?

164
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,000
No, dumb-dumb! Look over there!

165
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
[CHIAKI]
Uh...

166
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,375
Are those two Goda
and Kamine from class?

167
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,166
They're not super
"lovey-dovey" at school,

168
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,166
but they sure are here.

169
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,958
Um. Hey, Takeru.

170
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,916
Yeah, Kamine? What is it?

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,583
No. Gotta call me
by my first name.

172
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,708
[CHIAKI, KANA]
Didn't Kamine used to be shy?

173
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,250
Oh. Yeah, you're right.
Sorry about that, Ayaka.

174
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,166
Much better.

175
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,541
So what's up?

176
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,833
There wasn't anything.

177
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,458
I just wanted to hear
you say my name.

178
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,750
If you like hearing it,

179
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,791
then I'll say it as
much as you want me to.

180
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,333
Ayaka.

181
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,666
[CHIAKI, KANA] Since when is
Goda thoughtful and romantic?

182
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,416
I guess it's true. People do
change when they're in love.

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,041
You think so? I mean,
you and I haven't changed.

184
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,583
Kamin-- I mean Ayaka.

185
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,166
You've changed since
we started dating.

186
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,000
[KAMINE gasps]

187
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,958
Oh, no. Am I more annoying?

188
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,125
Not a bit. You're
even cuter now.

189
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,375
[CHIAKI] You're even
cuter now, too, Kana.

190
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,125
[KANA]
I'm gonna kill you, Chiaki.

191
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,708
We should get going, Kana.

192
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,708
I don't think I wanna
watch any more.

193
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,250
Yeah, we probably should go.

194
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,416
Then if you don't mind,
can I ask you for something?

195
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,750
[GODA]
Sure.

196
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,750
I kinda... wanna kiss you again.

197
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,166
[BOTH gasp]

198
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,416
You mean right now?

199
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,458
Oh. Do you not want to?

200
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,875
[CHIAKI]
Why would he?

201
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,833
It's broad daylight and they're
in public. Is she nuts?

202
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:10,958
[KANA]
Seriously!

203
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,083
Of course I want to.

204
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,833
[BOTH gasp]

205
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,625
Does kissing actually
work like that?

206
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,000
She says she wants to and he
just goes right in and does it?

207
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,583
No. I think Goda's
got the right idea!

208
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,625
He takes the initiative,
whereas, you don't.

209
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,750
Hey! You're not being fair!

210
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,625
Goda! What was that?
You went before I was ready!

211
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,000
[GODA]
Oh? You weren't?

212
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,333
Goda--

213
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,666
I mean, Takeru, you always
kiss me without warning.

214
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,583
[GODA]
Uh. Sorry.

215
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,541
Well, now it's my turn.

216
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,666
[BOTH gasp]

217
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,500
[CHIAKI, KANA]
No way!

218
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,750
See that?

219
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,083
Kamine was brave enough
to kiss her boyfriend.

220
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,666
Are you saying it's all on me?

221
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,125
What? There's nothing wrong with
a girl making the first move.

222
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,875
Good grief. Come on
and grow a pair already!

223
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,208
We'll do it right next
time. No more surprises.

224
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,666
Yeah.

225
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,750
Guess there's no sense
in fighting it, is there?

226
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,583
Nope. Don't think so.

227
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
Did you want to just kiss
me and get it over with?

228
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,333
Uh. I'm okay with
doing it if you are.

229
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,458
Okay. On the count
of three, we kiss.

230
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,416
On the count of three.

231
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,041
One, two, three, go.

232
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,500
[KAMINE] Hey, look!
It's Chiaki and Kana.

233
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,791
Hey, Goda! Hey, Kamine!
What a surprise.

234
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,708
[GODA] Yeah. What are you
and Kana doing here?

235
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh. Just passing by.

236
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,875
What were you and Kamine up to?

237
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,666
We, um...

238
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,166
...were also passing by.

239
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
[BOTH]
What a coincidence!

240
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,458
[CHIAKI] I invited
Kana over after school.

241
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Hey, Mrs. Uchimura!

242
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,333
[CHIAKI]
Uh, she's not here. No one is.

243
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,625
Huh?

244
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,750
[CHIAKI] I'm finally
gonna kiss my girlfriend!

245
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,208
Yeah. My family's
away on vacation.

246
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,458
So you can stay all
night long if you want to.

247
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,791
[CHIAKI]
Or maybe we'll go even further.

248
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,166
Well, Mom said I have
to be home by eight.

249
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,291
Oh, okay.

250
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,541
[KANA] Dammit, Chiaki.
We still haven't even kissed.

251
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,583
I mean, I assumed maybe
we would make out,

252
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,833
but not more than that.

253
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,125
[KANA sighs]

254
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,375
[KANA] Crap. Did I put on my
good bra and undies today?

255
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,416
[CHIAKI] I have till eight.
I have till eight. All right!

256
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,791
So, uh, wanna study
for the physics test?

257
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,041
[KANA]
Sure. Good idea.

258
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,333
Uh, d'ya think I should I
turn on the air conditioner?

259
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,791
Yeah. Why not? I guess
it is warm in here.

260
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,041
[CHIAKI]
What am I doing?

261
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,708
I decided to make a move
today and I meant it!

262
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,250
Hey!

263
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,083
What's wrong?

264
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,333
Ki-Ki-i--

265
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,083
Kinematics, you think
that'll be on the test?

266
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:27,916
Maybe.

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
Ki-Kinetic Energy, too?

268
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,458
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it will.

269
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,166
[CHIAKI]
Uh! It's getting late!

270
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,666
Wow. Studying hard
sure makes you thirsty.

271
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,375
I'm gonna get us
something to drink.

272
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,000
[KANA]
Oh. Okay.

273
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,041
[CHIAKI] I'm about to
strike out yet again.

274
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,708
Why can't you just
go for it, Chiaki?

275
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,750
You're running out of time!

276
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,375
[KANA] Where is he?
We don't have much time.

277
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,000
To make it home at eight,
I have to leave by seven.

278
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,625
Then again, I do want the mood
to be right for our first kiss.

279
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,416
And these things
can't be rushed.

280
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,875
[burps]

281
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,000
What's wrong with you, Chiaki?

282
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,083
Nothing's wrong with me.

283
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,375
What happened to the drinks?

284
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,208
And why's your face all red?

285
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,416
Kana, kiss me. You know
you really want to.

286
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,083
[KANA]
He reeks!

287
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,000
Kana--

288
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,125
Hold on a sec!

289
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,875
Did you get drunk downstairs?

290
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,833
I'm not gonna kiss you
like this! You're wasted!

291
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,500
But you keep saying you want
me to show some initiative.

292
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,333
That doesn't mean I wanted you
to go and get totally smashed!

293
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,125
Our first kiss is supposed
to be something

294
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,666
that both of us
remember forever.

295
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,833
Kana!

296
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,333
Back off! Get away!

297
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,791
Listen to me. I do wanna
kiss you, Chiaki.

298
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,250
But I wanna kiss the
normal you, not this.

299
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,625
I don't need a pretty setting,

300
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,291
and the mood doesn't
have to be perfect.

301
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,583
None of that matters.

302
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,333
All I want is a regular
kiss with the real you.

303
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,625
You're absolutely right.

304
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
I shouldn't be drunk
when I kiss you.

305
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,458
Chiaki.

306
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,500
[CHIAKI]
Psych! It was all an act!

307
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,000
Huzzah! I finally
kissed my girlfriend!

308
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,291
[KANA]
You're despicable.

309
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,875
[CHIAKI grunts]

310
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,208
Why ya bein' all serious-like?
Come on. Ya gotta play along.

311
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,833
Next time why don't you
start by acting like

312
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,708
you're getting attacked
by an evil space alien?

313
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,458
Or how about you just
scored on a penalty kick

314
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,166
and won the big game?

315
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,416
Ow, that hurt.

316
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,625
I'm going home.

317
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,541
Why? Are you actually upset?

318
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,875
I was just doing a new bit.
Didn't ya like it?

319
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,208
I'm done. I'm so done
with this duo!

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,166
What did she say?

321
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,041
If that was a set-up for
a joke, I don't get it.

322
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,416
Kana?

323
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,291
