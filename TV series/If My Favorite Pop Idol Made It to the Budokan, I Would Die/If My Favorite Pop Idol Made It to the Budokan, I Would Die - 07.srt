00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,942
It's the last day.
Popularity voting ends today!

160
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:03,900
[FAN A]
Ten Makis!

161
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,108
[FAN B]
Twenty Yukas!

[FAN C]
Two Ayas!

A hundred Reos!

164
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,317
Look, Reo. Please don't worry.
I made a promise.

165
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,650
So no matter what, I'll make
sure you take number one.

166
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,150
You're the best.

167
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,525
I believe in you, Kumasa.

168
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,775
[MAKI]
Thanks so much for coming!

169
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,608
Aw, Motoi. Thanks for
coming to see me again.

170
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,442
There aren't as many
people in my line now.

171
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:31,567
It means a lot.

172
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,983
Sure!

173
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,442
[MOTOI] None of these
morons has any idea

174
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,025
that the rumors are a lie!

175
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,025
I'll have her all
to myself soon.

176
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:40,067
Advantage: Motoi!

177
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,483
Right, send it over
to the agency now.

178
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,692
[MAINA]
I can't believe it.

179
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:46,317
Eripiyo really didn't come.

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,025
--[RENA] Maina.
--[gasps]

181
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,400
[MAINA]
Oh, hi, Rena!

182
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,942
How are you? By yourself today?

183
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,150
No, with my brother.

184
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,650
Oh, of course.

185
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,608
Awesome show. You were so cute
up there again, as usual.

186
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,233
Really? Well, thank you.

187
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,692
[AYA] I still think I'll
be on the front row.

188
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,275
[MAINA] If Eripiyo doesn't
come to see me here,

189
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,942
then where will I ever see her?

190
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,025
[gasps]

191
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,275
[ERIPIYO coughing]

192
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,692
[OLD MAN]
Oh, she's awake!

193
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,400
[OLD WOMAN]
You okay there, girl?

194
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:22,858
[ERIPIYO]
Where am I?

195
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,733
Well, we found you drifting
down the channel earlier.

196
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:28,608
You were just a-bobbin' up
and down like an apple.

197
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,317
Yup, that's right,
and mutterin',

198
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,108
"Today's the last day,"
or something.

199
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,233
Whatever that means.

200
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,400
Last day?

201
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,525
[gasps]

202
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:37,942
Nothing broken?

203
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,817
Not sure. Ambulance
is on its way.

204
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,483
[ERIPIYO]
If nothing's broken, I'm fine.

205
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,608
Sorry if I caused any trouble!

206
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,358
[ERIPIYO]
Um...

207
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,483
Can I still buy CDs?

208
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,817
[MISAKI] A demon!
Oh, Eripiyo, it's just you.

209
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,400
[ERIPIYO] Let me buy merch.
Let me buy merch...

210
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:17,150
But the deadline
has passed already.

211
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:20,733
Even if you did buy merch,
it's not gonna count!

212
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,192
It's okay.

213
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,692
I just wanna buy her stuff.
For Maina's sake.

214
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,067
It's not about the contest.

215
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,567
[KUMASA]
Man, Reo was amazing.

216
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,275
Like, did you see her smile?

217
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,442
Yeah!

218
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,108
Ya know, I think I
connected with Sorane

219
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,983
even more than usual today!

220
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,775
I love Reo.

221
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,733
Eripiyo?

222
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,900
What happened?
You're super late!

223
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,442
I figured you
might be late today,

224
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,025
and I totally considered buying
some of Maina's CDs for you,

225
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,692
but I figured you would tell me
there was no point in doing that

226
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,858
if you didn't buy them
with your own money,

227
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,442
so I didn't do it, and I--

228
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,942
[ERIPIYO]
Shut up, liar!

229
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:56,067
All other fans are sworn enemies
during popularity ranking!

230
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,692
[ERIPIYO] I worked so hard
for this, and all for nothing.

231
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:06,275
I at least wanted the chance
to tell her it was worth it.

232
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,775
That I wasn't working too hard
because it was for her,

233
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,817
so I enjoyed it.

234
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,442
Yeah, awesome! I got two SSRs!

235
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,192
[MISAKI]
Maina? You here?

236
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,233
Listen, Eripiyo stopped by.

237
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,483
Wait, what do you mean?
So she was just here?

238
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,483
Yup, downstairs.

239
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,150
[MISAKI] I told her the
deadline had already passed

240
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,067
so they wouldn't count as votes,

241
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,233
but she bought all
your CDs anyway.

242
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,650
[gasps]

243
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,942
[MAINA]
I'm so confused.

244
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,192
Eripiyo wasn't at
our show today.

245
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,233
[MISAKI]
She was drenched with sweat,

246
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,692
so I'm guessing something
must've gone wrong.

247
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:53,733
You've got one devoted
fan in that girl.

248
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,650
[MAINA] I wonder if she
already got on the train.

249
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,983
Probably so.

250
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,108
I'm an idol, anyway.

251
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:10,483
So I can't see Eripiyo unless
she comes to an event.

252
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,442
I hate that!

253
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,692
[gasps]

254
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,650
Eri--!

255
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,442
[MAINA]
My CDs!

256
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:35,858
She makes me... so happy!

257
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:39,983
The next time she comes to shake
my hand, before anything else,

258
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,942
I'll tell her how
she makes me feel!

259
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,817
[MOTOI]
The day has finally come.

260
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,692
[MOTOI chuckles]

261
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,858
Yeah, I guess.

262
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:58,400
[MOTOI] Hey, Eripiyo. Which one
of these do you like best?

263
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,192
[ERIPIYO]
Eh. Either one is fine.

264
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,400
Could you try to take
this seriously?

265
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,233
[ERIPIYO] I think it's fine
for you to get her a gift

266
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,983
to say congrats for the ranking,
but why's it gotta be clothes?

267
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,900
I stole the idea from Fumi.
You know, the Yuka stan.

268
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,525
Apparently, if you
get them clothes,

269
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:15,567
there's a pretty good
chance they'll wear 'em.

270
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,442
Wow, that's totally
hot. I'm melting.

271
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,692
[MOTOI]
Do I detect a sarcastic nuance?

272
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:24,067
Your face doesn't match
your words at all!

273
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,942
I need some assistance here,

274
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,442
but I'm scared to ask
the employees for help.

275
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:32,525
I know! They don't seem too
eager to talk to me, either!

276
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,775
Well, you don't look like
you're here to buy clothes.

277
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,358
Why would they
wanna talk to you?

278
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:38,608
Here's an idea.

279
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,733
Why don't you buy Maina
something nice to wear?

280
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,400
[ERIPIYO]
I can hear her now.

281
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,775
There's no way I'm wearing that!

282
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:47,525
Uh-huh. Just like with
the millet dumplings.

283
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,358
You poor thing.

284
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,817
[EMPLOYEE A] Looking for
something in particular?

285
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,858
[MOTOI]
Uh. Something for a girl?

286
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:55,817
So I'm assuming it's a gift.

287
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,108
Yeah.

288
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,317
[EMPLOYEE A] I'm guessing
for your girlfriend?

289
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Huh?

290
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,442
Okay, mind telling
me how old she is?

291
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,067
And her size if you know it.

292
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,483
Oh, she's 18,
158 centimeters tall.

293
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,358
She's slim with short hair
and plays tennis.

294
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:09,442
She looks great with black hair,
and her eyes are kinda cat--

295
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,275
Okay, small or medium.

296
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,525
What kind of clothes
does she usually wear?

297
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:17,025
Let's see. Stylish, but
casual at the same time.

298
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:17,983
Ah, gotcha. Well...

299
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,400
[ERIPIYO]
That seems like fun.

300
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:22,942
[ERIPIYO]
Pardon me.

301
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,483
[EMPLOYEE B]
Huh?

302
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,108
I need help finding a gift for
someone, if you don't mind.

303
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, sure.

304
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:29,942
[EMPLOYEE B]
A tracksuit?

305
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,233
Okay, Who's the gift for?

306
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,650
Who's it for?

307
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,192
[ERIPIYO]
How do I answer that?

308
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,108
What is Maina to me?

309
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,775
Well, that's actually a pretty
difficult question to answer.

310
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,150
A hundred fifty-two centimeters.

311
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,108
Blood type A positive,
a slim build and long limbs,

312
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,483
hair about like this,
and the cutest face!

313
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,900
She's basically like
an angel on earth!

314
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,567
[EMPLOYEE B]
An angel?

315
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,692
[EMPLOYEE B]
Maybe this is some

316
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,983
unhealthy sister
dynamic or something.

317
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,567
[ERIPIYO] But her wings
haven't grown in yet,

318
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,733
so no need to worry
about clothes

319
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:58,317
with wing holes in the back.

320
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,192
[EMPLOYEE B] Okay...
What do you think about this?

321
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,775
[KUMASA]
Yo!

322
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,942
My shift went longer
than I expected.

323
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,567
Hey, glad you could join us.

324
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,275
Oh, have you two been doing
some shopping together?

325
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,942
Whaddya get? Any presents
for Reo's birthday?

326
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,858
Her birthday was more
than a month ago, dude.

327
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,817
No, no. I celebrate her birth
every day of the year!

328
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,525
I agree. We celebrate them
all the time! Always!

329
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,817
Whatever, can we
just go in already?

330
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,067
Yeah!

331
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,942
Maybe the 30,000 or so
home-bound Maina fans

332
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,775
came through and voted
to get her to first place

333
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,525
where she belongs!

334
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,067
[ERIPIYO groans]

335
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,483
I'm not sure if I can do this.

336
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,983
'Cause if I give
her this present,

337
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,192
I'm going to want
something in return.

338
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,233
It's true!

339
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,483
But I'm not doing this

340
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,608
because I want something
from Maina, you know?

341
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,233
And yet, if she ignores you
after you give her your gift,

342
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:52,900
that's gonna feel pretty crappy.

343
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:55,608
Listen! I admit that I
expect something in return!

344
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,983
Hey! Please deliver this
present to Sorane for me?!

345
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,108
[FUMI]
Aw, we got ignored again.

346
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,483
[BOTH]
Huh?

347
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,150
Are gift certificates
to cafés not allowed?

348
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,275
Welp, that puts a
damper on my plans.

349
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,233
Wait, you were gonna
get her one of those?

350
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:14,942
I mean, it's not like I have any
idea what Sorane actually wants.

351
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:18,150
I wish she would just write
about it in her MC on her blog.

352
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,608
[ERIPIYO groans]

353
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:23,275
I wouldn't be caught dead
wearing something like that!

354
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,275
[ERIPIYO] Maybe I'll wear
it myself instead.

Ooh! Oh, yeah!

00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,358
Look, you guys! There's Reo!
She's in the center!

358
00:17:58,442 --> 00:17:59,858
Yeah, so what's new?

359
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,567
This is different!

360
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,733
This center is the most
special center of all!

361
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,192
It's symbolic! It represents
the hard work of her fans!

362
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,900
Hello, everyone. I'm Reo.

363
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:16,483
I won first place, but I have
mixed feelings about it.

364
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,442
But I'm standing here right
now because of all my fans.

365
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:22,192
So thanks for voting for me.

366
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,108
We believed in each
other, and I'm glad.

Thank you again, from
the bottom of my heart!

Hey, everyone, I'm Maki.

370
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,400
I came in second place in
the ranking. What an honor!

00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,483
I promise that I'll
keep doing my best.

Yeah, go Maki!

Third place? You guys rock! Hah!

I'm so pumped I'm
in the front row!

376
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,525
I mean, I was pretty sure I
would be up here all along,

but still.

Hello, there, I'm Yumeri.
Thanks to all who voted!

You got me the
fourth-place spot!

I had trouble finding
my confidence at first,

but I will do my best to
live up to your belief in me.

So I'm going to work hard.

Am I the only true Maina fan
left on the battlefield?

409
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,775
Did you actually believe
that they existed?

410
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:27,108
Eh, in any case, Maina
seems to be taking it well.

411
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,275
Her face is blank.

She always looks like that.

[KUMASA]
Hey. Is somethin' wrong?

414
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:42,483
I dunno. I always tell
Maina things about myself.

415
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,108
Things that make
me happy or sad,

416
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,233
I share them when I see her.

417
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,650
But I wonder,
does Maina have somebody

418
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:52,192
that she can talk to when
she's feeling down like this?

419
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,817
Well, in the end
a fan is just a fan.

Although Reo's happiness means
more to me than anything.

How should I tell her?

how I felt that day.

Uh, so... I feel really happy.

425

[ERIPIYO] It seems like Maina's
trying to say something.

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,817
Makes sense, I guess.

in the center and I didn't.

I wish I could have done more
to get you first place.

is supposed to know

that Eripiyo bought my CDs
after the performance.

I'd better not
mention that part.

I have woken up faster?

Eripiyo worked for me
this whole time.

down and I'm sorry.
