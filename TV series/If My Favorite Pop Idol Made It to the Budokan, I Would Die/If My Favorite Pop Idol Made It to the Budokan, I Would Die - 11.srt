super exciting news to share!

It's scary, true.

But still, if we can just
clear this hurdle,

31

Hello to all of Okayama and
Kagawa! Nice to meet you!

First Reo was on TV, and now,
Maki's following suit!

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,859
The front row sure does
get preferential treatment.

42
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:24,277
So, does that mean
Maina's gonna get

43
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,820
her big TV debut soon, too?

44

I mean, she did make
it to the front row.

Not that I got to witness that.

I'm here today to share
some exciting news with you.

My group, ChamJam,
is appearing in a festival.

I would love for all of you

They really seem to be pushing
this Maple Doll group.

Well, I mean,
it does make sense.

They're the top-billed group
at this festival, after all.

57
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,225
They're from Hiroshima,

58
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,227
but they've already had a
debut with a major label.

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,854
And I heard they even hold a
concert in Tokyo once a month.

[ERIPIYO]
Huh.

to Maina, so I had no idea.

The center is Mei.

63

And, in fact, it just so happens

idol group Reo was a part of.

[KUMASA]
Yeah... at the time,

67
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,705
Yoshimune invited me to come
with him to one of their shows.

68
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,289
See, he was a Mei fan,

69
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,875
and since I was at the show with
him, I got into her line, too.

about that day or let it go.

about Reo that long, honestly.

just ignore my despair?

468
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,837
and soft when I shake it.

469
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,173
Part Five: She never fails
to find something

470
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:49,799
cute and fun to blog about.

471
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,885
Part Six: Even though
she didn't do well

472
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,137
in the popularity ranking,
she didn't let it faze her

473
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,430
and kept smiling.

474
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,974
Part Seven: When she says hello,

475
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,643
it's the sweetest sound
to ever bless my ears!

476
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,020
Part Eight: When she bows,

477
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:05,190
we get to see how adorable
the top of her head is.

478
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:19,704
This is so sweet.

479
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:23,625
But I'm nothing without all
the other members of ChamJam.

480
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,192
[YOSHIKAWA grunting]

481
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,402
[MISAKI] Mr. Yoshikawa,
what in the world are--?

482
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,404
[YOSHIKAWA] Readying my
stopwatch for the festival.

483
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,947
[MUROTA] Next episode's
the last one, you know.

484
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:19,908
[YOSHIKAWA] Man!
I was gearing up for more!

485
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,242
[MUROTA]
What, so you could say,

486
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,536
"Thank you! Your time's up!"
a dozen more times?
