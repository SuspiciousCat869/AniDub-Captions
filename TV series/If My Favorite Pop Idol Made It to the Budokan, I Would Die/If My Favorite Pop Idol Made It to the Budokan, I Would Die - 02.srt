1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,942
[KUMASA]
So, Eripiyo?

2
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,150
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah?

3
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,067
[KUMASA] Promise you
won't freak out, okay?

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,567
[ERIPIYO]
Okay?

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,483
[KUMASA]
Cham is... gonna be in this.

6
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,983
Okayama Girls' Festa?

7
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,483
You mean the one single
event that can draw

8
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,483
all the girls in Okayama?

9
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,192
[KUMASA] It hasn't officially
been announced yet, but still.

10
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:47,983
I found this flier in my
newspaper, so it's likely.

11
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,442
Ah, finally!

12
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,983
I can't believe I'll get to see
Maina walk that runway!

13
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:55,233
Aw, yeah! And Reo's gonna
look amazing up there!

14
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:57,525
[ERIPIYO]
Wait, did it say...?

15
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:03,775
I knew it. That's so typical.

16
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:05,275
Lame.

17
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,983
Only Reo, Sorane, and Maki
will be in it--the top three.

18
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,608
Nope. Have fun feeling
awkward there by yourself.

19
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,358
Ugh, and with all those
squealing girls?

20
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:12,942
That's so gross.

21
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,275
[KUMASA]
Come on.

22
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,692
Maina might be able to go,
too, ya never know.

23
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,025
[ERIPIYO]
What do you mean "too"?

24
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:19,983
You never have to worry
about Reo being included,

25
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:21,442
and it shows.

26
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:23,233
[KUMASA] Please, Eripiyo,
I wanted us to go together.

27
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,983
[ERIPIYO] You just want me
there 'cause I'm a girl!

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,067
Admit it!

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,317
If I'm with you,

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,692
you won't look like such
a creep for being there.

31
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:29,733
Don't act so innocent!

32
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,400
No, it's not like that.

33
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:34,317
You and I have known
each other forever!

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,692
And anyway... I literally
have nothing to wear.

35
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:42,317
You know, I remember when you
used to wear decent clothes.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,733
[MOTOI] My little sister and I
are going to that together.

37
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:45,900
[BOTH]
Hm?

38
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,692
Her best friend is
actually in the show.

39
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,858
She scored the tickets for us.

40
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,275
[ERIPIYO]
Motoi shows up out of nowhere

41
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,442
and owns us with his sister!

42
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,858
[ERIPIYO] I gave it some
thought for about two seconds.

43
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,025
There's no way I can go
to the Girls' Festa.

44
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,567
Like I said, nothing to wear.

45
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,567
[KUMASA] Ha! Your tracksuit's
never stopped you before.

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,483
[YOSHIMUNE]
Oh, hey.

47
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,942
Kumasa, is that you over there?

48
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:38,983
Well, well.

49
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,692
Ha! I knew it!
Been a while, right?

50
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,442
Never thought I'd run into
you here. Are these, uh...?

51
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,025
[KUMASA] Oh, these are just
my fellow Cham Jam stans.

52
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,817
Ah. Interesting.

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,483
Still chasing after Reo,
then? Good for you.

54
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,983
I'm into a group called
Maple Doll these days.

55
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,567
Ah, that's cool.

56
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,983
[YOSHIMUNE]
Yep.

57
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,692
Well, I'm glad to see you
and I are still out there

58
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,942
livin' our best lives.

59
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,608
Welp, see you on the flipside.

60
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,067
[ERIPIYO]
Who was that guy?

61
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,900
Just a part of my old crew.

62
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:10,150
I see. He was a fan
of Reo's old group.

63
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,900
Wait, the one before Cham?

64
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,567
Yeah. That one.

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,025
Ah, the good old days.

66
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,358
When Kumasa was still just
another rando to me.

67
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,942
Uh-- Hey!

68
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,983
[giggles]

69
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,608
[KUMASA] Hey, miss, I'm pretty
sure she just waved at you.

70
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:34,942
[ERIPIYO]
Uh. Huh?

71
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,858
Maina... She's the girl
in the salmon pink dress.

72
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,567
Let's see the flier.

73
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,275
Yeah. Maina.

74
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,025
So, which one of the girls
are you here to see?

75
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,858
Her name's Reo. She's the
pink one in the center.

76
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:54,025
Before, she used to be part
of an indie idol group

77
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,567
that gained a lot of popularity.

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,400
But then that group
broke up kind of abruptly.

79
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,942
So she joined this one,

80
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,608
which is more of an
underground sensation.

81
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:06,692
And now, she gets to
be front and center.

82
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,858
She was always off
to the side before.

83
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,650
I can't tell you how
happy that made me,

84
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,858
because I've been supporting
her for three years now.

85
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:19,233
[ERIPIYO]
So, um, what about Maina?

86
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,858
Will she ever be center?

87
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,108
[KUMASA chuckles]

88
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:24,692
I don't think so, not as
long as Reo's around.

89
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,108
And, so, there you have it:

90
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,525
The story of Maina and
I's fateful first meeting.

91
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,942
[KUMASA] I'm confused
as to how you managed

92
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,900
to make this whole
story about you!

93
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,650
No. It's not, it's
about Maina and me.

94
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,817
[MOTOI chuckles]

95
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,317
[KUMASA]
Listen.

96
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,858
I know that...

97
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:54,442
I know that I'll never, you
know, be anybody's number one.

98
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,025
And so,

99
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:59,400
I wanna do my best to love
her more than anyone else.

100
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,150
Hey, look.

101
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,400
Huh?

102
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,858
[GIRL B] Those two
seem really out of place.

103
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,108
[GIRL A] Maybe some idols
are performing or something.

104
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:18,025
[GIRL C]
Oh, so they're superfans?

105
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,942
[KUMASA] The embarrassment
I'm feeling is on another level!

106
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,192
It's way worse than their
regular outdoor shows!

107
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,108
Hey, pull yourself
together, man.

108
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,775
I tried to blend in
like a normal girl

109
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:28,150
and put all this stupid
crap in my hair!

110
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,608
Also, I wore this yellow shirt.

111
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:30,983
I thought it would really
bring out the red

112
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,817
in my tracksuit, you know?

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,567
Are you crazy?
That's a Cham shirt!

114
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,733
I've never seen you wear that,

115
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,317
so why the hell are
you wearing it now?

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,817
For your information,

117
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,733
I didn't want to wear it,
since it's not Maina's color!

118
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,983
But these are the only
clothes I have!

119
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,442
[GIRL C]
Tsk, tsk. Tsk, tsk.

120
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,650
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Gloom.

121
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,067
[KUMASA] Might not look it,
but I'm actually wearing

122
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,442
designer brands from
head to toe, so there.

123
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,067
I can feel your judgement. Stop!

124
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,442
[FANS cheering]

125
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,358
[GIRL C]
So cute!

126
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:05,942
[GIRL E] They're even prettier
in person than in magazines!

127
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,983
They're so lucky.

128
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,775
Cham's never even been
in any magazines.

129
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,858
[GIRL F] How are they
cuter in person than on TV?

130
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,150
[KUMASA]
They've never been on anything

131
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,150
but local public access.

132

Who cares?

133
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,525
If we let this get us down, then
we'll be total failures as fans!

134
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,108
Yeah, you're right.

135
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,150
We need to be a unified front,
even if our faves aren't here.

00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,650
[BOTH]
So cute!

Way cuter than in the magazines!

Those two creep me out.

And now,

142

it's time to bring out
our special guests!

these "special guests"?

she's cute, but like...

This is super awkward.

too much for me to bear.

157
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,567
My love outweighed my shame.

158
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,650
[ERIPIYO]
I hear you, bro.

159
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,900
I'm so proud of you!

160
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:02,317
I'm basically chopped
liver, but still!

161
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,233
[ERIPIYO]
To be fair, I'm not surprised

162
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,233
they chose Reo for this event.

163
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,275
And the battle's just begun.

164
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,858
[ERIPIYO]
I assumed she'd be here, too.

165
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:13,775
[MOTOI]
Sorane!

166
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:15,775
[ERIPIYO]
Oh, I hear Motoi.

167
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,900
Now, if Maki's up next,

168
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:21,442
there's a huge possibility they
only brought the top three.

169
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,150
[ERIPIYO]
They want it to seem fair,

170
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,692
but it's clear their agency's
only pushing those three girls.

171
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,733
Please... show up!

172
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,233
[gasps]

173
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,483
[FAN A]
Maki!

174
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,192
[FAN B]
You're the cutest, Maki!

175
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:47,442
[ERIPIYO]
I knew it. Maki.

176
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,400
Eripiyo.

177
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:53,525
No worries. I understand.
I'm used to it.

178
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,483
[FAN C]
Maki!

179
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,067
[ERIPIYO]
It's definitely not her fault.

180
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,233
I blame the agency for
treating them unfairly.

181
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,567
[ERIPIYO] I've fought to get
tickets to so many events,

182
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,817
and there were plenty of times

183
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,608
when Maina wouldn't
even be there.

184
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,900
But I never once regretted it.

185
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:15,233
It was worth it just for
the chance to see her.

186
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:20,983
And you know,

187
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,108
at least we got to see
Reo looking adorable.

188
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,942
Wait, Eripiyo.

189
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,567
I think... it's...
it's not over yet!

190
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,233
Look up at the screen!

191
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,608
[gasps]

192
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,858
Hey. Maina!

193
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:14,400
[ERIPIYO]
Wait, why is she crying?

194
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:17,692
Maybe she was upset that
I showed up here today.

195
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,983
[MAINA]
Eripiyo came to see me today.

196
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,733
She was even
wearing our t-shirt.

197
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,192
[REO]
Maina? What's the matter?

198
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,900
Are you nervous?

199
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:37,358
I didn't think anyone
would be out there

200
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,858
specifically to see me.

201
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,608
[REO]
Why? Of course they would!

202
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,942
[MAINA] I'm only here because
they couldn't find anyone

203
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,025
for the fourth spot.

204
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,525
[REO]
No, you know that isn't true.

205
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:51,775
You were chosen to be here.
Because you're special.

206
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:57,025
[MAINA]
At least I know... she chose me.

207
00:11:57,108 --> 00:12:00,900
Thank you so much, my Eripiyo.

208
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,150
So cute!

209
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,233
[KUMASA]
Take my money!

210
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:04,817
Take mine, too!

211
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,942
[KUMASA]
All of it!

212
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,650
[NARRATOR]
They supported their girls,

213
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,942
then the superfans
replenished with food

214
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:13,317
and spent the day enjoying
the rest of the event.

215
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,192
[ERIPIYO] "I honestly
never imagined I would

216
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,983
get to be in the show today,
so I was really shocked,

217
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,525
but at the same time,
I was grateful.

218
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,817
The reason they asked
is that some of the clothes

219
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,275
were smaller than usual,
so they needed someone my size

220
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,358
in order to be able to
showcase those outfits."

221
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,608
She didn't have
to tell anyone that,

222
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,650
but she still included it.

223
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,358
She's so modest.
I love you, Maina!

224
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:49,692
[ERIPIYO]
"Today made me so happy!"

225
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,150
[door opens]

226
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:02,983
Today made me really
happy, too, Maina!

227
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,567
[ERIPIYO'S MOM] Do you have any
idea what time it is, Eri?!

228
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,650
[ERIPIYO]
Maina! I love you!

229
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,733
[KUMASA]
Eripiyo. Motoi.

230
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,858
[ERIPIYO]
Yes?

231
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,108
[KUMASA]
Promise me you won't freak out.

232
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:19,567
[MOTOI]
Sure.

233
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,775
[KUMASA]
Here goes.

234
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,983
Reo replied to my fan letter.

235
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:23,900
Seriously?

236
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:24,983
Uh...

237
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,775
What...? You don't think
that's amazing?

238
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:31,525
I try not to overreact to other
people's fan interaction stuff.

239
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,525
In my heart, I know
that I'm not wrong.

240
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,275
No matter how little interest
Maina takes in me,

241
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,442
I vow that I'll never
stop loving her.

242
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:40,567
Eripiyo, I...

243
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,483
[KUMASA] Oh, you mustn't
pity her, Motoi.

244
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,317
This is how she stays sane.

245
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,608
People tell themselves
whatever lies they can

246
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,858
to keep from going crazy.

247
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,067
[ERIPIYO]
You better watch out

248
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,817
or I'm gonna break all
your penlights in half.

249
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,483
You know, I've never gotten
a reply from Sorane, either.

250
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,858
[KUMASA]
When did you send your letter?

251
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,192
Sometimes it takes a while.

252
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,942
The agency has to
prescreen everything

253
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,567
that gets sent to them.

254
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,692
To be fair, I've never actually
sent Maina any fan mail.

255
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:05,942
You're kidding me!

256
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:09,483
What? I mean, it's not
like I'd get a reply.

257
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,525
I'd rather tell her in person.

258
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,942
You say that,
but you've never gotten

259
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,025
a reply in person, either.

260
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,858
[ERIPIYO]
I'll break your face, too.

261
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,775
[REO] Have I ever fallen
for one of my fans?

262
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,650
[MAINA]
Yeah.

263
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,108
[REO]
What? Of course not!

264
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,483
[MAINA]
What? Right, of course.

265
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,358
Oh. It's not like that.

266
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,233
I didn't mean to be
rude, it's just...

267
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,942
Well, how do I put this?

268
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:33,317
Falling for one of our fans
would betray the rest of them.

269
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,108
Does that make sense?

270
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,275
[MAINA]
I see.

271
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:41,192
But, I mean...
Eripiyo is my only fan,

272
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:43,608
and she's not a fan
of anyone else, either.

273
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,025
[MAINA]
Um. It's nice to meet you!

274
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,567
Hey.

275
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,233
I saw no one was in your line,
uh, and I felt bad for you,

276
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:52,025
so, well, I'm really a
Maki fan, but here I am!

277
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,483
[MAINA] Who tells people
that kind of thing?

278
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,650
I chickened out and
left Sorane's line.

279
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,692
[MAINA]
Seriously?

280
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,983
[FAN D] Hey, Reo! I hope to
see you at the Girls' Festa!

281
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,567
[REO]
Aww. Wow, thank you!

282
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,858
That means a lot to me!

283
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:05,858
[SORANE]
I like your haircut!

284
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,692
[FAN E]
I'm honored!

285
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,150
[gasps]

286
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,275
[MAINA] This is that Reo fan
who's always with Eripiyo.

287
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,733
Why's he in my line?

288
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:15,525
[MAINA]
Thanks for coming today!

289
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,650
We've never officially met.

290
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,275
[MAINA] Is he switching his
favorite to me for some reason?

291
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,608
If he is, then I hope
it won't make things

292
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,775
uncomfortable between
him and Eripiyo.

293
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,400
[KUMASA]
Uh. Listen.

294
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,025
My friend is an
enormous fan of yours,

295
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:34,025
but she came down with the flu
and couldn't be here today.

296
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,192
[MAINA]
Huh?

297
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,650
I hope you'll continue
to be kind to her.

298
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,108
[MAINA]
Of course! Absolutely!

299
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:44,067
And also, I hope you'll
continue to support Reo, too!

300
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,567
[KUMASA]
Goddess!

301
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,233
[REO]
Aya, what's your take on this?

302
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,567
[AYA]
My take?

303
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,442
Huh. I've never really
thought that much about it.

304
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,608
Guess kids don't have to
think about those things.

305
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:57,983
I'm not a kid, 'kay?

306
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,983
Oh. Whoops. I've gotta run.

307
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,442
Your job?

308
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,358
[AYA] Yup. Yuka just texted
to say she's leaving now.

309
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,942
See you later.

310
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,317
[REO]
You two are so close.

311
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,483
[AYA]
Nah, I wouldn't go that far.

312
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,817
I guess we'll see
you tomorrow. Bye.

313
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,233
[REO]
Have a good time at work.

314
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:16,192
[AYA] Thank you.
Don't have too much fun.

315
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,233
[REO chuckles]

316
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,983
[REO]
Oh, Aya.

317
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,067
She only packaged Yuka's color.

318
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,983
You're right.

319
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,775
[BOTH chuckle]

320
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,233
[YUKA gasps]

321
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,942
I definitely just saw one!

322
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:34,525
Behind the fridge.
I saw it scurry back there!

323
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:37,692
Morning.

324
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:38,608
[REO]
Morning.

325
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:39,692
[MAINA]
Hey.

326
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,817
Oh, hi. I was
expecting to see Yuka.

327
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,025
[SORANE] I was in the
neighborhood, so I stopped by.

328
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,358
Oh, right, Yuka.

329
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,858
She texted saying
she's gonna be late

330
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,608
'cause she saw a
cockroach in her house.

331
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:49,733
[MAINA]
Huh?

332
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:51,233
Why would she send
that to you, though?

333
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:52,567
[SORANE]
Who knows?

334
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,692
She and I were texting
a little last night, so...

335
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:58,358
She's basically fired.
Probably a mistake.

336
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,067
So, uh...

337
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,150
[REO]
Oh, fan mail?

338
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,233
[SORANE]
Yeah.

339
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,358
[REO]
I should take some home with me.

340
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,733
I don't want to get
behind on replies.

341
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,942
How nice. You know, I've never
actually gotten fan mail.

342
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:10,900
[BOTH]
What?

343
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:11,692
[SORANE]
Really?

344
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,108
Uh, yeah.

345
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,442
Not even Eripiyo?

346
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:19,233
Yeah. I would love
to be able to reply.

347
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,858
[MAINA] I'm always so
nervous around her,

348
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,192
but if I were to write to her,

349
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:27,733
I think it'd be easier to
get my feelings across.

350
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,650
[REO] Why don't you
ask her to write you?

351
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,192
Like when you see her at a
meet and greet or something.

352
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,233
[MAINA gasps]

353
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:35,900
But I don't know
if I can ask her.

354
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,025
[SORANE]
How about this?

355
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:39,025
When I'm emceeing
our next concert,

356
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:42,358
I'll ask you what you'd like
to get most from your fans,

357
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:43,567
then you could ask
for fan letters

358
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,817
without it being awkward.

359
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,025
Can I?

360
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,900
I don't see why not, right, Reo?

361
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,067
Totally!

362
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,442
[gasps]

363
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,817
[YUKA]
Oh, no!

364
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,358
Now a stinkbug!

365
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:01,150
Crap, crap, crap! This is bad!

366
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,400
How did it get in here?

367
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,817
[MAKI]
So, Yume.

368
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,983
You were in the audience at
Girls' Festa, weren't you?

369
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,650
[YUMERI]
Huh?

370
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,317
You caught me.

371
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,442
And I tried so hard to make
sure you didn't see me.

372
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,650
Well, I did.

373
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,900
I always know where
to find you. Always.

374
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:24,900
Don't lie.

375
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:27,858
You know I would never,
ever lie to you.

376
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,150
Let's both be in it next year.

377
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:34,525
[phone buzzes]

378
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:35,733
[YUMERI gasps]

379
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,067
A text from Yuka.

380
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,400
Jeez.

381
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:41,525
"The cockroach got away,

382
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,400
and now there's
a stink bug, too.

383
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,275
I'm going to bed. Sorry."

384
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,650
Huh?

385
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,983
Why did she send that
to you, though?

386
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,775
Who knows?

387
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,942
[SORANE]
Time flies, huh?

388
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:58,442
I mean, it's already July!
How did June slip by so fast?

389
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,942
Did you get your dads something
nice for Father's Day?

390
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:03,525
I wonder if any of you
want to be dads someday.

391
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:04,817
How would you celebrate?

392
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,692
What would you want
most in the world?

393
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,900
[AYA]
Wait, what?

394
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:09,817
[REO]
This feels forced.

395
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,108
[MAINA]
So awkward!

396
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,025
Industrial strength
bug spray, please!

397
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,400
[SORANE]
And you, Maina?

398
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:15,567
[MAINA]
Huh?

399
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,192
Um. I guess... I'd like
fans to write me.

400
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,025
[MAINA] Wait, if I actually
ask for letters...

401
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:24,483
[ERIPIYO]
I wrote you this letter,

402
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,900
but it might take you two
years to finish reading it.

403
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,525
Maina, will you accept
this, as well?

404
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:32,900
[MAINA] Eripiyo will probably
go way overboard.

405
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,400
And, well... I wouldn't
wanna do anything

406
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,025
that might cause
trouble for her.

407
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,608
She's really giving
it some thought.

408
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:46,025
[SORANE]
Uh, Maina?

409
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:47,275
[gasps]

410
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,608
Wish...

411
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,483
Wish strips.

412
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,650
[SORANE]
Wish strips?

413
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,067
[MAINA]
Yeah.

414
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,858
[MAINA] Then it'd only be
one small strip of paper.

415
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,442
[SORANE]
Okay...

416
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,483
It is almost
Tanabata! Good call!

417
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,608
[MAKI] So, she wants
well-wishes from the fans?

418
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,983
[ERIPIYO]
Maina wants... wishes?

419
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,317
Promise you won't get her a
bamboo plant covered with them

420
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,858
or write them on
10,000 yen notes.

421
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,108
[ERIPIYO]
My first ever fan letters!

422
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,567
Or fan letter strips.

423
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,608
Whoa, did you write it
on a brick or something?

424
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,858
Don't joke around.
I'm proud of these.

425
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,650
Not joking.

426
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,275
No, look! I wrote a hundred!

427
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:30,942
You might as well have
written her a fan letter!

428
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:34,733
There's a wish on
every single one, too!

429
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,692
[ERIPIYO] I hope Maina stays
healthy and happy every day!

430
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,233
I hope Maina never
has to feel sad.

431
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,608
I hope Maina will be
the center one day!

432
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,608
I hope I can use the
same shampoo as Maina

433
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,775
so I can smell just like her!

434
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,025
I want to take a
bath with Maina.

435
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,400
I want to peek
into Maina's room!

436
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,775
Did you check through them all?

437
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,150
'Cause it sounds like a couple
of your dirty wishes

438
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,775
got mixed in there.

439
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,817
All right, folks, that
concludes today's fan event.

440
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,442
Please start heading
toward the exits, calmly.

441
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,025
Excuse me, staff lady?

442
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,692
Here! Please give
this gift to Maina.

443
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,233
[MUROTA]
Great work out there today.

444
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,025
[MISAKI]
Thanks, you, too.

445
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:11,400
Whatcha got there?

446
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:12,483
[MISAKI]
Bug spray.

447
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,608
Apparently, Yuka said
she wanted it.

448
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,108
[MUROTA]
Oh.

449
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,900
Yeah, I remember hearing that
and thinking it was weird.

450
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,900
Well, supposedly, it's
powerful enough for rodents.

451
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,192
[MUROTA]
Gross.

452
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,358
What do you have
there? Another gift?

453
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,358
[MUROTA] Eripiyo gave me
something to give to Maina,

454
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,692
can you believe it?

455
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,608
I haven't had a chance
to check it yet.

456
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,817
If it's from Eripiyo,
I'm sure it's fine.

457
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,275
Huh. That's what has
me worried, actually.

458
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,067
Well...

459
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,817
Yeah... I'm just gonna...

460
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,233
...take a peek and
see what's in here.

461
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:44,400
Huh?

462
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:49,983
Eek! A mouse!

463
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,108

[gasps]

467
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,733
[MAINA] I can't wait to
read Eripiyo's letters.

468
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,775

[ERIPIYO] I can't wait
for Maina's replies.

Dear, Sorane.

472
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:10,483
I want nothing more in this
life than to make you happy!

473
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:11,733
I want you to wait at home

474
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,817
and cook delicious meals
for us both to enjoy!

475
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,483
Eripiyo and Kumasa are
gonna make fun of me

476
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,608
for falling in love with you,
but I don't care.

477
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:19,692
The truth is,
I love you, Sorane!
