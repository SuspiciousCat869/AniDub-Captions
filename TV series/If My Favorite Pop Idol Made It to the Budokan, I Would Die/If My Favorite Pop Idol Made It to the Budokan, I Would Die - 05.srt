1
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,817
[MAINA]
Just one?

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,400
Do you really only
have one ticket today?

3
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:22,525
[ERIPIYO grunts]

4
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:23,900
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah.

5
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,150
I guess if I can't buy merch,
I'm kinda worthless.

6
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,650
[MAINA]
That's not true!

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,483
[MAINA]
Not true at all.

8
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:32,942
I'm happy just knowing that
you come to see me, Eripiyo.

9
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:36,067
The fact that you
come to see me...

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,858
[ERIPIYO]
Wait, what?

11
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,317
[gasps]

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,442
[ERIPIYO] Hold the phone.
Is she trying to lure me in?

13
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,317
Ah, right, that makes sense.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
It's because of the
popularity contest.

15
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:47,817
Well, it's working!

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,942
I really wish she would
make this a regular thing!

17
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,483
I...

18
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,525
[ERIPIYO] Uh! She doesn't even
know how to do it, does she?

19
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:55,483
How adorable!

20
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,400
I--

21
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:57,400
Don't force it.

22
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:58,817
Huh?

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,775
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

24
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:03,150
No, that's not--

25
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,025
And your time's up.
Thank you very much.

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,233
Your support means
the world to me.

27
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:41,108
I'll do my very best!

28
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,983
Just promise me you won't
push yourself too hard.

29
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,442
You have to take care of
your health, too, you know.

30
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:47,900
Thanks so much,

31
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,317
but I hope you don't have
any creepy ulterior motives.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,525
I'm so happy to shake your hand
I might break your fingers!

33
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,692
You came to see me here, too?

34
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,108
I hope you come by
the studio again!

35
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,567
Your dancing was incredible
as always, Yumeri!

36
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,483
You really deserve to be at
the center, you know that?

37
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,608
There's no way. Do you really
think I deserve that?

38
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:09,858
Of course, you deserve
the whole world!

39
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,733
So I'll give you as many
of my votes as I can!

40
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,983
You mean it? Thanks so much!

41
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,358
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Phew.

42
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,817
I'm startin' to think this whole
popularity contest thing

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,650
is gonna burn us out, too.

44
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm just stressed because
I can't support her

45
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,108
like I want to.

46
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,983
Hey, know of any part-time jobs
I could do with a bum leg?

47
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,567
[KUMASA] Why don't you
just swallow your pride

48
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,233
and beg your parents for money?

49
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,275
Like I told you, my leg
prevents me from groveling!

50
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:38,983
Uh.

51
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,400
But my kidneys...

52
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:41,900
Good God.

53
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,483
I've got an idea!

54
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,150
How 'bout you and I go to a maid
café and blow off some steam?

55
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,400
What?

56
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,233
Maina's the only girl
I want attention from.

57
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,608
Well, sure, and Reo's
the only one for me.

58
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,150
But we're talking about
two different things here.

59
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,317
I just think we need
a break from the norm.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,192
There's this new place I
heard a lot about lately.

61
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,567
And don't worry,
this one's on me.

62
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,650
Okay, if you insist.

63
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,358
But don't expect me
to act all excited.

64
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:10,858
[ERIPIYO]
They're so dang cute!

65
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,150
This is so great!

66
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,567
[MAID]
Welcome home, masters.

67
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,275
I'm so honored to
be your maid today!

68
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,025
My name is-- Uh...

69
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,858
[BOTH]
Uh.

70
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,025
It's Aya.

71
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,483
[AYA] It's Reo's stan
and Maina's stan.

72
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:24,942
It isn't what you think!

73
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,692
There wasn't a performance
today, so we thought we'd--

74
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,108
Kumasa, would you shut up?

75
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:31,150
You really think Aya would
remember our faces?

76
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,483
[AYA]
Of course I do.

77
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,317
And I'm telling Reo and Maina.

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,900
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
No! Please don't!

79
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm not her stan!

80
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,025
[AYA]
Whaddaya think I am, a moron?

81
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,567
[ERIPIYO] Please don't
tell Maina I was here--

82
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,025
I'm begging you!

83
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,733
I'll do whatever you say!

84
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,567
Come to think of it,
you've been stingy

85
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,483
about buying Maina's
merch lately.

86
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,442
But you'll spend money
in a maid café?

87
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,192
[ERIPIYO] There's a perfectly
good explanation!

88
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,858
I've been buying Reo's
merch. I'm safe, right?

89
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:59,025
That's not it! Dude!
Reo's gonna be so sad!

90
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:00,567
[KUMASA gasps]

91
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,233
Kumasa, I thought that I was
supposed to be your number one.

92
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,608
Why did I ever think
I could believe in you?

93
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:08,983
--[KUMASA] Reo!
--[ERIPIYO] Maina!

94
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,067
No! Don't believe her...

95
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,317
[sighs]

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I mean, I guess I can
keep it a secret.

97
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,067
You angel!

98
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,150
So, let me see here.

99
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,775
I'll get the "have our maids
make you a parfait" thing.

100
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,025
You bounced back fast!

101
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,442
Hey, Aya. Try to lure me in.

102
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,775
Really? So you're
testing an idol now?

103
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,025
Yeah, what of it?

104
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,900
We all want someone to
be nice to us, right?

105
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,567
[BOTH]
Uhh...

106
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,775
[KUMASA]
I'm surprised you've been able

107
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:38,275
to keep being a Maina
stan for this long.

108
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,525
Huh?

109
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:40,858
If Reo treated me the
way Maina treats you,

110
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,567
I think I'd pass out.

111
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,608
Jeez, and Motoi? He'd probably
drop dead on the spot.

112
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:46,858
Meh, it's cool.

113
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,442
I don't ask for any
special fan service,

114
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,275
her being alive
is enough for me.

115
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,067
I'm happy just knowing
she's out there.

116
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,108
I am eternally grateful that
her parents got together

117
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:59,442
and I got to meet
her in this life.

118
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,817
[AYA]
Thanks for your patience!

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,525
Here you go!
Your maid-made parfait!

120
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:06,692
[ERIPIYO]
Wait, are those salmon filets?

121
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,942
[KUMASA] You managed to work
Maina's color into the mix!

122
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,983
What excellent service!

123
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:14,400
Maina was really happy that
she placed third in the ranking.

124
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,858
So you had better keep
supporting her, or else!

125
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,858
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Aya!

126
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,442
[AYA] Also, since I'm keeping
your dirty little secret,

127
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,233
you each have to put
in one vote for me!

128
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,150
Did an idol just blackmail us?

129
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,233
I didn't realize she
was such a tsundere.

130
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,817
[AYA]
I'm not!

131
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,608
[ERIPIYO]
So Maina was happy.

132
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,608
I'm glad to hear that.

133
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,733
I'd love for Maina
to be the center,

134
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,733
just so I could see her smile.

135
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,067
For that to happen,

136
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,983
I'm gonna have to ramp up
my support even more!

137
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,817
[ERIPIYO] My organs are the only
things I have worth selling!

138
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Kidneys for sale!

139
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:50,108
[AYA groans]

140
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,442
[MAKI]
What's the matter, Yume?

141
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,400
[gasps]

142
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,983
[YUMERI]
Oh, uh, it's nothing!

143
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,400
Okay.. Well, let's
head out, then.

144
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,858
[YUMERI]
Yeah, sure.

145
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,483
[YUMERI]
Ever since I joined the agency,

146
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:16,150
all I've ever done is watch
Maki from behind her.

147
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,442
I never thought people
would notice me next to her,

148
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,192
let alone vote for me.

149
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,942
Yet... here we are.

150
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:25,275
[MAKI]
Hey, Yume.

151
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:27,108
Do you remember the
dance for the front row?

152
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,650
Huh?

153
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:32,025
Yeah. I've watched you do it
a million times, so I know it.

154
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,525
That's good. You're ready to
move up front any time, then.

155
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:36,942
[YUMERI]
What?

156
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,775
Let's do our best again today!

157
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,525

00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,525
--[FAN F] Yume!
--[FAN G] You've got this!

311
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,525
Well, thank you!

312
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,233
Hey, I've got an idea:
Let's change the formation

313
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,567
to the current ranking
for this song.

314
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,192
Ooh, yeah!

315
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,775
Wait. So what does
that mean for me?

316
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,150
[MAKI] It means you're in
your usual spot, Yuka.

317
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,942
[YUKA] Maki, do you even know
the back row choreography?

318
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:15,358
Don't underestimate
the top three, hon.

319
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,400
Yume, you know the front
row choreography, right?

320
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:31,192
[FANS cheering]

321
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,650
[YUMERI]
Beautiful.

322
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,483
My Yumeri's coming into her own.

323
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,483
[YUMERI] They're so happy
to see me up here.

324
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,192
I can't believe I'm
in the front row!

325
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,900
Now, here's "Hot
Summer Holiday!"

326
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:55,942
[FANS cheering]

327
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:23,692
[singing in Japanese]

328
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,150
Wow, Yumeri can really dance.

329
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,483
I can't believe I never
noticed before.

330
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,567
Yeah, she's the best
dancer out of all of them.

331
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,483
I read online that she's
been taking lessons

332
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,942
to polish her technique.

333
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,608
[ERIPIYO]
Mmm...

334
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,525
[ERIPIYO]
Maina's good, too.

335
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:02,317
I hope she makes it
to the front row soon.

336
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,108
[OTAKU A]
Great job!

337
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,025
I've supported you for so long.

338
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,483
I was so happy to see
you in the front row!

339
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,317
You were just so incredible.
I can't get over it!

340
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,650
I owe it all to you,
Mr. Nagai, so thank you.

341
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,275
[YUMERI]
I'm grateful.

342
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,567
But it's just my regular
crowd, no one new.

343
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,733
[SORANE]
That's weird.

344
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:28,942
For coming in third,

345
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,942
Yumeri doesn't have
many people in her line.

346
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,775
[MAINA]
Oh, no. Only one again today?

347
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:39,692
Maybe Eripiyo really does
want to start supporting Aya.

348
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,233
Why aren't you supporting
me as much anymore?

349
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,942
Sorry, I haven't been able to.

350
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,442
[MAINA gasps]

351
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,650
[MAINA]
There I go again.

352
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,775
[MAINA]
No, that's not what I--

353
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:53,067
I couldn't sell
my organs in time.

354
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,150
I'm not even sure where
one would sell organs,

355
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,442
to be honest.

356
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,025
Does the black market have
an app or something?

357
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:01,442
[YOSHIKAWA]
Thank you very much! Time's up.

358
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:02,942
[MAINA]
It always seems to end with her

359
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,150
talking about
selling her organs.

360
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,692
I don't get it. I don't
understand you, Eripiyo.

361
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:11,233
If you wanna change
your fave, just tell me!

362
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:14,525
[BOTH laughing]

363
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,108
[MAINA] But that's the
last thing I want!

364
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,275
[RENA]
Hi, Maina.

365
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,775
I was able to buy three
of your CDs today.

366
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:23,650
Eripiyo usually buys them
all up, so I'm glad.

367
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,400
Thanks, Rena!

368
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,567
[ERIPIYO]
Ugh.

369
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,067
Ouch. This hurts. But still...

370
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,608
Ah! They're so cute!

371
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,150
Like two little birds
of a feather!

372
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,900
It seems like that new girl
might be a Maina stan.

373
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:38,983
She's so cute!

374
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,900
Hm? You don't mean
Eripiyo, right?

375
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,233
Of course I don't mean her.

376
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,317
What about "new
girl" says Eripiyo?

377
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,150
No, I mean Sorane look-alike.

378
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,442
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah, I know, right?

379
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,733
Rena is super cute!

380
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:53,150
Maina must be happy to have a
fan who's so adorable for once.

381
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,775
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah, you're onto something.

382
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,525
Maina never looks
that happy with me.

383
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,858
[MAINA giggles]

384
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,692
[ERIPIYO]
Gloom.

385
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,108
[ERIPIYO]
I can't buy any CDs, but...

386
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,358
Oh, wow. Did everybody go home?

387
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,567
Unlike us, the front row has
busy lives to get back to.

388
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,983
Hey, speak for yourself.

389
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,817
I was on the front row
before this last vote!

390
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,442
Maina, someone brought
a present for you.

391
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,233
Huh? For me?

392
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,442
Well, this is a first.
Who could it be from?

393
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,817
Um, let's see.

394
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,275
It's from Eripiyo, so
you'd better be careful.

395
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,442
[MAINA]
Eripiyo brought me a gift?

396
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,483
Yeah, and I examined
the packaging.

397
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:41,233
There didn't seem to be
a wiretap or anything.

398
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,442
[MAINA] This is the very first
present Eripiyo's ever given me!

399
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,317
[MAINA] Hey, Aya, did you
get millet dumplings?

400
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,608
No, why would I get
anything from Eripiyo?

401
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,192
She's terrifying.

402
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,025
Oh. Well, okay, then.

403
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,233
[MAINA] I'll be your pet
as long as you'll have me!

404
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,275
Woof, woof!

405
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:01,983
So Eripiyo will bring
you dumplings,

406
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,400
but won't buy your CDs?

407
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,608
What's up with that?

408
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,150
Huh?

409
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:07,775
Maybe she just doesn't feel
as compelled to buy your stuff

410
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,733
since you got to
third place once.

411
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,233
[FUJIKAWA]
You see it all the time--

412
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:13,692
fans who only ever root
for the underdogs.

413
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,108
[MATSUO] Yeah, they
just like to be unique.

414
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,442
Yeah, that makes sense.

415
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:19,858
Oh, my bad.

416
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,692
Oh, Maina, we're really sorry.

417
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,483
[MAINA]
It's fine.

418
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,275
Really.

419
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,317
[MAINA]
Oh, Eripiyo.

420
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,358
[MAKI] Doesn't being on
the front row feel amazing?

421
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,817
[YUMERI]
Yeah.

422
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,067
You looked like you were
having a lot of fun up there.

423
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,858
Was it obvious?

424
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,858
I've never experienced
anything like it.

425
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,483
That being said, I don't
wanna get used to it.

426
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,275
I would much rather just
stay in the back row.

427
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,483
Seriously? That's what you want?

428
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,775
Well, yeah, sure.

429
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,067
If I stay in the back row,
I can always watch you.

430
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,733
[clatter]

431
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,108
[MAKI]
Jeez. Look what I did.

432
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:06,150
I didn't expect you to say that.

433
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,442
You've been carrying a lot
of stuff lately. What's up?

434
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:12,525
[MAKI] Uh, don't worry
about it. I, um...

435
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:15,983
[YUMERI gasps]

436
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,483
What? You didn't
steal those, did you?

437
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,900
[MAKI]
Hey, calm down.

438
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,067
There's no reason to be weird.

439
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,025
I bought these all myself.

440
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,608
[YUMERI]
Huh? But why?

441
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:28,650
That means you're going to
fall in the ranking, Maki!

442
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,108
[MAKI]
I wanted them all to see you

443
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,858
and the work you've put
into your dancing.

444
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,442
So they'd know that
even in the back row

445
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,608
you're still amazing.

446
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:39,192
That's why. But I
won't buy any more.

447
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,733
And from this point on,

448
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:44,025
you're going to have to
work hard for your fans.

449
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:45,900
Maki.

450
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:47,483
[FANS cheering]

451
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,400
[YUMERI]
That gorgeous view.

452
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,442
Maki showed me that.
And my fans did, too.

453
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:55,108
They made it so beautiful
for me up there.

454
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,525
[YUMERI] But still, wouldn't
this count as cheating?

455
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,817
[MAKI]
Aya votes for herself.

456
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,358
She buys her own CDs.

457
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,567
[YUMERI]
Oh, wow. Does she really?

458
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,025
[MAKI]
I voted for you, and I'm glad.

459
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:08,442
But now I have all these
handshake tickets.

460
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:12,150
So, then. Can I have
a handshake, Yume?

461
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,775
Sure!

462
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,317
Thank you for always
supporting me.

463
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,317
It means so much.

464

You deserve it.
You were so cute up there.

00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:29,192
How many tickets is this worth?

[YUMERI]
Just one, I think.

[NAGAI] Your dancing was
incredible as always, Yumeri!

If it were up to me,
you'd be first!

I'm so grateful to have
supported you all this time!

You'll always be front
and center to me!
