1
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:21,275
[NARRATOR A] The day was
December 31st. New Year's Eve.

2
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:23,983
The Okayama City Shopping
District bustled.

3
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,275
Shoppers were on the hunt,

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,067
determined to find
New Year's supplies

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,567
and good luck charms.

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,858
Everyone was getting ready
to ring in the new year.

7
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:35,067
[MAINA gasps]

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,442
Oh, no! I totally forgot!

9
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:38,858
Maina, calm down.

10
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,858
I'm sure it's no big deal.
Try not to worry.

11
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,900
There's still some time
before the concert.

12
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:47,150
Yeah, you're right.
It's just, you see...

13
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,275
[REO]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

14
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:49,817
I didn't buy black beans!

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,483
You know, for health
in the new year!

16
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,858
[REO]
Mh-hm! Hm.

17
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,233
I totally forgot.

18
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:58,317
I can't ring in the new year
properly without them.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,983
[REO chuckles awkwardly]

20
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:05,650
I'm sure you'll have time to buy
some after the concert. 'Kay?

21
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,233
You're right.

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,858
Actually, the stores might have
marked them down at that point.

23
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:11,650
I can't believe the year's over.

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,692
This one sure flew by
quickly, didn't it?

25
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,900
Probably because
so much happened.

26
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:18,942
Like the Girls' Festa
and the sports festival.

27
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,775
And the popularity ranking.

28
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,650
At least Reo didn't break
her legs again this year.

29
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,025
Come on--am I ever gonna
live that one down?

30
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,858
I'm not happy with the way this
stupid year turned out at all.

31
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,150
I'm so gonna be in the
Girls' Festa next year.

32
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,275
And I'm winning the
sports festival, too.

33
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,567
Then the top ranking's
mine--just you wait.

34
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,525
Now that's confidence.

35
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:39,400
Okay, Aya, we'll believe
it when we see it.

36
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,150
That was the most
Aya thing ever.

37
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,983
All right, let's all channel
that confident Aya energy

38
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,442
and have a great concert!

39
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,192
Ring in the new year right!

40
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,817
And next year,
the Budokan is ours.

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,608
You think so?

42
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,358
[YUKA]
Hmm.

43
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:58,942
[AYA]
Hm?

44
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:02,858
You guys are always obsessing
about playing the Budokan. Lame.

45
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,983
[OTHERS]
Uhh...

46
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,692
Huh? Here, there's plenty!

47
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,442
[MOTOI] This is the very
first time I'm getting

48
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,025
to ring in the New Year
with my fave.

49
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:48,442
I'm beside myself! There's like
this... mysterious energy!

50
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,858
[MOTOI yells]

51
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,525
Kumasa! Eripiyo just up
and died in this mofo!

52
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,192
Be a shame if the concert
got cancelled because of her.

53
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,317
I hope she has an extra
life or something.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,025
[ERIPIYO groans]

55
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,900
Closing for repairs?

56
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:05,275
Oh, yeah.

57
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,567
Apparently, the lightning
that struck on Christmas

58
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,108
caused some major damage.

59
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,983
Wait, so, if they're not
performing here,

60
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,817
where are the Cham
Jam shows gonna be?

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,025
[ERIPIYO] The situation is
even more dire than that.

62
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,692
Since they don't have a venue,

63
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:20,692
where is Maina's birthday
celebration in January gonna be?

64
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,608
Why does she have the
worst luck of all of them?

65
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,858
But even her bad luck is cute!

66
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:28,733
Is that really a legitimate
reason to get so excited?

67
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:31,567
To be fair, Eripiyo is a
very odd breed of super fan,

68
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,692
who's like, "Oh wow
the sun? How cool!"

69
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,567
when she's looking through
Maina's pictures.

70
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,942
Maina's the cutest!

71
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,150
Maybe the universe took note
of her extreme cuteness

72
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,650
and gave her such
bad luck as a way

73
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,025
to even out the playing
field, you know?

74
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,858
[NAGAI] Y'know, it sucks that
Yumeri's birthday celebration's

75
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,108
gonna be a day late,

76
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,317
but it's lucky that
they'll be finished

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,692
with the repairs by then.

78
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,650
Yeah, the universe really
seems to be blessing her

79
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,900
with good luck for
the end of the year.

80
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,775
[ERIPIYO]
This planet sucks!

81
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,692
Maina's lot is so unfair!

82
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,233
This place should be destroyed!

83
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,483
I have no response to that.

84
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,192
Well, regardless,
I'm not so sure

85
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:08,858
Eripiyo could've organized
a birthday celebration.

86
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,358
Shut up!

87
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,817
[ERIPIYO] Maina's birthday
should be a national holiday!

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Therefore, I say we make it so!

89
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,817
Are you really gonna
bypass Okayama City

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,733
and take this straight to
the federal government?

91
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,108
[YUKA] So none of you nerds
have anything better to do

92
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,067
on New Year's Eve?

93
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,692
[FANS]
No!

94
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,900
[REO] Yuka, seriously,
what's wrong with you?

95
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:29,650
[MAKI] Everyone here
leads a full, busy life.

96
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,442
They just make time to come
see us 'cause they love us.

97
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,442
So let's all have fun
and ring in the New Year

98
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,983
like nobody's business!

99
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,525
[FANS]
Yeah!

100
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,442
[giggles]

101
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,900
Thanks for all your support!

102
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,025
Have a happy New Year!

103
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,733
Don't choke on your
black beans and die.

104
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,442
It was awesome spending
New Year's with you!

105
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,692
Thank you for everything!
You're all the best!

106
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,942
If you support me, I'll
never forget your face.

107
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,983
Even more so if you don't!

108
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,983
Uh. Thank you so
much for coming!

109
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,858
[GIRLS] We hope you'll keep
supporting us next year!

110
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,650
[FANS cheering]

111
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,442
And thank you from us, too!
We love you all!

112
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,942
That was great.
A perfect end to the year.

113
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,233
[ERIPIYO]
It's over...

114
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,442
And the level of despair
I'm feeling right now

115
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,275
is enough to engulf
the entire world

116
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:28,108
in a thick blanket of
never-ending darkness.

117
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,317
[ERIPIYO cackles]

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,317
Could you not spoil
everyone's good time?

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,233
No one came here to be part of
your villainous origin story.

120
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,733
It's our last concert
of the year,

121
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:38,567
so we have a special merch
booth as a treat for our fans!

122
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,358
We're so grateful to you all!

123
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,608
[FAN A]
Special merch booth?

124
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,650
[REO] This is the first
time we're trying it,

125
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,358
so we're a little nervous.

126
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,942
[FAN D] Nice. I wonder what
I should have her say.

127
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,025
Oh, wow. I'm so overwhelmed!

128
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,650
I can record her saying
anything I want

129
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,192
as long as it's not
inappropriate or creepy?

130
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,775
[KUMASA]
This must be divinely ordained.

131
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,150
Only godly intervention
could bring us such fortune!

132
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,358
And now Eripiyo can come back
from the edge of the abyss

133
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:01,858
of villainy and darkness!

134
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,608
Eripiyo, I love you more
than anything in the world.

135
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,067
Our civilization was
built upon hypocrisy,

136
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,442
but Eripiyo's mere existence
is the balm my soul needs

137
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:07,733
to persist in the
face of it all.

138
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,317
Her love shows me
the way and lights the path

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,483
I must walk in order to become
the number one idol of all time.

140
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,858
I get lonely sometimes,
like anyone else,

141
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,067
but when that happens,
I just imagine Eripiyo's smile.

142
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,650
Yes! That should be
doable in five seconds!

143
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,900
I don't know what five seconds
looks like in your dimension,

144
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,317
but the one we're in,
it's way shorter than that.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,692
Just wait!

146
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,025
Time's relative when it
comes to words, you'll see.

147
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,317
You are totally insane,
you know that?

148
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,317
Not to mention the fact
that nothing in that speech

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,775
sounds like something
Maina would ever say.

150
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:34,067
Attention, please: The special
merch booth begins now!

151
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,942
Okay, Kumasa, so what
would you like me to say?

152
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,483
Hold on.

153
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,733
How 'bout, "Morning, Kumasa.
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey"?

154
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:44,067
Okay!

155
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,567
Morning, Kuma. Wakey,
wakey, eggs and bakey!

156
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,942
I hope you set
that as your alarm

157
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,400
so you can hear me every day!

158
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,900
[KUMASA]
I will, thanks! You rock.

159
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,650
So, what would you
like for your message?

160
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,483
Oh. Uh. I'm not really sure.

161
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,275
[MOTOI]
"Motoi, kiss me now!"

162
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,942
"Motoi. We're having
instant curry tonight!"

163
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,942
"Darling, I love you!"

164
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,192
Gah! How could I ever
choose just one?

165
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,400
You wouldn't change
your favorite?

166
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:14,608
Wait! Did you record that?
I would never ever cheat on you!

167
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,942
Oh, I know.

168
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:17,900
[gasps]

169
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:22,942
[inaudible]

170
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:34,608
Huh?

171
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,525
So, um, Eripiyo.

172
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,567
[ERIPIYO]
Wait!

173
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,942
Could you say "Eri"?

174
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,733
Please, can you address
me as a person,

175
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,275
not just as a random wota!

176
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,650
[MAINA]
What?

177
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,025
Not just as a wota,
but as the woman that I love?

178
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,358
[NARRATOR A]
No one asked her to go that far.

179
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,817
And please say,
"Eri, support me!"

180
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,317
I'll play it to remind
myself why I have to work.

181
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,275
[MAINA]
Eri, support me!

182
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,733
So good.

183
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,150
The way Maina's voice vibrates
against my eardrum

184
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,358
gives me chills.

185
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,900
It almost feels like
Maina's inside my body.

186
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,192
[ERIPIYO laughing]

187
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,650
Um.

188
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,483
[MAINA] Eripiyo's talking about
internal organs again.

189
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,817
[ERIPIYO]
Uh! Was I too creepy just now?

190
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,525
So, um, I, uh...

191
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,025
[MAINA] I need to think
of something to say

192
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,817
whenever she brings
up her organs.

193
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Ah! Sorry if I creeped you out!

194
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,442
[MAINA]
Huh?

195
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,275
Happy New Year!

196
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:31,692
Cool, well, I hope you two
have an awesome New Year!

197
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,650
Reo's gonna be on one of
those count down shows,

198
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,567
so I'm going to the
studio to watch it.

199
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,233
Catch ya on the flipside!

200
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:40,983
Lucky duck. I wish I could ring
in the new year with Maina.

201
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,525
If I don't hurry home,

202
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,483
I'm gonna end up counting down
to sunrise with you, Motoi.

203
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,525
And no thanks!

204
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,442
Why you gotta be like that?

205
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,525
Okay, see you in a month or so.

206
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,733
Sure thing. Guess I'll
see you in about a month!

207
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,192
[ERIPIYO] A month usually
goes by super-fast,

208
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,192
but without her, it'll crawl.

209
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,067
[yells]

210
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,733
I won't see her for a month,

211
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,567
and I made our last
conversation so awkward!

212
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,358
[ERIPIYO wailing]

213
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,608
[ERIPIYO]
Hey, I'm home.

214
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:15,025
[SAKIKO]
Welcome back.

215
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,692
Now can you lend me a hand
with the New Year's food?

216
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,400
Sure.

217
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,608
Oh, for the love of--

218
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,358
I'm a pro at flipping buns,

219
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,567
and I'm also a pro
at supporting people.

220
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,358
Well then, just stand
there and support me.

221
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,858
There's just one thing
I've gotta say.

222
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:35,317
Sakiko's the cutest,
in a major way! Uh.

223
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,442
Eri. How come you're
always so loud?

224
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,067
Eri, what are you
doing these days?

225
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,525
Do you have a job?

226
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,067
Uh, I'm currently the best
bun flipper at the factory.

227
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,525
I meant a career,
not a part-time job.

228
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,942
Dang, Eri, still don't know what
you wanna be when you grow up?

229
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:52,733
Uh. Come on, I think I still
have some time before I decide.

230
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,067
With that kind of mentality,

231
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,442
you'll wake up one day and
find you're an old maid.

232
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,483
There's someone I would love
to introduce you to, Eri.

233
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,692
He's a wonderful man.

234
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,192
So wonderful, in fact,

235
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:05,317
that he's already had five wives
and he's not even 40 yet!

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,025
[ERIPIYO]
I don't know.

237
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,275
If you don't have a career
now, when will you?

238
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:12,108
Nothing is more important than
finding your purpose in life.

239
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:13,483
Listen, kid.

240
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,150
Make sure your employers
know how grateful you are

241
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,942
that they throw
you a bone, 'kay?

242
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,358
It'd be a shame to
waste your youth

243
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,442
waiting around for
the perfect man, Eri.

244
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,108
Eri, come play games with me.

245
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,108
Support me! I can't hear you!

246
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:27,483
[ERIPIYO screams]

247
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,067
This is exactly why I
hate spending holidays

248
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,400
with my family.

249
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,817
[HOST B] Well, folks, only 30
minutes left till the new year!

250
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,233
Thank you for being with us!

251
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:43,692
Tonight, we're looking
back on the year

252
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,233
with some local celebrities!

253
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,567
Let's meet our New
Year's guests! Tom?

254
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,567
[HOST B]
Okayama's favorite comedians.

255
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,650
Chieko Bloomers
with special guest, V!

256
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,733
Hello!

257
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,108
[HOST A]
Mr. Otomo from Ibara,

258
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,067
shigin poet and winner of
the Demi Katsudon award!

259
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,650
Glad to be here!

260
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,733
[HOST B] Last but not least,
pop idol from Okayama,

261
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,150
Reo Igarashi!

262
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,150
Hi, everybody!

263
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,817
This is my first time appearing
on a show like this on my own,

264
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,650
so I admit I'm a bit nervous.

265
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,233
Well, it looks like
a lot of your fans

266
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,858
came out to support you,
so that should calm your nerves.

267
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,817
Thanks, everyone!

268
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,692
So you usually perform as part
of a group, is that right?

269
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,858
Yes, sir, we're called
Cham Jam and...

270
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,775
...the rest of them
are under 20,

271
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,192
so I'm a little sad
that they couldn't

272
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,692
come on the show
with me tonight.

273
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,525
We're super close.

274
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,275
So cool!

275
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:36,233
But I'm pretty sure all of them
are watching this from home!

276
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,358
[FANS]
We sure are!

277
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,942
[ERIPIYO coughing]

278
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,525
It's not fair!

279
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,567
Must be nice to ring in the
new year with your fave.

280
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,567
Man! How can I sit here and
eat soba at a time like this?

281
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:55,233
"Hey, Motoi. Let's visit a
shrine for luck right now!"

282
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,567
Send!

283
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,525
Uh. Hey!

284
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,108
Hi, there, Eripiyo.
Happy New Year to you.

285
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,608
Happy New Year!

286
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,608
I'm so glad you're the
first person I'm seeing

287
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,567
other than family
this year, Rena!

288
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,983
Am I chopped liver?

289
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,733
Rude, considering you
called me out here

290
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:21,692
in the middle of the night.

291
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,275
[MOTOI]
I'm a mess.

292
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,858
I'm all in my head.

293
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,983
Sorane spending New Year's
with a boyfriend kills me.

294
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,400
I couldn't sleep at all.

295
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,775
Yeah, but you already know
those rumors aren't true.

296
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,567
[MOTOI]
I mean, I hear you, but...

297
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,942
At the same time, we only
know the version of them

298
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,775
we see at concerts.

299
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,733
That's not at all
who they really are.

300
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,442
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah, you're right.

301
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:44,817
And we spent so much of the year

302
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,483
thinking about that
version of them,

303
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,775
it feels strange sometimes.

304
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,775
I wonder who Maina thinks about.

305
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:55,317
Like, does she obsess about
someone in the same way?

306
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,567
[YUKA]
Hey, Maina!

307
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,567
[gasps]

308
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,650
[MAINA]
Hi, Yuka. Happy New Year!

309
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:04,900
Same!

310
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,025
Wait! Are you
wearing a disguise?

311
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:08,650
You're such an idol!

312
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,358
No! I'm trying to stay well!

313
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,067
Anyway, there's only one person
who would recognize me,

314
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,150
as pathetic as that sounds.

315
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,858
Aww.

316
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,983
Well, let's go!

317
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,358
[MAINA]
Sure.

318
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:27,400
[MAINA]
I'm kinda bummed we won't have

319
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,900
another concert for a month.

320
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,567
Me, too. But we can
do temp work.

321
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,400
[MAINA]
Temp work, huh?

322
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:34,650
[ERIPIYO]
They won't stop bugging me

323
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,692
about a career and marriage.

324
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,442
You're lucky to be young.

325
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:41,317
I bet no one bugs you since
you're still in high school.

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,442
Yeah, but I do have
entrance exams.

327
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,817
So I can't go to
concerts for a while.

328
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,025
Aww.

329
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,483
And I'm sure Maina's
gonna miss seeing you

330
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,025
at the meet n' greets, too.

331
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:53,275
But they're not having any
concerts until February, so...

332
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,775
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah, that's true. But...

333
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:56,733
[groans]

334
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,025
[RENA]
Something wrong, Eripiyo?

335
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:01,150
My time with Maina
yesterday was so awkward!

336
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,025
Ugh! I don't wanna have to live

337
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,817
with this awful feeling
for a whole month!

338
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,775
I can't wait for
the next concert!

339
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,317
But I feel so awkward.

340
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,900
What in the world did you
do to warrant all this?

341
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,692
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

342
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:16,025
I bet Maina's not
upset about it at all.

343
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:19,150
Rena! You're the nicest
little sister around!

344
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,650
Let me buy you an Ema plaque!

345
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,608
She's my little
sister, you know!

346
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,983
No, I mean, we're just fans,
they don't think about us.

347
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:26,775
--[MOTOI] Huh?
--[ERIPIYO] What?

348
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:27,775
They're idols.

349
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:29,108
In the grand scheme of things,

350
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,192
I don't think we have much
of an impact on them.

351
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,567
Address me as a person,
not just as a random wota.

352
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,442
[ERIPIYO yells]

353
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,192
I really messed up, didn't I?!

354
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,900
[ERIPIYO wails]

355
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:45,733
[YUKA sighs]

356
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:47,400
[YUKA]
We're finally here!

357
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,483
Welp, guess I'll pray now.

358
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,817
One whole gacha pull! Here!

359
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,817
[MAINA] I pray that Cham Jam
will go to the Budokan.

360
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
Also...

361
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,692
[MAINA] ...I pray that Eripiyo
doesn't get hurt anymore.

362
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,817
[ERIPIYO] Please let Maina
have another healthy year.

363
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,317
Please let Maina always have

364
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
delicious, nutritious
food to eat.

365
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,025
Please let Maina
be happy all year.

366
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:41,358
Please let Maina
go to the Budokan.

367
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:42,567
[RENA]
Hey, Motoi.

368
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,775
Did you ask that I get
into a good college?

369
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,025
I bet you only prayed for things

370
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:48,358
that you want for
yourself this year.

371
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,525
I just ended up praying for
my own good health. Sorry.

372
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,025
It's cool.

373
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:56,442
Well, I guess I only said
prayers for things I want, too.

374
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,983
[ERIPIYO gasps]

375
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,442
I totally forgot to make any
wishes or prayers for myself!

376
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,067
Really? Then who were you
saying prayers for? Uh.

377
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,317
[BOTH]
I see.

378
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,608
What's that mean?

379
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,733
Hey, why do you too
suddenly seem so distant?

380
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:09,858
Come on!

381
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,025
I don't care what
Motoi thinks of me,

382
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,942
but, Rena, don't shut me out!

383
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,525
Why the heck have you been
so hostile towards me lately?

384
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:18,983
[ERIPIYO]
Rena!

385
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,775
[YUKA]
This amazake's so good!

386
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,067
It sure is.

387
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,608
So what did you pray for?

388
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,650
Did you wish that we
would go to the Budokan?

389
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,858
[MAINA]
Mh-hm.

390
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:30,650
Wait, Yuka, did you wish
for the same thing?

391
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:31,900
Yup!

392
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,608
But I thought that you
had said you didn't care

393
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:36,067
if Cham Jam went to the Budokan.

394
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,275
[YUKA]
I did.

395
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:40,233
Ya know, I think being
an idol is so much fun.

396
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,858
That's the reason I do this.

397
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,025
I get such a big kick
out of total strangers

398
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:46,400
telling me that they love me!

399
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,900
So as far as I'm concerned,

400
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,233
it doesn't really matter
what stage I'm on.

401
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,233
I don't care where I perform.

402
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,692
[MAINA]
Oh.

403
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,858
But then, at
yesterday's concert...

404
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,025
Thanks for coming!

405
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,775
You want a recording?
What should I say?

406
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,900
Um... "We're going
to the Budokan"?

407
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:05,983
If you don't mind.

408
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,817
Huh? Is that really
all you want?

409
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,692
That's all I want, thanks.

410
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:12,108
[FUMI]
Say, "Hey Fumi.

411
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,608
I can't wait to see you in
the crowd at the Budokan."

412
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,900
Wait, you want me
to say that, too?

413
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,400
Why is that?

414
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,275
You don't seem to be that
interested in performing there,

415
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,442
but for fans, it would
mean the world to us

416
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,983
to see our favorite
idols making it there.

417
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,567
[YUKA] If everyone who
loves me is saying

418
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,150
that they want to see us up
there, I guess I wouldn't mind

419
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,192
performing at the
Budokan for them.

420
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,108
You know, I feel
bad saying this,

421
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,900
but I thought you'd pray
for something different.

422
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,317
Something like,

423
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,275
"Please let me eat lots of
non-conveyor belt sushi."

424
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,608
I guess.

425
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,275
That's so mean! You think
I'm that self-centered?

426
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,900
But while we're on the subject,

427
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,025
I'd love to be the
center at the Budokan!

428
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,317
You know, you have to have
an odd numbered group

429
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,608
to have a center.

430
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:53,483
I know.

431
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,608
So seven's the perfect number.

432
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:56,692
[MAINA]
Mh-hm.

433
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:57,900
[YUKA chuckles]

434
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,108
Huh?

435
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:01,025
[MAINA]
Huh?

436
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:04,192
[YUKA]
Hey! Maki! Yume!

437
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,525
Oh. Hey, Yuka.

438
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,483
Jeez, keep it down!

439
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:08,733
[YUKA]
Don't worry.

440
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:10,983
We're not so famous that
we'd cause a big ruckus.

441
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,233
[MAKI] That's not why you
should be quiet here.

442
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,442
[MAINA]
Happy New Year.

443
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,233
[YUMERI]
Yeah. Happy New Year.

444
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:19,192
Spending New Year's together--
you girls are so close.

445
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:22,692
Uh. Well, we... We were
scared we'd get separated.

446
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:25,900
I wasn't talking about
that, but okay. See?

447
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,567
Oh, sure. Right, yeah.

448
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,317
[BOTH chuckle]

449
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,400
Made it!

450
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,692
And we stayed together,
thanks to this!

451
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,567
Yeah, it's a good thing you
thought to bring it with you.

452
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,775
I wonder how long until sunrise.

453
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:50,525
Fear not, friend!
Morning comes no matter what.

454
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,858
And Cham Jam's gonna shine
brighter than the sun!

455
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,233
There you go with
random proclamations.

456
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,525
Speaking of the new year,

457
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,442
did you watch Reo on
the countdown show?

458
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,275
Yep, I did, actually.
Although...

459
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:10,317
[ALL]
Five, four, three, two, one...

460
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,733
{\an8}Happy New Year!

461
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,608
[MOTOI] I was so distracted
by Kumasa's weirdness

462
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,525
that I ended up
missing the countdown.

463
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,317
[ERIPIYO]
He was super creepy, right?

464
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,858
If I look anything like him,
I've gotta change my ways.

465
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,400
But still.

466
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,858
He also looked happy, didn't he?

467
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:33,483
[MOTOI] Yeah. I thought
it was pretty awesome.

468
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,567
[MAKI] Oh, hey, did you
guys watch Reo on TV?

469
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,525
[MAINA]
Yeah.

470
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,067
[YUKA]
Me, too!

471
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,942
[YUKA] Reo was looking
right at all her fans

472
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,358
when the new year began.

473
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,692
It looked amazing.

474
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,025
She spent New Year's with
people who love her.

475
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:50,108
[MAINA]
Yeah.

476
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,317
I'd like to do that
someday, too.

477
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,733
Oh, I see how it is.

478
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:56,192
I guess I don't fall into
that category, then?

479
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,608
That's not what I meant!

480
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,108
[YUMERI, MAKI chuckle]

481
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,358
[gasps]

482
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:11,525
[ERIPIYO] In Maina's eyes,
I may just be another fan.

483
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,817
But she's the one who showed me

484
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,692
just how happy I could be

485
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,775
giving everything I have
to just one person.

486
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:23,108
If Maina made it to the Budokan,
then I could die happy!

487
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:26,525
If Maina made it to the Budokan,
I could die period!

488
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:29,983
In fact, if Maina made it to
the Budokan, I would just die!

489
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,108
Jeez, we get it!

490
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:39,358
Maina! I swear I'll love
you even more this year!

491
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,567
[gasps]

492
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,317
Why are you so fidgety Maina?

493
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,317
[MAINA] I thought I heard
Eripiyo's voice just now, but...

494
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,317
No, it couldn't be.

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,150
[MAKI]
Well, we saw the first sunrise.

496
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,233
Let's go home.

497
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,483
What? Leave already?

498
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,275
[MAINA] I'm getting
pretty tired, too, Yuka.

499
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,275
You're no fun!

500
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,817
Aya's got her part-time
job in the morning,

501
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,483
Reo is at home, sleeping,

502
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:11,108
and Sorane's at some
relative's house.

503
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:12,692
The Cham Jam crew's
not gonna be able

504
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,942
to get together again
until February!

505
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:17,858
I'm sure we'll be doing
some outdoor event this month.

506
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:21,442
I mean, you know how management
is, everything's last-minute.

507
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,525
Yeah, I guess you're right.

508
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,192
[MAINA] That means I'll be able
to see Eripiyo soon, too!

509
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,608
[YUKA]
And our outdoor performance

510
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,525
will be at the Budokan!

511
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,983
[MAKI, YUMERI]
Yeah, I seriously doubt that.

512
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:36,650
[ALL laughing]

513
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:08,442
[KUMASA] You were amazing on
the countdown show, Reo!

514
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,192
I totally clocked how
you looked at me first

515
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,525
as soon as the new year started.

516
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,650
But I didn't get invited
to the first shrine visit.

517
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,733
I wonder why.

518
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:16,108
Uh, Reo, are you going
to cheer me up?

519
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:19,025
Thanks so much! Wow,
I'm feeling better already!

520
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:20,483
[YOSHIKAWA] Thank you
very much! Your time's up!

521
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:21,400
[KUMASA]
Kuma, kuma, kuma!
