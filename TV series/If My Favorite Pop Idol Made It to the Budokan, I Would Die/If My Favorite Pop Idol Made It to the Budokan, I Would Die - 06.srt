It's Yumeri. I loved seeing
her so happy the other day.

be in the center.

Huh? You don't wanna
be in the center?

I'd love to see you there.
You're amazing, Sorane.

you too much, Reo.

You're "it" in my mind.
The picture-perfect idol.

I think they're those
"idols" you hear about.

Idols, huh?

26
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,317
You mean you can be
called an idol

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,692
even with a crowd this small?

28
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,108
Guess so.

You know, you're way
cuter than them, Sorane.

Oh, don't flatter me.

[SORANE'S AUNT]
You could be an idol!

I could never do that.
No point trying.

[SORANE]
No way.

37
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:33,067
You have to work so hard to
become an idol. I'd just fail.

[STUDENT A]
Hey, for our next match,

39
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:40,150
I decided to pair with someone
else for doubles, okay?

Huh? But why?

I mean, no real
reason, I guess.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,858
I just figured I would mix
it up a little this time.

43
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:49,192
It's nothing personal, ya know?

00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,942
Okay.

45
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,233
[SORANE]
So it isn't about me, then?

00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,525
[STUDENT D]
So did you tell her?

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,525
[SORANE]
They all knew?

48
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,025
It's no use.

49
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,775
I need to stop believing
these people are special.

I have some news.

This is Miss Matsuyama.
She's joining you.

Oh! You must have seen
me with my old group!

64
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:03,108
They disbanded a little while
ago and Cham scooped me up!

65
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:07,900
Honestly, I've never really
danced before. Or sang, either.

66
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,192
My aunt sent in my application
without telling me.

67
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:14,400
Yeah, but you got this far
on your own merit, didn't you?

68
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:18,775
You'll be fine! If I can
do this, anyone can!

But you're... pretty.

Not prettier than you!

71
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:25,358
I'm here 'cause I had
fans cheering me on.

72
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,817
The truth is, being an idol
is about more than looks!

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,192
You have to work
really hard, too!

Don't worry. It'll be fun.

[REO chuckles]

00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,733
I knew right away I
wanted to be friends,

82
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:50,192
so I did some stalking online!

83
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,525
[SORANE] I'm sort of
struggling with this part.

84
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,108
Yeah, right before
the last hook.

85
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,525
[YUMERI]
It's such a tongue-twister,

86
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,442
and the lyrics change
slightly there,

87
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:14,567
which makes it hard to memorize.

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,942
Oh, I know!

89
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,317
If you change where you
breathe, it's a bit easier.

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,150
Like, for you, Sorane.

91
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,442
If you breathe here, and then
breathe again right there,

92
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,567
I think going into the hook
won't be as difficult.

93
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,942
Ohh.

94
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,858
Well, it's clear who's been
doing this the longest.

She must be switching to Yuka!

160
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,275
[MURAKAMI] Eripiyo's growing
cherry blossoms now?

161
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:44,817
She's gotta be a Reo stan!

162
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,483
Stop the madness!

163
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,525
You're the ones
who need to stop!

164
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:49,983
I'm not switching, okay?

165
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,567
What's with you?
Are you the stan police?

166
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,400
[MOTOI] They sure are
a pain, am I right?

167
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,192
[ERIPIYO] All blue?
Try stanning with dignity!

168
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,233
[KUMASA]
What's that saying about

169
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,858
the pot and the kettle again?

170
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:05,858
I just keep buying blue stuff.
I can't even help myself!

171
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,608
Oh, here.

172
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,608
I picked these up when
I went back home to Wake.

173
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:11,817
I want you to have some.

174
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,608
[KUMASA]
You bet.

175
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,108
Thank you. What is it?

176
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,567
Aonori sashimi konjac.

177
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,942
It's blue, so I kept
buying more and more.

178
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:24,400
[ERIPIYO] I mean, this is
technically green, so...

179
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:25,650

You just can't stay away!

[SORANE]
You're wearing blue. I like it.

182
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,025
Did you think of me
when you bought it?

183
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,275
[MOTOI]
Whoa! How did you guess?

184
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,442
[chuckles] Oh, come on.

185
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,108
You picked out that ensemble
just for me, didn't you?

186
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:40,400

00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:41,567

You wait right there.

192
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,650
[ERIPIYO]
Uh, Maina?

193
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,025
You know, I can't help
thinking about you

194
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,025
every time I eat salmon.

195
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,608
[MAINA]
Huh? Why though?

196
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,108
Um, thank you for the nice gift.

197
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,483

you're so nice.

198
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,817
[ERIPIYO]
They got to you!

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,650
I'm glad. I was worried!

200
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:09,692
Did you eat them?

201
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,942
Oh, no, of course I didn't!

202
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,483
[ERIPIYO]
Huh? Why though?

203
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,817
[MAINA]
I wanted to keep them.

204
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,858
[MAINA] Why does Eripiyo
have something green

205
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,525
tucked in her shirt?

206
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:25,233
Green is... Aya's color!

207
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,442
She's switching on me!

208
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,942
[chuckles]

209
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,233
[ERIPIYO]
She seemed to zone out

210
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,150
when I told her the thing
about eating salmon.

211
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,608
Well, duh.

212
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,317
Has it ever occurred to you
that you're just as boring

213
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,525
as the rest of us even
though you're a girl?

214
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,983
More importantly, isn't there
new merch coming out soon?

215
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,733
The stuff with the new design.

216
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,067
Oh, that's right!

217
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,817
I think I saw some
post on social media.

218
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,150
[grunts]

219
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,358
[BOTH gasp]

220
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:00,733
[MOTOI yells]

221
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,733
[KUMASA]
What happened?

222
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:10,108
I'm pretty sure Motoi just died!

223
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,275
[MOTOI]
There was a sighting.

224
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:17,067
Apparently Sorane was spotted
walking with some stupid guy.

225
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,067
[BOTH]
Wha--?

226
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,067
What the heck?!

227
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,233
The Idol Stan Paradox
is our strong desire

228
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,400
to become idols ourselves,

229
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,442
in order to get closer
to our faves.

230
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,983
But if this were ever achieved,

231
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,733
we would lose the ability to
see our faves as idols anymore.

232
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,275
Exactly!

233
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:38,400
I've been trying to reconcile
that for almost a year now.

234
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:39,817
Oh, don't worry.

235
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,025
'Cause you two have zero chance
of ever becoming idols.

236
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,442
More importantly, can you
guys not blatantly ignore

237
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,067
the information that almost
killed me a moment ago?

238
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,983
Have a little compassion--
my fave has a boyfriend!

239
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,608
Other people's faves are boring.

240
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,525
Yeah, literally no interest.

241
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,150
[MOTOI groans]

242
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,192
Come on! I'm dying here!

243
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:02,650
[ERIPIYO] But I mean,
Sorane was in the tennis club.

244
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,858
[MOTOI]
Curse you, tennis club!

245
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,150
[MOTOI] Honestly, I don't
think I can bring myself

246
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,692
to show my face
around here again.

247
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,567
[MAKI]
Are you searching yourself?

248
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,025
Ew, gross, no.

249
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,567
I'm learning about what it
takes to raise a hamster.

250
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,483
[MAKI]
Uh.

251
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,358
Caught in the act.

252
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,358
Just what is so wrong with
the tennis club, anyway?

253
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,858
[sighs]

254
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,400
This isn't looking good.

255
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,275
Someone's claiming they spotted
me, and to make matters worse,

256
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:35,233
they're saying I was
out with a guy.

257
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,442
No.

258
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,983
They're liars!

259
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,067
I was helping Yuka with her
homework that whole afternoon!

260
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,858
The last thing I want is for
people to get the wrong idea.

261
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:45,650
So I was hoping
Yuka'd do me a solid

262
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,983
and tell everyone at the show
tomorrow that I was with her.

263
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,358
But she claims she
doesn't remember!

264
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,483
Are you kidding? Sorry, fam.
I could never tell a lie!

265
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,733
Ugh!

266
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,858
[MAKI] You're way too
worried about your fans.

267
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:01,525
I've never even bothered to look
up my name in the first place.

268
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,733
[SORANE] You're too lax
about this stuff, Maki.

269
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,942
No, I just don't care.

270
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:09,317
I'm not doing anything
I'd be ashamed of, anyway.

271

Still, though. Cham is the
only good thing in my life.

hear the rumors?

[REO]
You're a true-blue idol, Sorane.

278
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:35,650
You would never do anything that
could tarnish your reputation.

279
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:39,442
So tomorrow? Just hold your
head high and do your job.

280
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,358
If anyone brings it up,
I will defend you.

That's Reo. Always so kind.

otaku are funny sometimes.

283
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,817
[KUMASA]
Are you thinking about Motoi?

284
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,442
You're right, but honestly,

285
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,150
it's pretty common for dudes to
fall in love with their faves.

286
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,442
I guess I never thought about it

287
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,775
'cause I was alone at
these shows for so long.

288
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:07,567
So are we gonna do that
thing or what? Come on.

289
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,983
I'm on crutches, hold on!

290
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,275
[ERIPIYO]
Gah! This is rad!

00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:16,150
A new pastime and
it's totally free?

292
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,608
It's the Cham Jam
Blog Selfie Tour!

293
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,525
[KUMASA] Yeah, we're taking
the exact same pictures

294
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:23,483
in the exact same places!

295
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,900
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah, but...

296
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,275
We're doing the same poses,

297
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:30,858
so why do our pictures
look so much dumber?

298
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,900
[MOTOI] You two look
carefree. Must be nice.

299
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:35,775
Hey, Motoi! So you
decided to show up!

300
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:40,608
Yeah. I guess I just wanted
to make one final pilgrimage.

301
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,150
Sorane was everything
good in my world.

302
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,692
She was my one
true happiness in life.

303
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:49,025
But apparently, our love
meant nothing to her.

304
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:52,358
So I see no point in my
coming here anymore.

305
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:54,983
Would you like to
express it with a poem?

306
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,608
Sorane. Pain.

307
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,067
You broke my heart,
it's killing me-ay.

to believe she would?

316
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,733
[MOTOI chuckles]

317
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,608
[ERIPIYO]
You are.

318
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,942
[MAINA]
Sorane's incredible.

319
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:35,483
So resilient. She inspires me.
I'm gonna do my best!

320
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,942
[ERIPIYO]
Um, Maina?

321
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,650
You have my support from now on!

322
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,650
You're so cute!
I'm your fan for life!

323
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,608
Please accept this
decorative candy I made!

324
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:47,483
[MAINA] I'd started to take
Eripiyo's love for granted.

325
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,900
I didn't show her how
much it means to me.

326
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,567
I'm sure she felt like
her efforts were wasted.

327
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,775
It makes perfect sense
that she would stray!

328
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,483
[MAINA] These heart hands
are for you, Eripiyo!

329
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,192
Take that!

330
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,150
[MAINA]
She's not looking?

331
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,317
I gave Eripiyo her own
special heart hands

332
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,358
and she wasn't even watching?

333
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,942
[MOTOI]
Ten of Sorane's please.

334
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,900
Wow. He's back at it.

335
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,650
Welp, here goes.

336
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:24,983
Twenty of Reo's please.

337
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,442
Gotta make up for that
whole maid café fiasco.

338
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,150
[ERIPIYO grunting]

339
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,317
I want to support Maina.
I'll die if I don't.

340
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,233
I want to spend all
of my money on her.

341
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,108
Just let me spend my money!

342
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,358
No! Eripiyo's become a
"take-my-money zombie"!

343
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:46,400
Let me support her.
Take all my money.

344
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,067
Snap out of it, Eripiyo!

345
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,775
Look, being a stan
isn't all about

346
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,483
buying your fave's merchendise!

347
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,317
Your desire to support
her's worth more

348
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,317
than all the money in the world!

349
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,900
If my support could
make her popular,

350
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:59,317
all would be right
with the world.

351
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,567
[KUMASA] Why does she have
to make such good points?

352
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,775
[ERIPIYO]
But you're right.

353
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:05,608
Our feelings about them
are super important.

354
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,525
So thank you. You're the best!

355
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:10,525
[YUKA]
You want to pay me to slap you?

356
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,400
[ERIPIYO]
One, please!

357
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:14,650
[MAINA] She only bought
one again today.

358
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:18,983
If she strays, I don't know
how I could live with myself.

359
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:22,192
What if she really does
pick another fave?

360
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,775
[gasps]

361
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,983
How about we play a game where
I tell you everything I feel?

362
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,525
[MAINA]
Huh?

363
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,442
[ERIPIYO]
Maina, you have the most

364
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,817
beautiful face in the world.

365
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,025
I love the way you dance
and your gentle demeanor.

366
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,567
I love how you
always do your best.

367
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,067
If I could spend every minute
of my life supporting you,

368
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,400
then I could die happy.

369
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:39,692
The fact that you're alive
brings me so much joy.

370
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,483
I'm honored to be
on the planet as you.

371
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,942
I love you so much, it hurts!

372
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:46,108
Maina, I just... love you!

373
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,067
Uh, thank you.
Your time's up now?

374
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,275
Sorry. I just wasn't sure
if you knew any of that,

375
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:55,067
so I thought I should tell you.

376
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,983
Yeah. I think I got it all.

377
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:03,317
[MISAKI] Okay! Up next:
Reo, Sorane, and Yumeri!

378
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,608
Wow, you came!
So glad to see you!

379
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:06,442
--[FAN A] Yeah!
--[REO giggles]

380
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:07,900
You're so sweet!

381
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,733
--[FAN A] Well, thank you.
--[REO] Sure! See you soon!

382
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,900
[REO] Hello! Ha! Aw, you
don't have to say that!

383
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,775
[MISAKI]
Ten for Sorane.

384
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:16,817
[gasps]

385
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,983
[SORANE]
Motoi!

386
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,817
[MOTOI gasps]

387
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,150
Thank you!

388
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,567
[MOTOI]
You remembered my name!

389
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,400
You wrote me a letter
the other day.

390
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,483
I knew who sent it immediately!

391
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:31,483
But to think you
actually remembered me.

392
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,400
[SORANE]
I promise.

393
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:36,150
I love my loyal fans, and those
who go out of their way for me

394
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,942
are even more special.

395
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,900
So don't stop. I won't forget.

396
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:44,942
[MOTOI]
Of course!

397
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,692
[SORANE]
In the end,

398
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,692
I guess it's hard not
to fall for everyone

399
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,442
who tells you they love you.

400
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:57,442
It's not exactly
romantic love, but...

401
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:00,692
[SORANE]
Hm?

402
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:03,692
Sorane. I love you.

403
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,442
Uh, thanks, but you
love everybody, Reo.

404
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:10,400
[REO]
Heh. That's true.

405
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:13,817
But still, it's one of the
many things I love about you.

406
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,817
Aw, thanks!

407
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,983
[ERIPIYO]
Hmm...

408
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,608
[KUMASA]
Looks like Sorane's in trouble.

409
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,400
She fell from the top three.

410
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,692
[RENA]
Wait, really? Why is that?

411
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,192
There was a sighting.

412
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,650
She was seen walking
with some guy in Wake.

413
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,233
[RENA]
Wake?

414
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,650
That means Sorane was spotted
with a guy near our place then.

415
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,317
[ERIPIYO]
Huh...

416
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,900
Now that I think about it,

417
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,567
maybe the people
they saw that day

418
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,608
weren't Sorane
and her boyfriend.

419
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,483
Motoi, it might have
been the two of you.

420
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:51,400
I mean, Rena looks
just like Sorane.

421
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,733
[KUMASA] Oh! That does
make perfect sense!

422
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,900
Well, holy crap! That's it!

423
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,233
[RENA groans]

424
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,733
[KUMASA]
Ha! It was just a false alarm!

425
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,317
[MOTOI]
Hooray!

426
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,358
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Congrats! Mystery solved!

427
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:06,525
[MOTOI]
Thank you!

428
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:07,942
[MOTOI laughing]

429
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,650
[ERIPIYO] I hope it gets
sorted out! Poor Sorane!

430
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,692
[MOTOI]
Hey, hold on!

431
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:16,233
So... I'm the only Sorane stan
who knows the truth right now.

432
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,858
That means I could be
her shoulder to cry on

433
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,275
while everyone else
abandons her.

434
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,233
This is great!

435
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:23,025
[MOTOI groans]

436
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,775
No, not great. Creepy.

437
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,150
[MOTOI, KUMASA]
Peace! Peace. Peace!

438
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:39,275
All wrong, guys! Look younger!
Younger! Please!

439
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,483
[MAINA] I wonder what they're
doing. Seems like fun.

440
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,483
[KUMASA]
This is harder than it looks.

441
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,400
[ERIPIYO] Watch and learn.
It should look like this!

442
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:49,358
It's like an angel angle!

443
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,692
No, more like a
goddess, actually! Uh.

444
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,192
[MOTOI, KUMASA]
Maina.

445
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,358
[ERIPIYO]
Huh?

446
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,900
Uh, sorry! I, uh...

447
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:00,775
[gasps]

448
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:02,817
[MAINA]
I'll get this right!

449
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,608
Hearts!

450
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,067
[ERIPIYO] Whoa, what in
the world is that pose?

451
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,567
Uh! She's trying!

452
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,442
In that case...

453
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,567
My heart!

454
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,275
[ERIPIYO yelling]

455
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:20,192
It worked?

456
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:22,692
[giggles]

457
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:27,692
[yelling]

458
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:29,858
[MOTOI]
What is the matter with you?

459
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:32,567
Maina's fan service!

460
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,900
So should we call an
ambulance, or what?

461
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,400
[RENA] Maina, you look
super cute again today.

462
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,942
The last day of popularity
voting is almost here.

463
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:14,442
I'm so busy studying for
college entrance exams

464
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,400
that I can't vote as
much as everyone else.

465
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,067
By the way, do I really look

466
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,025
as much like Sorane
as everyone says?

467
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,442
[YOSHIKAWA]
Thank you so much! Time is up.
