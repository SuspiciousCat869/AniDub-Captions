[AYA]
Excuse me, miss!

3
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,150
We're having a concert on
that stage over there at 2 P.M.

4
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,025
If you're not busy,
you should come!

5
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:52,858
[MAINA]
That's right.

6
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:55,192
Um, please come watch!

7
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:10,775
[ERIPIYO]
I always thought idols

8
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:14,192
were supposed to be
like dazzling stars.

9
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:20,108
[ERIPIYO] But things are
rarely what we think.

10
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:21,775
[REO]
Thank you all so much for coming

11
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,900
to Cham Jam at the
Cherry Blossom Festival!

12
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:27,358
Truly. We're so
grateful to you all!

13
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:28,233
[GUYS]
Yeah!

14
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:29,942
[REO]
It's such a relief!

15
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,942
I had no idea what
we were going to do

16
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,108
if nobody had shown up today!

17
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,650
Honestly, I never
worried for a second.

18
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,275
[REO]
What? For real?

19
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:40,400
Reo, you are kind
of a worry wart.

20
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,733
Yeah, you should really
learn how to relax.

21
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,692
[REO]
I don't know how!

[ERIPIYO]
But you?

26
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:05,775
You were far more dazzling
than I ever could've imagined.

27
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:09,858
And that afternoon, your
brilliance nearly killed me.

28
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,650
[MOTOI]
That's amazing, Kumasa!

29
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,775
You've already got
a full Reo set?

30
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,233
See, that's what makes
you a famous <i>otaku</i> .

31
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,817
No, no.

32
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,233
I could never have gotten there
without all your help, Motoi.

33
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,067
Here you go.
The Sorane I promised you.

34
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,525
[MOTOI]
Thanks, man!

35
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,900
I really wish they'd stop
giving us all these randos.

36
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,358
It's gettin' old.

37
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,025
[KUMASA] I dunno, at least
they're part of a photo set

38
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,858
and not some lame
CD extra or something.

39
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,525
I'm pretty sure you're
the first to collect

40
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:10,817
all the pics of your fave,
ss far as I know.

41
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,858
I mean, each girl has 20 shots.

42
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,233
Nope, someone I know collected

43
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,733
all 20 of their
favorites at once,

44
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:16,983
if you can believe it.

45
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,567
They didn't even have
to trade or anything.

46
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,650
Isn't that crazy?

47
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,900
Wha--?

48
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:22,692
Wait, you've gotta be
talking about that, uh,

49
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:23,608
that Maina fan.

50
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:24,858
Oh, man.

51
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:25,900
[SORANE] We're doing a
concert right over there

52
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,150
at that theater!

53
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,483
You should totally come
see us, if you can!

54
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,400
Oh. Hey, guys!

55
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,858
You are coming to see us
again today, I hope.

56
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:34,733
Sorane.

57
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,067
Yup!

58
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,400
So, uh, is Reo gonna be
performing with you today?

59
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,817
Why? Are we not enough
for you or something?

60
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,775
[MOTOI] Of course you are!
More than enough!

61
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:46,608
[KUMASA] Yeah. You two are
adorable in your own right.

62
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:47,858

00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,608
Maina?

[MOTOI gasps]

00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:02,483
[KUMASA]
Oh, hey, Eripiyo!

68
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,817
Hang on. I could've sworn I saw
Maina with you just now.

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,942
[KUMASA]
You did.

70
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,025
She was just here,
handing out fliers.

71
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,192
What?!

72
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,358
Then it's true--
she really is avoiding me?

73
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,067
[MOTOI]
She's so extra.

74
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,608
She spends her entire paycheck
on her favorite idol,

75
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,817
and the only outfit she wears

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,150
is her track uniform
from high school.

77
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,358
Word on the street is,

78
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,067
newbies to the fandom
tremble at the sight

79
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,567
of her bright red likeness.

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,608
They fear the name Eripiyo!

81
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,817
She's an OG fan and the
only true Maina stan.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,150
Hold it, buster!

83
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,775
The only reason it
may seem like Maina

84
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,900
doesn't have any other fans

85
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,858
is that her color is
salmon pink, okay?

86
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,525
[FANS cheering]

87
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:38,650
[ERIPIYO]
It's a rare color,

88
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,108
and you'd have to
put salmon pink film

89
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,900
into your KING BLADE
to achieve the right hue!

90
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,150
Gotcha.

91
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,025
Also, it only looks like
there are more Reo fans

92
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,150
because her color
is regular pink!

93
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,233
That's blasphemy!

94
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,150
There are more,
'cause Reo's the cutest!

95
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,233
Are you implying
Maina's not the best?

96
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:55,108
You wanna get your butt kicked?

97
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,400
[whimpers]

98
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,983
[SORANE]
Don't worry about those two.

99
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,317
They're at it all the time.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,567
Anyway, you're one of
my fans, aren't you?

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,567
[MOTOI gasps]

102
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,275
You came to see us
two weeks ago.

103
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,192
I'm so happy to see you again!

104
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,150
No way! You actually
remember me?

105
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,733
[SORANE]
Of course I did!

106
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:14,317
It's only natural that I love
anybody who's faithful to me.

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,108
Hey, you wanna come
see a concert?

108
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,358
Sorane.

109
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,983
Hey, Motoi, let's head
over to the theater.

110
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,608
Huh? Won't we be early?

111
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,817
Oh, I see. You're scared...

112
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,275
[KUMASA] Calm down,
Eripiyo. Come with us.

113
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,983
[KUMASA] It's not the best
idea to try and talk to them

114
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,483
while they're handing
out fliers.

115
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,858
Oh. Yeah, that makes
sense. Sorry.

116
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,608
No worries. It's not a hard-
and-fast rule or anything.

117
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:39,858
Besides, I prefer
to pay for the honor.

118
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,483
I just like the way it feels!

119
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,733
A thousand yen for
five second of bliss!

120
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,858
Gets your blood pumping, right?

121
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,400
Uh. I guess.

122
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,483
I get it--I buy up
all that time with Maina

123
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,400
and then end up spending
a ton more on her merch

124
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,775
while I'm at it.

125
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:53,858
I'd like to purchase

126
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:55,900
all of Maina's handshake
tickets, please.

127
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,317
Aren't you afraid monopolizing
all of Maina's time

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,150
will kill any chance of her
building up a fanbase, though?

129
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,775
I just wonder why she's
always so cold to me.

130
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:07,108
I sincerely appreciate
all your support.

131
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,358
Ah! How can I make you like me?

132
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,567
Maina! Maina!

133
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,025
If I may, could it be
that the sheer intensity

134
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,483
of your passion freaks her out?

135
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,692
[MISAKI] We'll be opening
the doors in a moment.

136
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,692
Please be waiting with
your ticket in hand!

137
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,067
And, naturally, you two
are the first in line.

138
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,525
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

139
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,858
Yeah, we know the drill.

140
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:27,192
They go in order of when
you purchased your ticket.

141
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,733
You'll get the hang of it soon.

142
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,567
[ERIPIYO] In other words,
they line you up in order

143
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,317
of who wants to see their
favorite the most.

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
[KUMASA] And how badly
you want world peace.

145
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,483
[ERIPIYO]
And how fast your wifi is!

146
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm inspired by you both.

147
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,358
We're officially
opening the doors!

148
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,608
So, who's holding
ticket number one?

149
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:42,900
Me!

150
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,608
[REO]
Hey, everyone!

151
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,317
Who's ready to have
a great time?

152
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,733
[FANS cheering]

153
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,275
Is there anyone here for
the first time tonight?

154
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:55,442
[FANS]
Yeah!

155
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,650
A special welcome to you guys!

156
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,317
Reo!

157
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,567
[ERIPIYO]
Maina.

158
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,858
You managed to make it
onstage again tonight.

159

If I were a producer,

such a ridiculous color.

Sorry, I was distracted by the
fact that Maina wasn't talking.

What's up?

302
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:50,400
Five CDs per person,
and fewer CDs than usual.

303
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:54,400
So, according to
my calculations...

...we have to rush to
get our hands on them

Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

307

Indeed.

out before we get 'em.

00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,108
[ERIPIYO]
Yes, exactly!

316
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,942
[KUMASA]
It sure is sunny out today.

317
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,608
It's gonna get hot.

318
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,275
Well, we're in the shade,
at least, so that's good.

319
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,067
I'm glad this event's
below street level.

320
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,775
Yeah, we're lucky they're
an underground group!

321
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,733
[KUMASA] I mean, I do hope they
become more mainstream someday.

322
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,692
[ERIPIYO] Hopefully their CDs
get wider distribution.

323
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,067
[ALL groaning]

324
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,983
[ERIPIYO] How long till
the merch booth opens?

325
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,483
[KUMASA]
Seven more hours.

326
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,067
[ERIPIYO]
Welp, guess I'll die.

327
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,067
Yeah, the air really doesn't
circulate down here, does it?

328
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,025
{\an8}[NARRATOR] On this June
day in Okayama City,

329
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,650
{\an8}where Eripiyo and
the others live,

330
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:00,358
{\an8}the temperatures soared,
reaching record-breaking highs.

331
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,150
I can't take it anymore!

332
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,858
You've got this!
Remember the photo op!

333
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,525
[MATSUO] Is all this
suffering really worth

334
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,858
one little photo op?

335
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,567
I mean, we're gonna
see their new outfits

336
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,858
at the show anyway!

337
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,442
[BOTH gasp]

338
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,608
[OTAKU E] That's the one line
we're never supposed to cross!

339
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:22,692
[OTAKU F] No. He said
the quiet part out loud!

340
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,358
We're here to memorialize
this moment

341
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,775
when our favorites reserved
special time just for us!

342
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,525
[KUMASA]
If you decide to leave now,

343
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,608
all the time you've spent
waiting will have been in vain.

344
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:35,567
But go on.

345
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,817
I'm sure that your favorite

346
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,192
won't doubt your
dedication to her.

This guy knows what...

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,025
[MOTOI] The OG fans are
seriously on another level!

350
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,900
[ERIPIYO] It's so hot that
I'm not even really sure

351
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,483
what's going on anymore.

352
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:52,525
But I know this:
Kumasa's the coolest!

353
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,442
[OTAKU F]
I'm not gonna make it.

Good morning, everyone!

Good morning!

Okay! We'll see you
all in there!

Oh, man, they're so cute!

361
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:26,067
Are you okay? Maina just
walked right by you.

362
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,567
It's embarrassing.

363
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,192
I don't want Maina to realize
that I'm the first in line

00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,525
to buy her merch again.

Wha--? What's gotten
into you all of a sudden?

366
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,358
I'm sure Maina would be thrilled

367
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,900
that you braved this
heat to be the first

368
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,817
to get a photo op with her!

369
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,692
I'm a freak.

370
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,025
No, really, what's
gotten into you?

371
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,233
[ERIPIYO]
I just told you.

372
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,025
[KUMASA] You've been
a freak for two years.

373
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,733
Why worry now?

Ah! This ice cream is awesome!

I've had 60 now.

and transformed into delirium.

approach the table now.

Here you go. Five for Maina,
is that right?

But I haven't even
said anything yet!

copies of the new single!

[ERIPIYO] It looks like we only
get one photo op today.

388
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,150
Yeah, that's fine with me.

389
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,858
As long as the new
outfits are cute.

390
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,317
I'll just treasure it even more.

[ERIPIYO]
Huh?

392

Hang on, this means that
I'm all drenched in sweat

393
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,108
for my one picture with her!

Maina's gonna see my
puffy, red, tomato face.

395
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,108
I was so worried about
getting here on time

396
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,692
that I forgot to wear makeup!

397

Oh, crap. I bet I have
major B.O., too.

aren't cute at all.

they be wearing these?

come up with outfits

[ERIPIYO] My first photo
op in four months.

416
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,400
Crap! I'm sweating even more!

Hello, there.

420

[ERIPIYO gasps]

421
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,108
You wanna do heart hands?

[gasps]

423
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,942
[ERIPIYO] The outfit's a
whole lot cuter up close.

She's really makin' the
salmon thing work for her.

Or maybe I'm just
getting used to it.

Um, I'm sorry, I look
freaking terrible today,

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,233
and I got really sweaty,
so I'm sure I stink.

428
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:02,317
I don't wanna gross you out.
Please don't get any closer!

429
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,192
But you--

430
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:04,567
[ERIPIYO]
It's fine!

431
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,983
Sir, can you please hurry up
and take the picture?

432
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:07,525
I'm begging you!

433
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:15,858
[KUMASA, MOTOI]
What's the point?

434
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,942
What even is this photo?

435
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,567
[ERIPIYO] Actually,
this one was the retake.

436
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,067
[MOTOI, KUMASA]
What?

437
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,942
[ERIPIYO] In the first one,
you could only see my hand,

438
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,233
so we took it again.

439
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,317
But you waited in that
awful heat for hours

440
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,650
and this is all you got?

441
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,067
This is what the picture's
supposed to look like.

442
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,483
Isn't it cute?

443
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:34,983
Guys, it's fine!
Maina looks great. Back off!

444
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,025
[KUMASA]
I mean, to be honest,

445
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,650
she's barely in
the picture, either.

446
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,108
[ERIPIYO] But the angle of
her fingers is adorable!

447
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,525
Look! Look at her ring finger...

448
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,608
No, wait! It isn't just her
finger--it's everything!

449
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:49,400
I love her!
She's amazingly adorable!

450
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,650
[ERIPIYO squeals, laughs]

451
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,858
I want everyone in the
world to know who she is

452
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,108
and fall in love with her!

453
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,692
That's what Maina deserves!

454
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,942
You mean you don't wanna have
your favorite all to yourself?

455
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,567
The thing I love
most about Maina

456
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,733
is how hard she
works as an idol.

457
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,317
So I don't want to
keep her to myself.

458
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,483
I want her to belong
to everyone.

459
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,692
But even if she did,

460
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:09,192
there's no doubt in my
mind that I love her

461
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,192
more than anyone ever could.

462
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,942
Yeah. I know exactly
what ya mean.

463
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,608
[ERIPIYO] If Maina were
to make it to the Budokan,

464
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,358
I'd die happy.

465
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:27,692
If Maina were to make it to
the Budokan... I'd die happy!

466
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,483
[ERIPIYO] It's so important,
I had to say it twice.

467
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,025
[KUMASA]
Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

468
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,358
[MOTOI]
It never even occurred to me.

469
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,275
[ERIPIYO]
Maina.

470
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,900
[MISAKI]
You girls ready to head out?

471
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,275
Almost time to go.

472
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,400
[AYA, YUMERI, REO]
Okay!

473
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:50,358
Huh? Someone left their photo.

474
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,900
Oh, that's mine.

475
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:53,275
[YUKA]
Ah.

476
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:22,692
[MAINA]
Eripiyo.

477
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,567
It means so much that you
came to see me again today.

478
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,275
Hopefully tomorrow
I'll have the courage

479
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:29,733
to tell you how I really feel.

480
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,483
[KUMASA] So, Reo, I heard
you're gonna perform

481
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:09,942
in the Okayama Girls Festa.

482
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:11,233
Congratulations!

483
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,275
Now everyone in town
will see how cute you are!

484
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:14,650
I bet you'll be
scouted as a model,

485
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,275
then get a part
on a big TV series,

486
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,525
and get big and famous
and totally unattainable.

487
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:19,775
Not that you're attainable no--

488
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,358
[YOSHIKAWA] Thank you
very much. Time's up!
