So, um, great job today.

319
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,025
I only watched you.

320
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,317
When Cham was done,
I just went and ate udon.

321
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,233
I figured. Thank you.

322
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:10,983
And with you there,
I was way more confident.

323
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,817
But did I dance all right?

324
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,275
I want you to be honest, now.

325
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,733
Yeah.

326
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,942
[YOSHIKAWA] Right, folks!
Maina's line's open! Hey, you!

327
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,858
I'll go ahead.
Is that cool with you?

328
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:25,442
Oh, sure!

329
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,525
[ERIPIYO]
What should I say?

330
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,942
Hey, Maina! You were
super cute today.

331
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,192
Aw, thank you!

332
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:32,233
[ERIPIYO]
Such pressure.

333
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,067
I wanna say something
extra special!

334
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,317
'Cause it's a special day!

335
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,567
So, uh, listen, ever since
I became your fan,

336
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,483
I've had so many neat firsts.

337
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,733
With Eripiyo, and my brother,
and even with Kumasa.

338
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,108
[ERIPIYO] But telling her
to keep doing her best

339
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:45,900
sounds weird.

340
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,483
Like, who do I think I am?

341
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,275
I'm having so much fun,

342
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,150
and I'm so grateful that
I was able to meet you.

343
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,442
[gasps]

344
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,150
[ERIPIYO] Something I can
only tell her today.

345
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,358
What can I tell her just
for this special day?

346
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,150
[YOSHIKAWA]
Anyone else for Maina?

347
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,150
I'm gonna cut off the line
if there's no one else!

348
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,817
[ERIPIYO]
Maina, right here!

349
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:09,150
Uh... Lovely weather we're
having, don't you think?

350
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,067
[MAINA]
Eripiyo.

351
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,650
I was really happy to see
you right there up front.

352
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,067
[gasps]

353
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,900
So, did you enjoy it?

354
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,942
Are you kidding? I loved it!

355
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,692
I had so much fun,
and I was so happy!

356
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:34,942
You worked so hard up there!
Your performance was the best!

357
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,608
That means so much.

358
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,483
And I really hope that someday

359
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,567
you'll come to the
Budokan with me!

360
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,067
[gasps]

361
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,275
[MAINA]
No. I don't just hope that!

362
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,525
It's gonna happen!

363
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,983
I'll do everything in my
power to make it there!

364
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,483
[ERIPIYO] What in the
world is this creature?

365
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,733
How can she be so cute?

366
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,942
Nothing in the world could
ever top her cuteness!

367
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,108
D-Did she level up?

368
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,150
Did this festival
multiply her cuteness?

369
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,317
Does this mean that when she
makes it to the Budokan,

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,650
or to something even bigger,

371
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,858
her cuteness will
become unstoppable?

372
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,400
[MAINA]
Eripiyo.

373
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,483
[gasps]

374
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,858
[MAINA] It's all because
of you, Eripiyo.

375
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:15,692
That I was able to do my best!

376
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,858
I owe it all to you!

377
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,942
I love you.

378
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,067
Huh?

379
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,233
[ERIPIYO]
The Budokan.

380
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,733
[MAINA]
Yes?

381
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,150
[ERIPIYO] If you were to make
to the Budokan, I could...

382
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,733
...die happy.

383
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,067
Huh?

384
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,233
If you made it to the Budokan,
I'd die... happy!

385
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,567
Huh?

386
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,067
[ERIPIYO gasps]

387
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,400
[KUMASA]
Well, we finally made it.

388
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:14,858
This is it.

389
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,192
[ALL]
The Budokan!

390
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,817
It's huge! Stretches as
far as the eye can see!

391
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,942
That part must be
the golden onion.

392
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,317
We were so excited
from the festival

393
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,942
that we went all
the way to Tokyo!

394
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,358
Yeah, I'm really glad we did.

395
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:29,817
So, Cham'll be on
that stage someday.

396
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,650
I feel it!

397
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,525
This is it? This is the Budokan?

398
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:37,733
It's, uh, not at all what
I pictured in my mind.

399
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,025
You sure this is it?

400
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:41,400
Yes! That's the Budokan!

401
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:47,525
But I thought that there was
an onion on top or something.

402
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,525
I mean, that looks
like onions to me!

403
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:50,900
Maybe they're diced onions!

404
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:52,525
Excellent point.

405
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:55,150
Someday, we'll be on that stage.

406
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,108
Yeah. I'll do my best.

407
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,358
[YUMERI]
Sorry, you guys.

408
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:01,692
Looks like this is the
wrong place, after all.

409
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,108
[OTHERS]
What?!
