00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,775
[MOTOI] Listen, guys. Sorane's
reputation's in jeopardy!

2
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,150
[KUMASA]
Jeez, again?

3
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:23,317
[ERIPIYO]
What's up?

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,983
Did a suspicious,
lurking shadow show up

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,733
in one of the pics on her blog?

6
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:27,983
[MOTOI]
No, not that.

7
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,150
Wait, what are you talking
about? I'm scared!

8
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,067
Ever since the whole
thing with Sorane,

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,900
I've just been totally paranoid.

10
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,483
Then on Maina's blog,
there's this!

11
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:38,608
"At the grocery store today,

12
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:40,817
fermented bean curd
was super cheap!"

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,483
Notice anything suspicious
in the background?

14
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,483
Are those a dude's clothes?
You see that?

15
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,858
Then there's the fact that
she's using a blue plate. Ah!

16
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:52,650
She's cooking at some
guy's house--I know it!

17
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,650
I've sunk to looking in
the mirrors to try and see

18
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:57,108
who took the pictures of her!

19
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:59,817
Even in her selfies,
I look for people's shadows!

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,275
And I'm terribly ashamed
to admit this, but...

21
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,692
...I zoom in on her eyes to see

22
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:06,192
if there's anyone
in the reflections!

23
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,108
[ERIPIYO]
I'm so neurotic. Ugh! It hurts!

24
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:14,775
I almost wish she'd stop
posting pictures altogether!

25
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,567
Not gonna lie,
I feel a lot better

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,567
about my own situation now.

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,608
[KUMASA] Anyway, what's
going on with Sorane?

28
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,858
Oh. I never said, did I?

29
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,025
So do you remember the
clothes I bought her?

30
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:30,400
Well, apparently, there's
a matching guy version.

31
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:33,775
People are assuming she and her
boyfriend bought them together.

32
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:34,858
[KUMASA]
Ohh.

33
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,567
I see.

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,608
[MOTOI] Man, you couldn't care
less about other people's faves!

35
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:42,400
Look, why don't you just buy
the matching outfit then?

36
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:43,983
Since you're the one who got it.

37
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,733
Oh! Yeah, great idea!

38
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,775
There's still time
before the show starts.

39
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,817
Right. Thanks for the tip!

40
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,900
[MOTOI] Looks like everyone
had the same idea.

41
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:43,858
[SORANE]
That's it--I'm done.

42
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,900
From now on, I'm posting
nothing but nudes.

43
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,567
[MAKI] Somehow, I don't think
that would solve anything.

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,233
But for real, why did you
search for yourself again?

45
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,483
[SORANE]
I didn't.

46
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,983
I was looking up how to
take care of pet moles.

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,400
[gasps]

48
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,983
Hey, Reo, check it out!

49
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,108
There's a new, free,
ten-pull-a-day gacha game

50
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:05,942
coming out today!

51
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,442
Morning, guys.

52
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,400
Good morning.

53
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,858
[REO]
Good morning.

54
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,067
Hi, Aya.

55
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,650
Good morning.

56
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,483
Good morning.

57
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,775
Uh.

58
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,067
Aya.

59
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,025
[AYA]
Ugh.

60
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,650
What?

61
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,400
If you don't like me, fine,
that's your prerogative.

62
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,275
But people are
always watching us.

63
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,567
So no matter how you feel,

64
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,775
you have to at least
act like we get along.

65
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,525
People are watching us?

66
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,567
A lot of fans on social
media seem to think

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,525
you said something bad about me.

68
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,817
[gasps]

69
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,567
Why is Sorane ranking
higher than me

70
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,650
when there's that rumor
about her and some guy?

71
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,942
It's so not fair.

72
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,650
[grunts]

73
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,192
[SORANE] I think I have
a pretty good idea

74
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,733
of why you don't like me.

75
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,817
And there's nothing I can do
to make you change your mind.

76
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,317
But let's try to do our best
at the show today, m'kay?

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,483
Huh?

78
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,650
[FANS cheering]

79
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,317
So winter's here!

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,567
When the weather
starts to get cold,

81
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,067
I want stew--something
to warm my bones!

82
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,442
[MATSUO]
Really?

83
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:17,108
Sorane! As usual, your emcee
style is pretty weird.

84
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,650
Hah. Well.

85
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,608
Aya and I made plans
to grab dinner together

86
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:21,983
and get some sundubu!

87
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,067
Huh?

88
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,233
[SORANE]
Right?

89
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,608
[gasps]

90
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,983
Yeah, and I'm super excited!

91
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,358
We're going tomorrow
after our voice lessons!

92
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,858
Aya, you promised me we would
have dinner together tomorrow!

93
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,900
Why don't you three
have dinner together?

94
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:36,942
That would be fun.

95
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:40,108
Good idea. Crab for me!

96
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,025
[MAKI]
Hey, I wanna come, too!

97
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,983
[YUMERI]
Yeah! So do I!

98
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,650
[REO] We should all go
together! You, too, Maina!

[MAINA]
Oh! Sure!

100
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,858
Oh, and I just remembered!

101
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:53,025
Aya gave me the cutest pair
of fuzzy socks the other day!

102
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,233
I'll upload them to my
blog sometime soon.

103
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,858
[AYA]
Sorane's such a good idol.

104
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,358
[MOTOI] It really is beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

105
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:04,817
Speaking of which,

106
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,483
do you two have any special
Christmas plans lined up?

107
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,567
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Huh?

108
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,483
What do you mean special
Christmas plans?

109
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,108
Why would you ask
an otaku that?

110
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,983
Oh, go easy on the guy.
I'm sure Motoi meant no harm.

111
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,317
I took off work for both
Christmas Eve and Christmas day,

112
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,108
just like I do every year.

113
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,608
That way I'm free to
make last-minute plans.

114
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,817
[MOTOI]
You're taking time off

115
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,067
even though you don't
have set plans yet?

116
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,275
As for me, I'm already
planning to spend Christmas

117
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,400
with the person I love most,

118
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,358
so I'm going to be busy,
without a doubt.

119
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:33,150
Hope you losers find
something to do!

We always spend
Christmas together!

Oh. I understand
what's happening now.

125
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,775
You're going to the
Christmas concert.

126
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,525
Yep, that is correct!

127
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,108
[KUMASA] It isn't nice of you to
scare us like that, you know.

128
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,983
Why would I ever make
plans to do anything

129
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,358
but go to the Christmas concert?

130
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:58,733
That's what I'll be
doing next year

131
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,317
and the one after
that, for sure!

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,858
You don't think you'll
have anything going on

133
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,650
in the next few years?

[ERIPIYO] I can't imagine my

[MOTOI gasps]

00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,775
I wonder if all
the Cham Jam girls

137
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:12,150
are gonna wear Santa outfits!

138
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,650
Of course they are! And
there'll be photo ops, too!

139
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,692
[MOTOI]
They're gonna be insanely cute!

140

[KUMASA] Yeah. Reo was
adorable last year!

santa outfit last year.

[MOTOI]
Wait, just Maina?

144
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,692
She was only wearing
a santa hat.

145
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:33,567
And the photo op
was sorta awkward.

146
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,483
I'm sure she just felt
embarrassed to.

147
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,858
She has a hard time
with that stuff.

148

Actually, do you
want my opinion?

It's nothing at all!
See you guys next week!

You were in the middle
of saying something!

154
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,317
[ERIPIYO] I know why she didn't
wear a Santa outfit last year.

155
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,775
She didn't have enough money!

156

So if I do my best and support
her even more this year,

157

she'll have all the
money that she needs!

a super cute Christmas costume!

00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,817
I mean, I don't know what
will actually happen,

160
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,608
but if the other stans
get word of this,

161
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,108
then they'll work hard, too,

162
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,858
and all the girls will end
up in incredible outfits!

163
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,442
Even though I would
be supporting her,

164
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,608
Maina wouldn't
stand out as much!

165
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:26,608
And so, it's a secret!

166
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:30,483
[FANS cheering]

167
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,442
So our Christmas concert
has finally been announced!

168
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,608
[MAKI]
Yeah!

169
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,567
[REO] You're all coming
to see us, right?

170
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,358
[FANS]
It's gonna be a sold-out house!

171
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,775
[REO]
Hello, there!

172
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:41,775
[FANS chattering]

173
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,108
[YUKA]
So you're a new fan right?

174
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:45,358
[FAN C]
Yeah.

175
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,192
[YUKA]
So here's the thing...

176
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,608
I'm stupid!

177
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,025
[FAN C]
Huh?

178
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,400
[YUKA] I'm terrible with
remembering people's faces.

179
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:53,858
But you know what?

180
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,900
If you keep coming to see me,
I'll remember you!

181
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,317
[FAN C]
Okay. I will!

182
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,233
[AYA]
Boy, oh, boy.

183
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,567
Maina, could you pull that off?

184
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,400
Uh! No way!

185
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:06,650
[AYA]
Didn't think so.

186
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:10,608
Maina. Yumeri. Time
to start. You ready?

187
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:11,858
--Okay.
--Yeah.

188
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,025
[FAN D]
It's Yumeri! Oh, god!

189
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,858
Maina, too!

190
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,108
[sighs]

191
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,150
[SORANE]
Aya, what are you doing?

192
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,400
[AYA]
Hm?

193
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:33,942
[SORANE]
Hm?

194
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,692
[AYA] I always wanted
to become an idol.

195
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:41,692
I've worked hard and
believed in myself.

196
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,483
And yet...

197
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,317
Sorane, you just decided
to join on a whim,

198
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,567
and somehow, managed to
become more popular than me.

199
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,775
And you're a natural
at dealing with fans.

200
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,108
And I... I don't know
how you do it.

201
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,233
The guys who come to see you
end up falling for you.

202
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,858
I guess I'm just
a little jealous.

203
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,900
Uh. I didn't try to
make them fall for me.

204
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,942
[grumbles]

205
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,358
That makes me feel worse!

206
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,858
I don't have any fans
who are in love with me!

207
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,442
Even with the rumors about you,

208
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,442
none of your fans would stray
from you and start liking me!

209
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,192
[gasps]

210
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,775
[SORANE]
Aya, this doesn't always

211
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,692
have to be some competition.

212
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:38,358
Here's what I do.

213
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,858
I hope you never stop liking me.

214
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,442
[gasps]

215
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,483
That's all there is to it.

216
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,733
[chuckles]

217
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,817
[AYA]
But I... I can't do that!

218
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,567
I'm not like you!
No wonder they go crazy.

219
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,733
[SORANE chuckles]

220
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,900
But we're at least
friends again, right?

221
00:10:55,983 --> 00:11:01,067
I mean, I guess it isn't like
we're fighting or anything!

222
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,567
[YUKA] Benjamin! Oscar!
You both made it!

223
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,692
[REO]
You're the sweetest!

224
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,900
[gasps]

225
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,942
This many tickets
on a regular day?

226
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,400
[REO]
Thank you so much!

227
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,858
[MAINA]
Why?

228
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,650
[ERIPIYO]
I'm sure she's like, "Why?"

229
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,983
I wanted to see you in
an adorable Santa outfit,

230
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,067
so I went all out!

231
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,150
But that might sound creepy.

232
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:30,650
I'm doing this because I want
you in my future, Maina!

233
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,525
[ERIPIYO] Next year,
and the one after that.

234
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,775
I wanna spend every
Christmas with you.

235
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:39,525
And I want you to have
nice things to wear.

236
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,775
Oh. Uh, you do?

237
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,608
[ERIPIYO]
I said that out loud!

238
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,608
[ERIPIYO] Even the top
of her head is cute!

239
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,817
[YOSHIKAWA] Thank you
so much. Your time's up!

240
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,775
See ya!

241
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,733
Oh, Eripiyo.

242
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,608
[MAINA]
Reo!

243
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:12,358
I'm so late! Sorry.

244
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:13,900
No.

245
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,317
[REO giggles]

246
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,942
[MAINA]
Wow, so many options.

247
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,650
[REO]
Right? Isn't it exciting?

248
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,817
Uh.

249
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,150
[MAINA]
Umm.

250
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,400
[REO] You're wearing one
this year, right?

251
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,775
Huh?

252
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,733
[REO]
A Santa costume.

253
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:41,483
Even though you were too
embarrassed to last year?

254
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,650
[MAINA]
Yeah.

255
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,775
I'm still embarrassed,
to be honest.

256
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,858
But I do want the fans
to see me wearing it.

257
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,567
[REO]
Isn't it nice?

258
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,233
There're so many other
things those people

259
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:53,900
could be doing Christmas day,

260
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,442
but they all choose
to come spend it

261
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,567
with us instead, you know?

262
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:01,983
I love that. Like, a lot.

263
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,483
[ERIPIYO]
Hmm...

264
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,192
That'd look so good on her.

265
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:20,858
So would that. And that one!

266
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:24,442
[grunting]

267
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:27,567
Right! Mental training complete!

268
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,775
Now I won't get a nosebleed
seeing Santa Maina,

269
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:31,733
even in real life!

270
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,233
[sighs]

271
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,317
[ERIPIYO]
Hm?

272
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,817
[GIRL A]
Let's buy matching rings!

273
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,650
[MAN A]
Yeah, I like that!

274
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,483
[GIRL B] Or we could
get the same rings,

275
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,275
but with each of
our birthstones.

276
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,567
Jealous.

277
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,317
What are you even
talking about?

278
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,108
We're gonna be spending
our Christmases

279
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,817
with the ones we love, too,
just like those idiots!

280
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,192
[ERIPIYO]
Yeah!

281
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,942
The fact that we're spending
Christmas day with them

282
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,650
kinda feels like
we're dating them!

283
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,567
Uh. Yeah, you're right!

284
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,900
Today is our big
Christmas date, guys!

285
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,150
[ERIPIYO, MOTOI]
You said it!

286
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,567
[thunder rumbles]

287
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,942
[ERIPIYO]
Hm?

288
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,025
It's really dark.

289
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,733
[KUMASA] What, you mean the
darkness of your heart?

290
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:22,942
No!

291
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,983
Over that way. Look.
Giant storm clouds.

292
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,525
[KUMASA] I'm sure
everything'll be all right.

293
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,775
I mean, the concert space
is underground.

294
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,358
So I don't think we
really have anything

295
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,317
to worry about, do we?

296
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,067
[MOTOI]
Nah, we're good.

297
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,733
Better hurry to get to
our Christmas dates!

298
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,567
Yeah, we wouldn't wanna
keep the ones we love

299
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,108
waiting on Christmas!

300
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,483
[ERIPIYO]
That's the truth! Woohoo!

301
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,067
[thunder rumbles]

302
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:06,942
It's our Christmas concert!
So, welcome!

303
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:10,108
Yeah! Your Christmas would be
boring without us, wouldn't it?

304
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,692
Jeez! Have some tact!

305
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,317
Yeah, don't say
things like that!

306
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,608
[YUKA chuckles]

307
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,150
Ma...

308
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:24,108
[ERIPIYO]
Ma... i...

309
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,650
...na...

310
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,108
[ERIPIYO yells]

311
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,400
Maina's the most adorable
little Santa Claus ever!

312
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,858
[KUMASA, MOTOI]
Congratulations.

313
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,192
Oh, Santa Maina!

314
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,233
Your being born is the
best Christmas present

315
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:44,442
a girl like me
could ever ask for!

316
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,317
I love you today

Huh?

[FANS yell]

00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,775
A blackout?

322
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,525
It's so dark now!

323
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:01,067
Did lightning strike
the building? Uh!

324
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,317
Oh, jeez.

325
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,983
No, no, no! I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared!

00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,733
[ERIPIYO]
Maina! Don't move!

327
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:08,608
Huh?

328
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,442
It's dangerous to move around!

329
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:13,317
Everyone! Staff included!

330
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,108
Whoa, Eripiyo. Do you have
night vision, like a cat?

331
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,525
What? No. I can sense
where bodies are.

332
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,483
What the--?

333
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,483
Well, that's creepy.

334
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,733
I happen to have
a light source.

335
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,400
[gasps]

336
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,942
I knew I'd get a
Santa Maina photo,

337
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,775
so I dressed for the occasion.

338
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,192
Because I totally had faith

339
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,067
that you would be wearing
a Santa outfit this year!

340
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,692
[ERIPIYO]
Okay! Remain calm!

341
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:50,317
Right. Now, fans,
light up those King Blades!

342
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,442
[KUMASA]
Oh!

343
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,067
Yeah, good idea!

344
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,108
[MATSUO]
You heard her, guys!

345
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:55,608
[FAN A]

Be careful.

[KUMASA]
Hey, Reo. Are you doing okay?

348
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,108
[REO]
I am. Thank you!

349
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:21,067
[SORANE]
Thanks for the light.

350
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,358
Be sure to watch
your step, guys!

351
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,400
[FANS]
You, too!

352
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,650
Yume. Watch out for
that cord there.

353
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,483
Yeah. My eyes are getting
used to the dark now.

354
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,608
Man. Not me. I'm still scared!

[FAN B]
You've got this, Aya!

356
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,150
[FUMI]
Are you scared, Yuka?

357
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:38,358
Oh, nah. I'm just making
this weird face for funsies.

358
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,483
[FUMI]
Oh. Cool.

359
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,692
[ERIPIYO] We're almost to the
exit. Just a bit farther!

360
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,442
[GIRLS]
Okay!

00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,400
[gasps]

362
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,983
[ERIPIYO]
This is amazing.

363
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,733
I feel like a hero.

364
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:59,858
Like I'm actually
helping Maina to safety!

365
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,108
I'm doing this because I want
you in my future, Maina!

366
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,567
[MAINA]
I know this much:

367
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,650
Even if the whole world somehow
went pitch black in the future,

368
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:17,817
as long as I have Eripiyo's
light to guide me,

369
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,358
I can keep moving forward.

370
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,067
[MAINA]
And as long as I live,

371
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,900
I will never forget
this image of her.

372
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:35,608
[MISAKI] All right, folks,
we'll begin the photo ops now!

373
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,858
They're so pretty they
might not need our light.

374
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:45,108
You can feel the
holiday spirit.

375
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,775
You totally saved
Christmas today, Eripiyo.

376
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:51,650
I have a feeling I might've been
a reindeer in a previous life.

377
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,983
[MISAKI]
Maina's line is starting now!

378
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,650
[ERIPIYO]
Great job today, Maina!

379
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,233
I'm sorry if today was hard.

380
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,733
Oh, not at all.

381
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,317
I think today was
probably harder

382
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,025
for you than anyone, Eripiyo.

383
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,858
What? No, not a chance!

384
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:08,692
I didn't think it was rough--
not even for a single second.

385
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:12,400
In fact, this is the most
satisfied I've felt in years!

386
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,358
[YOSHIKAWA] All right.
Time for the photo op.

387
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:17,192
Oh. Yes, sir.

388
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:30,817
[ERIPIYO gasps]

389
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,233
[ERIPIYO] Whoa! Maina's way
closer to me than usual!

390
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:42,775
[ERIPIYO] Wait, could this
be a Christmas miracle?

391
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:43,608
[YOSHIKAWA]
Here we go!

392
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:46,525
Ready. Say "cheese"!

393
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,733
[REO] Thanks, everyone.
We're so grateful for you!

[applause]

395
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,275
This has certainly been one of
the more eventful Christmases

00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:02,608
I've had in a while.

But I'm so happy...
'cause we spent it together!

[MAINA gasps]

00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,150
And Maina.

400
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:19,733
She actually wore a cute
Santa outfit this year!

401
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,650
She's cute, huh?

402
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:26,608
Uh. This year--

403
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,400
[MAINA gasps]

404
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:32,150
No. Next year, and the next,
and even the one after that...

405
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:35,233
I hope we can celebrate
Christmas again.

406
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,317
And I hope that when we
celebrate it in the future,

407
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
that we all do so together.

408
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:46,525
[MAINA]
And most of all, in my future,

409
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,692
I hope Eripiyo will
always be there.

[ERIPIYO humming]

411
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:59,275
I don't think I've ever seen
you this happy, Eripiyo.

00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,317
Santa and her reindeer--
name a more iconic duo.

413
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,775
I'm gonna treasure this forever!

[KUMASA, MOTOI grunt]

415
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:14,025
[BOTH] This is more
unfortunate than usual.

416
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,900
I know you're jealous.
Don't hide it.

417
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,025
[ERIPIYO laughs]

418
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,108
Uh.

420
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,942
Wow.

421
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:02,317
[MAINA]
If there ever comes a day

422
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,442
where Eripiyo's world goes dark,

423
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:07,108
I hope that I can
be there for her.

424
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,942
More than anything,

425
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,900
I wanna be the one
who lights her way.

426
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:18,317
I can't believe it.

427
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,442
I saw this picture and
didn't feel the need

428
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,858
to look for clues of some guy.

429
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,650
You're so cute, Maina!

430
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,775
The cutest ever!

431
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,150
[ERIPIYO]
Now that Christmas is over,

432
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,692
it's time for the
New Year's concert!

433
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,192
I can't believe my luck
that I get to spend

434
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,733
the end of the year
with Maina, too!

435
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:15,358
Ah! Do your best, Maina!
I believe in you!

436
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,900
I'll be cheering
you on, as always!

437
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,358
Jeez, my cup runneth over!
I have so much to say!

438
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,358
[YOSHIKAWA] Thank you very
much! Your time's up!
