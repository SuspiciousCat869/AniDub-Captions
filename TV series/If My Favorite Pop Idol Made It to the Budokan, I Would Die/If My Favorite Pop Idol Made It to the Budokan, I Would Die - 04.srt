[inaudible]

2
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,358
[KUMASA]
Reo.

3
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,358
[KUMASA] Next time, I-I'm
gonna do everything I can

4
00:00:56,442 --> 00:01:00,192
to get you to number one, so...

5
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,150
[inaudible]

6
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,567
[gasps]

7
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:44,025
Cham's schedule of events
has officially been updated!

8
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:46,317
Hey, there's a sports festival!

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Heck yeah! I go crazy
for that type of stuff.

10
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,817
[KUMASA chuckles]

11
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,817
Scroll down for
the important part.

12
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,358
There's more?

13
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,150
Oh, it's Reo's
birthday. Awesome.

14
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,400
Can't you feign interest
just this once?

15
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,942
That's important to me,
but look below it.

16
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,150
Ugh, fine.

17
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,108
[gasps]

18
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,442
No way!

19
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:12,442
I've been waiting for this day
for what seems like an eternity,

20
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,025
and now it's finally here.

21
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,400
Oh, cool. What happens
when Maina loses?

22
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,692
Why're you giving up
before it's even started?

23
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,692
[ERIPIYO groans]

24
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,358
So what's the breakdown with
the handshake lines these days?

25
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,483
Reo has a clear lead, as usual.

26
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,317
Of course.

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Well, Sorane's in second,

28
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,567
and Maki's in third,
right behind her.

29
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,900
Yuka's neck and neck in fourth.
And as for fifth...

30
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:38,775
Probs Yumeri, and then
Aya, then Maina, last.

31
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:41,775
So the voting goes till
the end of November, huh?

32
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,650
Even people who don't
usually buy duplicates

33
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,733
will go all out for this one.

34
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,275
Then this means war.

35
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,983
The 30,000 other Maina fans
will need to step up their game.

36
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,858
Whoa. You think she
has that many fans?

37
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,900
Did you hit your head when
I wasn't lookin' or something?

38
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:57,275
Maybe they're hermits
and never go outside!

39
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,400
No. I've got your number.
I know all about it.

40
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,983
You frequent Maina's blog,

41
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,025
but you post under different
aliases, so people will think--

42
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,192
Don't you ever speak
of this again.

43
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,525
If you do, you'll pay.

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,775
I hate this!

45
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:16,192
C'mon, you have nothing
to worry about.

46
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,775
I mean, it's not like
they're gonna kick us out

47
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,817
if we don't get first place.

48
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,858
But still.

49
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:21,983
If you work really hard,

50
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,858
you might even get
to be in the center!

51
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,358
I'm gonna work so
hard I might die!

52
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,733
I'm actually content
right where I am.

53
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:31,358
Being in the top three
is way too much work.

54
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:32,983
Yeah, well, you have
room to say that

55
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,900
because you're one of
the more popular members!

56
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,650
[YUMERI]
I don't want this.

57
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,025
If Yuka works hard and advances,

58
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:44,233
there's a chance Maki could get
knocked out of the top three!

59
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,317
Or even worse than that...

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,233
What if my own fans
were to band together

61
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,275
and pull off some sort
of miracle for me?

62
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,067
That would mean--!

63
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,983
[gasps]

64
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,900
Let's both be in it next year.

65
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:08,358
[YUMERI]
I made a promise to Maki.

66
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,358
What would I do?

67
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,567
[MAKI]
You're gonna be fine, Yume.

68
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm sure of it. Your fans can
all see how hard you work.

69
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,358
Thanks, Maki.

70
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,483
[YUMERI]
That's not what I'm scared of.

71
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,233
[sighs]

72
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:27,025
[REO] I hate it when they make
us compete with each other.

73
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:29,525
I don't think our rank
should even matter.

74
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,942
Uh, yeah.

75
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,525
Don't worry.

76
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:34,733
[gasps]

77
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,858
You have lots of fans.

78
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,775
[inaudbile]

79
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,067
'Kay?

80
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,817
[door opens]

81
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,150
What's with you guys?

82
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,608
You look like someone
broke the sheath

83
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,775
on the Momotaro statue again.

84
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:57,983
We've got bigger fish to fry
than some dumb ranking.

85
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,025
[ALL]
Ugh, that's right.

86
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,400
Huh.

87
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,317
I guess we're renting out
a grade school gym

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,775
for the festival this year?

89
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,233
Yeah, we owe that to
a certain someone.

90
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,900
She misjudged the space last
year and broke both legs.

91
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,442
[REO chuckles nervously]

92
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:13,233
[MAINA sighs]

93
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,317
[BOTH]
Huh?

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,150
[SORANE]
Something wrong, Maina?

95
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,108
I wish I was like Sorane.

96
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,233
I'm so bad at sports. For real.

97
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:23,275
Sorane was in the tennis club
in high school, right?

98
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,942
Tennis? Wow.

99
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,483
[GIRLS] We don't stand a
chance against you, ace.

100
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,275
Yeah, I was in tennis
club--stop being weird.

101
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,650
[MAINA chuckles]

102
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:39,025
[REO] It's Cham Jam's...
Big Autumn Sports Festival!

103
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,608
[OTAKU cheering]

104
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,150
[REO] Sorane, Aya, and Yumeri
are on the red team.

105
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:48,692
Maki, Yuka, and Maina
make up the white team.

106
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,400
And as for me, Reo,
I'm your ref!

107
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,900
I hope to hear you cheering
all the girls on!

108
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,192
You're the best, ref!

109
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,150
Don't let the ref
break her legs!

110
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:58,942
[REO chuckles]

111
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,233
Ah, my legs will be fine!

112
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:02,150
She's not competing?

113
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,358
Can you blame her?

114
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,608
Poor girl broke both
of her legs last year!

115
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,942
That was traumatic.

116
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,817
Wait. They made a print
of her on crutches?

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,733
They did. And it was
a secret draw, too.

118
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,567
I'm sure Motoi's
at home, fuming.

119
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,817
What a crappy time to
come down with a cold!

120
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,692
A fan must take care of himself
or face the consequences.

121
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,983
[sneezes]

122

[OTAKU chattering]

123
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:29,858
[REO] Our first event
is the team relay!

124
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,525
And they're off!

125
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,525
Wait. Has Aya always
been this fast?

126
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:43,192
Wow, Aya, I can't believe you're
so fleet of foot! Amazing!

127
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,900
You're so cute and
sporty! I love you!

128
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,858
I have to vote for you now!

129
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,983
I'm changing my fave!

130

00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,692

[YUKA gasps]

134
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,817
Come on, you can do
this, Aya! Get up!

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,483
[AYA groans]

136
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,942
[AYA]
Is she campaigning?

137
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,525
She helped Aya up, even though
she's on the other team!

138
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,108
Yuka's the sweetest!

139
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,692
Welp, gotta vote for her!

Uh! I know exactly what you're
up to, and I won't fall for it!

142
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,733
What?

143
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,067
[AYA groans]

144
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,983
[NAGAI] But Yumeri's such a
good dancer. I don't get it.

145
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,192
[ASAMI]
Dancing isn't running, buddy.

146
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,192
What do they think this
is, a Sunday stroll?

147
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,817
Go, Maina! You've got this!

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,483
Eripiyo's here!
Can't let her down!

149
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:51,817
Yumeri!

150
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,650
Yumeri!

151
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,650
[YUMERI] I have to keep going.
I've got to impress my fans!

152
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,317
[YUMERI]
Sorane's really fast.

153
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,817
She's our anchor!

154
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,400
If I can just get
the baton to her,

155
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,150
Maki has no chance of winning!

156
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:10,775
Uh?

157
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,900
Here, Maki!

158
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,150
You killed it out there, Maina.

159
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,442
[REO]
Wow, just look at Sorane go!

160
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,983
