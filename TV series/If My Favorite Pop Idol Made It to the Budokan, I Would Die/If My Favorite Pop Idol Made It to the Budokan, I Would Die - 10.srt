1
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:20,067
Happy birthday, Maina!

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,942
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:25,150
Your birth was a miracle!
Let's all celebrate!

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:29,150
And let's thank your parents
for going on that date!

5
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,067
Thank you!

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,108
[BOTH]
Yeah!

7
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,817
This is lame.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,733
Why am I here? And on
such an important day?

9
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:40,150
Could you just keep the
momentum going for me?

10
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:42,108
And I'm dining alone with
you for some reason.

11
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,275
Hey, don't take your
rage out on me!

12
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,483
This thing was your idea
in the first place.

13
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,942
You were the one who asked me.

14
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,483
"Let's have a birthday
dinner for Maina

15
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,275
since Cham doesn't have
venue right now."

16
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,358
[ERIPIYO] But now that
we're actually here,

17
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:57,358
all I feel is loneliness,
isolation, and pain!

18
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:00,358
Well, maybe we should've
invited Motoi and Rena.

19
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:03,275
No! Rena must study for exams.

20
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,233
And Motoi's been broke
ever since his wallet

21
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:06,608
got stolen at the shrine.

22
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,442
I didn't even know
that had happened!

23
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:09,692
And by the way,

24
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,900
I'm hurt that you didn't
invite me to the shrine.

25
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:14,108
Look, buddy, no true idol
fan would feel that way

26
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:16,858
if they'd gotten to spend
New Year's with their fave.

27
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:20,567
It's just that... I want
to tell Maina in person.

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,442
Thank you for being born.

29
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,400
And most of all, thank you
for choosing to be an idol

30
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,275
and sharing your gifts
with the world.

31
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:30,275
Hello. Pardon, are you
two ready to order?

32
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,483
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Huh?

33
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,775
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
She's actually here?!

34
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:11,317
Maina just witnessed me
being an embarrassing loser!

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,108
[ERIPIYO crying]

36
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,858
Are you kidding me?

37
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,358
[ERIPIYO]
I'm not kidding!

38
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,108
She saw me in this den of sin--
surrounded by other girls.

39
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:21,025
I wanted to go to karaoke, but
no, you had to have sweets, huh?

40
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,942
Hey, Maina! What a coincidence!

41
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,942
What are the odds Eripiyo would
show up here on the day

42
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,692
you started working part-time!

43
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,358
Yup. Total coincidence.

44
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,775
It's not like she's
been here before,

45
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,150
or is eyeing other girls,

46
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,525
or switching her fave to me,
or anything like that!

47
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,442
No way, not a chance!
It's crazy, right?

48
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,233
[MAINA] I got to see
Eripiyo on my birthday

49
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,025
by some strange twist of fate.

50
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,192
It's amazing!

51
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,025
[AYA]
What?

52
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:43,358
Even if we were performing,

53
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,358
who knows if our concert
would fall on my birthday?

54
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,775
But I got to see
her today anyway!

55
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,525
And to top it all off,
she was celebrating it.

56
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm not quite sure
how to respond.

57
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,108
[grunts]

58
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,900
[AYA] Just hurry up and go
talk to them, you big dummy!

59
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:01,150
Um. I don't mean to rush you,
but are you ready to order?

60
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,067
[ERIPIYO]
I can't!

61
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,317
I can't talk to Maina

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,525
without paying her for
the honor beforehand!

63
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,025
It's a café, genius!

64
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:09,067
You'll be paying,
just after the fact.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,733
Look here, 500 yen even
gets ya a photo op.

66
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,025
[ERIPIYO] But isn't that making
her work off the clock?

67
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,900
Uh, I'm not an idol
right now, so no.

68
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,025
[KUMASA] Yeah, she's literally
on the clock as a maid!

69
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,983
[ERIPIYO] I've only ever
supported Maina as an idol,

70
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,858
so I have no idea how to handle
her working as a maid!

71
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:25,942
The gall of asking for
a 500 yen photo op?

72
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,942
Like I could ever do
something like that!

73
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,817
But that's literally the way
maid cafés work, so...

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,192
Uh, maybe I should come back?

75
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,942
Ugh, you're such a pain!

76
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,983
Maina! Come here!

77
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,233
[AYA]
Here.

78
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,608
Now, was that so hard?

79
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,067
I'll add the photo op
fee to your tab.

80
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,608
Blesséd be. I shall pass this
down as a family heirloom.

81
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,483
Hey, I thought a photo op
meant we would be in it.

82
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,150
You're a goddess when you're
a maid, Aya, you know that?

83
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,858
I'm a goddess no matter
what I'm doing;

84
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,483
you just never got in
my handshake line,

85
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,150
so you don't know.

86
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,525
[sighs]

87
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:01,608
What's wrong?

88
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,275
It's just, you and
Eripiyo seem like

89
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:04,733
you're friends or something.

90
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:05,942
She's my fan.

91
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,817
Well, she's kind of
a regular around here.

92
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,358
Like, I see her all the time,
so it makes sense.

93
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,900
But I see her all
the time, too,

94
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:15,067
so I don't see
how it's different.

95
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,608
Hold on. Earlier you said
it was her first time here.

96
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:19,942
--[door opens]
--[AYA laughs]

97
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,775
Welcome home, master!
What can I get you today?!

98
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,067
[ERIPIYO sighs]

99
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,358
I couldn't eat or drink
anything in there.

100
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,317
Not when Maina might see me.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,692
What a waste.

102
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,817
You had a chance to talk
to her without a monitor.

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,067
[ERIPIYO sneezes]

104
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,608
Whoa, there!
Did you catch a cold?

105
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,775
[gasps]

106
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:38,067
If Maina got me sick somehow...

107
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,150
I'll never get well!

108
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,442
I wanna keep her pathogenic
microbes around forever!

109
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:46,150
But Maina didn't really
seem like she had a cold.

110
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:49,192
Those microbes must belong to
some crusty old guy at the café.

111
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,942
Don't crush my dreams!
Why you gotta be like that?

112
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,275
And don't think I didn't notice

113
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,442
your social distancing
techniques!

114
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey! What are you,
a sociopath?

115
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,317
[phone buzzing]

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,150
[ERIPIYO]
Wha--? Wait, for real?

117
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:05,442
A concert? And it's only
three days from now?

118
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,942
Oh, come on, Cham management!
Last minute--

119
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:09,650
[ERIPIYO coughs]

120
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,942
[SAKIKO]
Will you calm down?

121
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,858
If you keep flipping out,
you'll never get well.

122
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,400
Mom, do you think I'll be
better three days from now?

123
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,483
Can I go out then?

124
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,067
You kidding? There's no way!

125
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,692
Your immune system
is compromised.

126
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:22,108
You could get the flu, or
something even worse than that!

127
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:23,108
[grumbles]

128
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:24,233
For real.

129
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,608
Fine.

130
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:29,317
Well, I've gotta go to work.
You stay in that bed!

131
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,983
[coughs, groans]

132
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,067
[ERIPIYO] This sucks
so hard. I'm gonna die.

133
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,983
Someone come take care of me.

134
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,483
I could call a friend.

135
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,525
But then, no, they all
have jobs to go to.

136
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,692
Those heartless bastards.

137
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,650
[ERIPIYO]
Maina.

138
00:06:55,608 --> 00:07:01,192
We may not be close...
but I got to see her that day.

139
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:04,608
Thank you for that, Maina.

140
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:10,858
Hey, you guys!
It's been a while!

141
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:14,358
Sorry for making you wait for
our first concert of the year!

142
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:16,983
That's okay!

143
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,942
We have some more bad news.

144
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:21,650
Maki and Yuka won't be here
today 'cause they caught a cold.

145
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,442
[FANS]
What?

146
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,317
[REO] But the rest of us
will work even harder

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,442
to make up for it!

148
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,817
And I hope you enjoy seeing us

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,192
in a slightly different
formation this time!

150
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,192
[FANS]
Yeah!

151
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,817
[REO] All right! Are you ready
for our first song?

152
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,983
[FANS cheering]

153
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,525
Feels like it's been so long.

154
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:39,150
Yeah.

155
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,233
This feels great!

156
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,358
Do you think so?

157
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,233
Yumeri's in the

00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,275
I'm sure you guys know this,

316
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,067
but we're not allowed
to give our fans

317
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,358
anything but the chocolates.

[MAINA groans]

320
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,858
And most of all, thank you
for choosing to be an idol

321
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:06,317
and sharing your gifts
with the world.

322
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,817
[MAINA]
That's right.

323
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,483
Eripiyo is only supporting
me as an idol.

324
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,858
Maybe she doesn't
wanna be my friend.

325
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:15,483
Hey, Maina, how many
do you want?

326
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,067
Uh, I think just two.

327
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,150
You're getting way
more than two. Here!

328
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,483
This many?

329
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,025
[MAINA]
But I don't have that many fans.

330
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:28,983
Isn't this fun? I mean,
I never give guys chocolate.

331
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,025
Really?

332
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,233
You seem like the kind of girl

333
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,442
who has tons of guy
friends to give stuff.

334
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,358
That whole thing's an act.

335
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:38,067
'Cause, after all, I'm an idol.

336
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,067
Thank you so much for
being with us today!

337
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,483
So, as you know,

338
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,567
we'll be handing out
chocolates after this.

339
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,400
But we all talked
amongst ourselves

340
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:51,858
and decided to make this
a three-shot photo op!

341
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:55,067
So then, we can get chocolates
from two girls now?

342
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,983
I'm sure you guys are excited
about getting more chocolate!

343
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,983
I would be. Right?

344
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,150
Uh, yeah. We ended up with
way too much on our hands!

345
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,108
We have to get rid
of it somehow!

346
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,317
So, would you please...

347
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,692
[GIRLS]
...help us out here?

348
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,900
[YUKA] Listen, if you don't
want it, that's fine.

349
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,358
I'll eat all the surplus myself!

350
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,817
[MOTOI]
A three-shot photo op!

351
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Aw, man. Great idea!

352
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:20,817
No way. This could get hairy.

353
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,317
'Cause your fave will find out
who your second fave is.

354
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,858
Huh? I hadn't
thought about that!

355
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,442
[KUMASA] I'd like to
choose Reo and Sorane.

356
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:29,733
[MOTOI]
Wait, have you had your eye

357
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,483
on Sorane this whole time?

358
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,858
You can't do this!

359
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,192
I can't handle us both having
the same fave, man!

360
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,942
She's not mine. She's my
friend's. Don't worry!

361
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,733
Oh, I see.

362
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,108
In that case, I choose
Sorane and Reo.

[RENA]
Stare...

366
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,650
[MOTOI]
I mean, Maina.

00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,192
Oh, by the way, Eripiyo.

368
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,067
I heard the coolest
thing the other day.

369
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,983
Apparently, at the last concert,
Maina was on the--

Rena, look! I found
this in my pocket. Ha.

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,067
Want it? It's all warm and soft!

374

On Twitter earlier today,
I read Maina was on the--

Hey, Motoi.

377
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,692
I found this in my other pocket
and wanted you to have it.

378
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:10,775
Uh, no thanks, dude.

379
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:11,733
It's a good luck..

[MISAKI]
Next in line, please!

381
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,108
Okay.

382
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:20,567
Look, it doesn't
matter who you pick,

383
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,775
but it has to be two
different members.

384
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,692
We have extras.

385
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,567
So I'll just go ahead
and put Aya.

[YUMERI, REO] Thank you
for always supporting us!

387
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,025
So... this is kind
of embarrassing, huh?

388
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:37,108
Reo's literally smiling
at everyone, isn't she?

389
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:39,067
Heh. That's my Reo.

390
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,775
The fact that she treats
everyone equally

391
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,692
is her best quality.

392

[YOSHIKAWA]
All right. Uh.

393
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:47,192
We have one for Reo and Sorane!

[BOTH]
Be my Valentine, Kumasa!

395
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,400
Thanks, you two. I'm blushing.

396
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,775
Hey, Reo. You killed
on that show!

397
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,858
You saw it? I'm so embarrassed!

398
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,900
Ever since I heard about
that youth acting troupe

399
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,900
you used to be a part of,

400
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:05,275
it's been my dream to see
you up onscreen someday.

401
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:07,733
The truth is, every dream
I have involving you,

402
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:10,608
well, it seems to
come true somehow.

403
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:13,108
You were in the festival
I wanted to see you in.

404
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,733
You became the center, too.

405
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:19,067
And then, you were number one
in the popularity ranking.

406
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,233
And you helped. You were
involved in all of that, Kumasa.

407
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:26,067
Can you tell me what
your next dream is?

408
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,025
My next dream is for you
to go to the Budokan.

409
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,608
Then let's go together.

410
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:40,150
[REO giggles]

411
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:43,067
Wow, man! That was awesome!

412
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,150
I mean, I have never seen that
look on Reo's face before!

413
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:53,067
Next in line! You picked
Maina and Sorane.

414
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,692
[MOTOI] I've never taken
a photo with two of you.

415
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,233
Where should I stand?

416
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,025
Most people stand
in the middle.

417
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,608
That's right.

418
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,108
Oh, uh, thank you.

419
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,275
I've only ever
supported you, Sorane,

420
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,983
so this is all new to me.

421
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,900
There's still so
much I don't know.

422
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,150
[SORANE]
That's okay.

423
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,317
Cham Jam is just
starting to catch on,

424
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,275
so there are going
to be lots of firsts.

425
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,025
For me as much as anyone.

426
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,608
But if you're there with me,

427
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,983
even if I'm trying something
brand new, I'll be confident.

428
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:22,983
[MOTOI]
Mhm.

429
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,275
And I'll be there
supporting you!

430
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:26,983
You're the only one
for me, Sorane.

431
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,108
Well, thank you.

432
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:30,983
[MAINA]
You're amazing, Sorane.

433
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,108
I'd never be able to have

434
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,317
a conversation like
that with Eripiyo.

435
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,567
I'm just too shy to pull it off.

436
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,858
But I want to. I really want to!

437
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:41,358
[FUMI]
Yay!

438
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:42,900
[MATSUO laughs]

439
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,942
[FUJIKAWA laughs]

440
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,025
[ERIPIYO] No one's taking
photos with Maina.

441
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,900
Why isn't she anyone's
second fave?

442
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,233
Do these jerks have eyes?

443
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,150
[SHIMOTANI]
We actually want this excuse...

444
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,233
[NAKAYAMA] ...to change
our fave over to Maina.

445
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,025
[TAMURA] Well, I'm scared
of Eripiyo finding out

446
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:01,150
that Maina's my second fave.

447
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,692
Eripiyo.

448
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,817
I've, uh, never even done
a photo op before.

449
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,942
[ERIPIYO]
Rena is so nervous about this.

450
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,150
But I can help her out!

451
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,817
What the--?

452
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Where's my whiteboard!

453
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,400
Where did I leave it?
The bathroom?

454
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,150
Eripiyo?

455
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,317
[YOSHIKAWA]
All right. Thank you.

456
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,275
Maina, Sorane!

457
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,525
[SORANE]
Coming!

458
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,108
Eripiyo.

459
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,692
I'm really nervous, so would you
mind watching from right there?

460
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,192
[ERIPIYO]
What?

461
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,983
But I have to go look in the
restroom for my whiteboard!

462
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,692
That was super awesome!

463
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm rooting for you,
too, Eripiyo!

464
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,525
[YOSHIKAWA]
All right. Thank you.

465
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,733
[MAINA]
It's Eripiyo's turn now.

466
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,067
Maina and Aya!

467
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,317
Whoa. Wait, why me? Scary!

468
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,733
[MAINA] That means her
second fave is... Aya?

469
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,317
[ERIPIYO] What do I do
without my board?

470
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,442
Um, Eripiyo--

00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,108
Why'd you pick me, though?

472
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:02,858
[ERIPIYO]
I didn't. Not at all.

473
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:05,650
I just blanked and
the lady picked for me.

474
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:09,400
But I can't even say that
because I lost my damn board.

475
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,025
[AYA]
The heck is this?

476
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,567
[MAINA] Is it because
Aya is her friend?

477
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,067
No. It doesn't matter.

478
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,025
I'm the idol Eripiyo supports.

479
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,400
So I'm going to show her
who I really am

480
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,233
and speak from my heart!

481
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:31,317
[MAINA]
Happy Valentine's Day, Eripiyo!

482
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,650
My first fan!

483
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,150
Everything you've done
for me has been a first!

484
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,358
And I wanna show you how
much it all means to me!

485
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:39,733
I cherish all the
memories we've made!

486
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:43,400
I hope that we can experience
so much more together!

487
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:44,775
[ERIPIYO]
Maina.

488
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:46,483
[MAINA] I know you were sick
and couldn't be there

489
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,983
when I was in the front row
at last month's concert.

490
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,108
But I promise to share so
many other firsts with you!

491
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,358
[ERIPIYO]
Hold the damn phone!

492
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:56,192
Front row? I didn't
know about--!

493
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,858
[gasps]

494
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,442
[MAINA]
Eripiyo?

495
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,983
Eripiyo, no!

496
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:07,275
[sirens wailing]

497
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,567
Ah. Ah!

498
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,442
[sighs]

499
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,233
It's finally better.

500
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:16,567
Now I'll be fine no matter
what happens to Maina.

501
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,608
Hmm.

502
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:18,817
"The groups that'll
be performing

503
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,317
at Setouchi Idol Fes
have been decided."

504
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,775
Huh. So Cham's performing, too?

505
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,192
Huh?

506
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:27,483
Wait a second! Why did I find
out in this site first?

507
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:29,775
Why can't management
do it's freaking job?!

508
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:31,983
[ERIPIYO yells]

509
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,983
[MATSUO] This year's Valentine's
event was a three-shot photo op!

510
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:11,858
What? But I don't have
a second fave!

511
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,692
Maki for life; no substitutes!

512
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,650
Oh, by the way, I heard
Maki's gonna be on TV!

513
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:18,025
I'll watch it no matter what!
I'll record it for sure!

514
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,733
Then I'll watch it
a million more times!

515
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:21,442
[YOSHIKAWA]
Thank you! Your time is up!
