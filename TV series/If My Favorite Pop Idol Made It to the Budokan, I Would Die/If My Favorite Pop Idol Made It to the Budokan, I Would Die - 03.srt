Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:35,108
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

4
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:54,400
Maina!

00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:55,942
[sighs]

6
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,525
[REO] All right, then!
Time for the Q&A!

7
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,358
You ready?

8
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:01,733
[CROWD]
Yeah!

9
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,442
Great! Here's our
first question.

10
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,900
Mocchi Heart, from Kita,
wants to know this:

11
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,275
Back in high school did
you belong to any clubs?

12
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:09,650
If so, which ones?

13
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,317
Who first? Sorane?

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,942
Huh? Oh, me?

15
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:16,608
I was in...  Well, there
was the tennis club!

16
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:18,567
Seriously?

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,358
Gah!

18
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,150
Tennis is so lame!

19
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,150
[KUMASA laughs]

20
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,942
[KUMASA]
Well, what can ya do?

21
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,067
We're superfans, not gods.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,358
We can't control what our
idols are interested in.

23
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,317
Man, if I had the chance,

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,025
I'd die and be reincarnated
and be Maina's classmate!

25
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:40,483
So you would die right
now just for that, huh?

26
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,775
Why do you always have
to be so dramatic?

27
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,067
She was in the "go
straight home" club.

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,150
Uh, that's a euphemism
for a lazy bum.

29
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,567
It means Maina
wasn't in any clubs.

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,817
I don't care.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,192
Maybe she was a rebel.

32
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,483
No one who dances like that

33
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,108
could've been in
some preppy club.

34
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:56,775
Sorry? You lost me.

35
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,567
Dances like what?

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,192
How dare you both
pretend not to notice

37
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,858
how she dances like a goddess.

38
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:05,067
Man, if Eripiyo's reincarnation
idea really happened,

39
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,358
I'd come back as a
powerful record exec,

40
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,900
and then I'd give Reo
a mainstream debut!

41
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,442
Great idea!

42
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:14,942
Huh? Do you guys understand
the implications of all that?

43
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,233
Anyway, I just wanna make
Sorane happy in this life.

44
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:18,900
Huh?

45
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:20,400
What're you sayin'?

46
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:23,525
[MOTOI] I'll work hard and make
enough to support us both!

47
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,733
She'll stay home and
make amazing meals

48
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,150
for us to enjoy together!

49
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,025
Perfect!

50
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,525
Welcome home, my husband.

51
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,150
[MOTOI]
That's my dearest wish!

52
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:36,275
Oh, no. Poor Motoi thinks
he's gonna marry his idol.

53
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,317
[MOTOI]
Uh.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,358
Wait--what'd I say?
Is that weird?

55
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,567
[ERIPIYO, KUMASA]
Yeah. It's weird.

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,025
[MOTOI]
Huh...?

57
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,400
[MOTOI]
Whoa... Hey, check that out!

58
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:24,275
[KUMASA]
Huh?

59
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,692
You would never even know

60
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:28,192
that some of those girls
performed in the Girls' Festa.

61
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,942
Judging by that line.

62
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,192
Our place in line are
assigned at random today.

63
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,692
So I figured we wouldn't need
to get here super early,

64
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,233
but still, this turnout
seems pathetic, you know?

65
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:42,567
All right, folks!
Ticket distribution starts now!

66
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:49,192
[KUMASA]
Yep. This seems about right.

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,067
[MOTOI]
Hm? Ah!

68
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,442
Gah! Vomit!

69
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,275
[sighs]

70
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:06,817
Well, there aren't that
many people here,

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,150
so my number's more like 30.

72
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,733
And I was planning to watch from
the back today anyway, so...

73
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,025
[MOTOI]
Hey, um, Eripiyo?

74
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,400
[KUMASA] I "mustache" you
everyone's burning question.

75
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,108
What's goin' on with
that creepy get-up?

76
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,858
Are you joining the circus?

77
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,400
Ugh. Read much?

78
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:27,358
Maina gave a great interview
in this month's Mellow Magazine.

79
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,525
[MAINA]
Someone who's tall

80
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,983
and looks good in
dapper scarves, and...

81
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,983
Oh! I'd be over-the-moon if
they had a neat mustache!

82
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,942
See? Maina said so herself!
That's her ideal type, you know?

83
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,692
I hear that, but I think she
was referring to her ideal guy.

84
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,067
Gender is only a construct

85
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,650
when it comes to
matters of the heart.

86
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,150
My love for Maina
transcends such minutiae.

87
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,442
[KUMASA]
Oh. Cool.

88
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,817
[MOTOI] You know,
I gotta hand it to Maina.

89
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,108
She totally described someone

90
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:56,983
you'd never find in
a Cham Jam crowd.

91
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:58,483
She's so smart!

92
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,817
My Maina is the most brilliant,
capable idol in the world!

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,233
[KUMASA]
Wait just a minute!

94
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:03,942
My Reo would never be so foolish

95
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,025
as to give such an
oddly specific answer.

96
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:09,567
She's far too wise for all that.

97
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,900
[REO] My ideal partner would be
whomever I happen to fall for!

98
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:16,483
Uh, but if I had to be specific,
someone who's kind.

99
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,567
Heh. Still too generic?

100
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,567
See?

101
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,067
[ERIPIYO]
Shut up!

102
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,692
To each their own!
Maina's perfect!

103
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,067
She can answer
however she wants

104
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,192
and it will always be right!

105
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,400
[KUMASA]
A Maina stan at all costs,

106
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,983
even at the expense
of her dignity.

--[SORANE] Thanks for coming!

oba leaves as a filling!

They've got powerful
medicinal properties!

114
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,275
[ERIPIYO]
Good morning, Maina.

115
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,275
Still the cutest in
the universe, I see.

[MAINA gasps]

117
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,358
You look...

118
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:14,192
Oh, this? I'm trying
out a new look.

119
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,358
I wanna be your type.

120
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,692
[gasps]

121
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,150
[MAINA] I never said
stilts were my type!

122
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:23,608
That Mellow piece. You described
this as your ideal type.

123
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:25,317
[gasps]

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,900
[MAINA]
Oh, that?

125
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:29,192
[MAINA]
Those things are so silly.

126
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,733
[ERIPIYO]
Mh-mh.

127
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,650
You could have written anything
and I would've tried to be it.

128
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,067
The truth is,
I was just so happy

129
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,025
to be able to read
your words at all.

130
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,733
I could barely contain myself!

131
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,817
Uh. Hey, Eripiyo?

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,275
So I am going to do
whatever it takes

133
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,108
to become your ideal man, Maina!

134
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:47,692
You don't have to do anything!

135
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,108
Uh.

136
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,025
[ERIPIYO] Are you saying
there's no point in trying?

137
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:53,108
I'm nothing more
than a fan to you?

138
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,733
[MAINA]
I don't want you to change.

139
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:58,442
I want you to stay
exactly as you are.

140
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,900
[ERIPIYO] Uh, in one of the
wish strips I sent you,

141
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,525
I wished you would
go mainstream.

142
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,900
[ERIPIYO] Wait, did I just sound
impatient for a reply?

143
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,442
[MAINA]
Oh, you did?

144
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,817
You want me to break
into the mainstream?

145
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,317
[ERIPIYO]
Uh, yeah.

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,858
[MAINA] Then why didn't she
send me any of these wishes?

147
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,608
[ERIPIYO] I want you
to be front and center

148
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,358
and perform in
all kinds of stuff,

149
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:20,858
'cause that's what you deserve!

150
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:23,942
Also, I want you to
go to the Budokan.

151
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,858
I'm flattered.

152
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:29,192
[MAINA] But all I really wanted
was a letter from you, Eripiyo.

153
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,150
I'll spend my entire
paycheck on you!

154
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,650
Every last yen is yours!

155
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,817
[MAINA]
That's not what I want.

156

[MUROTA]
Thank you, come see us again.

Oh. Eripiyo.

00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm not sure what to
make of that hand signal.

160
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,608
[ERIPIYO]
She wasn't actually cold to me,

161
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:07,567
but I'm sure it seemed that way
from the outside looking in.

162
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,817
Maina, is there nothing
I can do to make you smile,

163
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,650
just for me?

164
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:14,900
Come on! Hurry!

165
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,317
Slow down!

166
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,067
[KUMASA]
Eripiyo?

167
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,650
[sighs]

168
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:24,567
It just hit me that
they're people, too.

169
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,983
[KUMASA, MOTOI]
What?

170
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,483
[ERIPIYO] Behind their smiles,
it's totally up to them

171
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,525
whether they love
you or hate you.

172
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:33,192
Don't you guys find that
absolutely terrifying?

173
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,775
It didn't occur to me to
be scared until now--thanks!

174
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,817
Well, great--how am I
supposed to think about

175
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,483
anything else now?

176
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,650
Look, it just occurred
to me, too!

177
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,567
I couldn't be alone with
this kind of despair--

178
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,817
I had to share it!

179
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,317
Look, I felt really
bad for triggering

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,983
your existential crisis,

181
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,942
so I found a way to
see Cham this week

182
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,025
during their promotional
activities.

183
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,275
Oh-ho!

184
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,483
And unlike the event at
the zoo the other day,

185
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,442
we can line up
in order this time.

186
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:09,608
Here's the catch:
It's at a mall in the boonies.

187
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,317
Even if we took the first train,
the earliest we could get there

188
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,900
is an hour before they start
handing out the tickets.

189
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,442
And that makes me nervous.

190
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,692
So I was thinking we could
stay at an internet café

191
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,650
in the area the night before.

192
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,233
How does that plan
sound to you?

193
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,900
[KUMASA]
You know me, kid, I'm in.

194
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,400
Even if it is in the
boonies, I'm down.

195
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,817
I'll be right up front,
cheering my head off!

196
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,442
Okay. It's on.

197
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,733
[BOTH]
Let's live our best lives!

198
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,608
[KUMASA snoring]

199
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,483
[MOTOI] What time are you
getting there today?

200
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,150
Let's line up together.

201
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,442
[chuckles]

202
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,567
[ERIPIYO]
Too bad! Way ahead of you!

203
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,900
We're out in the boonies,
camping out for a prime spot!

204
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:12,275
[MOTOI]
The boonies?

205
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:15,483
But they're supposed to be
playing in the city today.

206
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,025
Wha...?

207
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,692
Wait.

208
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,983
[ERIPIYO]
Oh, no. I got the wrong week!

209
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,400
You can't be serious!

210
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,650
Huh?

211
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:37,942
[KUMASA]
You sounded so confident

212
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,358
that it didn't even occur
to me to double check!

213
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,567
Why wouldn't I believe you?

214
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,608
[ERIPIYO]
You should've checked anyway!

215
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,983
I'm not infallible,
and she's your favorite!

216
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,233
Well, what about you?!

217
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,275
How can you call yourself
Maina's top stan?!

218
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,858
It isn't like I did
this on purpose!

219
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:56,233
Man! Every frikkin' stop?

220
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:59,567
I wish they would let me
drive this stupid train!

221
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:02,525
[ERIPIYO]
Streetcar?

222
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:05,358
No. We'll get there
faster if we run!

223
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,567
Come on, really stretch
your legs, Kumasa!

224
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,275
[KUMASA] I can't!
Don't you see how fat I am?

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,733
[KUMASA]
Please. Let's give up already.

226
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,442
If we walk normally,

227
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,650
we'll make it in time for
the special fan event.

228
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,150
What?

229
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,692
Am I some rich girl
who does this

230
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,525
'cause she has too much
time on her hands?

231
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,900
Am I?

232
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:37,317
But if you're tuckered out,
I'll run on ahead without you.

233
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,067
Come on, tracksuit!
Let's relive our glory days!

234
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,275
I saw this coming...
but it still stings.

235
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:52,900
[FANS cheering, applauding]

236
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:56,400
Hi, lovely people!
We're Cham Jam!

237
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:59,067
[FANS]
Yeah! We know!

238
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,358
[MAINA gasps]

239
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,400
[MAINA] Eripiyo's not there
in the front row.

240
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,067
I wonder where she is.

241
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,942
Here's our first song!
Sing along if you know it!

242
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:11,067
[FANS cheering]

243
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,650
[FANS]
One, two, three, four!

244
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,067
[MAINA]
There's Eripiyo.

245
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,942
Why is she so far back?

246
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,400
And she's soaking wet.
Did she fall into a river?

247
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,358
Maybe that's why she's late.

248
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,442
[ERIPIYO]
Uh.

249
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,942
[ERIPIYO]
Another girl?

250
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:30,025
I've never seen one here before.

251
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,067
[RENA]
She's really sweaty.

252
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,733
[ERIPIYO]
Wait, Maina.

253
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,525
Your pulse.

254
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,817
Normal. Good.

255
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,275
[MAINA]
Yeah.

256
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:44,858
[MAINA] Seems like Eripiyo
might be testing the waters.

257
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:47,692
I'm not sure how to respond.

258
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,192
[YOSHIKAWA]
That's it for today, everyone!

259
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:53,942
See you at the studio!
Till tomorrow, then!

260
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,817
[MAINA]
Eripiyo.

261
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,358
[YUKA]
I'm wide open here!

262
00:13:58,442 --> 00:13:59,942
Come hit me up!

263
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:01,233
[FUMI]
Hey.

264
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,817
I'm here, aren't I?

265
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,108
[YUKA] Obviously, but you're in
my line literally all the time.

266
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,817
You're basically invisible
to me at this point.

267
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,650
Man. She's so confident.

268
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:14,150
Makes sense. She is most popular
of the back-row squad.

269
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,150
Do you have to
call it that? Jeez.

270
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,525
Oh, right, sorry.

271
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,692
I wish I could be
like Yuka, too.

272
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,483
[AYA]
No, it wouldn't suit you.

273
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,275
Your sweetness is your
main selling point.

274
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,233
Ha. You think so?

275
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:28,817
I'm wide open!
Hit me up, people!

276
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,358
Uh.

277
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,358
Really, though. Wide open.

278
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,775
[MAINA]
Yeah. I'd just look pathetic.

279
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,692
[YOSHIKAWA]
Maina, here's one for you!

280
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,900
Hm?

281
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,400
[MAINA]
Wow, it's a girl!

282
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,025
[MAINA]
Hello! Nice to meet you!

283
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,067
Uh. Nice to meet you, too.

284
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,150
This was actually my very first
time seeing idols perform live.

285
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,817
Oh, really? So how did
you find out about us?

286
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
[MOTOI]
Oh, I see.

287
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:01,192
You just mixed this week's
schedule up with next week's.

288
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,192
I feel dumb. I should
always check just in case.

289
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,275
'Sup, Motoi?

290
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,192
[MOTOI]
Hey.

291
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,067
Oh. My little sister, Rena.

292
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,400
Hello.

293
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,108
You brought your sister?

294
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,233
Nice to meet ya.

295
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:17,483
I saw you in the back earlier.

296
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:21,150
I couldn't stand up
front. Too nervous.

297
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:27,567
I, uh-- I'm not really sure
if I should say this, but...

298
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,692
[RENA]
Huh?

299
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:29,983
[ERIPIYO]
She looks just like Sorane.

300
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,233
[MOTOI yelping]

301
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:35,150
Wait, isn't Sorane
the one that you like?

302
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,150
Well, that's creepy.

303
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,358
[MOTOI]
No! Shut up! You're wrong!

304
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:39,817
Well, you're right
that I like Sorane,

305
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,400
but the likeness is
just a coincidence!

306
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,442
Yeah, I get it.

307
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,608
So, who's your favorite
Cham Jam girl?

308
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:49,192
My fave?

309
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:53,150
Lemme see... The one I saw when
I went to the Girls' Festa.

310
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,275
I thought Maina looked prettier

311
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,567
than any of the
other girls there.

312

[gasps]

Maina? For real?

00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,775
You hear that?

315
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,733
Someone else picked up on her
ethereal beauty and grace!

316
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,608
Aw yeah! I win! I win! I win!

317
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:09,192
Yay, good for you.

318
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:13,233
[ERIPIYO] Rena! At tomorrow's
show, let's line up together!

319
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:14,942
[chuckles]

320
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:21,025
[MISAKI]
Thank you so much for coming!

321
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,817
[gasps] I forgot!

322
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,942
I bought them all on autopilot
without thinking of Rena!

323
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,067
I hope she won't be mad at me.

324
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,608
Um, Eripiyo?

325
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,067
Hi, Rena.

326
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,525
Uh, they told me, um, they're
sold out of Maina's merch.

327
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:38,608
Do you think maybe you'd
be willing to share yours?

328
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,400
It's my fault! So of course!

329
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,692
How many do you want?

330
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,733
Huh? Just one is fine.

331
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,025
[ERIPIYO]
Just one, really?

332
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,275
Yeah.

333
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:51,775
Maina's line, single file,
along the wall!

334
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:54,483
So what did you and Maina
talk about yesterday?

335
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:59,983
Huh? Girls' Festa, and I said
I'd always support her.

336
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,108
That's it.

337
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,858
[ERIPIYO]
Nice! And how'd she respond?

338
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:06,233
[MAINA] I'm so happy to
finally have a girl fan!

339
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,150
I hope you come back!
I'll be waiting!

340
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,192
[RENA]
So...

341
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,900
Huh...?

342
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,567
[YUMERI]
Hello!

343
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,108
[MAINA] Uh! It's the young
girl from yesterday!

344
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:21,358
Uh! She and Eripiyo
seem really close.

345
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,108
What's going on? And why?

346
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,608
All right! Maina's
handshakes start now!

347
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,067
Hello! Can't wait to meet you!

348
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,067
[YOSHIKAWA] Everyone in line,
please step forward.

349
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,358
I'm so nervous.

350
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,067
You've got this! Yeah!

351
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,275
Maina's a little shy, but if
you initiate conversation,

352
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,608
she'll totally answer,
so don't be afraid to speak up!

353
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,192
And if you run out of
things to talk about,

354
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,983
just compliment her on her
dancing--she loves that!

355
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,067
[RENA]
Hello.

356
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,858
[MAINA]
Hello! You came to see me again!

357
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,817
Did you have fun
at the show today?

358
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,150
[RENA]
Uh. Yeah.

359
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,775
[ERIPIYO] Maina's chatting
her up like an old pro!

360
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,317
I'm so proud!

361
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,442
[RENA] I'm glad they brought
me. It's been awesome.

362
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,317
[MAINA]
Eripiyo brought her?

363
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,650
Wow. You and Eripiyo
must be really close

364
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,400
if she's willing
to bring you here.

365
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:03,817
That's great.

366
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,692
Really close?

367
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,900
No. She and my brother
know each other.

368
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,233
I only just met her.

369
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,817
Oh, that makes sense!

370
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,817
[ERIPIYO yelps]

371
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,442
[ERIPIYO] Maina's having
more fun talking to Rena

372
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,400
than I've ever witnessed before!

373
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:22,067
Everyone should fall
in love with Maina.

374
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,067
I want her to belong to us all!

375
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,358
[ERIPIYO]
I never considered this

376
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:29,442
because for so long,
I was the only Maina stan.

377
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,650
Thanks so much!

378
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,525
[ERIPIYO]
But, like...

379
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,567
Please come see me again!

380
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,858
[ERIPIRO]
Right now?

381
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:40,608
I don't ever want Maina to smile
at anyone else besides me!

382
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,858
[MAINA]
Did I act too excited?

383
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:46,567
Eripiyo was watching.
I hope she's not mad.

384
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,150
[ERIPIYO]
Just one.

385
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:49,942
Just one?

386
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:50,942
[YOSHIKAWA]
Just one?

387
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,275
[ERIPIYO]
I mean,

388
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:55,817
if Rena got all that
attention with one ticket...

389
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,567
...so should I.

390
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,608
Why just one?

391
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:05,733
[ERIPIYO] Actually,
I have 28 more tickets.

392
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,942
[ERIPIYO] In order for her
to get to the Budokan,

393
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,192
she has to get more popular.

394
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,442
I can't do anything
to help her get there

395
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,900
if I keep her to myself.

396
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,067
When did this happen?

397
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,442
When did I become
such a selfish jerk?

398
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,567
[MAINA] There's something
bothering Eripiyo.

399
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,150
I can tell.

400
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:26,900
Eripiyo? Do you, um,
well, like me?

401
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,942
Huh? Of course I do!
I love you, in fact!

402
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,025
I tell you all the time, right?

403
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:36,983
[MAINA] I mean it in a different
way than you do.

404
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,525
[YOSHIKAWA] Thank you so much,
folks, that's a wrap!

405
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,942
[ERIPIYO] Maina, was
something wrong today?

406
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,525
[MOTOI]
Eripiyo!

407
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,525
We're waiting for you!

408
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,775
[ERIPIYO]
Rena.

409
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,108
Yes?

410
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,567
From an OG Maina stan
to a newbie,

411
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,608
I hope we can continue to share
our mutual love for her.

412
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:03,567
Yeah, me, too.
I'm looking forward to it.

413
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,942
Though I won't be able
to come by that often.

414
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,067
Oh, well, isn't that a shame!

415
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,692
Such a shame!

416
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,108
[ERIPIYO] Stop it!
Don't let on that you're happy!

417
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:14,608
Yeah. College entrance exams.

418
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:17,150
Oh. I see.

419
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:28,150
[bell ringing]

420
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:43,775
[gasps]

421
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,025
[ERIPIYO]
Maina in the wild?

422
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,442
I've never seen her like this!

423
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,442
A white dress. Normal clothes.

424
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:59,858
I've never imagined her
not in salmon pink.

425
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,983
[ERIPIYO]
An angel.

426
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:14,775
Right here in this train car,
a real-life miracle!

427
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:25,275
Sorry. I can change cars.
Next stop's mine, anyway.

428
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,650
Um. Okay.

429
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,525
Thank you.

430
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,692
For, um, always
coming to see me.

431
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,525
And coming to shake
my hand after.

432
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,275
[ERIPIYO] Does she mean:
"Giving me your undying support"

433
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,858
and "Cheering me on
no matter what"?

434
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,108
[ERIPIYO] I don't love her
just 'cause she's an idol.

435
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:57,567
I love her because she's Maina.

436
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,858
That's why I get so scared.

437
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:04,317
I won't stop. I'll keep coming
to shake your hand.

438
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:18,942
I love you.

439
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,400
[ERIPIYO]
Everything about you.

440
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,108
I love you!

441
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,608
[FUMI] Yuka, please,
don't get too excited

442
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:10,567
at the Autumn Sports Festival
and hurt yourself.

443
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,650
What kind of stuff have you
been into lately, Yuka?

444
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,483
Do you like the present
I gave you the other day?

445
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,817
If you want something else,

446
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,358
just write about it in
your blog and I'll get it!

447
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:19,983
I can't wait to see you again
on Halloween this year!

448
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,400
[YOSHIKAWA]
Thank you! Wrap it up!
