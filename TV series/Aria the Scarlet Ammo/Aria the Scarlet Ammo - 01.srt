1
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,500
Can you imagine
what it'd be like

2
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,250
to watch a girl just
fall out of the sky?

3
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,958
Yeah.

4
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,333
That'd be a great way to
start off a movie or a manga.

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,500
It could definitely
be the opening shot

6
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,875
of some extraordinarily
cool story.

7
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,333
Maybe the main guy
could transform into a hero

8
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,166
and this would be the
beginning of a great adventure

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,000
for him and the girl.

10
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,541
But actually wishing
for that to happen to

11
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,583
you would be kinda stupid,
because there's no way on earth

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,791
a girl like that
would be normal.

13
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,666
Hey Jerkwad!

14
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,458
You gonna duck or
should I shoot you too?

15
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,625
In real life?

16
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,791
Being shoved into
an unknown world

17
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,583
where you're supposed
to be the hero?

18
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,041
I know it sounds
cool but trust me,

19
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,750
it'd be dangerous and
a serious pain in the ass.

20
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,000
There's a frikkin bomb
planted on this stupid thing!

21
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,416
Get back or you're
gonna get dead!

22
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,875
Article 1 of the Butei charter.

23
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,541
"Trust your friends and
help when they need it."

24
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,375
Are you ready?

25
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,083
That's me.

26
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,958
I'm Kinji Tohyama.

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,416
And crazy hero adventures?

28
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,875
Yeah, that's never
really been my thing.

29
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,708
All I ever wanted was
to have an ordinary life.

30
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
I didn't want to be
noticed or even talk

31
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083
to anybody for that matter.

32
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,833
I wanted to get out
of my psycho school.

33
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,583
Just because my last
name 'Tohyama' is famous,

34
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,416
doesn't mean my life
has to be special.

35
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,916
There's my sleepy Kin-Kin.

36
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,416
I've told you ever since we
were little not to call me that.

37
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,791
Time to let that go and
just call me Kinji, okay?

38
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,541
Oh yeah.

39
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,083
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,000
I was actually just thinking
about when we were kids

41
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,208
on the way over here,
Kin-Kin, so I guess it was--

42
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
I just said it again, didn't I?

43
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,375
I'm so sorry Kin-Kin-- Oh. Oops.

44
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,625
Well?

45
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,375
What'd you come here for?

46
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,750
You remember how I told
you I'd be at the Ise Shrine

47
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,583
for training camp up
until yesterday, right?

48
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,125
Well, I just came by to catch up

49
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,250
since I couldn't do anything
for you while I was gone.

50
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,541
You don't have to do this.

51
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,375
But, I want to.

52
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,916
Fine, go ahead.

53
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,916
Check it out.

54
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,541
I made you this.

55
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,166
This is sugar-soy sauce shrimp,

56
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,708
Coho salmon and
Saijo persimmons,

57
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,958
and since
you like omelets,

58
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,833
I went ahead cooked one
of those for you, too.

59
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,708
You went to an
awful lot of trouble.

60
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,583
Not at all.

61
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,541
I just had to wake up at 4:30.

62
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
I always worry about
you during summer break

63
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,875
because usually
you eat so poorly--

64
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,333
nothing but fast food, cans of
meat and those sugar things.

65
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,625
Thanks a lot.

66
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,083
But my diet is not your job.

67
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,166
Here's dessert for my Kin-Kin.

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,041
Uh, yeah.

69
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,458
Say, um...

70
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,416
Thanks for all the nice
stuff you do, Shirayuki.

71
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,041
But you're always so nice to me.

72
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,083
I should be thanking you!

73
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,500
You really have to stop acting
like this with me at some point.

74
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,208
But I could see how difficult
it was for you to say "thanks."

75
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,791
You just try so hard for me.

76
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:24,916
 Black? Oh crap.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,208
That's gotta
violate the dress code.

78
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,708
Thanks for the food!

79
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,333
Oh man.

80
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,375
That was a close one.

81
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,208
Hey Kin?

82
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,125
In honor of our
first day as sophomores

83
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,333
I had your bulletproof
uniform cleaned.

84
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,041
Yeah, thanks.

85
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,041
And I loaded your
Berretta for you, too.

86
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,750
Those rounds were
laying everywhere.

87
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,791
Great.

88
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,625
Do I seriously
have to go strapped

89
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,583
on the first day of school?

90
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,791
You know you do, Kin.

91
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,208
The school rules clearly state
that students of Butei High

92
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,166
are required to
carry a gun and a blade

93
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,708
within school premises
at all times.

94
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,166
You never know
when another psycho

95
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,541
could pop up,
like that Butei-Killer.

96
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,833
The Butei-Killer?

97
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,416
C'mon, they already
caught that guy, right?

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,666
Heard they locked him up
and threw away the key.

99
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,666
Sure, but a copycat might
try to steal his ideas.

100
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,000
This morning's horoscope said

101
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,041
that you'd have trouble
caused by a woman.

102
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
If something were
to happen to you, Kin.

103
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,875
I'd just, I think I'd--

104
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,333
Okay, okay.

105
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
Besides, if I break the rules,

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,958
I'll get an even
worse evaluation,

107
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,333
and then I can't
transfer schools.

108
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,333
You're so lucky, Kin.

109
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,583
The Tohyama family is
filled with legendary heroes

110
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,000
and you're one of them.

111
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,291
Stop saying that.

112
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,083
I'm not anybody's hero.

113
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,625
I'm just a kid.

114
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,625
Go ahead and go without me.

115
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
I'll be there after
I check my e-mail.

116
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,083
If you want me to
wait I could clean

117
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,458
and do laundry until
you're finished with that.

118
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,166
You've done enough already.

119
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,208
Okay then.

120
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,750
Do your e-mailings.

121
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,416
Maybe you'll even have
time to send me one.

122
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,458
Oh crap! I'm gonna miss the bus!

123
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,500
On this particular day.

124
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,916
I missed the
7:58 bus for school,

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,750
which I would come to
regret for the rest of my life,

126
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,416
starting right then.

127
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,416
Is it too much to ask for
a normal, ordinary life?

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,333
That's all I want.

129
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,375
Attention: There is a remote
bomb planted on that bicycle.

130
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,125
If you attempt
to get off the bike

131
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,500
or if you begin to slow
down, it will explode.

132
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,250
Oh great.

133
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,000
This is a joke, right?

134
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,750
Please do not try
calling for help.

135
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,000
It is wired to explode if you
use your cellular telephone.

136
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,833
There's no way.

137
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
You never know when
another psycho could pop up,

138
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,625
like that Butei-Killer.

139
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,708
A copycat!

140
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,833
That's just perfect.

141
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,041
Why is he going after me?

142
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,208
I'm nobody.

143
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,416
I don't even want
to be a stupid Butei.

144
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,750
Good morning
first year students,

145
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,250
it's nice to meet you all.

146
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,625
I'll be your Ambulace
instructor at Tokyo Butei.

147
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,500
My name's Mr. Sayonaki.

148
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,708
Today, I'll orient
you to the campus.

149
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,833
I'll start with a basic
introduction of our facilities

150
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,500
and then I'll make
sure you understand all

151
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,041
of the school
rules at Butei High.

152
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,291
Tokyo Butei High is a 2
kilometer long by 500 meter wide

153
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,166
man-made island
known as a Mega-Float

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,166
which is anchored due
south of the Rainbow Bridge.

155
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,708
If I stop, it'll explode.

156
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,625
If I slow down, it'll explode.

157
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,833
Even if I jump off, I'll
end up getting shot by an Uzi.

158
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,791
I've gotta think.

159
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,291
Butei High is a comprehensive
educational institute

160
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,250
that trains students to become
armed detectives known as Butei.

161
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
Established to fight the
rising tide of violence,

162
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,041
graduates receive
an international license

163
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,208
granting them powers

164
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,625
equivalent to
those of the police,

165
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,916
like carrying weapons
and making arrests.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,291
However, unlike the police,
Butei are freelancers.

167
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,958
Our students are
allowed to take any Quest

168
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,500
they choose within
the scope of Butei Law.

169
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,791
Got it?

170
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,541
It's no use.

171
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,833
Unless I take it
out in one shot,

172
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll be Swiss cheese for sure.

173
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,375
Given the nature of the job,

174
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,083
a Butei could end up on
almost anyone's enemy list.

175
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,791
Recently, there was
even a serial killer

176
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,416
who was specifically
targeting the Butei.

177
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
Let that serve as a
reminder to all of you,

178
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,041
the life of a Butei
can be very dangerous

179
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,625
and our training
reflects that fact,

180
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,875
so try not to die
during school hours.

181
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,250
Every year I see the new
crop of incoming students

182
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,416
and get a little sad
because I know some of them

183
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,541
won't make it to graduation.

184
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,125
Crap, my legs are almost dead.

185
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,541
This is your last warning.

186
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,666
If you slow down any more,
the bomb will explode.

187
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,333
Is this how I'm going
to die, on a bike?

188
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,875
Can you imagine
what it'd be like

189
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,375
to watch a girl just
fall out of the sky?

190
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,750
Huh?

191
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,291
What happened to me?

192
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,208
I think my bike exploded.

193
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,333
There was a bomb planted on it.

194
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,375
A girl fell from the sky.

195
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,333
And then?

196
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,166
She's cute.

197
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,000
Hey, wait.

198
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,291
I got thrown when
the bomb exploded,

199
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,875
but how did I end
up in this place?

200
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,583
This can't be right!

201
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,041
So this girl risked her life
like that just to save me.

202
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,208
Oh no, this is bad!

203
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,458
This is not allowed!

204
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,125
Forbidden, forbidden,
forbidden, forbidden!

205
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,791
"Aria H. Kanzaki."

206
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,166
That's her name, huh?

207
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,416
From A to B?

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,875
She's wearing a push-up bra?!

209
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
Wait, the bra's powerless
against her genetics.

210
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,375
Good.

211
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,000
Calming down.

212
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,583
You perv!

213
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,541
You're a gross
disgusting freaky weirdo!

214
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,875
You ungrateful molester monster!

215
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,583
You got it all wrong!

216
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,041
I didn't touch you!

217
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,375
So there were more of them.

218
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,708
Uh, there were more of what?

219
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,625
Those Uzi two-wheelers
he used to kill the Butei!

220
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,833
These 9-millimeter
Parabellums are made

221
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,791
by an Israeli company named IMI

222
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,458
and shoot at 10
rounds per second.

223
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,125
If this vaulting box
wasn't bulletproof,

224
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,250
we would have been
cut to pieces by now.

225
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,791
But I thought you took
that thing out right

226
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,833
before my bike blew up.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,875
I told you there were
more of them, didn't I?

228
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,416
I count at least seven.

229
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,291
That's a problem.

230
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,958
Come on, pull out that Berretta!

231
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,750
I thought you were a
student at Butei High.

232
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,166
Uh, I can't.

233
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,166
Hurry up, we need more
firepower than just what I got.

234
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,500
What the heck?

235
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,666
This is new info.

236
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,000
Breasts are soft even
when they're tiny.

237
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,208
This is definitely
going to send me over.

238
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,791
Are you finished?

239
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,541
I only pushed them back for now.

240
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,750
They're still out there hiding

241
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,250
next to the trees on
the side of the road,

242
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,875
but they'll come out again.

243
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,250
You're strong for a girl.

244
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,208
I'm impressed you
could manage that.

245
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,125
Here's your reward,
my little princess.

246
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,125
Hey. What the--?

247
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,458
Have a seat there
and relax for a minute.

248
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,833
We don't need two people getting
all messy on this one, do we?

249
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,833
What happened to
you all of a sudden?

250
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,208
Have you gone crazy?

251
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,250
Figures.

252
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,666
We're in their blind spot.

253
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,625
They're wasting bullets
shooting like that.

254
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,875
Stop. You'll be shot!

255
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,250
I'll be fine as long
as I know you're safe.

256
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,583
What's gotten into you?

257
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,583
Out of nowhere
you're Mr. Super Stud?

258
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,125
What're you gonna do?

259
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,500
Protect you.

260
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,000
Aria.

261
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,625
Nice pattern.

262
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,833
This doesn't mean I owe you!

263
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,333
Toys like that, I could've
handled them by myself.

264
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,583
It's true.
I would've been fine.

265
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,833
If you're just trying to make up

266
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,583
for your super creepy
grope fest from earlier,

267
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,166
this is not going
to do it for me.

268
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,666
That was sexual assault,
and it's a crime.

269
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,791
Easy now.

270
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,625
That was just a
misunderstanding.

271
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,833
Where my face landed
was not in my control.

272
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,083
Not in your control, huh?

273
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,958
I was passed out and you were
trying to take off my clothes

274
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,583
like some kind of super
creepy pervy douchebag!

275
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,083
On top of that,
you saw my chest!

276
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,791
You're a criminal who got
caught in the act of assault!

277
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,208
You would have done
things I can't even imagine

278
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,791
if I didn't wake up
when I did, admit it!

279
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,125
Okay, try to think
about this rationally.

280
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,750
I'm in High School.

281
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,041
So it shouldn't be a shock
that middle school girls

282
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,333
like you are a little
too young for my taste.

283
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,458
I am not a middle-schooler,
you jerk-hole!

284
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,541
I didn't think they'd let an
elementary student be an intern,

286
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,208
but for a kid you did great.

287
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,333
It was really superb work.

288
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,875
Aria?

289
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:56,666
I should never have
saved a guy like you.

290
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm in my second
year of High School!

291
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,083
So you do hand-to-hand
combat, too?

292
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,333
You can't escape.

293
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,083
I've never let a single
criminal cross my path

294
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,791
and get away from me.

295
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,125
Where did my?

296
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,416
How the hell did
you get my magazine?

297
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,583
Give it back right now!

298
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,333
Sorry, princess.

299
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,833
I won't let you
get away with this.

300
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,625
Even if you beg for
forgiveness, I'll make you pay!

301
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,333
Swords, too?

302
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,875
You're a creepy molester man.

303
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,250
Give up now!

304
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,333
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,041
I must've dropped these.

306
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,416
You jerk!

307
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,791
Don't run off,
you stupid coward!

308
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm gonna pump you
full of so many holes!

309
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,375
Hysteria savant syndrome,

310
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,000
also commonly known
as hysteria mode.

311
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,750
It's a rare genetic abnormality
that runs in my family.

312
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,750
The problem with it
is that it also changes

313
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,083
every other aspect of my
personality when it kicks in.

314
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,458
I feel compelled to protect
the girl in front of me

315
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,791
no matter what, and,

316
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,750
for some reason,
I act so completely smug,

317
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,375
that I feel like a total idiot
whenever I look back on it.

318
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,250
I just want to crawl
under a rock and die.

319
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,750
Oh man.

320
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,875
'Here's your reward,
little princess'?

321
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,791
I'm such a douchebag.

322
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,041
Sorry I'm late,

323
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,416
but I had to deal with
something that came up.

324
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,291
I want my seat to be
right next to that guy!

325
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:39,833
What?

326
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,833
No way!

327
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,666
Why'd she have
to be in my class?

328
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,125
Good for you, Kinji!

329
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,375
I don't know what her deal is
but damn you are one lucky guy.

330
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,458
Hey, teacher!

331
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,125
After we drew
straws I was supposed

332
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,333
to sit next to Kinji,
but I'll give my seat to Aria!

333
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,666
That is so sweet.

334
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,666
Then the seat next to
Kinji will go to Aria.

335
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,041
Umm, actually, Teacher, I uhh.

336
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,166
Hey. I brought your belt back.

337
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,958
Oh! That's it!

338
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,291
Now I got it!

339
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,083
It's so obvious what's
going on between you two!

340
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,833
You're not wearing
your belt, Kin,

341
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,875
and then Miss Double Duty Hair
Freak brings it back to you.

342
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,208
It's hardly a mystery.

343
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,833
I conclude that you
must have done something

344
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
where you needed
to take off your belt

345
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,083
in front of her for some reason.

346
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:23,958
You're right.

347
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,708
My guess is they must be dating.

348
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,708
How are you dating a hot girl?

349
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,708
All this time I thought
he was a nerdy loser.

350
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,791
I assumed he only
liked the guys.

351
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,083
Total waste.

352
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,916
Hey, hold on.

353
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,625
Listen! Relationships
are pointless.

354
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,375
Try to remember that here.

355
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,333
Cause if you act
like a bunch of idiots,

356
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,875
I'll pump you full of holes!

357
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,291
Well that was pretty crazy
for a first day of school.

358
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,750
She sure likes
e-mail, doesn't she?

359
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,000
Hi Kin, how are you?

360
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,916
Inquesta's classes are
over for the day, right?

361
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,250
Looks like the SSR
has classes until night.

362
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,458
I just want to go home already

363
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,750
and think of stuff
I can do for you.

364
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,375
Things are tough on Shirayuki,
too, in their own way.

365
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,416
Now that I'm home,

366
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,916
it's like the whole bomb thing
this morning didn't happen.

367
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,666
I never thought the Butei
Killer would go after me.

368
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,666
Well, a copycat of the
Butei Killer anyway.

369
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,500
Besides it's not like they
were targeting me specifically.

370
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,625
It's gotta be random--they
coulda' picked any Butei.

371
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,291
But why go through all the
trouble of planting a bomb

372
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,875
on a bike like that?

373
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,708
You'd only do that if you were
targeting someone in particular.

374
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,958
Somebody must have a
serious grudge against me.

375
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:52,833
All right!

376
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm coming!

377
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,666
What the hell?

378
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,041
 'Bout time.

379
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,708
Oh, it's you again.

380
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,875
You could just say "hello."

381
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:02,458
Hold on.

382
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,583
Wait. Aria?

383
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,583
You can't come barging
in here uninvited.

384
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,791
Really. I mean it!

385
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,083
Listen up.

386
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,416
I've decided that you
should become my slave.

387
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,500
Just like Shirayuki said.

388
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,458
I had trouble caused
by a woman today.

389
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,500
"You should become my slave!"

390
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,541
Oh yeah, that was a
pretty cool thing to say

391
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,791
and it has a nice ring to it.

392
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,708
What's with you being
all stuck on yourself?

393
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,708
Like I said.

394
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,166
I think you should
team up with me!

395
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,333
No, thank you.

396
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,541
Why would I do that?

397
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,875
I've decided to
quit being a Butei.

398
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,250
Peach buns are so good!

399
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,791
Listen to me when I'm talking.

400
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,583
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo Episode 2!

401
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,041
"Aria the Quadra."

402
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,041
Watch it or I'll pump
you full of holes.
