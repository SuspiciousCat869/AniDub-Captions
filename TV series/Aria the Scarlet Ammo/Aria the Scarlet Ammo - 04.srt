1
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,375
On the evening of December 24th.

2
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,708
A fire broke out aboard
the cruise ship, Embellir,

3
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,916
causing it to sink while

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,708
off the coast of Uraga,
Kanagawa Prefecture.

5
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,583
According to the passenger list,
there was a Butei on board.

6
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,791
Apparently an operative
of the Butei Agency.

7
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,416
A witness claims
the fire erupted

8
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,541
within close
proximity of this Butei.

9
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,041
Butei are specifically trained

10
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,291
to prevent these kinds of
accidents aren't they?

11
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,458
I thought that was
the point of Butei.

12
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,041
Was it your older
brother's incompetence

13
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,333
that risked the lives
of hundreds of people?

14
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,541
Shouldn't you
apologize on his behalf?

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,291
Just a dream.

16
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,791
Damn it.

17
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:42,333
Screw being a Butei.
Screw this life!

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,375
My older brother got caught

19
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,458
in the middle of a
cruise ship accident.

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,708
He managed to lead
everyone on board to safety,

21
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,916
but he wasn't able
to save himself.

22
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,125
People still blamed
him despite his heroics.

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,583
That pretty much
sums up being a Butei.

24
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,958
Give your life to save someone

25
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,625
and they'll just wipe
their feet on your corpse.

26
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,500
And that's why--

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,458
Kin Kin.

28
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,583
Are you enjoying
your Sunday so far?

29
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,916
I just heard some news about
the Butei Killer copycat--

30
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,791
I can't be a Butei anymore.

31
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,208
Your haircut's really cute.

32
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,166
Yeah!

33
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,333
Thank you.

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,416
Aria.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,083
She got her bangs cut.

36
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,083
She's all dressed up.

37
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,166
I wonder if she's got a date.

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,208
I don't even know why
the hell I'm doing this.

39
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,916
It's not like I have
something to say to her.

40
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,916
A police station?

41
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,333
You call that tailing?

42
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,333
I can still see
your big bushy tail.

43
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,916
Aw, jeez.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,333
Ya could've said something if
you knew I was following you.

45
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,375
I was deciding whether or not

46
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,541
to let you know
where I was going.

47
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,333
Especially since the
Butei Killer targeted you.

48
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,916
Huh?

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,416
Oh well, you've followed me this
far, you might as well join me.

50
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,958
Mom!

51
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,166
Well. Who's this, Aria?

52
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,083
I didn't know you
had a boyfriend.

53
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,916
What, no way, c'mon, Mom!

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,333
He goes to high school with me.

55
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,375
His name's Kinji.

56
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,458
And he's definitely
not like that!

57
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,041
It's nice to meet you.

58
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm Kanae. Kanae Kanzaki.

59
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,875
You must be a good friend
to come down here with her.

60
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,291
Umm, I guess.

61
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,416
Visiting time's too
short for small talk

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,125
so I'll get right to the point.

63
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,875
The Butei Killer tried to
go after Kinji the other day.

64
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,500
I knew it wouldn't be very
long before he resurfaced.

65
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,416
And it won't take me
long to catch him, either.

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,416
Try to hang on!

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,250
If I can prove definitively
that you're not the Butei Killer

68
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,333
that will get one of your
life sentences overturned.

69
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,458
Then I can start working

70
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,250
on getting the other
seven thrown out.

71
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,708
I can disprove those before your
case goes to the Supreme Court.

72
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,083
That's sweet of you to try, but

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,125
it's more important that
you find a partner first, Aria.

74
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
Well, I know, but.,,

75
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,041
You need to have someone
who truly understands you

76
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,833
by your side before
you confront an enemy.

77
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,500
But I know I can
do it by myself.

78
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,041
You can't, Aria.

79
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,500
You need a partner to
harness your inherent talent.

80
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,791
It's the only way.

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,041
Your great grandfather's
legacy would be nothing

82
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,041
without his partner, right?

83
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,541
Yeah, I know.

84
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,625
People treat me
like I'm defective

85
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,875
because I haven't
found a partner by now.

86
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,083
But there's not enough time!

87
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,833
You need to focus
on living your life.

88
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,583
You're bound to slip
and fall if you rush.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,625
Kanzaki, time's up.

90
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,833
Just hang on, mom!

91
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,000
I promise I'll capture
every single person

92
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,333
who framed you before
you make it to trial!

93
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,416
No, Aria!

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,416
You just aren't
ready to confront I-U!

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,875
I-U?

96
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,458
Now! Time's up!

97
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,583
No, Mom!

98
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,416
Let go!

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Don't you dare hurt my mom!

100
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,333
Aria, promise me you'll
find a partner first!

101
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,416
Please!

102
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,583
That scar on your
forehead tells me

103
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,416
that you can't handle
this by yourself!

104
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,291
I love you.

105
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:03,750
Stop it!

106
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Come back!

107
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,250
Mom!

108
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,333
Don't follow me.

109
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,791
Aria.

110
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,791
Just leave me alone, Kinji!

111
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,125
I can't leave you
when you're cry--

112
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,541
I am not crying!

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,916
I'm not crying.

114
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,041
I'm not.

115
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,958
Many are the
mountains in Yamato.

116
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,375
The next day,
Aria didn't come to school.

117
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,708
So that's when her mom
got taken into custody.

118
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,958
But Aria's convinced
that she was framed,

119
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,875
and she's hell-bent
on proving it.

120
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,833
Listen up, I've decided that
you should become my slave.

121
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,166
You need to find a partner.

122
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,750
She didn't mean slave.

123
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,416
She was just too
proud to say partner.

124
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,625
But--

125
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,583
You're not the one
I was looking for.

126
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,625
I guess I was wrong about you.

127
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,416
But I've gotta quit.

128
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,416
There you are, Kinji.

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,541
Oh, what's up, Shiranui?

130
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,916
What're you doing down here?

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,791
I've been looking
all over for you.

132
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,291
I thought you might be
interested in the news

133
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,791
that I heard earlier.

134
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,041
It's about Aria.

135
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,333
Apparently she's decided
to go back to London.

136
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,500
What?

137
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,875
She's taking a charter plane

138
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,041
from Haneda at
seven o'clock tonight.

139
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,625
Then she's gone.

140
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
I thought you'd rather
hear about it from me.

141
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,625
I can't believe
that Aria's leaving.

142
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,000
But I'm sure it's for the best.

143
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,333
It's not like I could
really be her partner.

144
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,375
Ah! Kinjiiii!

145
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,291
I'm so happy that
you could make it!

146
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
Come on in, sit down!

147
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,166
What's with the private room?

148
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,125
You don't need
to worry about that.

149
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,541
Just sit back and
let me take the wheel.

150
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,958
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,208
And what's so important

152
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,708
that you have to make
such a deal about it?

153
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,083
Relax Kinji.

154
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,208
Now, open up.

155
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,541
Get that outta my face.

156
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,333
The Butei Killer.

157
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,625
If you simply open your mouth,

158
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,208
then I'll tell you
all sorts of fun things.

159
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,041
Say "Aahh."

160
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,416
Now, let's see.

161
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,458
Where would you
like to begin Kinji?

162
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,791
So soft!

163
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,708
Right here?

164
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,500
Or maybe.

165
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,666
You'd rather start right here?

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
That wasn't the deal!

167
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,375
I know, I know.

168
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,708
You only care about my intel.

169
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,208
Hey, what're you--?

170
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,333
Cut that out!

171
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,916
Not every crime is
accurately reported.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,083
Huh?

173
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,125
Just because they
were filed as accidents

174
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,291
doesn't mean the Butei Killer
didn't actually commit them.

175
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,791
Wait.

176
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,125
You're saying the hijacking
cases weren't the only ones?

177
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,875
This file does make me wonder.

178
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,875
I found it at
the police station.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,041
This is your older
brother's name, right?

180
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,583
Could this've been
a boat hijacking?

181
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,833
The Butei Killer
killed my brother?

182
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,083
But why?

183
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,166
Lovely.

184
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,750
Just lovely, Kinji.

185
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,583
You have such haunting eyes.

186
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,166
I get chills looking at them.

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,083
Je t'aime a croquer.

188
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:02,833
What?

189
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,083
Just relax!

190
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,000
No, Riko.

191
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,416
Stop it!

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,375
You couldn't possibly
be any more clueless

193
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
to the way girls work.

194
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,416
You really don't get it.

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,666
It's too late to stop this.

196
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,083
Dammit! No!

197
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,125
She's sending me
into hysteria mode!

198
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,291
You and I are the only ones

199
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,833
who'll ever know what
happens in this room.

200
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,125
Shirayuki's at training camp

201
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,875
and Aria's gotta be
on that plane by now.

202
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
So what do you think, Kinji?

203
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,458
Sorry, doll, but that's
all you get for today.

204
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,208
What?

205
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:50,750
Kinji?

206
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,458
What are--?

207
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,625
Tomorrow's a
school day, young lady.

208
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,083
It's getting close
to your bedtime.

209
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,291
If I'm adding
everything up correctly--

210
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,500
Then Aria's in danger.

211
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,500
I've come down
from hysteria mode.

212
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,583
Although.

213
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,375
Hey! Hold it!

214
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,916
I'm a Butei!

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,208
I never would've
connected all the pieces

216
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,958
if I hadn't gone
into hysteria mode.

217
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,875
The previous killings,
my brother's case,

218
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,833
all hijackings,
and now this airplane.

219
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,958
There's no doubt that
the Butei Killer is onboard.

220
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,083
What? Sir!

221
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:51,750
Butei!

222
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,666
Cancel the takeoff!

223
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,458
But we can't!

224
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,083
There's not enough
time to explain!

225
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,875
But this plane cannot
leave the runway!

226
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,625
Uh. Yes sir!

227
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,041
Just in time.

228
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,791
Talk about a decked out plane.

229
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,375
Guess you can't expect
the rich to fly coach.

230
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,583
We're moving!

231
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,333
Eh, 'scuse me.

232
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,916
It wasn't possible.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,291
The captain said it would be a
violation to stop at this point.

234
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,000
That leaves plan B.

235
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,333
And she honestly knows you?

236
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,666
I know you're a Butei.

237
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,916
But I'm not supposed to do this

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
without the
passenger's permission.

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,000
Kinji!

240
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Hey, what's up, Aria?

241
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,791
Well.

242
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,375
Please take a seat
and fasten your seatbelt.

243
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,833
The plane's about to take off.

244
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,666
Hey! What's the deal?!

245
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,458
I doubt you'll believe this,
but the plane is--

246
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,416
It's rude of you to barge
in here without an invitation!

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,250
That sure is funny
coming out of your mouth.

248
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,625
C'mon, the plane's taking off.

249
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,208
We need to sit down.

250
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,083
What're you doing here, Kinji?

251
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,958
What makes the sky look blue?

252
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,291
How are birds able to fly?

253
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,375
Shut up!

254
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,500
You want new holes in you?

255
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,750
Article 2 of the Charter.

256
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,916
Honor your client's
contract no matter what.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,208
Huh?

258
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,791
I made you a promise.

259
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,750
I promised I would
solve the first case

260
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,750
with you and only that one.

261
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,958
But we haven't solved
the Butei Killer case.

262
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,625
Why are you
bringing this up now?!

263
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,583
Seriously, thanks to you,
I've come to realize

264
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,125
that I'm gonna have to work
alone for the rest of my life!

265
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,791
There's not a single
person out there

266
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,291
worthy of being my partner!

267
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,666
And I'm fine with--

268
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,291
You're not frightened, are you?

269
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,875
What, why would I be scared?

270
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,958
Don't be stupid.

271
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,708
Anyway, what I was saying--

272
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,208
Why don't you just
hide under the covers

273
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,625
if you're that scared?

274
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,958
I don't think either of us
want you to piss yourself.

275
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,125
Shut up!

276
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,583
Stupid Kinji!

277
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Good evening, this is
your captain speaking.

278
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,375
We're taking a slight detour
to avoid some thunderstorms.

279
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,000
The weather's gonna
keep up for a little while,

280
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,750
but it shouldn't cause
us too much turbulence.

281
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,625
Please tell me you've got
an extra pair of underwear.

282
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,125
Sh-Shut up!

283
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,083
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna, pump you--

284
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,500
Of all things,

285
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,250
I never would've expected
this to be her weak point.

286
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,666
Just quit picking on me, Kinji.

287
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,291
There's nothing to be scared of,
everything is just fine.

288
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,541
But the-- How do
you know it's fine?

289
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,708
Her hands.

290
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,833
They're so small and delicate.

291
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,041
She may not seem like it,
but she's an ordinary girl.

292
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,458
Well, I may not be her partner,

293
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,833
but I can still be her friend.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,875
Kinji.

295
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,458
I need to tell
you something, Aria.

296
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,916
I've got a strong feeling
the Butei Killer is--

297
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,958
That was a gun.

298
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.

299
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,

300
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,833
but this plane
has been hijacked.

301
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,708
I know that voice.

302
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,375
It's the Butei Killer!

303
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,750
Dammit! I wish I'd
been wrong about this.

304
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,291
On the other hand,
Butei are welcome to roam.

305
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll be waiting in
the downstairs bar

306
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,791
if you'd like to
come play with me.

307
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,208
Fine by me.

308
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm gonna pump the
creep full of holes.

309
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,166
I'm right behind you.

310
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,083
I've got this one.

311
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,041
Are you sure?

312
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,083
Fine. Come with me.

313
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,708
The Butei Killer started off

314
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,416
by hijacking a
motorcycle and a car.

315
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,083
And he killed a Butei
while hijacking a boat.

316
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,791
I'm pretty sure that one
was a direct confrontation.

317
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,375
Why's that?

318
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,708
'Cuz there was no remote control
radio signal detected that time.

319
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,291
There was no need to use one,

320
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,541
because the killer
was on the boat.

321
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,916
It's just a hunch, but I get
the feeling he's on the plane.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,833
He attacked me on my bike,
and then he attacked the bus.

323
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,708
So the only thing left--

324
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,958
A plane?

325
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,583
But how were you so sure
he'd choose this plane?

326
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,125
He framed your mom and
now he's finishing the job.

327
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,041
He's declaring war on you.

328
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,000
So you think I've been

329
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,333
the bastard's target
from the get-go.

330
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,375
He wants to mess
with me, does he?

331
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,250
Then I'll show him a real mess.

332
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,208
Turn around now.

333
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,916
It's kind of sad how easily
you fall right into my traps.

334
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,666
Riko!

335
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,833
Bon soir, Kinji.
And you. Ohl-mes.

336
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,791
Ohl-mes?

337
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,500
Alright.

338
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,708
Who the hell are you?

339
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,125
Riko Mine Lupin the fourth.

340
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,333
That is my true family name.

341
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,583
Lupin, that's--

342
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,708
Exactly.

343
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,333
The French master
thief, Arsene Lupin.

344
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,791
I'm his great granddaughter.

345
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,083
Wait, what?

346
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,625
So maybe you are
Lupin's descendant,

347
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,750
but why the hell
are you doing this?

348
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,250
I'm doing this because
my name's Riko.

349
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,916
Not once has anyone

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,041
from my family called me
by my given name.

351
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,875
My mother gave me this name
and what do they call me?

352
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,458
It's Lupin! Miss Lupin!

353
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,750
Lupin the fourth!

354
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,208
Even the servants called
me Miss Lupin the fourth.

355
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,458
My whole life.

356
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,583
You're serious?

357
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,125
That's the reason
you're doing this?!

358
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,250
They've ignored my existence!

359
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,083
Treated me like a number!

360
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,750
Like I don't matter!

361
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,250
All they care about
is my genetics!

362
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,708
The only way to
become my own person

363
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,916
is to surpass my grandfather.

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,125
So I joined I-U for the power
they promised to give me.

365
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,416
And with this power I'll show
the world my true identity!

366
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,333
Hold on, Riko!

367
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,458
Are you seriously
the Butei Killer?

368
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,208
You planned the hijackings?

369
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,000
The hijackings were nothing
but a mere prologue.

370
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,625
Holmes the fourth is my target.

371
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,583
Which means you. Aria.

372
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,958
The confrontation between our
great-grandfathers

373
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,791
concluded with a stalemate.

374
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,416
So, if I am able to
defeat Holmes the fourth,

375
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,458
then I will have exceeded
my great-grandfather's legacy.

376
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,083
And don't try to skip out
on playing your role Kinji.

377
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,416
What?

378
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,833
It's a necessity that
Holmes has a partner.

379
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,125
The first Holmes would have been
absolutely nothing without his.

380
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,708
In order to balance the odds,

381
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,916
I had to make sure
you partnered with Aria.

382
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,291
Do you mean that you
orchestrated our meeting?

383
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,583
That's right!

384
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,291
All I had to do was plant
a bomb on your bike.

385
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,958
And then the remote radio
signal led her straight to you.

386
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,875
But it seemed like you
needed extra incentive,

387
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,083
so I hijacked the bus.

388
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,333
It boggles the mind
that you never noticed

389
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,958
I'd tampered with the
clocks in your dorm room.

390
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,458
You're a terrible Butei, Kinji.

391
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,791
So you've been able to
pull off every single step

392
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,750
of your plan without a problem.

393
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,416
Well, not entirely.

394
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,458
Hard as I tried, the
two of you simply refused

395
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,208
to team up with one another.

396
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,500
You wouldn't even
get off your butt

397
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,916
until I mentioned
your older brother.

398
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,833
Oh, I'm sure you've
figured this out,

399
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,958
but the culprit in the
case with your brother.

400
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,750
All meeee!

401
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,125
So you...
you killed my brother?!

402
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,125
Well actually.

403
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,166
I'll let you in on
something fun.

404
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,208
How exactly should I put this?

405
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,625
See. Your brother's
my boyfriend.

406
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,666
Enough of your crap!

407
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,708
Calm down, she's provoking you!

408
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,375
You expect me to be calm now?!

409
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,083
No, no, I don't think so, Kinji.

410
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,875
We both know you're
useless in a battle right now.

411
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,666
You aren't the only one
who uses two guns, y'know?

412
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,083
As a rule, Butei
never go anywhere

413
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,083
without their
bulletproof jackets.

414
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,250
This fact tends to complicate
up-close gun battles.

415
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,125
The only way to win is

416
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,250
to score a direct hit
at point blank range.

417
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,666
Or to land a head shot.

418
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,791
That hurt!

419
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,333
And if they're equally skilled,

420
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,833
it comes down to
who's got more bullets.

421
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,916
Which means,
Aria's in a bad spot.

422
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,750
Luckily.

423
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,458
Kinji!

424
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,041
Give it up, Riko!

425
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,791
What's truly amazing,

426
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,833
Aria is just how much stuff
you and I have in common.

427
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,041
Our family history, our cute
figures, and our nicknames.

428
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,416
What?

429
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,291
I know it's weird, but
I've got the same nickname.

430
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,125
I'm Riko the Quadra.

431
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,291
Although. Your Quadra
isn't the real deal.

432
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,833
Aria!

433
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,750
Aria. Aria!

434
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,041
Where am I?!

435
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,833
Last thing I remember
is getting shot.

436
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,833
Thou art deep in
the world of dreams.

437
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,416
What are you doing here, Kinji?!

438
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,791
My name art not Kinji.

439
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,416
I art a dream spirit.

440
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,791
Oh, is that so?

441
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,166
There art unfinished
deeds thou must accomplish.

442
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,541
I'm aware of that.

443
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,416
I've gotta take down Riko.

444
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,750
Next time on
Aria the Scarlet Ammo!

445
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,250
"Butei Charter
Article 1" tis next.

446
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,500
I shall pump thou full of holes!

447
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,583
Great, I'm talking like you.
