1
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,041
Kinji.

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,208
I think that you
should become my slave.

3
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,583
Huh?

4
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,500
Now that we're on the same page.

5
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,666
Pay attention!

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,666
I want you to make
me an espresso.

7
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,750
Lungo, doppio.

8
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,125
And pure cane sugar.

9
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,125
Huh?

10
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,291
Oh, and I'm hungry, too.

11
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,416
Huh?

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I seem to have an urgent craving
for some Matsumoto peach buns.

13
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,458
Go out and fetch me some.

14
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,375
This is crazy.

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,625
Like no-joke literally crazy.

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,583
Butei deal with vicious
criminals on a daily basis.

17
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,458
There are three chronic traps
Butei routinely fall victim to.

18
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,541
Darkness, poison,
and, of course--

19
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,958
Women.

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,666
Last time I checked.

21
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,500
Peach buns were not that tasty.

22
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,416
And yet she's on her sixth one.

23
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,833
This tastes all wrong, like
somebody added dirt to it.

24
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,208
It kinda tastes a
little like Greek coffee.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,833
No.

26
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:23,958
That's not it.

27
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,083
And she doesn't
seem to have any idea

28
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,250
there's such a thing
as instant coffee.

29
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,166
I can't figure her out.

30
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,416
Not that I really care,
and more importantly--

31
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,416
We need to have a talk.

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,291
Can it wait until
I'm done eating?

33
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,500
No it can't.

34
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,541
What the hell is with
all the slave stuff?

35
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,791
You're joking, right?

36
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,375
Far from it.

37
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,333
You're gonna transfer to Assault
and become my new team member.

38
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,625
From now on we'll
work together as Butei.

39
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,833
Listen, nut job,

40
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,458
I already transferred
out of Assault once

41
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,125
because I didn't like it.

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,250
There's no way I'm going back.

43
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,750
I'm sick and tired of
being a Butei anyway.

44
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,541
There are three words
that I absolutely despise.

45
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,083
Are you even listening to me?!

46
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:04,791
Tired.

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:05,750
Exhausted.

48
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,375
Impossible.

49
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,416
Those are the three words
that prevent everybody

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,583
on this stupid planet from
reaching their full potential.

51
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,958
Never say any of those
words in front of me again.

52
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
Are we clear?

53
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,875
Not entirely, no.

54
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,000
Now let's discuss your position.

55
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,416
Ah!

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,791
You should be working out
on the front-line with me.

57
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,625
No, I shouldn't!

58
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,083
Why do you want me, anyway?!

59
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,166
What makes the sky look blue?

60
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,833
How are birds able to fly?

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
What?

62
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,333
You're like a child who
asks too many questions.

63
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,708
Act like a Butei.

64
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,291
Do some research and
figure it out for yourself.

65
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,083
It's simply not possible

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,250
to have a rational
conversation with her.

67
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,416
I don't have much time left.

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,541
I need to know soon if you're
the one I've been searching for.

69
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,208
What?

70
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,583
It doesn't matter!

71
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,083
Whether you like it or not,
you're joining my team!

72
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,416
I'll just have to wear you
down until you say "yes."

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,541
And what does that mean?

74
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,958
I'll stay the night!

75
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,291
Now hold on!

76
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,750
No way, that's
against the rules!

77
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,958
Shut up!

78
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,750
If I wanna stay,
then that's what I'm doing.

79
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,416
See, I even came
prepared just in case!

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
You packed an overnight bag?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,875
Are you serious?!

82
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,041
Now, get outta here!

83
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,208
Wait.

84
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,250
What?

85
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,916
A little punishment
would do you some good.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,083
Now go outside and cool off!

87
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,583
What the hell?!

88
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,375
It's my dorm room!

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,458
What am I doing here?

90
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,291
She should've been
the one to leave!

91
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,916
Looks empty.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,708
Did she go home?

93
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,333
She's taking a bath?!

94
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,833
You're kidding me.

95
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,666
Shirayuki!

96
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,916
I better pretend
like I'm not home.

97
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,875
Was that you, Kin Kin?

98
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,583
Are you okay?

99
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,083
Hi, Kin Kin!

100
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,500
Yeah, why are you here?

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,875
And what are you wearing?

102
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,791
Oh. I uh, y'know.

103
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,875
My classes finally let out,

104
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,625
and I was in a hurry to get here
so I didn't bother changing.

105
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,791
I, I can go change
if you don't like it.

106
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,833
No, don't worry about it.

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,708
Kin Kin, wait.

108
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,500
The daily school
email update mentioned

109
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,458
a bike explosion this morning.

110
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,625
I'm afraid to ask but,
was that about you?

111
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,958
Uh. Yeah. It was.

112
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,083
You're okay, right?!

113
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,583
Please tell me you weren't hurt!

114
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,750
Calm down, I'm alright.

115
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,708
I don't know what I'd do--

116
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,666
Oh, good.

117
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,791
But it's unforgivable

118
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,541
that they would even
think of targeting you.

119
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,250
Monsters! I'll lop off
each one of their limbs.

120
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,375
I'll kill 'em!
Uh, I mean I'll arrest them!

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,791
Whoa, drop it.

122
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,416
Getting attacked is a
normal part of being a Butei.

123
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,458
Just try to forget
it even happened.

124
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,541
Oh, sure.

125
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,666
Okay. Yeah.

126
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,833
So. Why'd you drop by?

127
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,041
Well.

128
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,041
I made some steamed rice
with bamboo shoots.

129
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,000
I thought you might
like it for dinner.

130
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,375
I start training
camp at Mt. Osore

131
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,875
tomorrow and I'm not gonna
be around to cook for you,

132
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,583
so I made an extra serving.

133
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,750
Great, thank you.

134
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,166
That's all ya came
by for, right?

135
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,083
So you can leave?

136
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,666
Right? Right? Right? Right?

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,083
Can't believe I cooked
you two meals in one day.

138
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,208
It's almost like
like I'm your wife.

139
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,916
Oh, jeez, what am
I saying. How weird.

140
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,750
I'm so weird.

141
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,833
Right? Weirdo. Yep, weird.

142
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,250
Don't you think so, Kin Kin?

143
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,791
No, no, not at all,
whatever you want!

144
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,916
Now please go home!

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
Home you go!

146
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,333
Not at all?!

147
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,541
It's not weird?

148
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,416
Then. You want
me to be your wife?!

149
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,666
Is there somebody in there?

150
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,708
What are you talking
about, of course not!

151
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,375
Kin Kin.

152
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,208
You wouldn't be trying to hide
something from me, would you?

153
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,125
No, no, I'd never
try to hide Aria--

154
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean anything, from you!

155
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
That's good. Thanks, Kin.

156
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,791
Well, I guess I'm gonna
head on home now.

157
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,875
Wait a second.

158
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,958
If Aria finds out I came back
while she was in the bath.

159
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,833
She'll straight up
try to kill me.

160
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,333
Gotta work fast.

161
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,958
I need to hide her
weapons before she gets out.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,458
You. Pervert.

163
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,583
It's not how it looks!

164
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,791
I only want these! See!

165
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,083
You. Will. Diiiiieeeee!

166
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,583
Sweet peach buns, all mine.

167
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Damn.

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
This is pure torture.

169
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,375
I've gotta quit.

170
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,041
I can't take being
a Butei anymore.

171
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,916
This kind of life.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,958
It's the last thing I want.

173
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,208
C'mon, dumb ass!

174
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,500
Time to wake up!

175
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,666
What're you doing, you psycho?!

176
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,791
Get up and serve
me breakfast now!

177
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,916
Why, should, I?

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,583
Because I'm hungry!

179
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,541
Then starve to death!

180
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
Are you threatening my life?!

181
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,416
How dare you, Kinji!

182
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,250
I'm hungry, you idiot!

183
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Now feed me, feed me, feed me,
feed me, feed me, feed me!

184
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,750
Well, at least I'm starting to
get the hang of fending her off.

185
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,750
I can't believe you
don't have a single thing

186
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,208
to eat in your dorm room.

187
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,583
We should leave
at different times.

188
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,666
You go first.

189
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,750
Why's that?

190
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,000
So we don't get
caught leaving together.

191
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,791
This is the guy's dorm.

192
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,000
You're just trying to get
away from me, aren't you?

193
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,583
We're in the same class
and you sit next to me.

194
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,958
There's no escaping you.

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,458
No!

196
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,333
I'm not letting
you out of my sight!

197
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,208
You're my slave!

198
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,875
Let go, dammit!

199
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,625
Oww, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

200
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,750
Stop.

201
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,875
You're gonna make me
miss the 7:58 bus!

202
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,708
Am I gonna have to burn
you off me like a deer tick?

203
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,041
No no no no no no...

204
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,791
She actually smells.
Really nice.

205
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,791
Kinda sweet and sour.

206
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,291
Jeez.

207
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,375
Good afternoon.

208
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
My name is Mr. Sayonaki.

209
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,541
We'll be reviewing
Butei High's curriculum today

210
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,583
to help all you first
year students get acclimated

211
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,375
to your new surroundings.

212
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,416
We train students for
specific Butei disciplines

213
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,791
and in regular academics.

214
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,250
Your academic classes

215
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,208
will be a mix of students
from all disciplines.

216
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,625
The day is evenly split
between both areas.

217
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,708
The first four periods of
the day are always reserved

218
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,791
for your regular
high school classes.

219
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,750
The rest will be
with your department...

220
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,083
...where you will receive

221
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,541
rigorously specific
in-depth hands on training.

222
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,541
Assault focuses
on combat training.

223
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,166
In the Logi department,
it's vehicle training.

224
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,500
You get the idea.

225
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,875
You can also use this time
to focus on your Quests

226
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,958
that are contracted by private
citizens and companies.

227
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,416
There are many different
types of Quests,

228
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,333
such as undercover jobs,
bodyguard gigs, etcetera.

229
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,916
Remember, First Years
are only eligible for Quests

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,083
after completing basic training.

231
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,583
I guess taking on
a Quest isn't so bad.

232
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,791
It'll give me the chance
to get away from Aria.

233
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,791
She's in combat
training now, so--

234
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,041
Kinnnji.

235
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,708
Oh, come on.

236
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,833
What are you doing
out here, Aria?

237
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm tracking down my new slave!

238
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,541
But what about your training?

239
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,250
You're gonna get in trouble
for skipping combat class.

240
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,083
I've already completed enough of
my combat credits to graduate.

241
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,875
So what kind of daring
Quest have you set out upon?

242
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,291
It would just bore you.

243
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,083
It's an easy one tailored
for an E rank Butei.

244
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:17,958
Now get lost.

245
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,041
What?

246
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,666
You've gotta be
higher than an E rank.

247
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
I couldn't care less

248
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,583
about pointless
things like Butei ranks.

249
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,125
Well, I gotta agree
with you on that one.

250
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,000
I still wanna know
what your Quest is.

251
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,291
Give me one reason
why I should tell you.

252
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,583
I'll pump you full
of holes if you don't.

253
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,583
I'm looking for a lost cat.

254
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,750
No, seriously.

255
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not joking, it's
a missing cat Quest!

256
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
It's one tenth of a credit.

257
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,458
And the reward's barely
enough to buy me lunch.

258
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,000
I told you it was dull.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,666
Please quit following
me, five-head.

260
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,875
Five-head?

261
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,750
Yeah, it means you've
got a big forehead.

262
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,041
Now get lost.

263
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,625
There has to be something
fundamentally wrong

264
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,083
with you if you can't see the
elegant charms of my forehead.

265
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,458
Sure, that must be it.

266
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,875
Now leave me alone.

267
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,041
You don't like me much, do you?

268
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,291
I despise you.

269
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,791
Quit following me!

270
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,000
Tell me that again and I'm
gonna pump you full of holes!

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,916
So.

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,583
What strategy do
you have in mind?

273
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,791
How're you gonna
find this lost cat?

274
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,833
The usual way.

275
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll just do a thorough search

276
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,125
of the neighborhood
the cat's from.

277
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
If you're gonna follow me,

278
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,750
why don't you come
up with a strategy?

279
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,708
No, thanks.

280
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm not good with deduction.

281
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,291
That's the one important
trait I didn't inherit.

282
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,791
Where else?

283
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,541
Maybe the canal area?

284
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,208
I need some food.

285
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,541
What? How are you hungry?

286
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,458
Didn't you eat lunch?

287
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,666
I missed breakfast!

288
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,416
Now go buy me
something to eat okay?!

289
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
You are ridiculous.

290
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
You might wanna sit
on a separate bench

291
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,291
from me while we're
in this park, Aria.

292
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,041
And why is that?

293
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,791
Take a look around.

294
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,833
I told you.

295
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,916
Doesn't it make sense
for you to go home now?

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,541
If there's a guy you like,
he might get the wrong idea.

297
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
I don't like any guys!

298
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,375
Why the hell would
I do that to myself?!

299
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,375
Relationships are nothing
but a big waste of time!

300
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,250
They're just stupid!

301
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,458
Besides!

302
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,000
Why would I ever want
to have a boyfriend?

303
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,000
Talking about relationships
really gets under her skin...

304
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,500
Well, at least she
has one weakness.

305
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,083
Then I'm guessing
that you definitely

306
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,833
wouldn't want your friends to
get the wrong idea about you.

307
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,666
I don't have any friends
and I don't need them.

308
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,250
And people can say
whatever they want about me.

309
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,333
I couldn't care less
about what they think.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,208
Well. I do agree
with you about that.

311
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,583
But there's one thing
I don't agree with.

312
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,750
What's that?

313
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,458
That's my soda you're drinking.

314
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,291
You tricked me, you perv!

315
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,125
How the hell is this my fault?!

316
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,541
Wonder how long
she's been trapped here.

317
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,375
What's the plan?

318
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,000
How're ya gonna rescue her?

319
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,583
What's my plan?

320
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,416
I'm gonna reach out
and pick her up.

321
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,083
Huh?

322
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,458
Kitty, kitty.

323
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,166
You stay put now, okay?

324
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,875
I'm gonna take you
back to your nice home.

325
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,541
That's not a very good plan.

326
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,166
It's okay, kitty.

327
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,750
I'm not a bad guy.

328
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,375
There ya go.

329
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,791
Now wasn't that easy?

330
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,666
Ow that's my face!

331
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,166
Oh man, that is cold,
that is cold!

332
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,333
Ahh, my underwear
is soaking wet!

333
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,833
Bad plan.

334
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,958
Kinnnjiiiiiii!

335
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,166
Heyyy, Kinjiiii!

336
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,208
Not so loud, Riko.

337
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,041
Oh right, sorry.

338
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,958
I'm surprised they let
you modify your uniforms.

339
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,083
You like it?

340
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,875
This one is my
"white-Loli style".

341
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,041
I don't really care.

342
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,500
It took forever to
shake Aria off my tail.

343
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,500
Let's do this quickly.

344
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,583
Fine with me.

345
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,583
Wow, perfect!

346
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,375
"Black and White,"
"The Clover Story,"

347
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,000
and "Little Sister Goth"!

348
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,416
Those are the type
you like, right?

349
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,208
Yeah!

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,666
You can return
these if you want to.

351
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,666
I can already tell
that I won't like 'em.

352
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,958
Really, why not?

353
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,500
Aren't they the
same as the others?

354
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,500
No.

355
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,291
Sequels are always
disappointing.

356
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,750
They're an insult
to the original work.

357
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,708
Well, I'm not gonna
argue with you,

358
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,791
but this doesn't
change the deal we have.

359
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,000
What've ya got for me?

360
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,666
You wanted intel on Aria?

361
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,166
All yours.

362
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,625
You can always rely on an A-rank

363
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,833
from Inquesta to
get the job done.

364
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,208
You work fast, don't you?

365
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,583
Oooo. Roger!

366
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Hey, Kinji.

367
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,750
I've gotta ask.

368
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,958
Aria's got ya
pretty whipped, huh?

369
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,291
I mean, most people
would just ask

370
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,125
their girlfriend
about their past.

371
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,416
She's not my girlfriend.

372
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,625
Whaaat?

373
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,916
Don't give me that,
you're obviously dating.

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,291
Have you done it yet?

375
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,708
Done what yet?

376
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,625
Sexy stuff!

377
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,500
No, we're not dating!

378
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,041
You're such a terrible liar;

379
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,791
I know you two are
totally messing around!

380
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,166
Why do you always have
to steer our conversations

381
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,458
in that direction?

382
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,000
It's not a good habit.

383
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,166
Too bad.

384
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,291
Doom and Gloom Kinji
and Aria the Quadra,

385
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,875
you two would make a good pair.

386
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,791
Wait? What did
you just call her?

387
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,375
I guess you could say
it's an old nickname of hers.

388
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,541
She got it back when
she lived in Europe.

389
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,875
She's known for always using
two guns and two swords.

390
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,458
Add it up and what do you get?

391
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,500
Aria the Quadra.

392
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,666
Why am I not
surprised that she's here?

393
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
That makes sense.

394
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,291
I'd expect a streak of vanity
from someone of noble lineage.

395
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,541
You ran a background
check on me didn't you?

396
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,250
Aria H. Kanzaki.

397
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,208
Your mother is Japanese
while your father is British.

398
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,875
Your grandmother
earned the title of Dame

399
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,708
from the British Royal Family.

400
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,750
Which means you're
a noble. Right?

401
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,958
Not bad.

402
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,958
It was worth letting
you get away from me.

403
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
What else?

404
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,500
You were an agent for
the London Bureau of Butei

405
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,375
and you've been active in the
field since you were fourteen.

406
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,958
You already hold
the highest rank of "S."

407
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,000
And it's true that you never
let criminals get away from you.

408
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,708
Or at least the
last 99 in a row.

409
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,000
Well. You've actually dug deep.

410
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,041
Although. I let a criminal
get away the other day.

411
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
Only one I've ever let go.

412
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,833
Yeah? Who is this criminal?

413
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,791
It's you.

414
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,875
I am not a criminal
and I'd appreciate it

415
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,333
if you wouldn't call me one!

416
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,458
You totally assaulted
me the other day!

417
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,708
If that's not criminal activity,

418
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,625
then I don't know
what criminal activity is,

419
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,041
you perverted scum!

420
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,625
How many times do I have
to say that was an accident?!

421
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,041
A simple misunderstanding!

422
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,333
Shut up, shut up!

423
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,541
Go back to Assault!

424
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,958
You've already proven
how skilled you are

425
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,541
when you escaped from me!

426
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,083
No, I just caught a lucky break
or something, that's all.

427
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,166
I mean, I am only an E rank.

428
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,458
Only because you skipped out
on taking the finals last term.

429
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,500
You had an S rank
on the entrance exam!

430
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,291
What?

431
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,041
How do you know all that?

432
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,208
I know it wasn't
just a coincidence

433
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,500
that you managed
to escape so easily!

434
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,750
Admit it!

435
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,333
Yeah, fine, but I can't
just turn it on and off!

436
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,541
What do you mean?

437
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,791
Are there certain things
that you have to do

438
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,416
in order to turn it on?

439
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,958
Tell me what they are.

440
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,375
I can help out
if you need me to.

441
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,541
No. Fight it.

442
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,958
I... I don't wanna go
into hysteria mode.

443
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,625
I just, I just wanna
forget about all this.

444
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,666
That horrible mental state.

445
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,416
My life as a Butei.
But she won't let me.

446
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,041
Alright. One last time.

447
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,041
Huh?

448
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,583
You want me to go back
to Assault, then fine.

449
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,458
But I'll only team up
with you one time.

450
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,833
I'll help you out on the
first Quest that comes up,

451
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,416
and it'll be my last.

452
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,666
And I won't transfer.

453
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,375
I'll go to Assault
during my free class.

454
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,416
Those are my terms.

455
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,583
That's fine.

456
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,000
A single quest should
be more than enough

457
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,458
for me to get a feel
for your abilities.

458
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,083
It still counts even
if it's a small Quest.

459
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,333
As long as it still counts as
one no matter how huge it is.

460
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,750
Sounds fair to me.

461
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,166
And I'll pump you full of
holes if you cut corners.

462
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,500
Sure. I promise that I'll
give it everything I've got.

463
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,458
Everything I've got in
my normal mode, that is.

464
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,625
Promise.

465
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,708
Teaming up with Aria.

466
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,458
It's a one-time
only deal in order

467
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,833
to get rid of her for good.

468
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,708
Kinji!

469
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,000
Let's get started on our Quest!

470
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,833
I say we check that store first.

471
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,291
Wait, this is just an arcade.

472
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,416
Look how cute that lion is!

473
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,625
What, that stuffed animal?

474
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,875
No! His name is Leo-pon!

475
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,500
He's a ferocious king
of the jungle! Grrrr!

476
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,041
I'm just gonna try
my best to ignore you.

477
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,666
Next time, on Episode 3!

478
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,833
"First Mission"!

479
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,750
Watch it or I'll pump
you full of holes!
