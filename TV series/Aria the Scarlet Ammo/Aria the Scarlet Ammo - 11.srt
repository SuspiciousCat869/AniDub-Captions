1
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,083
Would you like another
cup of tea, Miss?

2
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,166
Yes, thank you.

3
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,791
It's so quiet today.

4
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,375
And look, everything
here is so beautiful.

5
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,208
It is, and don't the
flowers look happy.

6
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,208
You're silly, Aria.

7
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,541
And, cut!

8
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,250
That was a good one, Aria.

9
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,500
It only took a week of training
and now you're the perfect maid.

10
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,291
S-ranked Butei
are quick studies.

11
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,125
Oh shut up. You know why.

12
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,000
I'd never be doing this if
it weren't, for my mom's trial.

13
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,750
Now, now. Don't
be such a sour puss.

14
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, Kinji.

15
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,375
Don't you think Aria was
cute in that last scene.

16
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,208
Uhh, I don't think there's
anything right to say here.

17
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,583
Oh yeah? Spit it out, Kinji.

18
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,708
Well. How should I know? Really.

19
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,041
It's easy. Just tell me whether
you thought it was good or bad.

20
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,708
Answer quick, or I'll
pump you full of holes.

21
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,791
You know that's nuts, right?

22
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,166
This is all working out so well.

23
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,541
I can't wait for the real thing.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,083
Riko's late.

25
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,625
Well, I really
doubt she'd miss this

26
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,375
since the whole operation
is completely for her benefit.

27
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,666
I guess you're right.

28
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,250
I can't believe
we're going to stay

29
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,541
at Vlad the Bad's house for two
whole weeks; that's a long time.

30
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,416
When I got the approval
for this operation

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,416
they didn't even review
the docs I submitted.

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,791
They just said yes;
at least you'll be getting

33
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,833
some of the credits
you need for your class.

34
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,291
I wish I could get class
credit without risking my life.

35
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,250
Kinji! Aria!

36
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,916
Good morning.

37
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,375
Kana?

38
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,458
Thanks for waiting.

39
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,916
Don't tell me that's
Riko under there.

40
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,666
Vlad knows what I look like

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,208
so it's probably best
if I go in disguise.

42
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,083
Fine, but what made
you pick that face to use?

43
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,791
I thought you'd
feel more comfortable

44
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,083
if you had a
familiar face around,

45
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,166
and who better than Kana?

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,375
I'm not going waste time

47
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,125
letting your stupid
joke upset me. Let's go.

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait, Kinji.

49
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,291
What the heck am I missing?

50
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,000
What's so special about
that face she's using?

51
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,250
And who is this Kana person?

52
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,458
Stupid Kinji.

53
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,416
She was Vlad's
prisoner as a kid.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,958
So I guess I can
understand the disguise.

55
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,208
As you know.

56
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,833
Riko lost her parents
when she was a kid and,

57
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,083
well, she was then taken in

58
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,458
by someone claiming
to be her relative.

59
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,416
She was locked up.

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,750
Confined for years by herself.

61
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,875
Here Aria, try a bite.

62
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,125
Huh?

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,375
For someone with such
a terrible childhood,

64
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,583
she sure doesn't act like it.

65
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,375
Would you take a
look at this place?!

66
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,375
Are you sure we're
in Yokahama city?

67
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:08,833
Yes?

68
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,083
Good afternoon.

69
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,791
I'm with the temp
agency and I was told

70
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,000
to bring a couple of
housekeepers over here for you.

71
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,875
Ahh.

72
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,250
I've been expecting you.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,083
Yeah, so this is a
little unexpected, huh?

74
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,333
Yeah.

75
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,916
Our housekeeper is
only going to be gone

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,458
for two weeks so I told the
agency it didn't really matter

77
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,958
who they sent to me.

78
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,958
I didn't think
they'd send me some

79
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,875
of my own students, though.

80
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, that's quite a coincidence;

81
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,416
out of all the clients,
they end up

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,458
with one of their
teachers from school.

83
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,416
At least now we don't
have to introduce ourselves.

84
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,541
And with an S-ranked
Butei running the house,

85
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,875
I can get to my research in the
basement without any worries.

86
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,833
Yes and when the owner of
the house gets back in town,

87
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,875
you'll have a funny
story to tell him

88
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,500
about the temp maids we brought.

89
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, but I think he's overseas
for business at the moment.

90
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,291
He's not supposed to be
back for quite some time.

91
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,625
It sounds like he's busy person.

92
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,541
Actually, I don't know.

93
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,041
We've never met in person,
so I can't tell you much except

94
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,458
that he lets me use
his research facility.

95
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,083
So they just chat
online or something?

96
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,166
Well, I guess I better
get out of your way

97
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,041
and let you all get to work.

98
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,416
I expect you to do your best,
even though he is your teacher.

99
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,875
It kind of surprised
me to find out

100
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,958
that you lived in a
mansion, Mr. Sayonaki.

101
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,708
Yeah, I only wish it were mine.

102
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,083
The owner started out

103
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,458
by letting me use his
basement research facility.

104
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,333
And I was practically
living here anyway

105
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,916
so he ended up making
me the caretaker.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,666
This room will be yours Aria.

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,708
And you're across
the hall, Kinji.

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,250
This isn't school
so you're on your own.

109
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,250
There should be a uniform

110
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,416
that fits laid out
for you in your room.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,541
Make sure to read over the
note our housekeeper left you.

112
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,083
Oh yeah.

113
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,583
I'll be pretty swamped
with my research

114
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,416
so I probably won't
see you guys very much.

115
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,083
Just remember to let me
know when it's time to eat.

116
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,833
Okay, we put in some
time like normal help

117
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,333
until they start to
trust us around here.

118
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:25,250
Hey, Aria. It's time
for kitchen duty.

119
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:31,750
Aria, what are
you doing in there?

120
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,291
Well, I guess it's okay to dress

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,250
like a working girl
every once in a while.

122
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,750
I knocked on the door

123
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,208
and you didn't answer
so I let myself in.

124
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,875
What would you like me to
do for you, Master Kinji?

125
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,250
I'm good. Really.

126
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,291
I wouldn't mind not
getting killed if that's okay.

127
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,125
Try peeping on me again and
I'll pump you full of holes.

128
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,083
I don't really think
"the help" is supposed

129
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,541
to be playing pool in
the house where they work.

130
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,500
Don't worry.

131
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,333
He told me we could
play as much as we want

132
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,333
as long as we didn't
have any work to do.

133
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
Well. I guess that's cool.

134
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,750
Of course, we should get

135
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,333
to relax every once
in a while too, right?

136
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,750
Looks like you dropped this.

137
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,375
What?

138
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,875
You're a terrible artist.

139
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,791
I didn't draw that thing!

140
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,666
So, unless we attack these
eye patterns at the same time.

141
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,291
We can't defeat Vlad?

142
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,875
That's right.
And that's not all.

143
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,958
Apparently, we have to find
his hidden fourth eye, also.

144
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,541
Well, that's assuming we even
ever get the opportunity

145
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,791
to fight him at some point.

146
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,333
Right.

147
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,208
Uhh, hey.

148
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,500
I almost forgot.

149
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,208
She's scared to death
of thunder and lightning.

150
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,208
Hey, you're okay.

151
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,708
I'm right here with you.

152
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,333
Don't worry about it.

153
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,750
Okay, this is going to be our
regular conference call time

154
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,625
so I can stay on top of any
developments from you guys.

155
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,916
Yay!

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're a little
hyper, aren't you?

157
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,125
Uh-oh. I can't believe a
whole week has passed already.

158
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,750
How's everything going?

159
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,250
We'll start with Aria's report.

160
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,250
Do you have anything
you want to tell us?

161
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,500
Your rosary is being stored
in the safe in the basement,

162
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,416
just like you said.

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I saw it today

164
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,166
when I went down
there with Mr. Sayonaki.

165
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,541
It's a small,
blue rosary with a cross

166
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,750
that looks like a
pierced earring, right?

167
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,083
It was on a shelf.

168
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,458
Yeah, that's the one, Aria!

169
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,375
But Mr. Sayonaki's
research lab is down there,

170
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,416
so he almost never leaves.

171
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
It'd be a real pain
to break in there.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,291
That's exactly why
I sent you in as a team.

173
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
This job is too
tough to do alone.

174
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,541
I say we go with a
classic decoy diversion.

175
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,625
A decoy operation, huh?

176
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,500
Correct.

177
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,083
One of you will lure him out

178
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,708
and while he's gone the other
gets to sneak in to the safe.

179
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,875
It's called the Odd-Man play

180
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,791
and the set-up is
pretty straight forward.

181
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,125
Whoever can get closer to
the mark will take the lead

182
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,500
and develop the first...

183
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,125
Here's your grilled
Kobe Black on skewers.

184
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,500
On the side, we have
Yuzu chili peppers.

185
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,708
Wow, it looks really
delicious, again.

186
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,750
Bon appétit.

187
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,083
Thank you.

188
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,291
I don't get it.

189
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,291
It can't be healthy to only
eat extra rare meat everyday.

190
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,666
It's very unbalanced.

191
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,291
Hasn't he ever heard
of fruits or vegetables?

192
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,208
Grozav.

193
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,916
That's Romanian, right?

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,416
That's right.

195
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,416
I'm surprised
that you knew that.

196
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,625
So you're pretty good
with foreign languages,

197
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,833
like everything else.

198
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,708
I'm okay.

199
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,416
I worked as a Butei in Europe.

200
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,791
Can I ask why you
speak Romanian, sir?

201
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,625
The owner of this
house is Romanian,

202
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,125
so I learned in order
to communicate with him,

203
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,041
otherwise we'd never talk.

204
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,916
I'd be curious to know how
many languages you speak, Aria.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,375
I think seventeen or so.

206
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,916
Isn't that funny?

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,583
That's similar to the breed
of roses we have on the estate.

208
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,333
It's one of my hybrids
I'm most proud of.

209
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,958
I used seventeen
different varietals

210
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,916
to make it nearly perfect.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,416
I haven't been able to think
of a name for it till now.

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,750
Aria, that'll fit
it just perfectly.

213
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,125
I might never have figured out

214
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,625
what to call it if you
hadn't caught my Romanian.

215
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,500
Here's to you, Aria.

216
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,833
Okay, I really can't
believe we're in Yokohama.

217
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,666
Kinji, Riko.

218
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,916
This is bad,

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,541
I only got a quick look
while I was cleaning,

220
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,458
but it looks like our little
safe in the basement

221
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,625
is very heavily guarded.

222
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,458
The front is covered by state
of the art infrared sensors

223
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,833
and the floor is
pressure reactive.

224
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,125
Seriously?

225
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,166
Don't worry about
everything so much...

226
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,541
I've got a contingency
worked out for that...

227
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,458
I don't care how
heavily guarded it is.

228
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,541
That's my rosary
and nothing is going

229
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,166
to keep us from getting it back.

230
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,791
This'll be a piece of cake.

231
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,458
Okay, so which of you
thinks they've gotten

232
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,541
the best look inside his
brain and can lure him out?

233
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,625
I dunno.

234
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,541
Oh yeah, right Aria.

235
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,125
I think you might
have a little connection

236
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,666
since he named his
prize rose after you.

237
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,375
What do you mean?

238
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,541
It's not like we bonded.

239
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,833
He just named his
stupid flower after me.

240
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,458
I'd watch out if I were you.

241
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,791
He's the type of
guy who probably has

242
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,125
a string of girls
following him everywhere.

243
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,416
He doesn't really look
like that type of guy to me.

244
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,666
Something about
him is suspicious.

245
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
Aww.

246
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,916
Are you two having
a lovers' quarrel?

247
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,875
No we're not!

248
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,625
Anyway, I guess that decides it.

249
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,250
Aria will keep Sayonaki away

250
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
while Kinji hits
the basement safe.

251
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,708
Do you think you can do it?

252
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
I'll do my best.

253
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
He's pretty obsessed
with his research.

254
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,875
I don't know if I could keep him
away for more than ten minutes.

255
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,583
If you could stretch
it to fifteen minutes

256
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,041
that'd be plenty of time.

257
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,041
Maybe you could try flirting
with him or something.

258
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,625
I'd say flash your chest but
I'm not sure he'd even notice.

259
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,791
Hey, that's rude.

260
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,333
I'm gonna fill
you full of holes.

261
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,791
Oh, I'm so scared.

262
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,833
The mission is set for the
afternoon of your last day.

263
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,250
Kinji.

264
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,541
Yeah, what?

265
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,541
So what if I liked having
a rose named after me?

266
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,458
You know, you didn't have
to be such a jerk about it.

267
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,083
I wasn't being a jerk to you.

268
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,333
Yes, you were.

269
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,333
Why would you care
what I think anyway?

270
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,000
So, who's Kana?

271
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,625
You started acting so weird

272
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,250
when you thought you
saw her, not like yourself.

273
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,333
I don't know.

274
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,750
It kind seemed like,

275
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,083
she might have been an
old girlfriend or something.

276
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Listen.

277
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,375
I'm not going to say this again,
that's none of your business.

278
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,916
You're right.

279
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,333
I shouldn't have been
so pushy. I understand.

280
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,125
I mean everyone has something
they don't wanna talk about.

281
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry. I apologize.

282
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,083
Yeah.

283
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,833
Well I might've been a little
on the harsh side just then.

284
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,541
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,750
Don't worry about it.

286
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,500
I should go. Have a good night

287
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,791
Yeah, good night.

288
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,625
I'm honored.

289
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,083
What a considerate
idea to invite me

290
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,500
to see the rose with you.

291
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,125
It's very sweet.

292
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,541
You honored me.

293
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,500
Thank you.

294
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,916
It's my last day working here,

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
so I wanted to end
it with a good memory.

296
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,541
That's pretty smart.

297
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,500
I can't leave my
research for too long

298
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,166
so I can only stay for a bit.

299
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm just glad you said yes.

300
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
Can you hear me?

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,291
Com check.

302
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,583
The mole is headed
into the field now.

303
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,708
I read you loud and clear, plus,

304
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:58,666
did you know how much sexier
your voice sounds over the com?

305
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,875
I can't believe I dug all this.

306
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,708
Pretty good for two weeks.

307
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,291
They're beautiful, aren't they?

308
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,833
We keep only the perfect ones

309
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,583
and get rid of any that show
the imperfections we don't want.

310
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,916
After several generations
of work you end up

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,625
with superior blooms,
like these here.

312
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,375
It's worth it.
They're simply exquisite.

313
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,083
This is Kinji.
The mole is now a bat

314
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
Okay, that gives
you seven minutes.

315
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,208
Got it.

316
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,041
Are you receiving picture, Riko?

317
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,333
Yeah, perfect.

318
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,333
We can get started
on the rail operation.

319
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,166
First, connect
A1 to the Z1 wire.

320
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,958
Then connect B11, F23, A7,
and B15 twice in a row.

321
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:55,083
Then, C19, C15, A13, E12.

322
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,666
Roses are like
humans in that way.

323
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,750
A superior person is naturally
born into a superior family.

324
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,458
Wouldn't you agree Aria?

325
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,166
Uhh, of course.

326
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,541
Kinji, hurry up.

327
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,000
If I go too fast,
the rosary will start

328
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,916
to swing and touch
the infrared rays.

329
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,958
This has been a pleasant
break from the routine.

330
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry but I'm afraid I have
to get back to my research now.

331
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,750
But we just got here.

332
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,541
Aria, you have to stall
him for a little bit longer

333
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,583
or Kinji is going to get caught.

334
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,791
Got it.

335
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,958
Hold on. Mr. Sayonaki.

336
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,458
Yes?

337
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,250
I was just thinking, uhh,
isn't it a beautiful day today?

338
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,208
Actually it's rather cloudy.

339
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,875
Yeah... I guess you're right.

340
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,000
She's not going
to be able to do it.

341
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,000
What? Don't tell me
my line got cut off.

342
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,625
Aria, there's no other way.

343
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,250
You're going to have
to pull a honey trap.

344
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,541
He likes girls.
We have to use it.

345
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,208
Okay, I'll try.

346
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,583
I guess their
lines are still live.

347
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,041
I better hurry up.

348
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,708
Just throw yourself
into his arms

349
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,750
and see if he'll
start touching you.

350
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,125
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

351
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,833
She's really going to do it?

352
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,166
Before I do. Kinji?
Can you hear me?

353
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,041
What the hell?

354
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
You shouldn't be talking to me.

355
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,958
Sayonaki's distracted.

356
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,125
He's not paying
attention right now.

357
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,125
I have to tell you,
all this time.

358
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,291
You're the one I liked.

359
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,208
Do we really need to
be talking about this now?

360
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,125
Whatever he does to me today.

361
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,833
I'll let you do the
same to me later.

362
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,541
Whatever you want, I promise.

363
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,083
You what?

364
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,375
You can have me all
night long if you want.

365
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,333
We can skip school together.

366
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,041
I'll let you do
whatever you like.

367
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,875
Forever.

368
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,666
Now I get it,
this is Riko, right?

369
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,166
Poor stupid Kinji.

370
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,291
Since you figured it out,
you must be in Hysteria Mode.

371
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Yeah.

372
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,791
The interference from before
was you cutting the line

373
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,708
between Aria and me;
everything that happened

374
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,458
after that was just
more of your play acting.

375
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,583
You know, it's
really insulting that you

376
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,958
go into Hysteria Mode
so easily for Aria.

377
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,416
Bad girl.

378
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,583
You're gonna get a
spanking from me later.

379
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,208
Promises, promises.

380
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,458
I should be bad more often.

381
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,083
Sayonaki is coming your way.

382
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,083
You're out of time.

383
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,250
Can you make it?

384
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:32,166
Don't worry.

385
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,041
These past two weeks
you've done exceptional work.

386
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,208
You've both been very helpful.

387
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,083
Thank you.

388
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,333
Our pleasure.

389
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,583
We'll look forward to
seeing you at school.

390
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,125
Indeed.

391
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,833
By the way, try to take your
tests a little more seriously.

392
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,041
Okay, Kinji?

393
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,875
Yeah, sure.

394
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,250
This is the one
you wanted, right?

395
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,083
That is it!

396
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,000
It's my mother's rosary.

397
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,833
Riko.

398
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,125
I hate to interrupt
your celebration

399
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,000
to remind you of
the promise you made.

400
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,208
Oh silly you really don't
understand me at all, do you?

401
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,333
Well, Kinji?

402
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,708
Well, what?

403
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,833
Why don't you open your present?

404
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,458
It's a thank you gift but
you have to unwrap me first.

405
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,083
You're a bad girl, ya'know that?

406
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,250
What is wrong with you?

407
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,458
What do you think
you're doing, Riko?

408
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,708
I'm so sorry, you two.

409
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,375
But like Kinji said, I'm
really just a bad girl at heart.

410
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,916
As soon as I got this back
there was no more reason

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,458
to pretend since I now have all

412
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,875
the cards stacked in my favor.

413
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,916
Nothing is wasted
in my little scheme.

414
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,041
I use you two to
get my rosary back,

415
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,041
and then once you hand
it over, I destroy you both.

416
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,833
Give it your best shot Kinji.

417
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,166
After all, I gave you
something special.

418
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,791
Don't you think it's
ironic you're the first boy

419
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,750
I've ever kissed,
cause I'll be your last!

420
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,625
Hey, you look familiar,
what was your name again?

421
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,291
Boy, you sure know
how to hurt a guy.

422
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,791
It just slipped my memory!

423
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,291
It's on the tip of my tongue!

424
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:08,250
Yuji! No, Saito!
No, uhm... Uhm...

425
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,666
It's Ryuji.

426
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,750
That's right! Ryuji! Ryuji!

427
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,708
I knew it. I told you I knew it.

428
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,458
I was just playing
the whole time, right?

429
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,791
Aria, starting today,
I'm no longer your partner.

430
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,708
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo episode 12!

431
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:22,750
"Vlad."

432
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,375
I'll give you
some serious holes!
