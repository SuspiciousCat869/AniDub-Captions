1
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,416
Come with me, Shirayuki.

2
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,708
I'll take you to a place
more to your liking.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,791
To I-U.

4
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,125
Stop!

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,833
Kinji!

6
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,541
Get behind me! Move!

7
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,250
No! Stay back.

8
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,583
No, Kin! No! Stop it! Let go!

9
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,833
Damn you!

10
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,833
I wouldn't be worried
about her if I were you.

11
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,958
Not your best work, Kinji,

12
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,458
but your stupidity was the
perfect cover for a set-up.

13
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,375
Durandal, stop!

14
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,083
The kidnapping of
a minor is a serious crime!

15
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,958
You're under arrest.

16
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,708
I've studied up on
your tactics, Durandal.

17
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,750
When confronted by
multiple opponents,

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,666
you try to split them up to deal
with them one-on-one.

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,583
And that's why I bailed on being
Shirayuki's bodyguard.

20
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,500
It was just a trick
to lure you out.

21
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,458
But, Aria, I thought.

22
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,916
Butei Article 2.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,708
Honor your contract with
your client no matter what.

24
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,750
It'll be a cold day in hell
when I abandon a mission.

25
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,208
But. Don't think this means

26
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,125
that you didn't piss
me off the other day.

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,625
I suppose you think you've won.

28
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,958
What? Water?

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,375
Shirayukiiiii!

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,125
Shirayukiii!

31
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,000
Shirayuki!

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:35,875
Kin-Kin.

33
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,791
Please forgive me.

34
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,166
He told me he was going
to blow up Academy Island

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,083
and kill you if
I didn't meet him here.

36
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,083
And I just couldn't take
the risk of him hurting you.

37
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,625
When did he tell you that?

38
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,083
Last night, I got
an email from him

39
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,208
when you went out to
buy those sparklers for us.

40
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,625
I had to... I had
to do what he told me.

41
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,708
Stop crying it'll be okay.

42
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,583
I'm so sorry, Aria.

43
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,500
I was so mean but you
were just trying to help me.

44
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,583
Uh.

45
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,458
You should know
I'm only doing the job

46
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,333
that you hired me to do, okay?

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,125
I'm just trying
to catch Durandal.

48
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,583
So don't go gettin'
all teary-eyed on me.

49
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,208
Shirayuki.

50
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,750
Do you have any clue
where Durandal went?

51
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,208
Uh... I think.

52
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,916
Well, after he chained me up.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,208
I heard a noise from the ceiling

54
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,375
that sounded like some
kind of hatch opening.

55
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,333
Then he's upstairs somewhere.

56
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,875
Aria listen. You should go
on ahead and go after him.

57
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,000
Huh?

58
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,583
Riko gave me your
background dossier.

59
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,708
LookI know you can't swim.

60
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,125
Hey, I do just fine
with a pair of floaties!

61
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,541
My point exactly. Now get going!

62
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,083
I can't.

63
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,958
I'm not going to escape and
just leave you two here to die.

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,458
I didn't say escape.

65
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,125
I want you to go upstairs
and get the key from Durandal.

66
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,416
You've got a better chance of
getting it from him than I do.

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,791
But. But I--

68
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,666
Just do it!

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,625
We can't waste any more time!

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,958
Fine then.

71
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,458
Just hang on!

72
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,083
I'll be back with
the key in no time!

73
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,250
All this time and
I've only picked one lock.

74
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,791
This is the best I can do,
and it's not good enough.

75
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,916
I'll never make it.

76
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,666
Kin-Kin.

77
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,583
Just leave me.

78
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,875
You have to.

79
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,875
Because I can't let
you risk your life for me.

80
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,541
Don't be ridiculous!

81
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,708
Remember I'm a maiden
of the Hotogi Shrine.

82
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,875
We are maidens of protection

83
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,583
and we're supposed
to sacrifice ourselves

84
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,416
to save the life of another.

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,958
It's our fate.

86
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,125
What's wrong with you?!

87
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm not leaving without you!

88
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,208
It's okay.

89
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,958
It doesn't matter if I die.

90
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,375
Nobody will miss me.

91
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,250
I know my teachers are
constantly praising me but,

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,875
it could be anyone in my place.

93
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,458
They only like me because I'm
a maiden of the Hotogi Shrine.

94
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,250
That's all they care about.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,875
Aria's on her way
back with the key!

96
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,208
I'm not letting you give up!

97
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,375
Take calm, deep breaths!

98
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,333
I'm your bodyguard,
that's an order!

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
Then you're officially fired.

100
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,375
Kin-Kin. Live your life.

101
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,000
Shirayukiiiii!

102
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,708
I am not gonna let her die!

103
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,125
Thanks to hysteria mode.

104
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,458
I can practically see the
inner workings of the locks

105
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,416
just by the subtle
vibrations on my fingertips.

106
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,916
Kin-Kin.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,875
You said you don't want me
to be your bodyguard anymore,

108
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,083
well that's fine with me.

109
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,083
What?

110
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,750
I don't need to
be your bodyguard.

111
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,375
But I'll still protect you.

112
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,125
I'll protect you 'cuz
I care about you, Shirayuki.

113
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,500
That okay with you?

114
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,541
C'mon, hurry.

115
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,041
Shirayuki!
Where are you?! Shirayuki!

116
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
Shirayuki! Are you okay?

117
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm okay. I just
swallowed some water.

118
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,875
Hang on.

119
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
Kinji!

120
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,625
You're alright!

121
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,416
Hold on! Don't move!

122
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,541
Piano wire.

123
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
A twisted nano Kevlar
wire, to be exact.

124
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,916
Durandal strung it up.

125
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,666
I'm impressed you saw it.

126
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,041
It's the least
I could do for a girl

127
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,875
who worries so much about me.

128
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,166
I couldn't let a doll
like you get hurt.

129
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,500
Eh, Kinji.
Is possible that you have...?

130
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,125
Hm? What are you asking me?

131
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,833
Uh. Whatever.

132
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,875
We need to protect
Shirayuki. Let's go.

133
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,583
You do know where
she is, don't you?

134
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,375
She's right there.

135
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,500
Shirayuki. Are you alright?

136
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,375
I'm okay.

137
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,458
Thanks for saving me, Kin-Kin.

138
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,208
Something not right here.

139
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,083
Kin-Kin.

140
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:10,958
Is something wrong?

141
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,833
No. Of course not.

142
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,333
I didn't hurt your lips, did I?

143
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,291
From earlier?

144
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,250
What? Yeah, it's no big deal.

145
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,166
Aria! Get back!

146
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,708
Huh?

147
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,458
What the hell are
you doing, Kinji?!

148
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,916
What's going on?

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,708
Obviously. That's not Shirayuki.

150
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,333
Talk about a dead giveaway.

151
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,541
Shirayuki would've been
completely embarrassed

152
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,791
when I brought up the kiss.

153
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,583
Aria!

154
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,333
That's a pretty
good disguise, Durandal.

155
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,250
I'd rather you not call me that.

156
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,250
It's simply an alias
that was chosen for me.

157
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
Shut up!

158
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,875
You're the one who
should be stuck in prison

159
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,416
serving multiple life
sentences instead of my mom.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,041
I'll make you pay for all
the crimes you pinned on her.

161
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,375
Lupin the Fourth told me

162
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
that you have a habit of
running off at the mouth.

163
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,041
She was right.

164
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,541
Lupin the Fourth?

165
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,458
So she's connected to Riko.

166
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,166
I hate to say it, but you
remind me of my great ancestor.

167
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,083
She was quite beautiful
and disarmingly charming,

168
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,791
but her courage was boundless.

169
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,958
I'm sure you've heard of her,
the great Jeanne d'Arc?

170
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,541
That's a lie!

171
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,583
Jeanne d'Arc burned at the stake
when she was just a teenager!

172
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,250
There are no descendants!

173
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,458
Her double burned at the stake.

174
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,000
We're a family of tacticians.

175
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,250
We've hidden in the darkness
and manipulated history

176
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,291
and continued to
pass down our legacy.

177
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,875
Of her descendants,
I'm the thirtieth Jeanne d'Arc.

178
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,791
Now come with me, Aria.

179
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,375
Lupin the Fourth
might have failed

180
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,333
but I will take you with me.

181
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
Unless you'd prefer
that I kill you.

182
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,208
Stand down.

183
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,916
Make a move and I'll freeze her.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What're you doing,
shoot her already!

185
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,125
Looks like the only
way to shut you up

186
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,708
is by freezing
that tongue of yours.

187
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,916
Aria!

188
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,958
What?!

189
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,875
Hold it right there!

190
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm not going to let you
hurt my friends, Durandal!

191
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,666
Hold it right there!

192
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,875
I'm not going to let you
hurt my friends, Durandal!

193
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,250
Shirayuki!

194
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,583
Kin-Kin. Aria.
Sorry it took me so long.

195
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,083
It was perfect timing.

196
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,625
I knew you'd come through.

197
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,333
Well, Durandal.

198
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,333
It's three against one now.

199
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,875
Looks like you're screwed.

200
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,791
It's a little insulting how
much you underestimate me.

201
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,541
This was nothing
but a dress rehearsal.

202
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,666
Drop the pompous crap!

203
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
Why don't you quit hiding?!

204
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,166
Aria, give me your hands.

205
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,083
This might sting a little bit.

206
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,916
They should be alright now.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,791
Yeah, they are. Thank you.

208
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,833
Of course.

209
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,666
But the ice got deep
into your hands.

210
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,666
Even though they should
be completely healed,

211
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,791
it still might take awhile
before they're back to normal.

212
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,958
So then.

213
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,583
I want you to hang
back and protect Aria.

214
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,375
I can take down
Durandal by myself.

215
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,125
I don't know, Shirayuki.

216
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,791
I'll be perfectly fine.

217
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,708
Trust me on this, Kin-Kin.

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,166
Trust you, huh?

219
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,041
How utterly touching.

220
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,958
Touching but foolish.

221
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,125
I know I wouldn't want to
fight me without a partner.

222
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,166
Please Jeanne. Just quit.

223
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,500
The last thing I want
is to hurt anyone.

224
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,958
So please don't
make me hurt you.

225
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,375
Such confidence.

226
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,750
You're nothing but a
helpless little girl.

227
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,375
It's just silly to
think you can hurt me.

228
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,666
I've been trained by I-U.

229
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,125
And on top of that.

230
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,125
You can't betray your shrine.

231
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,416
You're a maiden of
protection, Shirayuki.

232
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,750
You're not a killer.

233
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,833
Normally you would be
correct in thinking that.

234
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,250
But right now,
you're dead wrong.

235
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,541
There are some people
in my life I'd do anything

236
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,250
to protect including
breaking my oath to the shrine.

237
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh yeah?

238
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Kin-Kin. Please don't look
at me from here on out.

239
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,541
I have no choice
but to use a technique

240
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,916
that's forbidden
by the Hotogi Shrine.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,958
But it's a terrifying
thing to see.

242
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,333
I can't stand the
idea of scaring you.

243
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,666
So please don't look.

244
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,875
You'll hate me if you do.

245
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,958
But Shirayuki.

246
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,375
Shirayuki.

247
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,375
Listen to me.

248
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,208
I don't care how
terrifying it is.

249
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,583
Nothing in this world
could make me hate you.

250
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,416
That's just not possible.

251
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,375
Sit tight; I'll be right back.

252
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,250
Alright, Jeanne.

253
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,375
If you really want a fight,

254
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,041
then I'll just have
to give it to you.

255
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,333
Now a Maiden of Hotogi Shrine

256
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,333
will use her hidden power,
the forbidden kidou.

257
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,583
This power has been passed
down through generations

258
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,791
of the Hotogi.

259
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,708
Passed down for
two thousand years.

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,125
A flame?

261
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,833
Shirayuki is just a
pseudonym I was given

262
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
to hide my true identity.

263
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,625
To conceal the fact that
I'm the scarlet maiden

264
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,333
of the Hotogi Shrine.

265
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,625
My true name is Himiko!

266
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,458
Fighting back is pointless.

267
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,625
There's not a thing

268
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,250
on this planet my
sword can't cut through!

269
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,625
How funny; that's my line!

270
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,208
There's no metal on earth

271
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,500
that can stop the
holy sword Durandal!

272
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,875
Shirayuki.

273
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,750
Hey Kinji.

274
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,875
My hands are back to normal now.

275
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,958
Let's jump in there
and help Shirayuki.

276
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,250
I doubt this fight is
going to last very long.

277
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,000
I know. Stealth's can
only use so much power.

278
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,833
It consumes too much
of their strength.

279
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,083
Right. They're gonna
run out of energy soon.

280
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,583
And when they do, that
will be our chance to attack.

281
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,333
I hope you can trust me.

282
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,625
I'm pouring my heart out
and you still don't trust me.

283
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,083
Why won't you
listen to me, Kinji?

284
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,958
I was an idiot to
not believe you.

285
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,500
Can you forgive me?

286
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,125
I swear I'll never doubt you
again for the rest of my life.

287
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,375
That's a long time!

288
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
I don't care if
I'm the only person

289
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,916
in the entire world
that believes you.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,208
No matter what,
I'll always be on your side.

291
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,000
Can I ask you to
trust in me, too, Aria?

292
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,083
Uh, yeah.

293
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:27,958
Okay then.

294
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,291
Now, let's get ready to strike.

295
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,750
Drop the sword, Jeanne.

296
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,958
You know you don't
have a chance.

297
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,458
You're too soft to win.

298
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,708
You've been aiming at my sword

299
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,833
this whole time instead
of my body, you fool.

300
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,291
Not yet, Kinji.

301
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,833
Shirayuki's probably saving
her power for one last attack.

302
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,875
Count to three after I move in.

303
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,291
Right.

304
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,375
Well Shirayuki. Let's end this.

305
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,583
It's time for you to fall, and
break into a million pieces!

306
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,625
Go time!

307
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,416
What can you do to me, Butei!

308
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,166
Drop your weapon!

309
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,833
Now. It'd be wise to cooperate.

310
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,666
There's no point in
getting yourself hurt.

311
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,166
We've got you.

312
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,541
No you don't.

313
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,791
Butei Law Article 9
prohibits Butei from killing.

314
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,916
But that doesn't apply to me!

315
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,250
Hotogi Souten Style!

316
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,208
Hihino Hotogi Kami!

317
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,166
Durandal.

318
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,208
You destroyed it.

319
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,541
You're under arrest, Durandal.

320
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,500
Heyyy.

321
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,333
You alright?

322
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,416
Kin-Kin.

323
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,166
I must've looked awful.

324
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,708
I'm sorry if I... scared you.

325
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,208
You weren't awful,
that flame you conjured

326
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,708
was just beautiful.

327
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,666
It reminded me of the
fireworks we snuck out

328
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,166
and saw when we were kids.

329
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,875
Kin-Kin.

330
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,333
Just don't go and
disappear anymore

331
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,916
without telling me
where you're going.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,375
Okay.

333
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,333
Ladies and gentlemen.

334
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,333
We'll now begin the closing
ceremony for the fifth Adosiade,

335
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,875
the international
Butei competition.

336
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,916
Jeanne was taken into custody
by the Masters afterwards.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,541
And I got a brief moment
of peace and quiet.

338
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,375
Whoa!

339
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,666
Shirayuki!

340
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,833
Go, go, let's go!
Let's go, team Butei!

341
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,416
This is not the time
for hysteria mode.

342
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,708
One of the girls from
the cheer team backed out.

343
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,625
So I persuaded Shirayuki
to pitch in and cover.

344
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,583
I told her it was her
duty as student president.

345
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,958
Good argument.

346
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,125
Wellll, we wouldn't've
had a closing ceremony

347
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,500
without her help.

348
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,208
Thank you so much, Shirayuki.

349
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,416
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Uhh.

350
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,250
Before this goes any
further I've got something

351
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,083
that's been weighing on
me that I need to tell you.

352
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,625
Actually. Both of you.

353
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,791
Hm? What is it?

354
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,791
When you were sick.

355
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,791
Remember that day I came over.

356
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,625
I kind of lied to
you about something.

357
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,958
You did?

358
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
You remember how you
thanked me for the medicine?

359
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,875
Well, I wasn't actually
the one who replaced it...

360
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,833
You were the one who
bought it, weren't you, Aria?

361
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,041
What?

362
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,458
It really was you, wasn't it?

363
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,541
Well, uh.

364
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,166
Yeah, about that.

365
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm a terrible person, aren't I?

366
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,291
But I-I don't want to be
seen as a terrible person.

367
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,208
I'm so sorry!

368
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:34,958
It's cool.

369
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,083
No big deal.

370
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,958
Let's just forget about it.

371
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,708
We've got more
important issues at hand.

372
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,250
Such as you joining
the ranks of my slaves!

373
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,416
Huh?

374
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,250
You've changed my perspective.

375
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,500
I always believed that
all I needed to take down

376
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,125
an opponent was myself,
and a good partner.

377
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,458
But the only way we
were able to defeat Durandal

378
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,625
was by all three of
us working together.

379
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,625
So what do you say?

380
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,125
Will you become my--

381
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,916
What I mean is, be my friend!

382
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,750
Wow. Aria wants a friend?

383
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,708
But, uh... You said slave.

384
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,583
Kin-Kin's the only
slave master I want.

385
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,208
Alright. Here.
I'm giving you this.

386
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,791
It's a spare key
to Kinji's dorm.

387
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,791
Huh?

388
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,750
Wow! Thank you, Aria!

389
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,375
My own key!
This is proof you love me!

390
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,916
Whoa, hey now.

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,041
One rule though!

392
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,041
Whatever I walked
in on the other day.

393
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:32,208
Uh, y'know. There's no
naughty stuff allowed!

394
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,708
Especially between two slaves.

395
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,166
That's your game.

396
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,875
Trying to keep us apart, huh?

397
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:38,958
What?

398
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,833
Well I've got
somethin' to tell you.

399
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,833
You aren't the only one.
No, not anymore.

400
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,958
I made out with Kin-Kin, too!

401
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,458
Whoa! What the hell?!

402
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,375
We're tied right now!

403
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,541
But trust me! Not for long!

404
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,875
I'll gain the lead in no
time now that I have a key!

405
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,958
Kin-jiii!

406
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,500
You kissed your client,
you dirtbag?!

407
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,541
You're a horrible Butei!

408
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,708
Hey! I had a reason!

409
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,166
Whoa! Don't shoot!

410
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,791
Freaking stupid,
worthless Kinjiiiii!

411
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,375
Well, we settled that matter.

412
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,916
But Durandal was persistent.

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,583
Shirayuki's persistent too.

414
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,083
She blows up so easily.

415
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,416
And it was tough.

416
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,125
I've never fought an enemy
with ice powers before.

417
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,041
And ice is cold, which
makes me think of Shirayuki.

418
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,083
Which is weird,
since she uses flames.

419
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,375
I guess we'll have all
types of enemies in the future.

420
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,000
Y'know what's gonna
make the future tough?

421
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,041
Shirayuki. Man, I hate her!

422
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,791
You know you like her.

423
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,041
Next time on
Aria the Scarlet Ammo!

424
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,083
"Honey Trap."

425
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,333
Honey for scones
and holes for Kinji!
