1
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,833
After all, I gave
you something special.

2
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,750
Don't you think it's ironic
you're the first boy

3
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,916
I've ever kissed,
cause I'll be your last!

4
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,458
Tell me one thing before
I pump you full of holes.

5
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,000
Why were you so hell bent on
getting that rosary back?

6
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,291
It's more than a keepsake
of your mom's, isn't it?

7
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,041
Aria.

8
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,250
Have you ever been held
captive in a small cell,

9
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,208
living off nothing but
rotten meat and muddy water?

10
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,750
I refuse to go back
to that existence!

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,583
I'm more than just
a genetic receptacle!

12
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,416
I am Riko! Riko Mine Lupin!

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm not some machine for
giving birth to the Fifth!

14
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,458
To answer your question,

15
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,458
it's not just an
ordinary rosary.

16
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,000
It's actually the
Lupin's secret treasure.

17
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,083
And my mother
passed it down to me.

18
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,750
When I was locked in
the cell all those years.

19
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,166
I kept it hidden in my mouth

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,125
so they could never find
it and take it from me.

21
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:44,166
And that's how I discovered,
that this rosary.

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,916
It's metal endowed
me with powers

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,666
that I wasn't even aware of.

24
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,041
And I used them
to escape that cell.

25
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,500
Now let's settle this, Holmes.

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,875
After I defeat the two
of you. It'll be over.

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,958
I'll have proven my superiority!

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,875
Surpassing the first!
And I'll be free!

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,333
Mr. Sayonaki? What the hell?

30
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,666
It'd behoove you to stay still.

31
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,791
They will attack if
you make any wrong moves.

32
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,041
So let's try to
keep this pleasant.

33
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,541
They're Caucasian Silver Wolves.

34
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,875
The same type as
the wolf Reki tamed.

35
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,041
That's right.

36
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,958
At one time, he was
my dutiful servant.

37
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,375
I was a little surprised at
how quickly she mastered him.

38
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,041
I really should have
collected her blood.

39
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,291
Even if it had to be by force.

40
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,083
Collected her blood?

41
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,208
Compared to Reki's skills.

42
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,000
Lupin the Fourth.

43
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,500
You're just as
worthless as always.

44
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,125
All this time that
we've spent together

45
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,333
and you still don't
remember the fact

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,125
that we'd already
met ten years ago.

47
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,041
You just stay put.

48
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,625
I'm only drawing
a little bit of blood.

49
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,625
Actually, I'm checking
your genes to be exact.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,708
Now I remember you.

51
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,375
You were the one who told Vlad.

52
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,333
That was you, wasn't it?

53
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,291
It was. I just realized.

54
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,916
Your friends don't even know
what we're talking about.

55
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,000
The results of my tests showed

56
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,916
that even though
Riko here is a Lupin--

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,125
No, don't tell them!

58
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,833
Not a single one of
their genetic talents

59
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,791
were passed down to her.

60
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,291
In other words.

61
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,458
She is a perfectly useless
fluke in their family's history.

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,541
But you are quite skilled at
proving how useless you are.

63
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,166
Aren't you, Number Four?

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,916
It's outright laughable
that you tried

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,833
to steal this rosary
with such a childish plan.

66
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,208
It must make you sad
to be so incompetent.

67
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,333
Human abilities are
predicated on their genes.

68
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,875
Your genetic makeup
draws the line

69
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,875
between what you
can and cannot do,

70
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,958
no matter how
hard you might try.

71
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,208
To give you an example,
just try to stop me!

72
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
Why don't you go ahead

73
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,125
and swallow this junk
so you won't lose it again.

74
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,083
And you thought your
plan went well, didn't you?

75
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,166
I made it as easy as I could
for you to steal it back.

76
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,208
I knew your despair
would be even greater

77
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,125
if you thought you won.

78
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,666
Ohhh, listen to that!

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,041
There's nothing more ambrosial

80
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,458
than the sound
of pain and despair!

81
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,791
Alright, cut it out already!

82
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,416
There's no point in
torturing her anymore!

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,833
There's actually a
very specific point.

84
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,125
It's necessary for
Vlad's summoning.

85
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,625
Vlad?

86
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,375
Pain.

87
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,708
And despair.

88
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,250
He appears when he
hears a song of agony.

89
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,250
Please.

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,708
Now it's building towards
something beautiful.

91
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,916
This can't be real.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,041
Don't tell me you're Vlad.

93
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,875
Well, no, it's not
quite that simple.

94
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm nothing more than
an outer shell created

95
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,458
from the many genes
Vlad has collected.

96
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,583
I'm an organic effigy
designed to mimic humans.

97
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:55,291
Get ready. Here
he comes. It's time.

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,666
Just what the hell is he?!

99
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,916
He's Vlad, that's what he is.

100
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,208
Get ready to cover me, Kinji!

101
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,375
I'm only gonna paralyze them.

102
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,166
Not to outright
steal Reki's trick.

103
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,041
Vlad!

104
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,250
You framed my mom
for your crimes

105
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,291
and now she's stuck
rotting away in prison.

106
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,583
I'm gonna make your hairy ass
confess to it on the stand!

107
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,083
The bullets.

108
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,666
The wounds have
completely healed, too!

109
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,041
Do you think you can arrest me?

110
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,416
Huh?

111
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,916
Delusions of grandeur
are clearly a genetic trait

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,583
of your family, little Holmes.

113
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,125
I'm dead serious, jerk!

114
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,750
You have such boundless spirit.

115
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,875
It's downright precious.

116
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,541
You've convinced me that your
blood is worthy of sampling.

117
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,333
I suppose I'll just have
to snap your head back

118
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,500
and sink my fangs
deep into your neck.

119
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,125
Oh, yeah. It all makes sense.

120
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,458
Vlad. I know your
true identity now!

121
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,375
You're Dracula, aren't you?

122
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,083
Wait, Dracula?!

123
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,875
The vampire?

124
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,166
Good guess, Holmes.

125
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,708
I am Ogre Vampies.

126
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,375
I've been consuming human blood

127
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,125
and assimilating the genes
into my own constant evolution.

128
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,000
My body and mind
have achieved powers

129
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,083
far beyond your
puny comprehension.

130
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,166
My defenses have
made me impervious

131
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,500
to guns and garlic
and even sunlight.

132
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,625
You've attempted to
harness each one against me

133
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,291
and failed every time.

134
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,833
Haven't you, Lupin the Fourth?

135
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,000
It's been so long since
we've seen each other

136
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,416
and you can't even
give me a smile?

137
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Vlad. You promised.

138
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,875
You said that
you'd let me go free.

139
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,708
As long as I was
able to defeat Holmes.

140
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,458
And I had her right in my palm.

141
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,500
Would you feel the need to keep
a promise you made to a dog?

142
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
Forget all about it

143
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,041
and go back to
your cage, you bitch.

144
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,208
You may be worthless

145
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,458
but you still hail
from a superior breed.

146
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,916
If I find the
right mate for you,

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,875
you might yet spawn
an improved Lupin Five.

148
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,750
Take a good look.

149
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,875
This is the very last time

150
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,125
you'll see the world
outside your cell.

151
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,125
Soak it up and store it deep
inside that puny brain of yours.

152
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,041
Aria. Kinji.

153
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,166
Why won't you help me? Please?

154
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,083
What took you so long to ask?

155
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,666
Kinji!

156
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,125
Right!

157
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,041
Obnoxious brat.

158
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
Looks like you want
me to teach you

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,583
a lesson on how to play rough.

160
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,833
You're calling me a brat?!

161
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,541
I'm sixteen years old, dammit!

162
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,958
You're getting dangerously
close to pissing me off.

163
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,958
I love to see the look
on the arrogant ones faces

164
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,750
when I pop their skulls between
my thumb and forefinger.

165
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,958
Alright, you're safe here.

166
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,250
Listen to me.

167
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,416
The only chance Aria
has is to surrender.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,750
Vlad is too strong.
She'll never make it.

169
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,458
We can't defeat him.

170
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:27,041
It's impossible.
Trust me. We can't.

171
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,041
Many others have
tried in the past.

172
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,750
The past gets
rewritten everyday, Riko.

173
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,833
See, things are
getting better already.

174
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,166
I snagged it when I rescued you.

175
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,208
Riko. You're too
hurt to fight anymore.

176
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,458
Just stay here. Aria
and I can handle it.

177
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,625
Kinji.

178
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,708
Y'know what?

179
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,708
With you and Aria
fighting together,

180
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,750
it just might be possible.

181
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,208
I'll stay, but I can help.

182
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,125
I know where his fourth
weak spot's located.

183
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,583
Aim your gun, at the
middle of his chest.

184
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,375
Aria!

185
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,625
Nothing's working.

186
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,375
I've shot each of those
patterns a dozen times,

187
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,750
but the wounds just
keep on closing up.

188
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,166
It's gonna work this time, Aria.

189
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,208
How, we don't
know the fourth spot!

190
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,666
Yes we do. Riko told me.

191
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,333
It's the center of his chest.

192
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,333
I'll shoot there
and his left shoulder.

193
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,416
You cover the
spots on his right side.

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,666
If you say so.

195
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,791
Alright.

196
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,833
I'll count it down.
Five. Four. Three.

197
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,791
Two. One!

198
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,500
Is he dying?

199
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,333
You stupid children.

200
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,666
Did you really think

201
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,625
that girl could figure
out my final vital point?!

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,750
No. No!

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,166
So. Was that the only
strategy you two had?

204
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,041
Well then. Let me show
you an effective plan.

205
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,166
I've never heard of
Dracula howling before!

206
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,708
Wait. What the hell?

207
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,083
He neutralized my hysteria mode.

208
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,583
Crap! What do I do?

209
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,208
I'm clueless. I'm too normal!

210
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,708
What's wrong with you?!

211
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,416
Kinji!

212
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,500
Riko?

213
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,875
Riko?

214
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,000
I can't believe you saved me!

215
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,666
Let's just keep going, Kinji.

216
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,166
We can't defeat him,

217
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,208
so what's the point in
us going back there?

218
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:11,916
Let's run.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,333
And just leave Aria?

220
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,166
Once she realizes
that you've run,

221
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm sure she'll
do the same thing.

222
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,958
You know that
she's not like that.

223
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,291
I'm not leaving without her.

224
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,416
She and I are partners, dammit!

225
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,083
But what about Vlad?!

226
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,458
Make him pay!

227
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,541
Are you gonna let him go
after what he's done to you?

228
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,083
Your name is Riko, isn't it?

229
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,166
Aren't you more than
just the number four?!

230
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,666
Help me, Kinji.

231
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,666
I need you to call out my name.

232
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,791
Riko.

233
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,791
Please, say it again.

234
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,958
Riko.

235
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,041
One more time!

236
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,666
Rikooooo!

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,041
You're right.

238
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,583
My name is Riko. It's Riko Mine!

239
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
I hope you're ready, Kinji.

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,666
I am.

241
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,583
Hey. Do you have a gun?

242
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,916
Yeah. I do.

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,291
But it's got one round.

244
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,375
First things first.

245
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,083
We rescue Aria.

246
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,708
If the idea I had
earlier is correct,

247
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,208
then we've got a chance!

248
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,500
Kinji?! You're alive!

249
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,041
You smell delicious
after you sweat!

250
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,041
Do you really think this
is the time to perv out?

251
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,250
It's the perfect time!

252
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,250
We've gotta give Kinji
some extra incentive

253
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,583
to come up with a solid plan!

254
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,791
No. Okay!

255
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,208
What are you doing? Stop!

256
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,666
Now the finishing touch.

257
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,541
Get off of me,
you freaky pervert!

258
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,833
On your feet, right now!

259
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,666
So, Kinji?
Did Aria do it for you?

260
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,750
What?

261
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,958
Yep.

262
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,750
You know me
too well, Riko.

263
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,083
Aria, you're not out
of bullets, are you?

264
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,125
What? No.

265
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,833
There's one in each chamber.

266
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,291
And I've also got one left.

267
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,083
And Riko's got one,
so when you add

268
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,750
them all up we've
got four total.

269
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,291
Let's take another crack
at Vlad's weak spots.

270
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,791
Why? Did you figure
out the last spot?

271
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,791
Aria, I want you to shoot his
left shoulder and his chest.

272
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,416
His chest? We tried that!

273
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,708
Butei Charter Article 1.

274
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,666
"Trust your friends.
Help when they need it."

275
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,791
Aria. I need you to trust me.

276
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:27,250
I can do that. Let's do it.

277
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,666
Shoot the right shoulder, Riko.

278
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,791
I'll cover his right flank.

279
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,333
I'm on it.

280
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,916
You just don't
know when to give up.

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,791
Couldn't you at least
try to be good at losing?

282
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:48,666
In five. Four. Three. Two. One!

283
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,458
Wasting your bullets again, huh?

284
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,208
He'll simply block
his last weak spot

285
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,791
if I outright aim
for it. Although.

286
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,208
If he sees me aiming
at a different spot.

287
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,208
No! I can't die!

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,875
We killed him?

289
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:33,625
We did.

290
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,958
I'm confused, though.

291
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,166
How did you know where
his fourth weak spot was?

292
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,125
Tell me.

293
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,791
I remembered something.

294
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,416
That first time we shot him?

295
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
He blocked his
mouth with his arm.

296
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,291
But it didn't exactly
make sense for him

297
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,125
to do that if he's got
the power to eternally heal.

298
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,583
Unless he's blocking
his weak spot.

299
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,125
That's how you knew?

300
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,083
How d'you feel, Riko?

301
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,750
The three of us were able to
defeat the undefeatable Vlad.

302
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,625
We did it by working together.

303
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,333
Not even the first
Lupin could defeat him.

304
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,666
Good point.

305
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,333
I guess this means
you've officially

306
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,500
exceeded the first Lupin.

307
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,541
But don't expect
me to thank you.

308
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,625
Alright, Holmes?

309
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,125
Our personal interests just
happened to intersect this time.

310
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,833
This doesn't change
the fact that the Holmes's

311
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,041
and Lupins are age old enemies.

312
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,125
Yeah, calm down.

313
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,333
I don't wanna be
your friend either.

314
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,625
But, you are still gonna testify
at my mom's trial.

315
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,666
And if you even
think of backing out.

316
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,333
Aria Holmes Kanzaki,
and Kinji Tohyama.

317
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,416
You've proven yourselves.

318
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,458
I'm through looking down on you.

319
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,500
You're obviously my equals.

320
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,291
And so, I will keep my promise.

321
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,541
Just remember, I'm the only
one that gets to defeat you.

322
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,458
Au revoir!

323
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,791
Riko!

324
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,291
And there she goes.

325
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,250
With everything she wanted.

326
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,041
It won't be long
before she turns up again.

327
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,333
Probably acting like
nothing happened.

328
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,875
I'd love these in a
green if you have 'em.

329
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,291
Oh, and a red and blue.

330
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,333
Jeez.

331
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,625
She needs some girl friends

332
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,625
so I don't have to go
shopping with her.

333
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,791
Kana?

334
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,666
No. I'm seein' things.

335
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,750
Kinji, Kinji!

336
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,083
Hey, Kinnnji!

337
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
My mother's attorney
just called me!

338
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,750
Riko just came by to
tell her that she'll testify!

339
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,458
Oh, yeah? That's great, Aria.

340
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,458
This means my mom's
definitely gonna get a retrial!

341
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,625
I bet she's so
relieved right now!

342
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, she must be.
Oh, hey, Aria.

343
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,041
I think you dropped
these when you hugged me.

344
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,000
What are these things?

345
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,541
You worthless pervert!

346
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,125
What?! Hold on, Aria!

347
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,250
You're such a perverted idiot!

348
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,666
Stupid, stupid!

349
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,041
Pervert, pervert!
Stuuuupid! Pervert!
