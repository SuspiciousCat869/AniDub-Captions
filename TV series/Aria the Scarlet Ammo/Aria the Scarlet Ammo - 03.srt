1
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,083
What's the matter?

2
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,708
Why do you look so serious?

3
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,375
You're auditing
the Assault class?

4
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,833
I'm teaming up with Aria.

5
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,625
But, it's only for one case.

6
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,000
No big deal.

7
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,708
Oh, yeah.

8
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,708
You like going to
the arcade, right, Kinji?

9
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,791
Someone gave me a coupon
for free game tokens,

10
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,208
so I'll give it to you.

11
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,333
Here you go.

12
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,166
It's only good through
today, but I'm not going.

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,416
Uhh, okay.

14
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,041
Gold, huh?

15
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,833
Underwear sure does
come in a lot of colors.

16
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,916
Kinji! I always knew
you'd come back to Assault!

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,208
No, It's just a visit.

18
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,250
Is that Kinji?

19
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,666
Well, it's about time,
you slacker!

20
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,166
I told ya' you'd
be crazy to quit.

21
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,958
All right.

22
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,208
The entertainment is here!

23
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,500
I didn't come back here
to entertain you jerks.

24
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,708
Hey dude.

25
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,833
You finally decided
to come back and play

26
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,083
with the big boys, huh?

27
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,875
You know you don't
belong anywhere else.

28
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,333
Don't worry, we enjoy having
a dork like you around.

29
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,833
We'll be friends
with almost anyone.

30
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,250
I won't be your
token dork friend.

31
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,750
Why did I decide to
come back to this place?

32
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,083
Kinji.

33
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,375
Aria.

34
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,750
Well then, see you later, Kinji.

35
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,208
Huh?

36
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,875
You're pretty popular,
aren't you?

37
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,500
I don't wanna be popular
with guys like that.

38
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,458
At this school, no one
comes anywhere close to me.

39
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,000
My abilities are so advanced
that no one can keep up with me.

40
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,708
I see.

41
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,333
So you're a solo act
just like your name, huh?

42
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,666
I'm surprised you even
know what "Aria" means.

43
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,291
But you are correct.

44
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,500
An aria is a piece in an opera
sung by a single person.

45
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,750
So, by taking on a
slave are you trying

46
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,000
to sing a duet with me now?

47
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,125
You're just full of
surprises, aren't you?

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,458
What's so funny?

49
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,083
I don't get you at all.

50
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,875
Til now, every time
you've opened your mouth,

51
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,333
it's been nothing
but gripe, gripe, gripe.

52
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,208
Turns out, you can be
charming when you wanna be.

53
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
Whatever.

54
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,041
Kinji?

55
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,416
Just go home without me.

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm gonna stop by the arcade.

57
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:20,750
An arcade?

58
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,791
What's that?

59
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,875
It's a place with video games.

60
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,708
Everybody knows that.

61
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't help it that my
parents raised me overseas.

62
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,583
Okay.

63
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll make an exception and play
with you today, my little gift.

64
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,375
"Little punishment"
is more like it.

65
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,000
Stop following me.

66
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:45,833
No way!

67
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,125
I said get out of here!

68
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,250
Not a chance.

69
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,833
What's the matter?

70
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,833
Haven't you seen
one of those before?

71
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,541
They're so cute.

72
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,458
Oh great.

73
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,500
Do you wanna try it?

74
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know what to do.

75
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,208
Anyone can play this, it's easy.

76
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,041
Do you want me to teach you how?

77
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,833
All of those other
tries were practice!

78
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,875
That's a lot of
practice, isn't it?

79
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,958
Shut up!

80
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,208
This time I'm gonna get serious

81
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,541
and beat this machine
once and for all!

82
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,291
Well, that's the way it goes.

83
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,666
Now, let me try.

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,333
They're so cute!

85
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,041
I didn't think she was capable
of making a face like that.

86
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,250
Hi there!

87
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,291
I'm Leo-pon!

88
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,583
What a coincidence!

89
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,291
I'm Leo-pon, too.

90
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,833
What the heck?

91
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,041
I'll give up one of them.

92
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,375
I mean, you were the one
who won them, after all.

93
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,500
Uh, okay.

94
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,708
That's why I don't
like cheap stuff.

95
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,500
Things go so smoothly
when Aria isn't around.

96
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,708
Plenty of time to catch my bus.

97
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,041
Muto? No way,
that's the 7:58 bus!

98
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,958
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,375
I thought I had already
put my cell on vibrate.

100
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,791
Attention: There is a
bomb planted on this bus.

101
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,958
Guess I'm walking.

102
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:01,833
Hello?

103
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,208
Kinji?! Where are you?!

104
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
On my way to school.

105
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,208
What's up?
Is something the matter?

106
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,583
Listen. A bus has been hijacked!

107
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,833
If you reduce speed,
then the bus will explode.

108
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,833
Is this really a bus-jacking?

109
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,083
Yeah, most likely it is.

110
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,458
The same thing happened
to my friend not too long ago.

111
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,916
Do not attempt to
fight back in any way.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,708
Shiranui!

113
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,250
Did you find the bomb yet?

114
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,083
Do not disregard my warning.

115
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,041
Everybody, get down!

116
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,208
A bus-jacking?!

117
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
It was one of our school routes.

118
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,500
G3. That's the one
that goes to Butei High

119
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,166
from the men's dorm at 7:58.

120
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
7:58, I knew it.

121
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,291
That's the one Muto
and the others are on!

122
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,250
Is this for real?

123
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:15,875
At eight this morning,

124
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,125
I intercepted a
radio transmission

125
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,208
that this guy always uses

126
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,833
when he pulls one of these.

127
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,833
I'm absolutely certain
that the G3 is the target.

128
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,083
There's more;
this guy's the Butei Killer.

129
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,125
Butei Killer?

130
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,625
How's that?

131
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,958
They already arrested that guy.

132
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,291
The real killer
is still out there.

133
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,750
What'd you mean?

134
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,041
It's not possible.

135
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,625
Butei Charter Article 1!

136
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,166
"Trust your friends and
help when they need it!"

137
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,791
The people on that
bus are fellow Butei.

138
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,708
No more explanation
is necessary.

139
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,458
Hold on.

140
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,791
While we sit
here talking about it

141
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,833
that bus could explode
killing, everyone inside.

142
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,666
Fine.

143
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,291
Point made.You can count me in.

144
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,125
Our mission is to save
everyone on that bus.

145
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,625
Yeah, got it.

146
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,791
I can't let the Butei Killer
keep getting away with this.

147
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,416
I have to rescue the hostages,

148
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,416
then I'll catch
the Butei Killer.

149
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,750
Hey. Is everyone okay?

150
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,375
That bastard!

151
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,666
Our uniforms may be bulletproof
but getting shot still hurts.

152
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,791
Is everybody okay back there?

153
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,083
Now we know.

154
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,000
We have to be extra
careful fighting this guy.

155
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,958
You're right.

156
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,125
But how?

157
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,000
Dammit!

158
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,666
He's got us beat.

159
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,958
Why is this happening?

160
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,583
Next, you're going to turn
right at the Hotel Gekkou.

161
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,291
Okay, where are we headed now?

162
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,583
Odaiba.

163
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,375
My guess is that's
where they're going.

164
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,958
And why is that?

165
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,625
A hunch.

166
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,250
I see.

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,333
If someone is targeting
Butei, then it would be best

168
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,208
to do it in the middle
of a public place

169
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,916
instead of on Academy Island

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,583
since that makes
more of an impact.

171
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,000
Good. That's exactly right.

172
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,958
I expect that from my slave.

173
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,750
You're beginning to understand
the way I approach a problem.

174
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,958
So Kinji, I guess
this counts as the

175
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,958
one mission you
agreed to go on, huh?

176
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,208
That's just my luck.

177
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,416
The first mission
happens to be a huge one.

178
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,625
You better keep your promise.

179
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,666
Got it?

180
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,041
I want to see
your real abilities.

181
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,041
No holding out on me, okay?

182
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,083
I should tell you.

183
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,375
I don't think my
skills are going to

184
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,166
live up to your expectations.

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,458
I'm only an E-ranked Butei.

186
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,583
Are you really sure you want me

187
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,791
with you on such a
complicated mission?

188
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,583
If you screw up and get yourself
cornered, don't worry.

189
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,833
I'll be there to save you.
I've got your back.

190
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,000
Shiranui! Give us a hand.

191
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,541
We'll stop that stupid car.

192
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,833
Hey! Chill out.

193
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,166
We've been trained as Butei.

194
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,541
We can't just sit here.

195
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,541
He's got a camera watching
every move we make.

196
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,458
I know, but we're
headed for a tunnel.

197
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,666
It'll give us our chance,
in the darkness,

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,708
the camera will have
to correct for exposure.

199
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,666
When it goes dark
we'll attack in unison.

200
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,875
We can do this,
big targets are easy.

201
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
We've got too many
unknowns to deal with.

202
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,958
Too risky.

203
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,416
Forget it.
We'll do it ourselves.

204
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,958
Three.

205
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,083
Two.

206
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,541
One!

207
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,708
It's got infrared.

208
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,583
That's not good.

209
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,166
Hey! Are you okay?!

210
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,333
So far. Watch yourself.

211
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,541
There's a bomb
somewhere on the bus

212
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,666
that he says will
explode if we slow down.

213
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,041
Okay, I'm gonna have
to get on the bus.

214
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,208
Huh?!

215
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,250
I can't defuse the
bomb sitting over here.

216
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,250
Hey, don't be reckless!

217
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,875
There's no other way
for us to get to the wounded

218
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,166
and save those still alive.

219
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,416
You're going to come with me.

220
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,625
I figured.

221
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,208
Okay.

222
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,833
Let's split up and
look for the bomb.

223
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,458
I'll check under the
bus and you look inside.

224
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,833
Don't go outside the bus,
even if you can't find it.

225
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,250
Understood.

226
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,583
Kinji, you should check
under the driver's seat.

227
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,666
That's the only place
we still haven't searched.

228
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,708
Sure.

229
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,708
It doesn't look like
it's here, Muto, you okay?

230
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:10,458
I'll be fine, but I can't say
the same thing for this bus.

231
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,458
Bad news, it's leaking gas.

232
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,500
Also, this tunnel is directly
connected to Rainbow Bridge.

233
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,000
If it explodes,
it'll be right in the city.

234
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,208
Dammit!

235
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,250
We have to find
that bomb right now.

236
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,458
Kinji! I found it!

237
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,250
Looks like a Kaczynski
beta-type plastic explosive.

238
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,583
I'm guessing the blast volume

239
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,000
will be in excess of
3500 cubic centimeters.

240
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,500
No way.

241
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,458
That's enough to take out
a tank, much less a city bus!

242
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,625
There's no need to freak.

243
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,166
I can dismantle this thing.

244
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,458
That's great, nice work.

245
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,583
Hey Kinji, you got a sec?

246
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,125
What's wrong?

247
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,541
This sick bastard.

248
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,875
He's not stupid.

249
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,000
He's probably watching
us Even now as we speak.

250
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,791
He's going to make
another move soon.

251
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,041
We have to get the jump on him

252
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,541
by disabling whatever
he's using to transmit.

253
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,291
Let's see if we can find it.

254
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,958
Dammit. I can't quite reach it.

255
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,583
There it is!

256
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,291
I figured I'd find
it up on the roof.

257
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,625
Kinji get down here.

258
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,291
I can't reach the bomb!

259
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,416
Hurry up!

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,166
That idiot!

261
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:35,791
Kinji!

262
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,583
Check it out!

263
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,958
I found the transmitter.

264
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,750
He's pretty smart; this
let him monitor the inside--

265
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,833
You idiot!

266
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,958
I thought told you
not to go outside!

267
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,708
What good are you if you
can't follow a simple order?

268
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,916
Hey, you don't
have to be so rude.

269
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,458
I thought I would
disable this thing

270
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,000
while you handled
the bomb, that's all.

271
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,083
You're too exposed there!

272
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
Finish up and get insi--

273
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,375
Hit the deck!

274
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,833
Kinji!

275
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,458
Aria! Talk to me, come on!

276
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,625
Wake up!

277
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,458
Who is that?

278
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,000
Reki!

279
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
I am...

280
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,958
...a single bullet.

281
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,583
Thanks for the
back-up yesterday, Reki.

282
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,458
I didn't know you and
Aria knew each other.

283
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,750
Aria is one of my clients.

284
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,541
She's a client?

285
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,541
So that sniper work was paid.

286
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,750
She told me her plan and how
it might require my expertise.

287
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,708
When she asked,
I, of course, said "yes."

288
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,166
She also said that by teaming up

289
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,833
with you there wasn't
any case she couldn't solve.

290
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,875
It left a scar.

291
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,750
Aria.

292
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,958
Uhh wait, give me just a second.

293
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
The doctors are
just overreacting.

294
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,416
To think I was
hospitalized over a scratch.

295
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,916
It's really no big deal.

296
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't want you
worrying about it.

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,375
Article 1 of the Butei Charter,

298
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,000
'Trust your friends and
help when they need it."

299
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,208
I was just following
the charter.

300
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,666
I would've saved any one of
our classmates the same way.

301
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,375
The Charter is
full of nice words.

302
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,958
Don't follow it blindly.

303
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,916
Are you trying
to say I'm stupid?

304
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,291
Who do you think you are?

305
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,583
But maybe you're right.

306
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,041
I'd have to be pretty dumb

307
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,833
to risk my life saving
an idiot like you.

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,541
Here's a copy
of the case report.

309
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,291
The teams from Inquesta
and Repier pulled

310
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,583
an all-nighter investigating it.

311
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,541
I'll save you
the time reading it.

312
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,166
They couldn't find
anything that could be

313
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,916
connected back
to whoever did this.

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,291
I figured as much.

315
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,875
The Butei Killer is
intelligent and methodical,

316
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,375
there's no way he'd leave any
evidence behind.

317
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,583
Anyway, is that all?

318
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,166
Yeah, that's all.

319
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,958
Then there's nothing
else to say so leave.

320
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,583
Hey, you can't just
toss their work like that.

321
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,750
I said go home.

322
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,250
Get out of here!

323
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,750
Fine, I'm gone.

324
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,666
What's your problem?

325
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,791
It's too bad.

326
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,791
I had high hopes for you.

327
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,375
I thought you'd at least try

328
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,875
to show me your real abilities
like you did the other day!

329
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,208
You made all that
stuff up in your head.

330
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,916
There's nothing
special about me.

331
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,125
That's a lie!

332
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,041
I know exactly what
you're capable of doing.

333
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,833
You're just scared
of your own potential!

334
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
That's none of your business.

335
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,625
It doesn't matter.

336
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,541
I'm going to quit being a Butei.

337
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,500
Not everything's
about you ya know!

338
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,291
I don't have much time left.

339
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,125
If I'm selfish, then so be it.

340
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,583
You're not making sense.

341
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,791
What do you mean?

342
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,166
You're a Butei,
why don't you figure it out.

343
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Talk about self-centered.

344
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,750
You think I don't know
about wanting to quit?

345
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,958
I have to fight
against it every day.

346
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,625
It doesn't matter.

347
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm still done
with being a Butei.

348
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,041
That's alright.

349
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,000
I understand. You're not
the one I was looking for.

350
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,916
I guess I was wrong about you.

351
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,375
So I guess Kinji wasn't
meant to be my partner, either.

352
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,125
I've always been a
lone pretty girl Butei.

353
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,416
That "pretty"
bit's kind of a stretch.

354
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,416
Kinji?!

355
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,625
I thought I sent
you home already!

356
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,666
I stayed because we
have to do this preview!

357
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,666
Why don't you start?

358
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,166
I don't feel like it!

359
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,166
And don't you ever tell me
what to do or try to be nice!

360
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,333
It's not going to work.

361
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,875
Nothing's going to
work with that attitude.

362
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,791
Hey!

363
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,083
Leave the clever
comebacks to me!

364
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,291
Just leave already!

365
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,458
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo Episode 4!

366
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,458
"Butei Killer."

367
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,583
Watch it or not,
I'm pumping holes!
