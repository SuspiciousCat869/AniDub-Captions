1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,125
Seriously.

2
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,333
You're gonna make me come

3
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,791
to a girl's dorm
without telling me why.

4
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,291
Aria's had me do
some crazy things

5
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,875
but they were
never embarrassing.

6
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,750
Man.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,375
Hey, I'm here!

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,333
You know that took
you too damn long.

9
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,333
But I forgive you anyway.

10
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,333
Which one do you like, Kinji?

11
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,916
I... What do you mean?

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Aww... I'm asking you which
costume you want me to wear.

13
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,041
Kinji!

14
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,666
Kinji!

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,250
Are you ready?

16
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,375
Hey Riko.

17
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,250
Yay!

18
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,583
I knew you'd be able
to tell who it was.

19
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,500
You got it, the amazing Riko!

20
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,375
Aren't you happy to see me?

21
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,500
You really don't want
me to answer that.

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,958
You're so funny.

23
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,666
Let's do naughty things! Okay?

24
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,541
The way you smell.

25
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,041
It's so good I can't
help it. I love it.

26
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,416
When I was gone, I couldn't
stop thinking about you.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
I was kinda obsessed.

28
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,875
So how about we just make
the rest of the world fade away

29
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,541
and let me into that
big strong heart of yours.

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,500
You're acting
has improved a lot.

31
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,458
Is that any way to treat a girl?

32
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,750
My feelings for
you are undeniable.

33
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,291
I've been a very bad girl.

34
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,708
Even if you are
Aria's little slave.

35
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,625
I'm going to steal you.

36
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,208
No, you're not.

37
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,541
You've done enough like taking
my older brother away from me.

38
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,291
You still think
that I killed him?

39
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,708
What are you saying to me?

40
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,500
Just exactly what I said.

41
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,750
Give me some proof
that he's alive.

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,291
Hysteria savant
syndrome for one.

43
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,041
I never really killed anyone.

44
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,375
So "Butei Killer" isn't exactly
an accurate nickname for me.

45
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,208
Right. That's plenty
of talk for now.

46
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,541
It's time for you to make
your choice, boyfriend.

47
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,083
And if you pick me,

48
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,541
I'll tell you everything you
want to know about your brother.

49
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,458
Stories about my brother.

50
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,208
Hey.You should really pick
me as your girlfriend, Kinji.

51
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,791
You can do whatever you want,

52
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,750
whenever and
wherever you'd like to.

53
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,875
I'm your weapon.

54
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,000
You can use me
whenever you want to.

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,708
Hysteria mode won't
start on its own.

56
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,666
The only catch is.

57
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,041
I won't do it if I'm just
another one of your harlots.

58
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,666
I won't let you steal my slave!

59
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,708
Too bad.

60
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,875
There's only enough room for
one heroine in this love scene.

61
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,458
You're nothing but the
offspring of lowlife thieves.

62
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,833
He belongs to me and I'm
not gonna let you take him.

63
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,375
Is that so?

64
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
I can tell you were watching us
from that look on your face.

65
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,583
So you know Kin was
about three seconds away

66
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,500
from completely losing
himself in my breasts.

67
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,458
There's not a guy alive
who has the strength

68
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,166
to resist the almighty
power of my girls.

69
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,125
But don't worry, it has nothing
to do with you, I'm sure.

70
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:57,083
I'm gonna pump you full
of massive, angry holes!

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,541
You've managed to totally ruin

72
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,875
my long awaited
re-debut of naughty fun.

73
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,333
Now my little
devil side comes out!

74
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,458
That was a flash grenade!

75
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,375
Okay, where'd you go?

76
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,708
I'm pretty sure I didn't
hear the door open.

77
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,916
Window.

78
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,333
I'm surprised you found
my location so quickly.

79
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,166
Muto and the others
told me that you left

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,208
to meet me after
I supposedly called you.

81
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,375
Then I bet it was just a
matter of you tracking me

82
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,833
down with the surveillance
footage from Informa.

83
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,791
Standard operating procedure.

84
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,208
Riko!

85
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,250
It's such a
pretty night tonight.

86
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,750
There's gunpowder in the air
and my man is chasing me.

87
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,041
There's not much
more a girl could ask for.

88
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,458
Riko Mine Lupin the 4th!

89
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,041
You're not getting
away this time!

90
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,000
You'll pay for every
crime you pinned on my mom.

91
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,958
I'd like to see
you try, Limey wench.

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,208
Say that again, frog face!

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,916
I don't know how you
could show up here again

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,541
after hijacking a plane;
you don't have any shame.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,041
You can't figure out
something that simple?

96
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,958
You are a hopeless Holmes.

97
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,291
What did you say?!

98
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,500
I won't let an ugly
Lupin talk to me that way!

99
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,708
Oh yeah?!

100
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,958
At least I don't get
mistaken for a child!

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,041
Shut up.

102
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,208
Your voice is
grating on my nerves!

103
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,458
Well, your flat chest
is making me sad.

104
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,291
Maybe if you keep
eating those peach buns,

105
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,958
the fat will go to your boobs.

106
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,625
It's time to stop cosplaying!

107
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,333
You look like crap
in those outfits.

108
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,458
Shut up!

109
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,833
At least I have a
butt people notice.

110
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,875
Oh yeah, as long as they
can put a bag on your face!

111
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,541
Oh man!

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:38,250
I am so pissed off!

113
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,541
What do you think
you're doing, Kinji?

114
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,458
She's totally a monster.

115
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,291
Nothing makes me sadder than
watching two adorable kittens

116
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,750
try to scratch and
claw each other to death.

117
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,125
It isn't my thing.

118
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,708
Aria, don't fight with Riko.

119
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,625
Why shouldn't I?!

120
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,041
She's not hiding so I bet
she took a plea-bargain.

121
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,375
That's why they let her come
back to Butei High.

122
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,375
Exactly right!

123
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,291
You know me so perfectly, Kinji,

124
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,583
it's like you're walking
around inside my head.

125
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,083
That's a lie!

126
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,666
Do you think I'd fall for
something as stupid as that?!

127
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,916
But if it is true then
anything we do to her

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,291
without just cause
ends up being a crime

129
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,083
and we're the ones
who will get arrested.

130
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,500
If that happens, all our
work so far will have been

131
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,416
for nothing and
we'll never be able

132
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,541
to prove your mom's innocence.

133
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,625
But you didn't take any deal

134
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,458
for the crimes you
pinned against my mom.

135
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,458
I want you to
testify in Court, Riko.

136
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,708
Okay.

137
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:33,291
It's no use if you
refuse to help I'll--huh?

138
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
I'll testify for her.

139
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,333
Are you serious?!

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,583
You really love your mom a
whole bunch, don't you, Aria?

141
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,000
I feel the exact
same way about my mom,

142
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,166
so I know how hard it is.

143
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,791
I'm so sorry.

144
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,625
I just... I miss... my mom.

145
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,166
What? Riko?!

146
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,708
Why are you crying?

147
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,208
It's okay,
you can talk about it.

148
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,083
I'm just really upset
because I got expelled

149
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,083
from I-U after what
you and Kinji did to me.

150
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,166
Expelled?

151
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,958
And then Vlad said
you guys beat me--

152
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,583
so as punishment he decided
to take away my treasure.

153
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,708
"The" Vlad?

154
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,166
The number two at I-U?

155
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,583
Known as "Vlad the Bad"?

156
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,250
That's right.

157
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,541
I want to show him and take back
everything he stole from me.

158
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,291
That's why I need you to help.

159
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,875
Exactly what do you
think we'd do for you?

160
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,791
Kinji, Aria, I was thinking.

161
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,375
We could be thieves!

162
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,208
Wow, Riko! Welcome back!

163
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,166
That's so cute!
You look amazing!

164
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,125
I decided to make a
new outfit for school.

165
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,791
I have to get one, too!

166
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,000
Ahh crap.

167
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,041
Can I just shoot her
and get it over with?

168
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,458
I can only assume
you're upset about girl stuff.

169
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,875
But seriously,
there's no way it can

170
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,791
be all right for us to help
her steal her stuff back.

171
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,291
We'd have to be nuts, right?

172
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,708
Of course, it's not okay,

173
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,833
especially considering
I have to do it by teaming up

174
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,583
with a stupid Lupin,

175
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,291
but we do have a
unique opportunity here.

176
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,791
Not many people are handed the
chance to contact Vlad the Bad.

177
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,500
But won't we be
convicted of theft anyway?

178
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,958
You don't have to concern
yourself about that, Kinji.

179
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,500
Even if we get arrested,

180
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,541
we won't be prosecuted because
we did it trying to hit I-U.

181
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,125
That's re-assuring, but I still
don't even know what I-U is.

182
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,666
So c'mon, tell me.

183
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,833
I can't do that.

184
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,541
I thought I was your
partner in all this.

185
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,541
That's precisely the
reason I can't tell you.

186
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,833
So, have you decided
what you're going to do?

187
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,333
Are you going to help
her get her stuff back?

188
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,666
Yeah, I guess.

189
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,916
Wellll.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,875
Let me guess what made
you change your mind.

191
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,000
It's, kind of--it has
nothing to do with you.

192
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,166
You were powerless to resist

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,500
the pull of a cute
girl begging for help.

194
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,875
Like I said, my decision
has nothing to do with you.

195
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,458
I know all about it.

196
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,833
Wait, about what?

197
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,083
You don't have to say a word.

198
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,791
I can tell by that
look in your eyes.

199
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,083
All the guys just love her
because of how cutsie she acts,

200
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,583
but really, it's just--she's
got those big boobs.

201
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,125
Butei always fall for darkness,
poison, and women

202
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,416
and last night in that room Riko
busted out her secret weapon.

203
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,750
She did something naughty to you

204
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,708
and you liked it and
now you want it again.

205
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,166
You're nuts.

206
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,208
Now, what kind of disgusting
things did she do to you?!

207
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,083
Spit it out!

208
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,625
I want detailed instructions.

209
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,500
Man, what is your problem?

210
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,750
Why would you want

211
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,041
to hear about stuff like
that in the first place?

212
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,958
Shut your mouth.

213
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,208
You're nothing but a horny guy.

214
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,208
Just take a breath.

215
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,750
I don't know what
you think you saw,

216
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,333
but Riko and
I didn't do anything

217
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,958
that you need to
freak out about.

218
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,333
It's all in your head.

219
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,375
You're lying!

220
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,958
Then why was she
all straddling you?

221
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,666
Are you always in
bed when you chat?

222
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,208
She forced me down
and got on top of me!

223
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,458
What were you doing

224
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,875
by the bed in the
first place, Mr. Innocent?

225
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,416
That was--

226
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,708
I thought so,
I bet you were hoping

227
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,666
that something
naked would happen!

228
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,041
Just because Riko's got breasts

229
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,166
that are slightly above average,

230
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,166
you turn off your brain.

231
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,041
It's pathetic!

232
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,750
I don't understand why you're
freaking out about it, anyway.

233
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,083
Even if something did happen,

234
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,333
it's none of your
business what I do

235
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,500
when we're not on a mission.

236
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,958
It is my business!

237
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,958
You're mine and no
one else can have you.

238
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,791
Little Miss Riko has got you
completely blinded by her boobs.

239
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,916
I read something about this in

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,916
a book Shirayuki
showed me the other day.

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,541
Girls shouldn't flirt like that

242
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,416
if they really like a
guy then they have to wait.

243
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,125
The only reason they
act like little whores is

244
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,541
if they're trying to
use a guy for something.

245
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,958
You're not making any sense.

246
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,458
Riko doesn't really like you.

247
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,916
She's only throwing herself
at you because she's trying

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,291
to get you to join
her little den of thieves.

249
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,958
I won't let that tramp take
what rightfully belongs to me,

250
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,750
and I won't have any slave of
mine serving some other master.

251
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,375
 Let me make this clear.

252
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,625
Kinji you belong
to me and nobody else,

253
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,458
do you understand that?

254
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,125
Yeah, okay.

255
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,583
Okay, fine. Fine.

256
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,625
I'll forgive you, but don't
ever let it happen again.

257
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,833
If you betray me,
I'll pump you full of holes

258
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,833
and turn you into
human Swiss cheese!

259
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,041
It's gross, just like
it was with Shirayuki.

260
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
You were flirting with
her all day long, then.

261
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,541
On top of that you had to go

262
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,041
and kiss her to
supposedly save her life.

263
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,666
Seriously, what is up with
you and all these stupid girls?

264
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,416
Okay, let's get ready
for our biology test.

265
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,583
First, I'll show you a video

266
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,916
on some of the
processes in genetics.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,541
After watching the
video, all you need

268
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,458
to do is fill in the blanks on
the answer sheets I gave you.

269
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,375
Mr. Sayonaki is such a hottie.

270
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,416
Please look this way, my prince.

271
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,750
He is so totally handsome.

272
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,958
Hey, Kinji.

273
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,083
Ah! Riko!

274
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,458
What the heck are
you doing up here?!

275
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,416
I'm studying Inquesta, too.

276
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,125
I have to take the tests
in order to get credit.

277
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,041
I didn't mean that.

278
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,958
Why are you sitting next to me?

279
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,458
Heredity. It's how
the traits of a parent

280
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,291
are passed on to their children.

281
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,958
Heredity isn't all chance...

282
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,000
Kinji, it's nice and dark;
you want to touch me?

283
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,291
We're right in the
middle of a test here!

284
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,916
I know. That's half the fun;
doesn't it turn you on?

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,041
I told you, I'm a naughty girl.

286
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,208
Relax Kinji. Just let go.

287
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,250
Don't you want to touch me?

288
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,416
No way, freak.

289
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,708
If you don't then
I'll start screaming.

290
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,875
I'll tell everyone
you were trying to

291
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,666
have your way
with me in the dark.

292
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,583
Get to it or I'm going
scream. Three, two...

293
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,666
Okay, just give me a second.

294
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,791
Ahh stop, don't
make it so rough.

295
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,833
You gotta be more
gentle with me.

296
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:59,333
More slowly, that's right, good.

297
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,583
Oh crap.

298
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,125
Where's my pencil?

299
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,916
If you're looking for
your mechanical pencil,

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,208
I decided to play a game
of hide and seek with it.

301
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,208
Not funny, give it.

302
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,125
It's all yours.

303
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
Unbelievable.

304
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,791
You better get it soon

305
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,125
or you won't be
able to finish the test.

306
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,583
I guess I should tell you
I'm not wearing a bra today.

307
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,916
Don't make this
worse than it has to be.

308
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,500
Uhh, is that it there?

309
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,500
Ah.

310
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,916
That's not it.

311
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,416
You're so smooth.

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,208
I didn't expect that.

313
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,541
I'm a little shy.

314
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,666
You just surprised me,
that's all.

315
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,708
Now.

316
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,583
I'm ready to let you try again.

317
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,458
I don't understand why
you're doing this to me.

318
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,791
You know I don't like it.

319
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,541
I'm training you so
that you'll be able to go

320
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,625
into Hysteria Mode
whenever you want to

321
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,666
and not just when
you lose control.

322
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,333
If we're going to be
master thieves you'll need

323
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,375
to be able to
turn it on and off.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,916
Hey look! I've finished
answering all the questions.

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,291
See ya!

326
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
Now Kinji.

327
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,208
I'm going to need to see you in
my office after class alright?

328
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,875
Uhh, yes sir.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,791
Come on, Kinji,
don't be so angry.

330
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,125
Tomorrow we're going to have
our first strategy meeting

331
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,791
for our Master Thieves
Operation and you can't be mad.

332
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,916
I'm not angry.

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,125
I've just given up
trying to fight you.

334
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,583
Sharing an umbrella

335
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,458
with you makes me
feel all warm and fuzzy.

336
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,625
I hope it rains all week.

337
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,791
It's funny, isn't it?

338
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,333
Whenever we're alone
you're somehow able

339
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,291
to be so nice to me.

340
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,583
Like the other day when we were
on the bed, you were so sweet.

341
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,791
Who are you?!

342
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,250
Shirayuki!

343
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,333
Kinji, you should
get out of here.

344
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,250
Hey, you just
totally interrupted us

345
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,083
being adorable in the rain.

346
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,416
Who are you?

347
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,166
I'm Shirayuki Hotogi from SSR!

348
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,583
This flagrant display of
affection is disgraceful.

349
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,625
It makes me absolutely
jealou--I mean disgusted!

350
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,875
Can't you see how painful
it is to poor Kinji?!

351
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,875
No, I can't.

352
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,208
There isn't anything painful

353
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,958
about being my
boyfriend, besides,

354
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,791
a true gentleman always
escorts his lady home.

355
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,375
You two are dating now?

356
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,458
There sure are a
bunch of weirdos

357
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,833
at school this year,
Kinji, right?

358
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,208
He's mine.

359
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,583
If you wanna take back what you
said, now would be the time.

360
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,750
Kinji and I have
already kissed each other.

361
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,708
Oh?

362
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,291
You two just locked lips?

363
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,125
Kinji's already taken me
all the way to second base.

364
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,750
What?!

365
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,208
Noooooo!

366
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,083
Hold on a second.

367
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,541
Everybody calm down.

368
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,291
Riko, you've got
to watch what you say.

369
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,166
Noo.

370
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,208
I won't let another thieving cat

371
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,250
get her claws on
Kinji, so back off.

372
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,250
Make me.

373
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,291
I'll beat the crap out of you.

374
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,708
Nooooo!

375
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
Whoa! You're wearing
black, girl!

376
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,250
That totally ruins
your good girl image!

377
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,541
Well, see ya, Kinji.

378
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,291
I'll send you an email
later about the place

379
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,333
and time for our date tomorrow!

380
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,875
I just want to lay down and die.

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,416
I'm the student
council president.

382
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,416
I have to set the example and
not flaunt myself in public.

383
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,291
My black panties
have been shown to you.

384
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,958
I can't get married
to you anymore.

385
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,083
I'm going to die
an old maid alone.

386
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,375
Nobody will marry me now.

387
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,000
The nurse isn't here.

388
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,416
Maybe we should
check somewhere else.

389
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,083
Yeah, that sounds good.

390
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,541
It's stuck.

391
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,250
What's wrong?

392
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,833
I think we might
be locked inside.

393
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,916
I can't open it.

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,416
No way, wait a minute,

395
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,958
I thought you said
your legs weren't working

396
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,500
because of all the trauma
and shock of humiliation.

397
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah, they appear to be
doing much better now.

398
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,625
Thank you for your concern.

399
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,958
Well that's a big relief.

400
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,291
I guess if we're stuck

401
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,791
in here I should probably
try to call somebody.

402
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,333
Maybe one of the guys in Amdo--

403
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,291
No you can't.

404
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,541
I'm sorry!

405
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,833
Hey, what do you think
you're doing, Shirayuki!

406
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,125
Give that back to me!

407
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,125
Just my luck.

408
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,375
Alright.

409
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,041
What's the matter with you?

410
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,000
I just couldn't stop myself.

411
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,500
I know you've got another girl,

412
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,166
but I want you as my prince...

413
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,583
so even if you just fake it,
can't you be mine right now?

414
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,791
Sorry, what?

415
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,375
Yes, it has to work.

416
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,416
If I can just get my chance
before I go back to the shrine

417
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,791
I know I can beat that thieving
cat but I need a chance.

418
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,958
Just a little chance.
One final chance.

419
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:47,583
Hey, snap out of it.

420
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,916
Alright!

421
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,750
Can I have my cell back
so we can get out of here?

422
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,375
But we can't yet because I have
two really important things

423
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,125
to say to you before we go.

424
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,208
Okay, I'll listen to you but
then I'm getting my phone back.

425
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,791
Of course.

426
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,666
The first thing is that I told
your fortune with the cards--

427
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,250
I know I shouldn't have--but
I couldn't help it

428
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,375
It said you are destined
to meet a wolf, a demon,

429
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,125
and a ghost sometime
very close to now.

430
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,916
The cards were very specific.

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,291
Yeah, weird.

432
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:17,666
I'll meet a wolf,
a demon, and a ghost?

433
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,916
I think I've already met them.

434
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,791
The second thing
is about my future...

435
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,791
I have to go back to
the Hotogi Shrine tonight

436
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,500
and stay for a while.

437
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,333
I broke part of my oath
when I was fighting Durandal,

438
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,208
and things have changed there
since I've been away so long.

439
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,375
I have to stay
for about a month.

440
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,458
I see.

441
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,625
You should go home
and take it easy.

442
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,916
That was really all
I wanted to say to you.

443
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,708
Hey, it seems like its kinda
cold in here, don't you think?

444
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,833
Oh no, the heater
is broken, Kinji.

445
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,333
We should try to preserve our
body heat as best we can

446
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,666
until someone realizes we're
missing and comes to save us!

447
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,625
Or you could always
just give me my cell back.

448
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,666
Shirayuki, what do
you think you're doing?

449
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,375
Why are you taking
your clothes off now?!

450
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,166
People stranded in a
mountain snowstorm survive

451
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,750
by sharing body heat.

452
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,750
This isn't a snowy mountain!

453
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,750
What's with the
sudden super powers?

454
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,125
You're using Hotogi's
Jutsu, aren't you?!

455
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,041
I'm prepared to abandon my duty
as a shrine maiden for you!

456
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,083
To hell with Hotogi!

457
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,125
Have you gone
completely insane?!

458
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,458
Let go of my arm!

459
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,333
Kin-kin, my prince!

460
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,583
Won't you have some pity on me

461
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,083
just this once before
I go back to my prison?

462
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,625
I just need a chance.
That's all.

463
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,416
Please give me a chance!

464
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,625
Here I am...

465
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,916
Hey, don't stare at me without
at least saying something.

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,458
I mean, unless you want to,
which is fine with me.

467
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,083
Kin, you are my prince now.

468
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,166
Please do whatever you want.

469
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,250
I'm not holding back
from my prince tonight.

470
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,750
Okay, you win!

471
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,166
What, am I in a dream right
now; you'll be my prince?

472
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,458
Am I all yours for real?

473
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,166
Yes, but I need you to
look away from me first.

474
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,000
I get too embarrassed
and freak out.

475
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:07,958
So look at the floor.

476
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:08,750
Huh?

477
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,541
Lie down!

478
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,333
Yeah okay!

479
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,583
Just let me know when you're
finished getting undressed.

480
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,625
We're finally going to give

481
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,083
our love a chance,
a real chance!

482
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,083
Kin-kin, can I look up yet?

483
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,916
Are you ready?

484
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Kinji, my prince.

485
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,041
He's gone!

486
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,625
Be back soon!

487
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,000
We'll pick this up
where we stopped

488
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,833
when I get back from the Shrine?

489
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,833
We have to finish!

490
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,583
That's a promise!

491
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:56,750
This is it.

492
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,291
There's no mistake.

493
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,666
Riko's a jerk.

494
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,500
She had to go and pick
someplace totally dangerous

495
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,041
for our first meeting with her.

496
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,875
We should be prepared
for trouble, just in case.

497
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,458
Ready, Kinji?

498
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,000
Welcome Miss and
you as well, sir.

499
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,125
We're glad to have you here.

500
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,208
Kin. Aria.

501
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,125
Let me welcome you home.

502
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,875
Hey, Kinji, are Haru-habara,
Natsu-habara,

503
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,583
and Fuyu-habara close to here?

504
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,083
What do you mean?

505
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,291
If there's an Aki-habara,
which has "autumn" in the name,

506
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,083
there's ones for the
other seasons, right?

507
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,791
Aki-habara is full of
electronics, anime and manga.

508
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,541
Oh, I got it!

509
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,500
Haru-habara is a town of
peach buns and English Tea!

510
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,500
I think that's your
version of paradise.

511
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,333
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo episode 10!

512
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,666
"Special Training."

513
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,750
Watch it or I'll pump
you full of holes-habara!
