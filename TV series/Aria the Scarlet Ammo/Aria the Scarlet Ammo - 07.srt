1
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,791
Dammit.

2
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Oh, Kinji!

3
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,458
How's your cold?

4
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,250
Is there a fever?
Do you have a headache?

5
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,541
No. I'm fine.

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,166
I'm completely over it now.

7
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,291
Thank goodness.

8
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,666
I was so worried.

9
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,875
You don't have to
get all emotional.

10
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,208
Okay!

11
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,458
Oh, boy.

12
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,208
By the way, thanks
for getting this for me.

13
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,583
What?

14
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm glad you went to buy
this fever medicine for me.

15
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,916
It really did the trick.

16
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,791
Yeah, that's the--

17
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,625
What's wrong? You okay?

18
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,500
It's nothing.

19
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,666
I'm alright.

20
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,833
My room became a fortress and
because of them I caught cold.

21
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,000
Then there are half
naked girls at school.

22
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,958
My safety zone is shrinking.

23
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,625
Kinji!

24
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,291
Owww!

25
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,625
Seriously, it's pathetic!

26
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,875
You could at least

27
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,291
get the sword-catching
right once in a while!

28
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,916
Durandal has a sword that

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
they say can cut
through any type of steel.

30
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,833
I'm training you this way

31
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,500
because it could save
your life, you big dork.

32
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,000
I hope you didn't come
all the way out here

33
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,083
just to tell me
that little tidbit.

34
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,958
Try not to be a
simpleton, Kinji.

35
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,833
I don't have that kind of
time to waste. I have a job.

36
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,875
I want you to check all
the emails Shirayuki got

37
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,250
on her cell after school today.

38
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,000
What for?
That sounds kinda lame.

39
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,125
I heard that Durandal always
sends a threatening email

40
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,541
to his target on
their cell phone

41
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,333
before he tries to kidnap them.

42
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,041
Shirayuki might've gotten one.

43
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,250
How am I supposed
to pull that off.

44
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,583
She's never going to let
me just search through them.

45
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,500
And besides, she'd tell me if
something like that happened.

46
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,250
Hey, aren't you supposed to
be guarding her right now?

47
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,750
It's ok, I asked Reki
to watch her for me.

48
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,875
But it's only
for a little while.

49
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,500
She's too busy with all her
practice because she's

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,166
representing Japan in
the sniping competition.

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,875
Oh, really?

52
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,541
Are you even listening to me?!

53
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,916
Yes, I am.

54
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,625
That was rude;
would you try to be at least

55
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,708
a little considerate of your
partner's fragile condition?

56
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,750
You mean.

57
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,208
Can't you lay off for a bit?

58
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,666
I just got over a cold.

59
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,125
Which I got because a
certain someone threw me

60
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,833
into the freezing
cold Tokyo bay at night.

61
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,208
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,291
I know that I can be a
little overbearing sometimes

63
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,666
but it's for your
own protection.

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,125
At least I'm finally
feeling human again.

65
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,875
I'd probably still
be dying if it weren't

66
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,000
for the medicine
Shirayuki brought me.

67
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,791
What? Shirayuki?

68
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,833
Yeah.

69
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,708
It was nice having
someone around

70
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,500
who bothered to take care of me.

71
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,833
What's wrong?

72
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,000
Nothing.

73
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,416
I'm just glad
you're better that's all.

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Aww, come on.

75
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not like you to hold back
when you have something to say.

76
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:41,791
Speak.

77
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
Now you care what I think?

78
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,375
Well I'm still not
tellin', so there!

79
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,875
I'm so glad that you had
Shirayuki to take care of you!

80
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,916
Why don't you just
marry her already?

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,583
What is with you today?

82
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,000
You know you want to!

83
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,875
You're the bodyguard
and she's the client,

84
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,750
and I catch you taking
off each others' clothes?

85
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,125
It's wrong!

86
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,291
I already told you,
it wasn't what it looked like.

87
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,541
I saw what I saw!

88
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,083
If I'm wrong, fine!
Then show me the proof!

89
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,916
Huh?

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500
I can only believe evidence!

91
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,250
That's how Butei are trained.

92
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,791
Show proof! Proof, proof, proof!

93
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,666
You're my slave,
and you act like this?!

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,500
You stupid Kinji! Stupid Kinji!

95
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,500
Stupid Kinji! Stupid Kinji!

96
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,875
If you're so insistent on proof,
why don't you show me yours?

97
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:22,958
What do you mean?

98
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,125
The proof that
Durandal really exists!

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,958
We've been watching
Shirayuki twenty-four seven

100
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,333
and nobody has even
tried to get close to her.

101
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,750
I don't think this
Durandal really exists.

102
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,541
That's not true!

103
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,000
He does exist!

104
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,500
Or maybe you just convinced
yourself that it was true.

105
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,416
Maybe you're so
desperate to find ways

106
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,666
to clear your mother's name that

107
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
when you heard
the name Durandal,

108
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,458
you wanted more than anything
to believe he actually existed.

109
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,500
And now, you've managed

110
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,333
to convince
yourself that he's real.

111
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,458
No!

112
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,791
Durandal does exist!

113
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,041
Shirayuki's in danger.

114
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,416
I can feel it.

115
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,833
Then show me some real
proof instead of just words!

116
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,166
You assume things all the time

117
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,375
and then you just do
whatever you think is right.

118
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,208
You're just like
the rest of 'em.

119
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,125
Nobody ever believes
anything I say.

120
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,583
Like right now I can sense

121
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,583
that an enemy is
closing in on Shirayuki.

122
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,416
I'm not anything like
my great-grandfather.

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,208
I don't have the words
to explain it logically.

124
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,583
That's why they call
me the defective Holmes,

125
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
the one who didn't get the gift.

126
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,708
But I know I'm right this time.

127
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm pouring my heart out to you
and you still don't trust me.

128
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,041
Why won't you
listen to me, Kinji?

129
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,833
Why should I believe in this
enemy when he doesn't exist?!

130
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,125
Until the competition's over,

131
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,833
I'll guard Shirayuki
by myself, got it?

132
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,250
Why don't you go
somewhere and cool off?

133
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49,333
You- You- You- You- You,
you, you stupid idiot!

134
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,625
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

135
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,833
You are so stupid, Kinji!
You deserve an award!

136
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,791
What?

137
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,791
So from now on you're going
to be my bodyguard exclusively?

138
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,333
Are you sure?

139
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,125
Aria's really the one who wanted
to make sure you were safe,

140
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,791
but I made a promise,
so I'm here.

141
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,458
You've sworn a solemn
vow to protect me.

142
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,208
It's like you're a
knight. I'm dreaming.

143
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,083
I wouldn't get too
excited about it.

144
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,083
After all you did get
stuck with an E-rank Butei.

145
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,083
Oh I don't care about that.

146
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,041
You're brave,
and I totally trust you.

147
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
Kinji.

148
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,416
I'd be honored if you'd agree
to be my bodyguard. Okay?

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,208
Okay, yeah.

150
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
Come to think of it,

151
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,125
aren't the other student council
members coming over today?

152
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,083
The competition starts tomorrow
and you guys have to get ready.

153
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,875
But since we're
pretty much finished,

154
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,666
we decided to take a break,
everyone's probably already

155
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,583
at the fireworks display by now.

156
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,083
There're fireworks tonight?

157
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,666
They're shooting them
off at Luckyland in Tokyo;

158
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,541
everyone's been
real excited about it.

159
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,291
So, because you're the
Student Council President

160
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,375
you have to man the fort?

161
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,250
No, they invited
me to go with them

162
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,500
but unfortunately
that's not possible.

163
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,916
Wait, you can't go? Why?

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,125
There are rules.

165
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,791
I'm not allowed outside
without permission

166
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,375
from the school and the Shrine.

167
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,541
Huh?

168
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,041
I'm a maiden of
protection for the Shrine.

169
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,458
It's an ancient tradition that

170
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,875
we spend our entire lives
inside the Hotogi Shrine.

171
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,500
Sometimes we're allowed
to leave but it's rare.

172
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,208
But they let you out to
come to school here, right?

173
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,541
Yes, but that was a decision

174
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,416
they let me make in
spite of their disapproval.

175
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,166
So I don't want to upset

176
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,750
my Shrine any more
than I already have.

177
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,083
That's tough.

178
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,708
I'll just be a minute,
if you don't mind waiting.

179
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,666
Poor girl.

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,916
I guess it's not much different
for you here at school.

181
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,791
Too bad, from
one cage to another.

182
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,875
Hey, let's take a detour.

183
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,875
What?

184
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,875
Let's go see the
fireworks display.

185
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,375
I'm not allowed to
go outside the school.

186
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,583
You can't have fun
for just one night?

187
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,791
No one else has to know.

188
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,750
You mean, it'll
just be you and me?

189
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,833
That's right.

190
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,833
I've got your security
to think about.

191
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,833
We're not saying anything.

192
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,416
Of course, I usually try to
avoid being alone with a girl.

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,041
I can't believe we
can hear the fireworks

194
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,166
from all the way over here.

195
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,125
Oh yeah.

196
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,875
I can't wait to see them.

197
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,458
Yeah.

198
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,833
Kin, I hope taking me out
isn't really boring for you.

199
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,750
Nah, I'm okay.

200
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,958
I don't ever get to talk to guys

201
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,166
that much so I don't
really know what to say.

202
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,083
I'm not very interesting.
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
I wouldn't worry about it.

204
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,625
I'm the same way.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,833
This is like a dream.

206
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,791
Looks like the fireworks
are over already.

207
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,750
Sorry. I should've
checked the start time

208
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,833
before we came all
the way out here.

209
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,000
It's okay.

210
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,416
It's not your fault
that we missed them.

211
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Besides.

212
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,125
I don't care if
there are fireworks

213
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,458
or if we just take a
walk on the beach at night.

214
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,208
The only thing that matters to
me is that it's you by my side.

215
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,666
You must be freezing
standing out here.

216
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,458
Here you go, put this on.

217
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,083
Shirayuki!

218
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,041
Hey.

219
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,041
What's wrong?

220
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,041
I'm fine.

221
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,958
Did something happen to you?

222
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,208
Not at all.

223
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,916
Your jacket, it smells like you

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,958
so I felt like you were
by my side the whole time.

225
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,750
It kinda smells like gunpowder.

226
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,333
It smells good.

227
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,250
You're a little weird.
Anyway check it out.

228
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,375
Kin.

229
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,791
Hmm? What's up?

230
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,875
The sparklers are
pretty, aren't they?

231
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,375
Yeah.

232
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,541
Do you like watching fires burn?

233
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,416
Uhh, little things
like this are alright,

234
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,416
but out of control
flames are terrifying.

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,000
It's been wired into us.

236
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,625
You're probably right.

237
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,750
I guess it's all done.

238
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
Yeah.

239
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,000
I told your fortune

240
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,666
with the shrine maiden's
fortune cards the other day.

241
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,833
What'd the cards say about me?

242
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,750
They said you
were going to leave.

243
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,250
Where am I going?

244
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,083
They didn't say.

245
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,000
Just that you were leaving.

246
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,666
I wonder if that means
I'm gonna transfer.

247
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,916
I thought maybe Aria was going

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,166
to take you away
with her somewhere.

249
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,875
There's no way that's happening.

250
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,666
But Aria's made you
a different person.

251
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,958
Ever since you met Aria,
you've become so much happier.

252
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,666
Shirayuki.

253
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm so embarrassed, Kin.

254
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,125
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,375
Hey, why are you apologizing?

256
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,666
Because I always
thought I'd be able

257
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,500
to pay you back somehow.

258
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,500
You've been so nice
taking me out like this

259
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,791
so I could have time
outside the shrine, but now.

260
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,000
This won't make sense,
but I need you to do it.

261
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,458
Pretend I'm your girlfriend.

262
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,291
Just me. No one else but me.

263
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,041
Please kiss me.

264
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,125
Dude, that is so awesome!

265
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,458
Let's do the Dragon, next!

266
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,500
The Dragon, okay?!

267
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,166
Yeah!

268
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,750
I'll light this one!

269
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,250
Man.

270
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,250
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,125
Why?

272
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,708
Let's go home now, Kin.

273
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,125
Another day guarding
her and no problems.

274
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,666
I guess this is a pretty
easy mission after all.

275
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,041
Hey, Kinji!

276
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,958
Muto is over at
the reception desk.

277
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,416
He's complaining
about you how you forgot

278
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,541
to take over his shift.

279
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,875
You should go.

280
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,791
Is it that late already?

281
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,583
She should be alright with
this many people around.

282
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,791
Shirayuki.

283
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,583
I've got relieve Muto
from reception desk duties.

284
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,916
Yeah, go ahead.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,583
See you later, then.

286
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:03,291
Kin, I'm sorry. Goodbye.

287
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,708
Oh no.

288
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,375
Where is she?!

289
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,291
Ms. Tsuzuri?!

290
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,666
Where's Shirayuki?

291
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh, she should still be
at the student council tent.

292
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,458
She isn't there now.

293
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:11,875
What?

294
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,125
Look.

295
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
I need to know if she
received a weird email.

296
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,458
If he's involved in this
thing there should've been

297
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,166
some warning signs beforehand.

298
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,416
Try to remember!

299
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,750
You mean--

300
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,125
I heard that Durandal
sends a threatening email

301
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,583
to his target on their cell
phone before he kidnaps them.

302
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,916
Durandal!

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,916
Get back here, right now!

304
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,583
What did she mean by "Goodbye"?

305
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,041
Come on, pick up, Shirayuki!

306
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,750
Please, pick up! Dammit!

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,250
Aria! Come on, answer!

308
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,750
Why isn't Aria
picking up, either?!

309
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,875
Dammit! What am I doing?!

310
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,500
I never should have left her.

311
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,541
Shirayuki asked
me to protect her.

312
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,750
How could I let this happen?!

313
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,541
Aria was trying to
tell me that things

314
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,541
were getting dangerous for
Shirayuki but I didn't listen.

315
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,125
I should have trusted her.

316
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,375
If I hadn't driven her away we
could have kept Shirayuki safe.

317
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,916
Dammit! Where are you?!

318
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,333
Aria?!

319
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,500
No.

320
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,125
This is Reki.

321
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,333
I've just been informed

322
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,625
that our client,
Shirayuki, has gone missing.

323
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,791
Yeah, you have to
help me find her now!

324
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,125
You have to calm down.

325
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,458
Your abilities are cut in half

326
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,750
when you let senseless
panic take a hold of you.

327
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,125
Right now you appear
to be in full panic.

328
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,541
You want to take
a breath and try again?

329
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,750
Yeah.

330
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,875
Who was the last
person to see Shirayuki?

331
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,625
I think it was me.

332
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,458
I saw her 12 minutes
ago near Logi's garage.

333
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,666
She doesn't have any
reason to be over there.

334
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,666
Reki, you notice anything
else that seems out of place?

335
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,375
It doesn't matter how small.

336
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,000
The doors to Logi's equipment
warehouse #3 are open.

337
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,500
Normally, that warehouse
isn't used for anything.

338
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,708
So that's odd.

339
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,125
Equipment warehouse #3?!
I'm on my way.

340
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,416
The place feels deserted.

341
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,333
An elevator?

342
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,875
I wonder where that goes.

343
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,333
You can't be serious.

344
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,750
Okay Durandal, you can come out.

345
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,166
I'm here, now you're going
to keep your promise, right?

346
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,291
Of course.

347
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,750
No harm will come to the
students of Butei High.

348
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,583
especially not Kinji Tohyama.

349
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,833
What do you want
with me, Durandal?

350
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,000
She's here!

351
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,166
I don't have any
extraordinary abilities.

352
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,958
You're being modest.

353
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,875
You're a diamond in the rough.

354
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,083
And because you're such
a poorly protected gem

355
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,375
it seemed like the natural
thing to do to reach out to you.

356
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,958
No, If I fire a gun in here

357
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,916
it could set off
all the ammunition.

358
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,500
Don't you remember?

359
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,375
I called you before.

360
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,500
That sounds, like Kin's voice.

361
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,541
Once I supplied the impetus,
you and Kinji did just

362
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,916
as I expected, especially after

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,666
that annoying
Holmes left you two.

364
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,375
Come with me, Shirayuki.

365
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,333
I'll take you to a
place more to your liking.

366
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,916
To I-U.

367
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,291
Stop!

368
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,416
Kinji!

369
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,833
Get behind me! Move!

370
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,083
No! Stay back.

371
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,666
Damn you!

372
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,708
What?!

373
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:55,125
No, Kin! No! Stop it! Let go!

374
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,375
Let her go!

375
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,250
I wouldn't be worried
about her if I were you.

376
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,375
What?

377
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,833
Not your best work, Kinji,

378
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,541
but your stupidity was the
perfect cover for a set-up.

379
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,500
Durandal, stop!

380
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,291
The kidnapping of a
minor is a serious crime!

381
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,166
You're under arrest.

382
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,583
Hey, Kinji.

383
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,291
Isn't it weird that "Durandal"
sounds kinda like "sandal"?

384
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,875
The only thing
weird here is you.

385
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,291
No, listen!

386
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,208
"Sandals" remind you of
summer and sun and stuff, right?

387
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,708
But Durandal's got ice power!

388
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:07,833
It's all backwards!

389
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,625
Ahh, but summer's also the time

390
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,208
when people eat
the most sno-cones.

391
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,250
Hey, you're right!

392
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,916
Just what I'd expect
from my slave!

393
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,375
Brilliant deduction!

394
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,666
You being a descendent of
Holmes is the weirdest part.

395
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,291
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo episode 8!

396
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,458
"Durandal"!

397
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,666
Watch it or I'll pump
you full of holes!
