1
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,458
Exactly.

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,625
The French master thief Arsene
Lupin, his great granddaughter.

3
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,583
Aria!

4
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,208
Oh Great-grandfather!

5
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,458
I did it!
I defeated her. I'm free.

6
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,208
Now I'm number one!

7
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,750
Come on, you don't
really think you can hide

8
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,750
from me on this plane do you?

9
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,916
Aria, stay with me.

10
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,958
Not good.

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,375
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,625
Just hang on.

13
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,916
Aria!

14
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,833
You came back, good girl.

15
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,041
You stupid perv, get off me!

16
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,041
Okay booby freak.

17
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,333
They're still super tiny.

18
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,958
They're stuck that way.

19
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,583
Like me, the Lilliputian
Butei walking

20
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,875
around four feet tall for life.

21
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,833
Hey, calm down.

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,166
Riko shot you.

23
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,041
No way, Riko!!

24
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,208
Wait! Calm down. Try to think.

25
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,416
You can't take her head on.

26
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,666
I don't care about that.

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,416
Let go!

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,666
Keep your voice down!

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,541
I won't!

30
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,375
I can handle Riko all by myself.

31
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,291
I didn't ask you to come save
me and I don't need your help.

32
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,375
Besides, you despise me,
don't you?!

33
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,666
You said that to me when we went
looking for that stupid cat!

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,250
The shot I gave
is working too well.

35
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,333
She's out of control.

36
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,666
If this keeps up.

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,500
You told me to my face
that you really hated me!

38
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,541
I pretended like I didn't
care but it really hurt me.

39
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,333
It broke my heart
when you said that,

40
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,833
and now I can't get
it out of my head.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,291
So forget it.

42
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,708
If you hate me, forget it.

43
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,125
Just get out of here.

44
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,000
If you hate me so much why
don't you just disappear?

45
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,166
Get out of my life forever--

46
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,625
Aria, forgive me.

47
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,083
It was the only thing
that would calm you down.

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,041
You're stupid, Kinji!

49
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,416
Why would you do that
to me at a time like this?!

50
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,875
That was, my--

51
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,125
That was the first time
I've ever been kissed!

52
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,958
 We have that in common.

53
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,666
It was mine, also.

54
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,208
Then maybe.

55
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,083
Maybe you are the one.

56
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,583
Butei Charter: Article 1.

57
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,583
Trust your friends and
help when they need it.

58
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,625
I put my trust in you, Aria.

59
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,750
Now it's time for you to put
your trust in me for a change.

60
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,750
Why don't we arrest
the Butei Killer together?

61
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,833
Hey, I just found out.

62
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,458
Has Aria's plane been hijacked?

63
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,833
Nakasorachi from Connect

64
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,958
intercepted the radio
signal by accident.

65
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,375
The plane is currently circling
above the southern Kanto area.

66
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,750
Though we still don't know
what the hijacker wants.

67
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,541
We think there may be some of

68
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,666
our Butei onboard
who are fighting back.

69
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,291
Good, so we're sure we have
Butei besides Aria on board?

70
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,333
Not yet.

71
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,291
The passenger
list didn't contain

72
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,291
any names belonging to our guys.

73
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,083
I wonder who it is.

74
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,916
I've got an update.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,625
It was a male Butei
wearing our school's uniform

76
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,541
who got on the
plane before it took off.

77
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,833
No way.

78
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,750
Of course. It has to be Kinji.

79
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,500
It's time for
our unhappy ending.

80
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,833
You went and hid Aria
somewhere, didn't you?

81
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm surprised you were able to,
under the circumstances.

82
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,458
So, where is she?

83
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,250
I don't know.

84
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,625
I just love when
you play hard to get.

85
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,083
It makes my blood

86
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,875
so hot I might just have
to kill you to cool off.

87
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,833
I just think you're so great.

88
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's see now.

89
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,541
I wonder what Ohl-mes's
partner can do.

90
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,916
An oxygen tank?!

91
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,500
Stop right there.

92
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,833
Time to die, Aria!

93
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,291
Riko Mine Lupin the 4th.

94
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,333
I'm placing you under arrest for
assault and attempted murder.

95
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
Such idiots.

96
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,458
Stop it!

97
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,583
What're you doing?!

98
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,291
See ya later, guys!

99
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,333
No!

100
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,416
Perfect, now
we're losing altitude.

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,791
Check the cockpit and
see if you can pull us up.

102
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll get Riko.

103
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
Okay!

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,416
Hey!

105
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,875
The hijacked plane is starting
to lose altitude rapidly!

106
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,208
Status.

107
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,750
It's currently at 3,300 feet.

108
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,750
That doesn't give
them much room.

109
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,000
What are they doing?

110
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,833
Are they gonna try to crash it?

111
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,250
Not yet.

112
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,458
The plane is still under
somebody's control.

113
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,833
There's no place on this plane

114
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,458
for a little rat
like you to hide,

115
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,000
so why don't you come on out.

116
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,250
Hey there.

117
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,875
I'm so glad you finally came,

118
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,541
but I wouldn't come any
closer than that, Kinji.

119
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,708
Explosives.

120
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,625
Don't act surprised--as
the Butei Killer,

121
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,791
I've always specialized
in things that go boom.

122
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,750
I have to say.

123
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,041
I didn't expect you to be
one of the 'gifted' Butei.

124
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
Paranormal Stealth ability, huh?

125
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,166
I can't share everything.

126
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,875
A girl's got her
secrets, you know.

127
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,416
So you were operating the plane

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,166
using a controller you
put in your hair, right?

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,166
That's why the plane lurched at
just the right moment for you.

130
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,083
If you're going to hijack
a plane all by yourself,

131
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,416
you need to be creative.

132
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,333
Say, Kinji. Why don't
you come join I.U.?

133
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, but just one thing.

134
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,958
I still don't know what I.U. is?

135
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,500
Why don't you tell me about it?

136
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,750
It's like a piece
of Heaven on earth.

137
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm only allowed to
take you with me though,

138
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,625
that is if you want to join us.

139
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,083
Of course, you
wouldn't be alone there.

140
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,083
Your brother's in I.U.

141
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,291
That's it.

142
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,750
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

143
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,208
Unless you want to
see me break Article 9.

144
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,500
We can't have that now, can we?

145
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,875
I'd much rather you
remained a Butei for a while.

146
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,458
But, if you ever change
your mind, don't worry.

147
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,250
We'll always
welcome you. Oh yeah.

148
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,208
I'm supposed to tell
you there's a little gift

149
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,958
from I.U. headed your way.

150
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,791
I hope you enjoy it.

151
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,166
Dammit! Riko!

152
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,750
That's not good.

153
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,791
How'd we lose the network?

154
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,541
They're cycling
the encryption code.

155
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,125
Our analysis can't
keep up with it.

156
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,458
Neither can ours.

157
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,250
The aviation radio signal
is completely scrambled.

158
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,291
Dammit!

159
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,583
Hey, Muto.

160
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,291
I think I figured it out.

161
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,500
I had a feeling
that I'd encountered

162
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,666
this particular
encryption pattern before.

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,083
What is it?

164
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,250
The Ministry of Defense
is intervening on this.

165
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,375
So sorry I'm late.

166
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,083
That's fine, and Riko?

167
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,250
She got away from me.

168
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,375
What's worse. Two engines
were hit by missiles.

169
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,166
Great. So that
was the jolt I felt.

170
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,958
She said it was a
little gift from I-U.

171
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,458
Where'd the pilots go?

172
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,125
They were both
unconscious in the galley.

173
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,958
They're gonna be
out cold for a while.

174
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,250
No one else on board
has ever flown a plane.

175
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,833
So I guess you're
the best we got.

176
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,125
The only flying experience I've
had was on single engine planes.

177
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,458
I learned how to
keep the nose straight

178
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,333
and level but that's
all I know how to do.

179
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,875
I have no idea what it takes
to land a big jet safely.

180
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,250
That's enough for us.
You'll be fine.

181
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,500
Well, you're still a big dork.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,041
Haneda control, come in,
please, it's an emergency.

183
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,458
This is the Kanto Air Defense
Force Headquarters.

184
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,875
Is this Flight #600?

185
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,625
Military?

186
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,250
That is correct. Your plane
is currently under our control.

187
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
Please update the
status of your situation.

188
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,541
Unfortunately, the hijacker
escaped using a parachute.

189
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,875
The passengers are okay.

190
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,208
Both pilots are out cold.

191
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,208
The plane is being flown
by two Butei who were onboard.

192
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,875
I'm Kinji Tohyama.

193
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,500
And the other Butei's
name is Aria H. Kanzaki.

194
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,416
Nice work, Butei Tohyama.

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,291
Await further instructions.

196
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,083
What's that?

197
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,666
It's a satellite telephone.

198
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,500
I borrowed it earlier from one
of the passengers in the back.

199
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,625
Uhh. hello?

200
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,500
Muto, It's me.

201
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,583
Sorry to call you
like this out of the blue.

202
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,208
Kinji?! Are you okay?!

203
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,833
Yeah. We're good for now.

204
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,625
I'm flying the
plane above Tokyo.

205
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,125
The hijacker got away, though.

206
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,750
So then it really was you.

207
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,583
Are you sure you're okay?!

208
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,583
Yeah, except that two of
the engines were destroyed.

209
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,000
Wait what'd you say?

210
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,583
Can you read the fuel gauges?

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,833
Currently it's 240.

212
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:38,000
235, 233, still going down.

213
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,166
Dammit!

214
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,500
That's what I was
afraid of, a major leak.

215
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,083
How long do you think we've got?

216
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,708
We're passing 230.

217
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,750
Ten minutes at best.

218
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,416
Okay, so why don't you
give me the bad news now.

219
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,458
Well, Kinji.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,416
Hey, Muto?

221
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,875
This is the Kanto Air Defense
Force Headquarters again.

222
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,375
Flight #600, come in, please.

223
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,625
We've got interference
on this one, too!

224
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,750
It looks like the
government is trying

225
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,958
to completely isolate Flight
600 for some reason

226
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,916
but I can't seem
to figure out why.

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,958
They haven't even picked up
any media coverage yet.

228
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,125
It's a total blackout.

229
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,583
That doesn't make sense.

230
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,166
It's a hijacked
commercial airliner.

231
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,541
This is Nakasorachi
from Connect.

232
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,916
It wasn't very easy

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,916
but I've intercepted
their signal,

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,458
and you're not going to like
what I've been hearing so far.

235
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,000
The government
considers the risk

236
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,291
of a crash landing too great
so they won't allow Flight #600

237
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,958
to land at either Haneda
or Narita airports.

238
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,458
Their next move is to order them

239
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,625
to ditch the plane in the
Pacific Ocean outside of Kanto.

240
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,791
If Flight 600 does not comply,

241
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,500
they'll be forced to
shoot it down out at sea.

242
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,375
I repeat. Haneda
has technical issues

243
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,916
and the runways are
currently unavailable.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,166
Circle around to the right
from your current location

245
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,833
and head towards
the Pacific Ocean.

246
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,541
A Defense Force
jet will escort you

247
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,208
to a location where you can
make an emergency landing.

248
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,958
Kinji. Let's just
do what they say.

249
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,458
What is it?

250
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,875
You can't make an emergency
landing in the ocean.

251
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,666
They just want us
to ditch the plane.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,791
That's right!

253
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,041
I'm impressed you caught that!

254
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:10,791
Muto?!

255
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,666
Who is this?

256
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,083
How did you get on this line?

257
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:13,875
Shut up!

258
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,333
Stay out of this, stooge!

259
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Kinji you have to listen to me.

260
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,458
The government
and the Defense Force

261
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,916
have already given up
trying to save you guys.

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Haneda's runways are fine.

263
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,416
They're trying avoid the public
spectacle of a botched landing.

264
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,875
They would rather
risk your lives

265
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,833
or shoot you down
if you don't go along.

266
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,333
Shoot us down?

267
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,000
Forget that!

268
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,250
We Butei never
abandon our fellow Butei!

269
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,416
We'll save those civilians
and you guys at the same time.

270
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,458
Thanks man.

271
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,458
Hey, Muto, do you know about

272
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
how many meters this
plane needs to land?

273
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,875
It depends on
the wind direction,

274
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,208
but about 2000 meters should
be enough to do the job.

275
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,750
Just barely enough.

276
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,041
What are you thinking Kinji?

277
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,666
The Academy Island
mega-float is about

278
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,708
2 kilometers long
by 500 meters wide.

279
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,875
If we land on the diagonal

280
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,166
we should have 2,000
meters to work with.

281
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,166
You're not serious?

282
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,333
Don't worry.

283
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,166
We're not going to
land on Academy Island.

284
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,875
We'll land on the
vacant island to the north.

285
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,750
But Kinji, there are no lights
anywhere on that thing.

286
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,250
It's empty.

287
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,500
In this weather, you'd never
be able to see where it was,

288
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,208
We'll figure something out.

289
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,875
You can't. Dammit!

290
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,041
Do whatever the
hell you want to!

291
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,583
We'll never even see it, huh?

292
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,000
I guess Muto was right.

293
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Aria, I'll do
my best to save us,

294
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but still you should prepare
yourself just in case.

295
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,583
Don't worry.
I know you can do it.

296
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,000
Besides, you don't
have another choice.

297
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,166
If you die as a Butei you'll
never be able to quit, right?

298
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,583
And don't forget my mom.

299
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,625
I've still got to save her.
We can't die yet.

300
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,375
The two of us are
not going down this way.

301
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,041
Not this way.

302
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,416
Hey, Kinji! You read me?!

303
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,666
I don't wanna hav'ta see
Shirayuki crying her eyes out

304
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,708
if you die, got it?!

305
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,916
We grabbed every
light we could find:

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,291
Logi's motorboats,
Amdo's search lights.

307
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,875
Hope nobody minds.

308
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,625
Just make sure you don't
crash that thing into us okay?

309
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,041
Oh yeah. And bring Aria
back to us in one piece.

310
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:17,250
Article one of the Butei
Charter, "Trust in your friends.

311
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,458
And help when they need it."

312
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,208
I'm pretty blown away
at how stupid that was.

313
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,083
I thought I was dead for sure.

314
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,708
So my mom's trial got postponed.

315
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,125
I was finally able to prove
her innocence and get all

316
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,291
of the charges dropped
in the Butei killings.

317
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,583
Good for you.

318
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,333
Hey.

319
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,458
Why'd you force your
way onboard the plane

320
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,666
to save me in the first place?

321
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,208
I would've been able to take
care of it by myself, you know.

322
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,458
I guess I don't know why.

323
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,791
I just did it.

324
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,625
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,291
That's a lie.

326
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,333
I don't think
I would've been able

327
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,708
to handle it without you there.

328
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,875
I'm finally starting
to understand

329
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,750
why it's so important for
me to work with a partner.

330
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,000
If you hadn't been there for me,

331
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,000
it could've ended a
lot worse than it did.

332
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,041
That's why.

333
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,750
I came here to
say goodbye to you.

334
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,291
You're saying goodbye?

335
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,250
I've decided I should keep
looking for my partner.

336
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,250
It would've been
nice if it were you,

337
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,791
but our deal was only to
solve a single case together.

338
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,416
That's right.

339
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,125
Kinji, I can see now
that you're a great Butei.

340
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,458
So I've decided.

341
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,333
I won't call you
a slave anymore.

342
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,250
But if you change your
mind someday, I'll be here.

343
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,875
I'd be happy to have
you as my partner.

344
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,000
I still think we
make a great team.

345
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,208
Sorry.

346
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,291
No. No, Kinji.

347
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:31,083
There'll never be anyone
else like you. Never.

348
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:35,166
You, you were the one. I'm sure.

349
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,041
I think this is
all for the best.

350
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,625
I can't continue being a Butei.

351
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,583
I'll give up one of them.

352
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,333
I mean, you were the one
who won them, after all.

353
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,291
Aria! Aria! Don't go!

354
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,708
Okay! You win!

355
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,666
I'll be your stupid
partner after all!

356
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,083
Please come back!

357
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,333
Aria! Aria!

358
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,000
What?!

359
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,958
What took you so long?!
Stupid Kinji!

360
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,500
What the hell? Oh crap!

361
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,208
That was pathetic;
all you had to do

362
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,083
was catch a tiny little girl
jumping from a helicopter.

363
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
Shut up.

364
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,083
Hey. Why did Riko
keep calling you Olmes

365
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,583
back when we were on the plane?

366
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,166
Doesn't your middle
name start with an "H"?

367
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,166
Are you trying to be stupid?

368
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,375
She was pronouncing
it the French way.

369
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,833
It's spelled H-O-L-M-E-S!

370
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,333
So what's the
big deal with that?

371
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,208
You didn't notice it before?

372
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,083
Officially, my full given
name is Aria Holmes Kanzaki!

373
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,791
Duh. As in Sherlock
Holmes the 4th!

374
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,416
Sherlock Holmes? You sure?

375
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,875
Yep.

376
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,583
The strangest
Holmes ever. It can't be.

377
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,125
Kin-Kin!

378
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,916
How come you haven't
replied to my emails?!

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,041
I heard that you're living
with a girl, is that true?

380
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,333
Who's that?

381
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,041
I'm coming in, okay, Kin?

382
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,500
I knew you'd be here!
Haa! Aria H. Kanzaki!

383
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,583
Shirayuki no!

384
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,166
Wait. You're taking
this all wrong!

385
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,791
It's not your fault, Kin!

386
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,791
You've been tricked

387
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,625
and besides that
you're just a man.

388
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,666
You thieving cat!

389
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,875
You've soiled my Kin-Kin

390
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,250
and now must pay for
that sin with your life!

391
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,958
Hey, what's her deal?!

392
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,166
Calm down, Shirayuki!

393
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,833
I haven't been soiled at all!

394
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,875
If you keep standing in the way,

395
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,625
how am I supposed to kill her!

396
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,333
Do something, Kinji!

397
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,500
What am I supposed to do?

398
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:33,541
Hey, calm down!

399
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:43,541
Hey, calm down!

400
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:53,583
Hey, calm down!

401
00:22:53,666 --> 00:23:03,583
Hey, calm down!

402
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:13,583
Hey, calm down!

403
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:23,583
Hey, calm down!

404
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:33,625
Hey, calm down!

405
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:43,625
Hey, calm down!

406
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:56,750
Hey, calm down!

407
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,166
I'm exhausted.

408
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,041
I'm surprised we got out
of that one alive, huh, Kinji?

409
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,541
Sorry, Aria. I can't be
your partner after all.

410
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm gonna quit being a Butei

411
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,625
and start a new career
in flying tomorrow.

412
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,208
What? You can't be serious!

413
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,291
I've come to understand
the beauty of flight.

414
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,125
The clear blue sky
is my new home.

415
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,458
Now I can tell you're joking.

416
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,041
Thank you for
traveling with us today.

417
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,208
If you have any questions,

418
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,458
please ask one of
the flight attendants.

419
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,000
You don't even
want to be a pilot?!

420
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,708
Next time, Aria the
Scarlet Ammo Episode 6!

421
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,166
"Maiden of Hotogi Shrine"!

422
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,791
Watch it or I'll pump
you--you know the rest!
