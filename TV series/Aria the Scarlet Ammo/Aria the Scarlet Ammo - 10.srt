1
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,333
Welcome back, master.

2
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,916
We're ready to serve you!

3
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,416
Alright then!

4
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
I call to order our
meeting of master thieves!

5
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,125
Hey, whoa.

6
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,000
Pipe down, you're
gonna give us away.

7
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,375
It's okay.

8
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:05,041
No one's listening.
Anyway. This is our target.

9
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,500
Nice, huh?

10
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,166
It's the Koumei-kan
building in Yokohama.

11
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,000
So that's where
Vlad the Bad lives.

12
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:13,916
Well.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
It's more of a summer home.

14
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,541
My treasure's locked up in a
secure safe in the basement.

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,791
If you already know that much,

16
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,875
why can't you just
break in without us?

17
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,750
Believe me, I would if I could.

18
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,541
I know it doesn't
look like much,

19
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,875
but this building
is actually a fortress.

20
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,166
And on top of that, I don't
have any intel on the basement.

21
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,500
Alright, just wondering.

22
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,416
So. What's the plan?

23
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,291
The two of you
are gonna infiltrate.

24
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,750
You learn the
layout of the hous...

25
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,333
And we rob it from the inside.

26
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:41,875
What?

27
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:42,625
Infiltrate?

28
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,958
Fer sher!

29
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,750
You're gonna go undercover
and gather information

30
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,375
by posing as their
new maid and butler!

31
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,000
Huh?

32
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,958
You... You can't be serious!

33
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,000
I absolutely refuse! No way!

34
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,125
I will not! I'm not
gonna dress like that!

35
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:05,791
Really?

36
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,958
What's the big deal?

37
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,708
You know it's
common practice for Butei

38
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,250
to accept undercover
investigations.

39
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,583
Riiight, Kinji?

40
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,916
Well uh.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,541
She does have a point there.

42
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,125
I need your assurance
on something.

43
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,541
Yeah? What?

44
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,500
If I run into Vlad
while we're in there.

45
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,041
I can arrest him, right?

46
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,500
He's also part of the
cabal that framed my mom.

47
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,958
So I wanna see him locked up.

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,125
Afraid not.

49
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,166
What?!

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,541
My intel states
that he hasn't been

51
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,500
to this house in
several decades.

52
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,416
The only people there
are the estate manager

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,458
and the housekeeping staff.

54
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,125
So forget it.

55
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,458
Then what's the point in jumping

56
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,541
through whatever hoops
you have in store for us?

57
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,291
I'm out. Do it by yourself.

58
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,333
Ohhhh?

59
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,500
Then I guess that means

60
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,750
that I'll just have
to do it with Kinji.

61
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,791
Just the two of us.

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,833
Do you mind, Kinji? I hope not.

63
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,875
It won't distract you if I don't
wear any underwear, will it?

64
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,500
Y'know, uh, actually. You win!

65
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,791
I'll do it! I can't stand back
and let you hit on my slave!

66
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,208
But.

67
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,541
You had better keep that
promise you made to me!

68
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,791
You are gonna testify!

69
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,041
But of course.

70
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,750
I may be a master thief,
but I'm not a liar.

71
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,875
I hope not.

72
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,750
'Cuz I'll mess you
up if you are lying!

73
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,625
So, Riko.

74
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,875
You ever gonna bother
telling us what we're stealing?

75
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,416
Oh! I forgot!

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,583
You're so cute, Kinji.

77
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,500
Stop saying that!

78
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,375
The object that I want
you to steal for me.

79
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,833
Well, it's a rosary.

80
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,583
My mother gave it to me.

81
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,833
It was a gift for
my fifth birthday.

82
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:41,916
You're joking!

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,083
You've got some
real nerve to ask that!

84
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,041
My mom's in prison
for crimes you committed.

85
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,458
And you want me to help steal
some gift your mom gave you?

86
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,125
Do you even realize how
ridiculous that sounds?!

87
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,416
Aria. Hey, calm down.

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,750
How can I?!

89
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,541
I can't even see my mom
without a scheduled visit!

90
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,500
Even then it's
with armed guards!

91
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,500
And it's all thanks to you!

92
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,208
It could be a lot worse, Aria.

93
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,500
And how's that?!

94
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,791
She's in jail.

95
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,625
But that's better
than being...

96
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,625
...in a coffin.

97
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,208
I have neither a
father nor a mother.

98
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,916
They're dead.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,166
They were both killed when
I was just eight years old.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,083
That Rosary's all
I have left of my mom.

101
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,958
And it means more to me
than even my own life does.

102
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,458
But. Vlad stole it.
He knew what it meant.

103
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,666
That's why he took it from me.

104
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,833
And now he's got it hidden

105
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,833
from me in a heavily
guarded location.

106
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,000
Damn him. Damn him.

107
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,750
Uh. Come on,
you don't need to cry.

108
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,083
I really don't want to see

109
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,291
what your face looks
like after your makeup runs.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,541
Just quit crying. Riko. Riko.

111
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,166
You're a cheerful girl.
So stop. And now.

112
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,166
Give 'em a smile.

113
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,541
Well, I guess we
should go huh? Aria?

114
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,291
What? And go where?

115
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,791
A whole store devoted
to maid costumes.

116
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,541
I'm surprised a place
like this even exists.

117
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,791
Noooo, stop it!

118
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,125
Cut it out, Riko!

119
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't want your
dirty fingers touching me!

120
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,833
What, I can't help it!

121
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,916
You just smell too good!

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,791
Wow, Aria! I just can't resist!

123
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,000
Get back, you pervert!

124
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,958
You and Kinji are both perverts!

125
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,875
If I really wanted to
get pervy, you'd be wearing

126
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,291
nothing but an apron
and high heels right now.

127
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,750
Voila! You are adorned!

128
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,375
Whad'ya think, Kinji?

129
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,083
Take a good look at her.

130
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,583
Every single inch.

131
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,208
Go ahead and take your time.

132
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,166
It's pretty perfect,
dontcha think?

133
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,041
I just threw a simple apron
over her school uniform!

134
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,625
Look at you, you're so cute!

135
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,458
Now, the next step.
Time to practice your speech.

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,875
What? My speech is fine.

137
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,166
It may be fine for you,

138
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,208
but it's not for
a subservient maid.

139
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,375
Act like you're her
master, okay, Kinji?

140
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,166
Huh?

141
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,958
Uhh.

142
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:06,958
First.

143
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,125
Make eye contact
with your master.

144
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,416
Repeat, after me.

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,583
Greetings, master.

146
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,250
What can I do to
serve you today? Now you.

147
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,750
No, forget it.

148
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,791
I can't say something like
that to him when he's my slave.

149
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,416
Repeat, after me.

150
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:31,416
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mas--

151
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,166
She only got the
first syllable out.

152
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,000
You can do it! Keep trying!

153
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,416
C'mon! Just say "master."

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:46,666
Ma- Ma-Maa-as-
t-t-mas-t-t-mas-t.

155
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,416
I-I can't. I don't wanna!

156
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,291
If you try hard enough,
then you can do anything.

157
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,916
You need to be more passionate!

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,791
C'mon! You can do it,

159
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,083
This is not going to end well.

160
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,083
Hello Master.
Hello Master. Hello Master.

161
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,250
Hello Master.

162
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,083
How can I serve
you today, master?

163
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,791
How can I serve you
today, master?

164
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,083
How can I serve
you today, master?

165
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,166
Now look at that.

166
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,000
I gave her special
training all day,

167
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,791
and I finally broke her
will and got her to say it!

168
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,541
She kinda looks
dead inside, though.

169
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,291
Oh, no, that's just a
normal part of the process.

170
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,625
You'll find out soon enough
now that I'm done with her.

171
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,416
What?

172
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
Meet me in sickroom seven

173
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,125
in the Ambulace wing
in fifteen minutes.

174
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,458
Be discreet.

175
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,625
Don't let anyone see you
going inside, understand?

176
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,666
But why?

177
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,416
What the hell do
I need training for?

178
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,041
You're going to find out!

179
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,750
So! I'll see you then!
Later, alligator!

180
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,000
Is that you? Kinji?

181
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,375
Durandal.

182
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,791
You know it's Jeanne.

183
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,625
I'm not looking
to start a fight.

184
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,625
So I assume that you
took a plea-bargain?

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,083
One of the terms of my probation

186
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,666
is that I have to
attend this school.

187
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,000
According to my files.

188
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,833
I'm a foreign exchange
student from Paris.

189
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,250
I'm a second year
student in Informa.

190
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,750
I hope we can get along.

191
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
Yeah. Whatever.

192
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,833
You're going to infiltrate
Vlad's residence, aren't you?

193
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,791
Who told you that?

194
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,291
It was just a guess.

195
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,125
I know the one thing Lupin
the Fourth desperately craves.

196
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,166
She wants freedom.

197
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,791
Freedom?

198
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,000
As you know.

199
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,125
Riko lost her parents
when she was a kid.

200
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,333
And. Well, she was then taken in

201
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,791
by someone claiming
to be her relative.

202
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,500
She was locked up.

203
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,791
Confined for years by herself.

204
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,916
What?

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
They didn't feed her very often.

206
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,916
And when they did,
it wasn't much.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,458
She lived in a dank cell,
wrapped up in rags to keep warm.

208
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,250
The one who locked her
up for all those years.

209
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:12,166
It was the number two of I-U,
the man known as Vlad the Bad.

210
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,458
She somehow managed
to escape once before,

211
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,833
but it didn't take to long
for Vlad to come after her.

212
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,708
He captured her again easily.

213
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,125
But after that.

214
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,375
He released her from her
cell only on one condition.

215
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,958
What was it?

216
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,583
He demanded that Riko surpass
the legacy of the first Lupin.

217
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:34,208
And only after she'd succeeded
would he leave her alone.

218
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,583
If I can defeat
Holmes the fourth,

219
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,833
then I'll exceed my
great-grandfather's legacy.

220
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,375
So that's what she was ranting
about during the hijacking.

221
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,000
There's one thing
I don't get here.

222
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,333
Why are you
telling me all of this?

223
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,916
Last I checked we were enemies.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,458
Sure, maybe we are,

225
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,625
but Vlad's an
enemy to my family,

226
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,416
and that means a
little more to me.

227
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,333
One hundred and
twenty years ago.

228
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,375
The Jeanne d'Arc twins
squared off against Vlad.

229
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,916
They teamed up with the
first Lupin to fight him.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,458
It was a stalemate.

231
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,125
Nobody won.

232
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,500
You mean Vlad's ancestor, right?

233
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,041
No, I mean Vlad himself.

234
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,083
He's that old
and he isn't human.

235
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,000
What? Then what exactly is he?

236
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,333
Well, I'm not sure how
to properly translate it

237
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,750
from the French, but if
I had to say: a demon.

238
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,791
A demon?

239
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,875
It's kind of hard to explain.

241
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,166
You have to see
him to believe it.

242
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,916
Well.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,125
I doubt that's gonna happen, he
hasn't been around for a while.

244
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,666
But it sounds like
it'll be a tough fight

245
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,000
if we do have to face him.

246
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,458
You have no idea, oh.

247
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,375
I guess I should tell you a
little-known secret about him.

248
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,166
Yeah... Okay.

249
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,875
A long time ago.

250
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,875
A paladin sent by the
Vatican marked Vlad.

251
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,708
He branded his body
with permanent patterns.

252
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,416
There are four of them,
spread out across his body.

253
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,750
They're his only weakness.

254
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,875
If you wanna bring him down.

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,500
You have to destroy all
four patterns at the same time.

256
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,125
I can show you
where they're located.

257
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,583
Except for one of them.

258
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,625
They're here, here, and here.

259
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
Study it closely.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,875
What's wrong with you?

261
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,500
Take it and remember it.

262
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,458
Uh, sure.

263
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,125
See ya.

264
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:44,583
Wow. She's not much of
an artist, is she? Aw, crap!

265
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,250
I made it just in
the nick of time.

266
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,000
He said sickroom seven, right?

267
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,333
Yeah.

268
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,041
We've got way too many
sickrooms in this school.

269
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,708
Hey. Mr. Sayonaki's not here.

270
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,583
Didn't he tell us 4:30?

271
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,291
Yeah.

272
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,916
He'll be here soon.

273
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,541
It's pretty amazing
I managed to fit in here.

274
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,333
What the hell are
you doing, Muto?

275
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,125
That's the lamest
question ever man.

276
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:36,958
C'mon. It's starting! Look!

277
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,583
I wonder why we're the only
ones who need to be rechecked?

278
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,625
Good question.

279
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,125
It's kind of a drag though.

280
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,333
Just couldn't say no
when you heard the girls

281
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,458
were getting checked again, huh?

282
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,500
Same here.

283
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,458
I came running when I heard.

284
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,791
I highly doubt
that I can get you

285
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,291
to believe me about this,
but I'll say it anyway.

286
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,166
That's not why I'm here!

287
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,041
Whoa. It's a visual feast.

288
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,500
Did you hear me?

289
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,875
Pretty nice view,
isn't it, Kinji? Well?

290
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,250
Any girls other than me making
you feel all hysteria mode-ey?

291
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,666
Damn you, Riko.

292
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,208
This is your special training?

293
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,333
Just to be safe, I've gotta make
sure you're really watching.

294
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,125
You've got ten seconds to tell
me what color my underwear are,

295
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,125
and if you don't,
then I'll open the locker!

296
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,833
Move it, Muto!

297
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,458
Riko. Riko. Where is she?!

298
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,666
Got her! Honey, gold. Send!

299
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,625
Hey, Aria. What took so long?

300
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,625
What do you mean?
I'm right on time.

301
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,208
Well now that you're here.

302
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,833
I thought this would be a good
chance to get your measurements.

303
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,166
So! Get undressed!

304
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,208
Hey, get back, perv!

305
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,750
I can do that by myself!

306
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,458
But I want to take them off!

307
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,875
Ohhh, come on, Aria!

308
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,250
No! Stop itttt!

309
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,500
You can't be serious.

310
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,458
I was just looking at her.

311
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,625
That alone spiraled
me into hysteria mode.

312
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,416
What?!

313
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,625
C'mon, girls!

314
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,083
I'm only taking new
samples of your blood!

315
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,666
You didn't have to undress!

316
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,083
Whaaaaat?

317
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,333
Oh, come on!

318
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,250
We're already undressed,
just do it like this!

319
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,416
Shouldn't you do a more
thorough examination?

320
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,041
What? Absolutely not!

321
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,875
Now get dressed this instant!

322
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,958
Why'd Sayonaki have to say that?

323
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,916
Thank you, sir.

324
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,416
What was that look for?

325
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,375
Huh? Reki?

326
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,833
Kinji!

327
00:15:53,708 --> 00:16:08,125
Hold on! I'm sorry?

328
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,333
Muto!

329
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,208
Kinji!

330
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,541
Keep your guard up!

331
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,375
A Caucasian Silver Wolf.

332
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,625
It's an endangered
species indigenous

333
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,416
to regions in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia.

334
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,000
I wanna know why it's
here, not where it's from.

335
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,083
Dammit!

336
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,333
Go after it, Kinji!

337
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,125
We've got it covered in here.

338
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,583
Kinji! My motorcycle's
outside by the bushes.

339
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,541
Use it!

340
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
Seriously, Muto?

341
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,791
You stashed a bike here
to escape after peeping?

342
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
Reki?

343
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,416
You won't be able to
find that wolf on your own.

344
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,958
Well. Put this on at least.

345
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,166
Fine.

346
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,458
He was in hysteria mode.

347
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeahhh.

348
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,916
I had a pretty good feeling
that's all it would take.

349
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,750
Damn. Did I lose the trail?

350
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,041
Follow the next off ramp

351
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,166
to the building construction
site on your left.

352
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,666
I saw the wolf
climbing the stairs.

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
I'm glad you're with me, Reki.

354
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,500
Those are
definitely wolf tracks.

355
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,750
The last time
I caught a glimpse of it,

356
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,583
it was on the eighth floor.

357
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,125
Reki. Do you have
any tranquilizers?

358
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,625
No. I'll just use
a normal bullet.

359
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,666
Alright.

360
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,875
I was really hoping we
wouldn't have to kill it,

361
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,500
but we I guess
don't have a choice.

362
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,541
This is tough.

363
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,125
An assassin's heart.

364
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,291
I guess it doesn't
bother her at all.

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,416
What is it?

366
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,458
It's nothing. Come on.
Let's do what we have to.

367
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,541
Right.

368
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,375
She was correct about
it being this floor.

369
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,791
It was a trap.

370
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,083
I'm really sorry,
but I've gotta put you down.

371
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,041
I am a single bullet.

372
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,541
Bullets do not
have human emotions.

373
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,916
Therefore. I do not falter.

374
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,500
My sole concern is
connecting with my target.

375
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,666
No way. Reki missed?

376
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,458
I guess you're
human after all, Reki.

377
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,916
I've been human
since I was conceived.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But now I know
you've got a soft side.

379
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,583
I bet you missed the shot

380
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,416
because you felt
sorry for that wolf.

381
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:38,458
Who said I missed the shot?

382
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:43,458
Who said I missed the shot?

383
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,708
I intentionally shot it

384
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,208
so the bullet
would graze the area

385
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,083
between the spine and
the dorsal vertebrae.

386
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,666
Your spinal nerves are
temporarily paralyzed.

387
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,250
That's why you can't
get up. But don't worry.

388
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,583
It'll wear off soon and
you'll be able to move.

389
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,416
You can try to
run away if you want.

390
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,458
But if you do, just
know you won't get far.

391
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,041
My next bullet
will find your heart.

392
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,875
Abandon your master.

393
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,708
From now on, I'm in charge.

394
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,458
Holy crap. She shot
it into submission.

395
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,791
So what now?
What're ya gonna do with it?

396
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,625
I'll keep him.

397
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,875
Huh? Keep it?

398
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,541
That's the only reason
I went after him.

399
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:28,250
Oh, I didn't realize that.

400
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,083
But you know pets
aren't allowed in the dorm.

401
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,750
I'll get permission to
train him as a Butei dog.

402
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,833
Dog? There's no way
they're gonna go for that.

403
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,208
Shake hands.

404
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,125
Well. Maybe they will.

405
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,833
Hey, I'm home.

406
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,916
It took you long
enough to get home.

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,583
You got anything
you wanna tell me?

408
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,083
Like why you were hiding
inside that locker?

409
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,916
Whoa, wait, Aria. Riko told me--

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,750
So you were perving
out over her again?!

411
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,708
That's not true!

412
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,041
It wasn't her, you made me--

413
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,166
What?

414
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:12,333
You-- you are such a-Super perv!

415
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,541
Peeping tom pervert!

416
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,666
Wait, listen!

417
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,833
New holes for you!
Holes, holes, holes!

418
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,708
Deadly holes!

419
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,583
For your face! And your stomach!

420
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,708
I am so glad these
shirts are bullet proof.

421
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,875
I'm sorry for doubting you about
the peeping debacle, Kinji.

422
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh! So you understand now?

423
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,000
While you were in that closet,

424
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,000
you were actually messing
around with Muto, weren't you?

425
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:05,875
What?

426
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,250
It's nothing to be ashamed of!

427
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,541
I read all about it
in Shirayuki's book.

428
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,916
Some guys are just into that.

429
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,333
So I'll go explain to
everyone and clear the air!

430
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,083
What?! No, wait! Ariaaaaa!

431
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,375
Next time on Aria
the Scarlet Ammo!

432
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,416
"Infiltration"!

433
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,583
Everyone!

434
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,666
Kinji and Muto are
gonna get some holes!

435
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,208
That doesn't even make sense.
