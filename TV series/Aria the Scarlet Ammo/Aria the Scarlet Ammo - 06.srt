1
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,041
You didn't notice it before?

2
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,291
Offically, my actual full
name is Aria Holmes Kanzaki!

3
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,666
As in Sherlock Holmes the 4th!

4
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,375
Sherlock Holmes? You sure?

5
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,541
Yep.

6
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,958
The strangest
Holmes ever. It can't be.

7
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,083
Kin-Kin!

8
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,875
How come you haven't
replied to my emails?!

9
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,750
I heard that you're living
with a girl, is that true?

10
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,833
Who's that?

11
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,083
I'm coming in, okay, Kin?

12
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:21,625
I knew you'd be here!
Aria H. Kanzaki!

13
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,875
Shirayuki, no! Wait!

14
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,250
You're taking this all wrong!

15
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,083
It's not your fault, Kin.
You've just been tricked

16
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:29,625
and besides that you're
just a man. You thieving cat!

17
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,833
You've soiled my Kin-Kin

18
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,541
and now must pay for
that sin with your life!

19
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,250
Hey, what's her deal?!

20
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
Calm down, Shirayuki!

21
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,708
I haven't been soiled at all!

22
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,625
Aria H. Kanzaki!

23
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,208
It's time for you
to meet your maker!

24
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:51,708
Hey!

25
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,583
What's wrong with you?!

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,750
Feeeel my wraaath!

27
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,000
Holy crap?!

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,708
She knows sword catching?!

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,583
Why are you doing this?!

30
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,583
Shut up, you thieving cat!

31
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,708
Get off!

32
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,833
I'm gonna make you disappear!

33
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,833
What are you talking about!

34
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,500
Listen to me, you nutcase!

35
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,625
Stop!

36
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,625
Please both of you knock it off!

37
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,000
I tried to be rational!

38
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,875
It's time to pump some holes!

39
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,500
Hey!

40
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,833
You're a paranormal?!

41
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,666
Yep.

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,250
She's a paranormal Butei.

43
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Simply put, she's got
supernatural powers.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Hotogi Shrine is located
in a suburb of Aomori.

45
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,208
Shirayuki hails from
a long line of maidens

46
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,458
who've served the Hotogi Shrine.

47
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,875
And when it comes
to Shrine Maidens,

48
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,958
you can be sure of two things: 

49
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
They're always armed,

50
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,208
and they wield a supernatural
power called kidojutsu.

51
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,000
I've always been
skeptical of people

52
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,041
with supernatural powers,
but they do exist.

53
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,708
The fact Riko
turned out to be one

54
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,041
is still pretty
fresh in my mind.

55
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,708
Butei High even has a
wing for paranormal Butei,

56
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,291
the Department of Supernatural
Selective Research,

57
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,583
otherwise known as SSR.

58
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,250
Shirayuki's apparently
at the top of her class.

59
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,916
And when you match
Shirayuki's powers

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,666
with an S-rank Butei like Aria.

61
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,375
Well, it tends to
turn out like this.

62
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,666
You are stubborn.

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,166
You know that.

64
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,125
Yeah.

65
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,500
You're one to talk.

66
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,000
So, why don't you girls
give talking a try now.

67
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,166
Kin-Kinnnn!

68
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,708
I'm sorry!

69
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,416
You wouldn't have
chosen a girl like her

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,333
if I'd had more courage!

71
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,916
You're not exactly lacking in
bravery, you maniac!

72
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,541
It's bad enough you
and Kin-Kin are in love!

73
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,541
Don't rub it in!

74
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,291
What? There's no love here!

75
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
How stupid are you?

76
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,208
I don't give a flaming
crap about being in love!

77
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,333
I've never been in love
and I'm never going to be!

78
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,166
Wait, then you and Kin-Kin...
He's not your boyfriend?

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,291
No, of course not!

80
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,416
Then what is he?!

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,458
He's my... my uh... my slave!

82
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,833
Your--he's your slave?!

83
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,375
You, you mean you're already
doing kinky stuff like that?!

84
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,750
I mean, sure, I admit it.

85
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,958
I've often fantasized about

86
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,083
being Kin-Kin's
slave before. But!

87
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:53,916
What?!

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,583
Dammit Kinji! Explain this!

89
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,875
Explain what?

90
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,875
Look. We're working
together as Butei...

91
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,708
I'm Aria's temporary partner.

92
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,416
Huh? Really?

93
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,708
Do you really have that
much trouble believing me?

94
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,625
No. I-I believe you.

95
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,916
Sooo...

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,375
If that's all it is,

97
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,375
then you two aren't fooling
around or anything, right?

98
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,416
Fooling around?

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,583
Y'know.

100
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,083
You haven't kissed, right?

101
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,875
Then, you did?

102
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,750
Calm down, Shirayuki,
it's not like you think!

103
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,208
Yes, it's true we kissed,
but it meant nothing!

104
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,208
And it's fine!

105
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,041
There's nothing to worry about,

106
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,625
because I didn't
get pregnant from it!

107
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,416
Huhhhhh?!

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,291
Well, my father told
me kissing someone

109
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,000
is what causes
you to get pregnant!

110
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,666
Of course not!

111
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,166
Shirayuki.

112
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,666
Hey! So listen, about yesterday.

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,416
Hey. Hold on.

114
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,041
I take it she's
still pissed off.

115
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,333
Class, the "Adosiade,"

116
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,375
the annual Butei
competition, is coming up.

117
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,166
Since the event is being
held at our school this year,

118
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,625
we'll have Butei students

119
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,541
from around the world
coming to compete,

120
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,666
plus their families--

121
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,083
Hey Kinji were you planning

122
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,125
on participating in any of
the events for this thing?

123
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,708
Well that's a
dumb question, man.

124
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,166
They don't want an
E-rank Butei participating.

125
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,333
I thought so.

126
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,333
Do you wanna work
reception with me then?

127
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,250
'cause Shiranui
backed out on me.

128
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,125
I'm in the shooting competition.

129
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,291
Aria dropped out.

130
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,458
So they're forcing
me to take her place.

131
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,458
Huhhh. Well, I don't
mind working at reception.

132
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,625
But why did you
drop out of this, Aria?

133
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,541
Jeez, what the hell
are you reading about

134
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,583
this early in the morning?

135
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
So that's what men really want.

136
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,208
Huh?

137
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,833
You're a bunch of perverts!

138
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,541
You should've dodged that,
you worthless Butei.

139
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,250
Okay. I wish I could have.

140
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,250
Well.

141
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,625
I guess we should
work on it then.

142
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,958
Huh?

143
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:46,583
Helloooo? Aria! Heyyyyy!

144
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,958
Guess who!

145
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,791
You're the one who asked
me to meet you here.

146
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,541
You could have--

147
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,708
You should never allow
anyone to sneak up on you.

148
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,583
Um.

149
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,375
Why are you dressed like that?

150
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,458
Oh, I thought I told you.

151
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,541
I signed up to cheerlead
at the Adosiade.

152
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,875
So I've gotta practice.

153
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,166
Cheer. You mean Arkata?

154
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,958
If you're asking me to help
you practice, I have to decline.

155
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,375
You've got a split personality.

156
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,708
Huh?

157
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,875
I looked into it right
after the hijackings.

158
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,291
You've clearly got
dissociative identity disorder.

159
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,750
It's probably a coping mechanism
from some childhood trauma.

160
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,916
And that personality takes
over when you're in combat.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,708
You're not the sleuth
your great-grandfather was.

162
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,083
Hysteria mode isn't
a psychogenically--

163
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,291
acqquired condition.

164
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,541
It's a neurogenic
inherited condition.

165
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,916
Hey! Listen to me!

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,416
If you need that
kind of combat stress

167
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,875
to activate your other side,

168
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,833
then I will be
happy to provide it!

169
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,000
Ow!

170
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,083
We're gonna tame
those wild mood swings!

171
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,750
Then you can turn your
abilities on and off at will.

172
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,208
That freakin' hurt, you nut.

173
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,750
I've decided the
most effective way

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,041
to properly tame you is to start
by teaching you how to block

175
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
attacks using the sword
catching technique.

176
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,666
You can't be serious!

177
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,625
Now, the best way to learn
this is through muscle memory,

178
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,708
so I want you to practice

179
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,166
catching an imaginary
one, understand?

180
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,375
500 reps.

181
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,500
So it's imaginary training?

182
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,375
We can still use this
if you really want to.

183
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,000
The other way is fine.
Let's get started.

184
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,458
There you go.

185
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,291
I like it when you're good
and obedient, Kinji.

186
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,125
Now you keep
it up and work hard.

187
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,291
You should be showing
better results by now.

188
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,500
It's only been a few hours!

189
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,708
We'll continue with
your taming tomorrow.

190
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,041
What? Who says
you get to decide--

191
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,583
You're my partner,
so it's my responsibility

192
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,791
to make sure you're properly
tamed and ready for anything.

193
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,416
Attention Shirayuki Hotogi.

194
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,541
Shirayuki?

195
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,625
But they never call
her to the office.

196
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,041
Please report to
your Master's office.

197
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,041
Your homeroom teacher--

198
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,000
Kinji.

199
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,666
Yeah.

200
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,500
This is our chance.

201
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,833
Huh?

202
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,750
It's the perfect time to
discover her weak points.

203
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,833
Huh?

204
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,750
Shirayuki almost
killed me today.

205
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,083
And? You almost killed
each other last night.

206
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,666
But it was for real today.

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,791
Somebody tried to set a trap for
me in the girls' locker room.

208
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,375
A trap?

209
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,708
She must've
anticipated me having

210
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,541
to step further into my locker.

211
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,250
So she strung up piano
wire to lop off my head.

212
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,750
Piano wire?

213
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,333
That's way too brutal for her.

214
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,833
I know she's mad at you,
but Shirayuki wouldn't--

215
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,250
Or, uh, she might.

216
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,500
No, there's no way.

217
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,958
On top of that, I feel
like I'm being followed.

218
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,916
And someone dumped water
on me from the bridge.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,875
And I found a letter
with "thieving cat" written

220
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,541
on it in my shoe locker.

221
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,791
Know anyone else who's
called me that lately?

222
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,000
Shirayuki.

223
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,000
What's goin' on with
these test scores?

224
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,875
It's just not like you
to score under a 90.

225
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,375
I- I know, I'm really
sorry, Ms. Tsuzuri.

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,666
Well, It's not the
scores I'm worried about.

227
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,875
They just struck
me as a red flag.

228
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,833
I've gotta ask.

229
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,666
He hasn't tried to make
contact with you has he?

230
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,791
"He" who?

231
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,416
Look I've already
read the report

232
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,875
that Lezzad filed ranking
you as a likely target.

233
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,458
And the same prediction
came in from SSR, as well.

234
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,916
I'm talking about Durandal.

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,833
Oh.

236
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,250
She said Durandal?

237
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,500
But everyone says that
Durandal's not even real,

238
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,958
that he's just a myth.

239
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,416
Yeah, but what do you plan
on doing if he's not a myth?

240
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,750
Everything I've
heard about him says

241
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,583
that he only abducts
major paranormal Butei.

242
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,708
I don't see why he'd
wanna come after me.

243
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,375
C'mon, Shirayuki, you're
one of our best students.

244
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,708
I think you should play it safe

245
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,000
and at least keep a
bodyguard around, you know?

246
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,833
But, uh.... If I've got
a bodyguard with me,

247
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:28,208
well, when will I take
care of Kin-Kin?

248
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,416
The school is gonna be crawling

249
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,833
with outsiders
once Adosiade begins.

250
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,708
Why not hire one
until it's over?

251
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,291
It should help you relax
some, at least. Right?

252
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,083
Yeah, but still, I--

253
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:39,750
What the--

254
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,708
Look no further!

255
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,083
I'll be your bodyguard!

256
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,250
Aria! What're you
doing up there?!

257
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,083
I'll work around the
clock as your bodyguard

258
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,458
and I'll do it for free!

259
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Huh?

260
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,208
Wow. You're an S-rank Butei
and you'll guard her for free?

261
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,333
Well that's great news.

262
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,666
No! No way.

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,666
The thought of spending
that much time around her?

264
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,416
It makes me sick!

265
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,166
If you don't hire me,
I'll just have to shoot you.

266
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
Aria! Butei
Article 9! Article 9!

267
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,791
Kin-Kin!

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,625
Ohhh, I get it.

269
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,541
I've always wondered what this
Kin-Kin of yours looked like.

270
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,166
What do you wanna do, Shirayuki?

271
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,875
Fine, I'll agree to hire
Aria as my bodyguard. But!

272
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,125
Huh?

273
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,333
The only way I'll do it is
if Kin-Kin guards me too!

274
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,166
And I'm talking
about around the clock!

275
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,583
And! This means...

276
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,208
I'm going to move into
Kin-Kin's dorm room!

277
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,041
Why me? What did I do?

278
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,125
G-good day. My name's Shirayuki.

279
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,791
And I'll be living
here with you.

280
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,666
Um.

281
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Let me know if I can help you.

282
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,250
I'll do anything.

283
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,083
Why are you acting like
we don't know each other?

284
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,291
I'm a little nervous
about the whole thing.

285
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,708
Living with you and all.

286
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,750
Well, I should do some
cleaning before I make dinner.

287
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,541
Seriously.

288
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,916
What happened to the
peaceful life I used to live?

289
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,291
Hey.

290
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,458
What exactly are you doing?

291
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,458
Oh.

292
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,625
I'm adding a
new security system.

293
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,458
That's the first step
to guarding someone.

294
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,166
Why don't you just drop the act?

295
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,875
You're just trying to figure out
all of Shirayuki's weaknesses.

296
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,375
Nope. I've got a new goal.

297
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,666
I'm gonna catch Durandal.

298
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,541
What?

299
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,833
He's on my list.

300
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,208
He's one of the many
people who framed my mom.

301
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,500
If I can capture him,

302
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,916
it'll knock another life
term off her sentence.

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,791
If it works out like
I'm hoping it will,

304
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,708
we might be able
to get her a retrial.

305
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,833
She gets even more intense

306
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,833
than usual when it
comes to her mother.

307
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,708
I thought it was
common knowledge

308
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,041
that Durandal is
just an urban legend.

309
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
It's not like anyone
has seen him.

310
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,875
That's a load of crap!

311
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,416
I guarantee you that he's real!

312
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,875
Oh, yeah?

313
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,458
I take it you've seen this
guy with your own eyes then?

314
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,791
Uh. Well. Not really.

315
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,833
Thought so.

316
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,333
But that doesn't
mean he's not real!

317
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,166
He framed my mom,
so he's gotta be!

318
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,916
How do you know it
wasn't someone else?

319
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,791
I just know it
was him, so shut up!

320
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,875
Whatever.

321
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,458
Why don't you
make yourself useful!

322
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,041
Go check the dresser in
the hallway for booby-traps!

323
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,500
You're kidding now, right?

324
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,166
I'll install the system
in the bedroom.

325
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,791
Go on! Move it, move it!

326
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,041
Shirayuki must've brought
this dresser with her.

327
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,416
I doubt there's
anything dangerous--

328
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,208
Okay. That's a different
kind of dangerous.

329
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,041
No!

330
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,375
What's the matter, Shirayuki?

331
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,458
Did you break something?

332
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,250
Oh, Kin-Kin. I'm so sorry!

333
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,291
Your extra strong cold medicine.

334
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,458
I remember you telling
me that's the only stuff

335
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,125
that works for you
when you get sick.

336
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,166
It's really
expensive too isn't it?

337
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,416
No. You just have
to go out to Ameyoko

338
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,083
to find a store that carries it.

339
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,666
It's really not a big deal,
don't worry about it.

340
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,541
You haven't changed
at all, Kin-Kin.

341
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Just as kind as
you've always been.

342
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,083
Come on. Who would
get mad over this?

343
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,791
You just go ahead with
whatever you were doing

344
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,458
and I'll clean this up, okay?

345
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,791
Sure.

346
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,958
Well! Bon appetite!

347
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,291
Whoaaa.

348
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,375
I tried hard to think of
everything you might like.

349
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,583
Wow.

350
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,791
Well, thanks a lot,
it all looks delicious.

351
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,208
Do you want a bath after dinner?

352
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:11,125
I could draw the water.
Or, y'know, I could--

353
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Huh?

354
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,708
Alright. You tryin'
to starve me now

355
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,791
since the piano
wire didn't work?

356
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,833
Are you serious?!

357
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,750
If you're going to start
complaining, I'll fire you!

358
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,041
Alright, that's it!

359
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,583
Fine, you wanna go?!

360
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,958
I'll get to use the trump card
I was hiding the other day!

361
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,041
Well I was hiding
two trump cards!

362
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,625
So what're ya
gonna do about that?!

363
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,875
I'm gonna win because
I was hiding three!

364
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:33,750
Well I've got four!

365
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,208
Five!

366
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,750
Thousands!

367
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,833
Hundreds of thousands!

368
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,250
At any rate, this is how Aria

369
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,208
and I started
protecting Shirayuki.

370
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,416
We all walk to school together.

371
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,375
Aria handles the
duty during class.

372
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,583
Open up, Kin-Kin. Say ahhhh!

373
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,583
And then I join
them during lunch.

374
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,791
It was my shift after school,

375
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,916
but I felt more
like a therapist.

376
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,666
What? You guys got
in another fight?

377
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,125
She's ordering me around!

378
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,041
She told me that the lunch
break is dedicated to taming

379
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,916
and that I need to
quit interfering with it.

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,833
Yeah, it's training, not taming.

381
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,416
She's gotta get on your nerves.

382
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
She pokes her nose
into everything you do.

383
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,375
And she tries to act like she's
a part of our little world.

384
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,166
I didn't even know
we had a little world.

385
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,041
On one level, I think
she's kind of amazing.

386
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,166
Well, on a certain level.

387
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,916
I'm afraid she'll
steal you from me.

388
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,708
She's so much more
charming than I am.

389
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,625
Like I told you.

390
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,666
She and I only work together.

391
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,958
Besides, I've known
you way longer than her.

392
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,708
Yeah, I guess you're right.

393
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,958
It's funny to think.

394
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,875
I can't believe
it's been so long.

395
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,666
But you really are one
of my oldest friends.

396
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,708
It was against the rules for me
to leave the Hotogi Shrine,

397
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,125
but I remember how
you convinced me

398
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,583
to sneak out for the first time.

399
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,750
You took me
to see the fireworks.

400
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,791
And they were so beautiful.

401
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,916
Yeah, but you got in
serious trouble for doing it.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,291
It was worth it, though.

403
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,291
And you kept coming
back to visit me.

404
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,291
So I was happy.

405
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,500
We were so young.

406
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,041
But even then, I think
I must've sympathized with her.

407
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,708
♪ The crane and the
turtle slipped and fell. ♪

408
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,708
♪ Who's behind you,
behind you now. ♪

409
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:06,166
♪ Caged bird,
caged bird, all locked up. ♪

410
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,708
It's probably because
I heard what all

411
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
the adults called Shirayuki

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
and her sisters whenever
they weren't around.

413
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,458
They called them
the caged birds.

414
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:20,083
♪ Caged bird, caged bird,
poor caged bird. ♪

415
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,750
What?

416
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,416
Um, hello?

417
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,041
Shirayuki!

418
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,666
It's me!

419
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
Kin-Kin?!

420
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,333
Kin-Kin, what's wrong?!

421
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:56,958
Hey!

422
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,166
What're you-?!

423
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,166
Why did you call my
phone and say "help me"?

424
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,291
What?

425
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,791
Why would I call you
from the bathroom?

426
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,083
I don't know, but I know it
was your voice on the phone.

427
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,583
I, uh... Kin-Kin,
you--you're not wearing.

428
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,791
Huh? So?

429
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,958
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I admit I was just now

430
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,708
fantasizing about seeing
you naked in the bathtub!

431
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,000
But I wasn't trying to!

432
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,916
It was just having a fantasy!

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,083
I'm such a bad girl!

434
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,791
Hey, don't worry 'bout it.

435
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,083
But. What's up
with this phone call?

436
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,250
It's only fair.

437
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,500
Huh?

438
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,458
It's only fair if you
see me get undressed.

439
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,416
That way we'll be
even with each other.

440
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,250
Whoa, hold on!

441
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,708
Stop it! We're even!

442
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
No!

443
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,458
We're not even until you
see me with my shirt off!

444
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,791
Hey! I don't want things
to be even, alright?

445
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,416
Stop, Kin-Kin!
Just let me do it!

446
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,125
Please cut it out!

447
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,958
Hey, I'm back.

448
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,958
Why, you. You dirty pervert!

449
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,833
Worthless degenerate!
You're an animalllll!

450
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,625
No, stop it!

451
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,916
Don't shoot me, Ariaaaaaa!

452
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,875
It's time for the
festival of holes, you scum!

453
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,833
Quit acting like a poor sport.

454
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,541
What?!

455
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,000
You're calling me that?!

456
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,500
You're just mad because you
found Kinji embracing me.

457
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,250
Are you kidding?

458
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,125
I don't care about that!

459
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,125
Kinji. I heard
you've got a cold.

460
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,500
I wonder whose fault that is.

461
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,583
Well don't worry.

462
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,625
I found some old
natural folk remedies...

463
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,000
Try to hold your breath
for as long as you can.

464
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,541
Then drink a glass of
water while upside down.

465
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,708
Press the accupoint behind
your ear and think about tofu.

466
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,375
Boil some water with persimmon.

467
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,666
Boo! Well, did it work?

468
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,500
Aria.

469
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,458
That's how you cure hiccups.

470
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,666
Next time on
Aria the Scarlet Ammo!

471
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,041
"Caged Bird."

472
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,291
Now watch out or
I'll pump some holes in you!
