1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,458
Yeah, you've got
a job to capture me,

2
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,416
but as a policewoman, you've
also got a duty to save lives.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,333
Am I right?

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,125
What?

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,666
Here's the deal, Angel.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,791
Right now you and I are the
only two souls on this planet

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,208
who know that the godforsaken
bomb is still gonna blow.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,625
I couldn't give a shit less
for the guys who are out there

9
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,583
killing themselves over
politics, but it'd be pretty

10
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,083
damn lousy if all the good
people just blew up today.

11
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,291
I want you to try to get
as many civilians off of

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,000
this planet as you can in the
time we have left, Angelica.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,750
Can you do that?

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,916
You still...

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,458
haven't said why you're staying.

16
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,791
Because I still have
family on this planet, Angel.

17
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,958
And you already know

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,416
that coyotes don't
betray their families.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,375
Even if it kills 'em.

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,291
Mister...

21
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,333
I...

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,625
I...

23
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,208
I'm not much of
a romantic, either.

24
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,000
Hm?

25
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,750
Slide over, honey.

26
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,750
I'll take the wheel.

27
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,041
Okay.

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,125
Let's roll!

29
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,875
End of the line, kid.

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,250
Countin' on ya.

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,541
I need ya to tell
as many people

32
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,500
as ya can about
that other photonic bomb.

33
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,458
So they can get out of here.

34
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,125
Good luck.

35
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:37,833
Mister.

36
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,125
Hm?

37
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,916
When this is over...

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,875
...I'm still going
to track you down.

39
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,625
I'll be waiting.

40
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,125
Right!

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,041
We're running out of time.

42
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,625
Let's get a move on.

43
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,958
Meany!

44
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,833
What the heck
was that for, Angelica?!

45
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,625
What's our status?

46
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,458
We are currently searching
for the two female detectives.

47
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,791
Apparently, one of our
armored cars assisted

48
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,541
them with their escape.

49
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,791
I'm verifying that with our
ground force now, Mother.

50
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,375
April, October, November and
December are currently heading

51
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,416
towards the Godwing area from
Graceland's Philip Desert.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,958
January,.

53
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,750
March, June, July and August
are exploring the caves and they

54
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,791
still haven't reported sighting
the Gigabanks vault yet.

55
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,875
May is still on stand--by.

56
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,250
Well done.

57
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,958
Listen to us!

58
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,916
I'm telling you...

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
that bomb's still gonna go off!

60
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,458
It's buried underground
not far from here!

61
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,750
Go see it for yourself!

62
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,250
All right.

63
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,250
Let's see if
I've got this straight.

64
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,458
You're trying to tell me
there's still a photonic bomb

65
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,583
buried in Godwing, and
the Jupiter bomb was a fake.

66
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,791
We're all in terrible
danger and need to leave.

67
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,958
You think I should buy
into a story like that?

68
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Yes.

69
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
You should.

70
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,625
I'm not so sure.

71
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,333
Now, let me tell you
what I think.

72
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,416
Rumor has it there's a Federal
Inspector with Presidential

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,125
orders running around half
the galaxy bossing around

74
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,833
any government
official she meets.

75
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,083
Pleased to meet you.

76
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,333
I don't know what
game you're playing,

77
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,833
but the Graceland Liberation
Forces have already given

78
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,458
the dogs of the Federation
all the answer they deserve!

79
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,375
Now get the hell out!

80
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,708
This isn't good...

81
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,125
While you're posturing,

82
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,541
Federation forces are
already evacuating this planet!

83
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,750
If your intelligence
network is worth a damn,

84
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,166
you'd have already
figured that much out!

85
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,791
Isn't that why
you let us in here?

86
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,666
So you could figure out why
the Federation pulled out of

87
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,083
the bloodiest battle
in the war so far?!

88
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,916
The truth's hard to swallow.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,375
And you don't have
a lot of time left...

90
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,500
Please!

91
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,791
So where's the next base?

92
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,791
It's uh...

93
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,500
right here!

94
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,125
Okay.

95
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,291
Let's go.

96
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,791
We're not giving up!

97
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,083
Oh, man!

98
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,666
Wev'e got under seven hours now.

99
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,375
Katana!

100
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,708
There!

101
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,500
There's a tunnel on
the other side of that rock.

102
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,000
Ah perfect!

103
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,083
Mister...

104
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,916
we'll be waiting for you.

105
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,500
Angelica?

106
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,416
Hm?

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,083
Those soldiers we saw...

108
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,416
Do you think they believed us?

109
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,958
Can't tell.

110
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,750
They could contact
the other bases in their

111
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,708
communications network
if they wanted to.

112
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,000
If we could just get
one of them to do it.

113
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,333
Yeah, really.

114
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,750
Chelsea?

115
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,000
What is it?

116
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,208
You said you wondered
what motivated me to go

117
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,166
after Mister in
the first place.

118
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,083
You wanna know?

119
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,583
You'll tell me?

120
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,750
I was just fresh out of

121
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,708
the police academy
and still 22 years old.

122
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,416
Around then, he was wanted
on another criminal charge.

123
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
It's been eight years.

124
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,125
GC Twenty Thirty--Three.

125
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:29,958
Oh!

126
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,291
The Diamondhead Job!

127
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,625
You got it!

128
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,125
Back then...

129
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,250
that was the
first time I saw him.

130
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,833
That very first case...

131
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,666
Heh...

132
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,250
I was new to the force and

133
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,791
I was stuck on traffic control
at the intersection from hell.

134
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,416
At the peak of the commute,
all the honking and exhaust

135
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,291
would beat down on you
like a ton of bricks.

136
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,833
It was hotter than hell that
day and I was losing my mind

137
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,083
trying to direct traffic.

138
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,541
And then...

139
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,000
The noise died...

140
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,375
like there'd never
been any to begin with.

141
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,166
Just like time hiccupped...

142
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,291
and stopped.

143
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,875
And then, I started to
make out something shining

144
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,708
in the distance.

145
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:23,541
It was so big, I couldn't
tell it was tsunami at first.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,125
Everyone, get to the high
ground as quick you can!

147
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,541
Get moving!

148
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,166
And there he was,
grinning like a little boy,

149
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,000
like no one in world could
possibly have more fun

150
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,916
than he was having...

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,750
Despite the danger
of the situation.

152
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,416
What are you doing?

153
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
C'mon!

154
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,375
Back then it's like
I was dreaming.

155
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,625
But you can bet after that
I thoroughly investigated

156
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,625
this "Mister." And four years
ago, there was another event

157
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,208
that led to my appointment as
an investigator specializing

158
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,250
in tracking him down.

159
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,875
That was GC 2037.

160
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
The Firegate Incident!

161
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,333
Right again!

162
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,666
Someone attempted to involve the
president in that scandal...

163
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,041
Yup.

164
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,041
I found out about that
while I was on Mister's tail

165
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,291
And that just happened to
bring that particular scandal

166
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,833
to a close.

167
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,625
That's why you have all those
presidential authorizations!

168
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,791
The Guild was trying to

169
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,416
put a presidential
candidate into office!

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
And you were sent
to rat them out!

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,708
Maybe...

172
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,708
Yeah?

173
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,208
Never mind.

174
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,625
Maybe I've been lying
to myself these last

175
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,833
eight years since
I saw him on Diamondhead.

176
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,708
Perhaps, as a cop, I was trying
to suppress my true feelings,

177
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,875
telling myself I was just
chasing after a "criminal."

178
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,750
Right, Mister?

179
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,416
Nilson...

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,333
Are you really going?

181
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,333
Yes...

182
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:25,083
it's time to settle the score.

183
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,166
With Mister?

184
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,791
Myself.

185
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,166
Only then will I be satisfied.

186
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,750
I see.

187
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,250
Mother, we've received word from
our squad exploring the caves.

188
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,416
Mister's been sighted in
Godwing, point zero three.

189
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
We're launching our attack now.

190
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,083
Very well.

191
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,625
Don't die out there.

192
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,083
When you get old like I am,

193
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,541
having your familiars around
makes things less lonely.

194
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,625
Nilson?

195
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,916
Yes ma'am?

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,333
Have I really been
living an honorable life?

197
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,208
You're still going to be
the most powerful woman

198
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,666
in the galaxy when
this is done, aren't you?

199
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625
Don't doubt yourself now!

200
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,583
Mister...

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,916
Hm?

202
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,958
Mister!

203
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,125
Hey!

204
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,500
Mister!

205
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,625
Sorry I'm late.

206
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,625
We've got a new problem, Boss.

207
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,250
Yeah, I see.

208
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
All that bombing's

209
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,333
probably what caused this
cavity to fill up with water.

210
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,458
So what do we do?

211
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,750
We've only got
about three hours left.

212
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,166
That's it?

213
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,708
We're runnin' out of time.

214
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,666
We can't leave without
checking it out, right?

215
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
How would Bruce
feel about that?

216
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,916
Franca...

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,458
sorry you had to wait.

218
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,750
Let's go say hi...

219
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,666
to your dad, okay?

220
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,458
Let's go, Mister.

221
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,958
Let's go.

222
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,916
Papa's waiting for us.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,791
Yeah.

224
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,208
Well, I'd like to say
let's all get a move--on.

225
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,250
However...

226
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,708
I'll just bet you had

227
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,750
a real flashy gunfight with
the 12 Sisters back there.

228
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,333
I've got it covered here.

229
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,708
Go ahead.

230
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,041
You're a good man, Katana.

231
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,208
I know.

232
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,583
And you know we're
not gonna pay ya back.

233
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,750
All Coyotes know...

234
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,291
"Even if it kills ya,
don't pay anyone back!"

235
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,833
Go on already!

236
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,208
Right!

237
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:48,583
Oh...

238
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,458
Katana!

239
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,500
Huh?

240
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,666
Thank you!

241
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,875
Hurry up, Franca!

242
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,958
Okay!

243
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,041
Good luck, you two.

244
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,916
Whatever you find.

245
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,625
Come on Asshole!

246
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,291
Can't ya do
somethin' to shake 'em?!

247
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,916
I'm flying a BOX!!!

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Give me a break, ya dickhead!

249
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,916
Missiles AWAY!

250
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,875
Hmph...

251
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,958
That's one less headache
for our mother to deal with.

252
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,375
It's time to
head back to Godwing.

253
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,208
Roger!

254
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,666
Are we alive?

255
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,916
This was a damn rough
trip for my comeback.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,291
I'll tell ya that.

257
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,000
We're not that far
from the Coyote.

258
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,333
How much time we got?

259
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,708
You don't wanna know.

260
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,125
This way.

261
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,291
Run!

262
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Shit!

263
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,250
I can't buy a break, can I?

264
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,958
Gigabanks "reshuffles" itself
after the final authentication.

265
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,250
And once you're
inside, that's that.

266
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,583
It turns into
an inescapable maze...

267
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,166
Right, Mister?

268
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,916
Not if we do it
the way your Dad did.

269
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,500
So, they got it started.

270
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,625
So, wanna play?

271
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,625
Mister!

272
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,083
I'm ok.

273
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,708
You all right?

274
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,708
I'm ok.

275
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,458
Round one's over.

276
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,208
That gives us 30 minutes
until it starts again.

277
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,041
You up for it?

278
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:14,958
Of course.

279
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,666
Okay, this way.

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,583
Queen to Bishop six coming up.

281
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,083
Knight takes the Queen.

282
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,875
Bishop taking seven.

283
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,541
Check.

284
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,833
Hello.

285
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,458
Amazing...

286
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,333
That's the center ball,
the heart of Gigabanks.

287
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,333
And that's where Papa
planted the bomb to use

288
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,250
the security system
against itself.

289
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,791
Yeah.

290
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,041
Heh...

291
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,791
that lonely feeling
after the party's over...

292
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,666
Ten billion space dollars,
and it's all wet...

293
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,583
We came a long way...

294
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,750
but I don't know if we have

295
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,875
the time to take
all of this with us, kid.

296
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,791
Then I'll just take
this one with me as a memento.

297
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,625
Franca.

298
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,166
Papa?

299
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,625
Oh, Papa, me too.

300
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,708
I...

301
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,458
I... Papa!

302
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,125
I love you too, Papa!

303
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,416
More to the north, you idiot!

304
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,083
What are you talking about?!

305
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,833
We can't just fly
straight into Godwing

306
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
all lackadaisical like that!

307
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,291
Think about it for a minute.

308
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,125
Marciano's people are
probably layin' a trap for us.

309
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,750
Can't argue with that.

310
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,208
So, if we can't get the
Coyote right up alongside

311
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,083
the Gigabanks, how are we
gonna get the money out?

312
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,833
Have faith!

313
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,375
You leave it to me!

314
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,833
I've got one hell
of a good idea!

315
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,666
Where is January's team?

316
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,458
They went in a few minutes ago.

317
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,916
It's this way.

318
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,875
Honestly, bullets are so much
more efficient than a knife.

319
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,958
January, that's cheating!

320
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,375
January.

321
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,333
August.

322
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes Mother?

323
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,416
The two of you have done well.

324
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,166
Where is June?

325
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,500
Over there.

326
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,750
Being selfish and hogging
all the fun to herself.

327
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,958
What's wrong Mother?

328
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,333
Coyote...

329
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,916
For interfering with my plans,

330
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm going to destroy you
here and now.

331
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,708
It's time for the two of us
to have one last party...

332
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,416
Mister!

333
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,000
MISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
