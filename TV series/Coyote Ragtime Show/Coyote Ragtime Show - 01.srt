1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,541
The Federation's press
conference in response

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,500
to the Graceland uprising
was met with sharp criticism

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,125
from galactic leaders.

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,750
At 9:58 p.m. today,
Geteldova Standard Time,

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,000
they announced the scheduled
deployment of a photonic

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,208
annihilation bomb
against planet Graceland.

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,166
Currently, the Baltic Pact
forbids the use of photonic

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,791
annihilation bombs
and similar WMDs.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,250
Inspector!

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,375
Inspector Angelica!

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,583
I'm so glad you made it!

12
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,416
Are you with the Sandvil police?

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,083
Yep, Chelsea Moore...

14
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,416
with the SPD.

15
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,916
It's nice to meet you, Chelsea.

16
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,041
Is this your first trip
to Sandvil, Inspector?

17
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,333
Yeah.

18
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,416
So what brings an
investigator of your stature

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
out to a remote
planet like this?

20
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,666
Oh, it's just minor
business, really.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,916
Just minor business?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,458
Yep, that's it.

23
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,208
Oh, that's one of
our insect repellers.

24
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,291
Insect repeller?

25
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,458
Right!

26
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,500
Planet Sandvil's
pioneering history is

27
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,458
complete with stories of...

28
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,125
Oh...

29
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,583
darn it...

30
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,291
Sandvil's settlers were
always fighting off insects.

31
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,666
This is no ex...

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,875
ex--agg--ur--ay--tie--on.

33
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,541
However, in G.C. 1837,
it was con...

34
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:11,666
formed that the insects rely on
hearing instead of si-- sight!

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,333
So a ha--yi--per--SONE--ic
ree--meh--dee was...

36
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,416
Anyway, they're Sandvil's
only tourist attraction!

37
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,916
So I see.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,208
Huh?

39
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,500
"The raisin for...?

40
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,000
mmm...

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,041
entering?" 

42
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,083
It's "Reason."

43
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,500
Oh, "Reason!" -
I knew that was it!

44
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,625
So you're Inspector Burns...

45
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,416
Welcome to Sandvil Penitentiary,
I'm Warden Frank Dustin.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,791
Warden.

47
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,125
So, what exactly brings you
past the bugs and into

48
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,416
my neck of the desert?

49
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,208
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to open

50
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,041
your suitcase for me, please.

51
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,041
Wow...

52
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,583
What in the hell?

53
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,958
All right - what in the world
is going on here, Inspect...

54
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,166
The Federation...

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
And the President?

56
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,708
Approved this?

57
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,291
So who the hell is
this friend of yours?

58
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,583
Inspector Angelica Burns
from the Federation she's...

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,208
Yeah, well I knew that much!

60
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,291
But...

61
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,666
That's all I know
about her, honest!

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,875
The bigwigs just told me
to bring her here and to...

63
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,458
act all polite and stuff!

64
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,875
Yeah, yeah sure...

65
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,666
but not every Federal
Investigator walks around with

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,125
Presidential Orders, do they?

67
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,083
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

68
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,416
Maybe...

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
She's a special agent...

70
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,333
with a secret mission.

71
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,791
And she couldn't tell us...

72
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,500
even if she wanted to!

73
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,333
But...

74
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,083
what KIND of secret mission?

75
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,291
Well, probably...

76
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,708
um, uh...

77
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,000
it's just you know, top secret!

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,708
So, are you done
snooping around?

79
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,333
No, I still need
your cooperation.

80
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,833
Well, let's see.

81
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,708
Bringing weapons into the
prison, full computer access

82
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,375
and prisoner profile
searches and printouts.

83
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,291
Okay, I give...

84
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,833
What ELSE could
you possibly want?

85
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,083
A certain detainee of yours...

86
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,375
Oh, really?

87
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,833
So you're after one
of our prisoners, are you?

88
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,250
Well, maybe you can tell me.

89
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,500
Huh?!

90
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,583
John Smith, Frederick Gondorf,
Ray Mosquin...

91
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,000
... sound familiar?

92
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,208
'Fraid not.

93
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,625
Oh, I know!

94
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,666
John Smith: G.C. 2030,
planet Duran, Geteldova system,

95
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,875
police raid the location
where he is about to carry out

96
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,791
a narcotics transaction!

97
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,000
The bust netted approximately
200,000 space dollars from

98
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,583
the Criminal Guild!

99
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,125
I'm impressed.

100
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,166
Thanks!

101
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,791
My memory's
actually pretty good!

102
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,375
It doesn't make a difference!

103
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,708
If you're looking for a fugitive
go the police, not my prison!

104
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,458
Those are his aliases, Warden.

105
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,500
Huh?

106
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,125
Richard Phillips,
Jonathan Klish,

107
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,583
and Steven Foreman
are a few others.

108
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,000
He has as many aliases as there
are stars in the sky by now,

109
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,375
I'd imagine.

110
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,250
They call him, "Mister." 

111
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,791
Mister?

112
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,041
Coyotes call him that
out of respect.

113
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,916
I received an anonymous phone
call last night and the caller

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,875
told me that Mister would show
up here at Sandvil Penitentiary.

115
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,833
I've been on his trail for
4 years now and I haven't had

116
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,875
a decent lead in over a year.

117
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,208
And what makes you think
there's any validity to

118
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,791
this "phone call" you received?

119
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,583
My gut.

120
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,375
Great!

121
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,625
Women's intuition!

122
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,333
Hey!

123
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,625
That's sexist, you know!

124
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,958
Shut up!

125
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,750
If you don't like it
then go cry to the President

126
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,375
or the friggin'
gender--feminists!

127
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,708
I'm gettin' sick
and tired of this crap!

128
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,875
Hello?

129
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,500
This is the Red Desert
Liberation Front,

130
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,958
and we're about to set off
20 bombs in your prison.

131
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,583
Power to the people.

132
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,166
Unbelievable!

133
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,250
I've been warden of this
penitentiary for eight years.

134
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,625
Eight whole years!

135
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,000
And not a single day
has gone by without getting

136
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,625
an anonymous call from some
jackass trying to rile me up!

137
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,166
And none of those calls
has been real, not even...

138
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,625
Fire in Cell Block 4!

139
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,000
And in five also!

140
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,625
Send out the
firefighting squad!

141
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,125
And lower barriers
D--7 through 14!

142
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,833
This is cell block 8,
go ahead!

143
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,208
I don't know...

144
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,125
but the explosions have
to be coming from inside!

145
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,166
Let's get the prisoners
and guards evacuated ASAP

146
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,500
and have everyone else
work on the fire.

147
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,666
Chelsea.

148
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,000
Get the Sandvil Police's
Bomb Disposal Team

149
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,500
here on the double!

150
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,708
Right!

151
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,416
This is Detective
Chelsea Moore...

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,750
Oh my god, what a mess.

153
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,458
It gets worse.

154
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,500
Huh?

155
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,500
There's plenty more to come.

156
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,791
All right, scumbags!

157
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,750
We need everyone in
the main courtyard!

158
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,875
What's your problem?

159
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:31,916
Move it, cueball!

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,291
And hurry the hell up!

161
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:37,833
Oh, hey!

162
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,083
Over here!

163
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,208
I'm so glad you made it.

164
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,791
I'm Warden Frank Dustin.

165
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,083
I'm Captain Jones
of the Bomb Squad.

166
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,458
What's your situation?

167
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,041
I received a phone call
saying terrorists had set up

168
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,375
bombs within our perimeter.

169
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,583
I see.

170
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,750
How's the
evacuation coming along?

171
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,333
We've got about 70 percent,
but Cell Block 4 is going slowly

172
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,625
with 300 prisoners
and guards inside.

173
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,000
Any casualties?

174
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,375
We do have people injured

175
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,583
but we haven't determined
if anyone's died, yet.

176
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,791
Just leave it to the pros.

177
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,500
Okay, we're counting on you...

178
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,000
Keep a safe distance.

179
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,916
Chelsea.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes?

181
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,625
What happened to
the jeep we arrived in?

182
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,125
I thought we parked it...

183
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,000
over there.

184
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,166
All right, show me where.

185
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,583
Right!

186
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,250
We'll split into three groups.

187
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,291
Andy and Brad will
take Cell Block 3.

188
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,833
Matt, George, and Elliot
will take Blocks 5 and 6.

189
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,416
And I'll take care of Block 4.

190
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,250
Move out.

191
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,333
It was under the seat!

192
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,666
That's what really
set the damn scanner off!

193
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,000
What do you mean?

194
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,541
I mean we all got played
and didn't even know it!

195
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,125
They used my
weapons clearance to get

196
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,208
their bombs into the prison.

197
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,625
It had to be the
guard driving the jeep.

198
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,291
The terrorist story
was more than likely

199
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,166
a deception on his part.

200
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
And those "anonymous"
phone calls probably

201
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,708
came from him as well.

202
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,083
Now wait a minute...

203
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,541
Some of the bomb squad
are likely a part of it too,

204
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,125
using the confusion
to complete their plan...

205
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
whatever it is they're up to.

206
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,750
Right.

207
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,791
And how exactly
would you know this?

208
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,000
Because those are the tactics
he used on planet Carnaval.

209
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,083
"He"?

210
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,000
Mister.

211
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,666
If only I'd seen it.

212
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,458
But he's not
getting away this time!

213
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,083
Listen up, this is how we're
going to do this, people!

214
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
So just shut up
and pay attention!

215
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,333
I don't care whether
you're a prisoner or a guard

216
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,833
or a bag of trash!

217
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,000
Or especially someone
from the bomb squad,

218
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,291
NOTHING is leaving
this facility!

219
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,750
Now, wait - you're
not saying that...?

220
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,958
This prison is under lockdown.

221
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,208
You guys gotta be shittin' me!

222
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,416
You're gonna lock us out here
with the stinkin' trash?!

223
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,291
Look, it's only
until we catch the guy.

224
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,333
Now back the hell up!

225
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,625
Kiss my ass!

226
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,875
What is this crap?!

227
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,208
We got rights!

228
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,000
I want my lawyer!

229
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,625
Any other requests?

230
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,041
I-I-Inspector.

231
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,791
The wounded have
all been treated.

232
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,875
Just a handful of minor injuries
and nothing life--threatening.

233
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,333
And we've finally got
the fires under control.

234
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,333
I may be reaching here, but
is there any possibility of

235
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,041
the prison buildings collapsing?

236
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,375
I wouldn't bet on it.

237
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm not an architect or
an engineer but the guys

238
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,958
who built this prison made it
capable of fending off

239
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,166
a missile attack from
any kind of terrorist cell

240
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,625
you could dream up.

241
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,875
That's good.

242
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,666
Besides, I'd guess
that blowing themselves up

243
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,583
along with the prison
isn't their goal.

244
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,125
Ah, no thanks.

245
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,375
I promised my daughter I'd
finally quit for good, and I...

246
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,291
Inspector,
I'm glad you made it.

247
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,916
Something the matter?

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,458
Please take a look, ma'am.

249
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,458
What is this?

250
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,291
Well, it's supposed
to be our access control

251
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,208
and surveillance system, but...

252
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,000
someone's keeping me from
bringing up all of the cameras.

253
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,333
Do you know how?

254
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,375
It had to be hacked
from the outside, Inspector.

255
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,625
And that...

256
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,625
shouldn't be possible,
but there you have it.

257
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,791
And that also means
that nobody can get in or out

258
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,583
of the prison at the moment.

259
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,916
Anyone still in there?

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
About a hundred and fifty.

261
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,625
Most of them are
in Cell Block 4.

262
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,000
Inspector!

263
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,541
Sandvil Police just reported
finding our assigned driver and

264
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,375
the real bomb squad captain tied
up in the precinct supply room!

265
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,541
Good work, kid.

266
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,166
Warden...

267
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,958
this is a list of the inmates
who were imprisoned here

268
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,458
during the last year.

269
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,291
Do you have a way of
determining who among

270
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,250
these men is located
in Cell Block number 4?

271
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,833
It'll take some time, but sure.

272
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,416
What for?

273
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
It's Mister.

274
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,875
I've been on his trail for
4 years now and I haven't had

275
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,125
a decent lead in over a year.

276
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,500
So that means
Mister's on that list!

277
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,541
And it also means that our
driver and the captain of

278
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,666
the bomb squad are
definitely working to help

279
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,500
break him out of here,
aren't they?!

280
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,333
Right on the nose.

281
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,083
Well...

282
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,291
Do you think they'd use

283
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,208
the inmates who didn't
get out as hostages?

284
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,916
I really don't
think so, Warden.

285
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,250
Hostages would only
slow their progress.

286
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,333
Besides...

287
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,166
It doesn't fit his M.O.

288
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,666
Okay.

289
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,708
So why go to the trouble of
hacking the security system?

290
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,208
That's still a mystery.

291
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,125
It could be as simple as buying
time for their next move.

292
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,791
Or maybe...

293
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,583
they could be
waiting for something...

294
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,333
I see.

295
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,750
Very well.

296
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,875
You'll have orders soon enough.

297
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm sure you can understand
the unrest we will cause within

298
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,083
the Federation
when we make our move.

299
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,000
Be patient.

300
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,125
April...

301
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,291
Yes, Mother Dear.

302
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,833
We've located the man
we've been searching for.

303
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,250
He has been incarcerated under

304
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,458
a different name in a prison
on the planet Sandvil.

305
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,958
Now, then...

306
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,916
April, can you handle
this for me, love?

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,916
Certainly, Mother Dear.

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,625
Then I look forward
to your success.

309
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Is the security system
back online?

310
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,041
They said it was gonna
take a little longer.

311
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,375
And where is
the warden right now?

312
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,625
He's working in the armored
car the bomb squad came in.

313
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,791
He has to go over the lists

314
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,583
by hand since the
computer's off--line.

315
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,875
I see.

316
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
I don't like
the smell of this.

317
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,125
They've been
quiet for too long.

318
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,125
I'd like to think Mister's
off cowering in a corner...

319
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,208
But him...?

320
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,583
It's more likely
that he's got us...

321
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,250
right where he wants us.

322
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,541
Inspector!

323
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,541
What is it?

324
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,708
What was...

325
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,958
that giant flash up there?

326
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,875
Oh no...

327
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,375
What's that!

328
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,625
Surveillance team says
we've got 12 inbound!

329
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,458
The Twelve Sisters!

330
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,375
It's Marciano!

331
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,958
It's show time.

332
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,583
Chelsea!

333
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,416
This way.

334
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,583
Fire!

335
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:51,791
All right!

336
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,791
Stop right there!

337
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
Put your hands on your hea...

338
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,916
What the hell's going on?!

339
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,166
Upsy--daisy!

340
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,833
So you big lug,
maybe you've seen him?

341
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,875
There's someone here
we're lookin' for.

342
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,833
And...

343
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,458
who's that?

344
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Heh.

345
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,666
Not your ass!

346
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,708
Who are those people,
and what are they after?!

347
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,791
Madame Marciano's 12 Sisters!

348
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,583
They're ruthless, and
they're the best assassins

349
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,166
the Criminal Guild has to offer!

350
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,375
The "12 Sisters"?

351
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,083
Isn't that kinda hokey?!

352
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,583
No kidding!

353
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,750
And why does it take TWELVE
of 'em to get the job done?!

354
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,083
So, you find him?

355
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,375
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,958
The biometric readings
are indeterminate.

357
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,625
We're going to have to wait
a little longer, May!

358
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,166
You hear that, old man?

359
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,041
All we wanna do is finish
this off real quick and then

360
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,958
get the hell out of here!

361
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,375
So just make it
easy on yourself.

362
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,583
I don't know!

363
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,291
I really don't know anything!

364
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,791
Then you die...

365
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,416
NOW!

366
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,500
Inspector!

367
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
Get out of here, Chelsea!

368
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,375
Come and get it.

369
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Inspector!

370
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,375
May...!

371
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,541
Feb.

372
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,875
Right!

373
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
Physical characteristics
and biometrics both match

374
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,666
what we've got on file!

375
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,875
Could he be...?

376
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,083
Yeah.

377
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
That's Mister.

378
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,708
Hi, Mister!

379
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,541
Our mother has just been
dying to talk to you.

380
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,166
That's the only reason
you're not dead yet.

381
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,166
Well, bless your heart!

382
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,708
But I don't have time for you

383
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,250
or your sweet little
death squad today.

384
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,958
Isn't that right, Angel?!

385
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,541
Mister...

386
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,208
Been a whole year, hasn't it?

387
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,708
How's workin' for
the Feds been, sexy?!

388
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't mess with me!

389
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,750
Okay, stop fooling around!

390
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,000
You ignore us to flirt
with that boring old thing?

391
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,458
Then we'll show he...

392
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,958
You could work on
some manners yourself!

393
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,000
Better behave, little girl,
or I'll punish you good!

394
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,625
You were waiting for them?

395
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
Marciano's 12 Sisters?

396
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,083
Was this all
part of your plan?!

397
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,583
Answer me!

398
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,041
Angelica...

399
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,500
Come on now...

400
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,000
It wasn't THEM...

401
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,875
I was actually waiting for...

402
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,791
my "little friends."

403
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,291
"Little friends"...?

404
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,833
You remember
"Diamondhead," Angelica?

405
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,041
'Cause in about
two minutes, surf's up!

406
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,875
And you're gonna
wanna get somewhere dry!

407
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,875
Inspector!

408
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,333
Chelsea!

409
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,750
Get the guards and the rest

410
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,208
of the prisoners as far
inside the prison as you can!

411
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:07,583
Hurry!

412
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,708
Right!

413
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,666
Attention, everyone.

414
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,750
The others aren't
important right now.

415
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,916
Securing Mister is
our primary objective.

416
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,833
This is embarrassing.

417
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,583
But least you're
still functioning.

418
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,375
Don't leave
a single wall standing.

419
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,375
What's happening?

420
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,875
Mister was referring to...

421
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,958
the Planet Diamondhead
National Bank attack

422
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,291
that happened in Galactic
Calendar year 2033.

423
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,833
Richard Phillips
was the suspect...

424
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,458
That's Mister!

425
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,916
Diamondhead police
had him surrounded...

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,458
But he used a tsunami
to break through them and it

427
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,416
looks like he's probably going
to try the same thing here.

428
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,208
Tsunami?

429
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,333
In the desert?!

430
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,416
That's insane!

431
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,666
Which would make
perfect sense...

432
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,083
He's completely insane!

433
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,291
Why aren't they working?

434
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,666
See, told ya I'd punish ya!

435
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,500
Anyway, I'm too old
to play with dolls.

436
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,041
See ya around, girlies!

437
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,291
Mister...!

438
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
MISTER!!!!!

439
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,416
Hey!

440
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
That's crime scene evidence,
leave it for the police!

441
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,791
Sorry, now it's ours.

442
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,250
Chelsea!

443
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,000
Sorry kid, but you're better
off letting this one drop.

444
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,541
Unfortunately, it looks like the
Criminal Guild already got to

445
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,000
the police and bureaucrats.

446
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,125
But...

447
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,041
no way...

448
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,791
It's so futile...

449
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, it is.

450
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,125
You did a good job, though.

451
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,416
The trip wasn't a total waste.

452
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,458
After all's said
and done, you know...

453
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,208
it was nice working with you.

454
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,708
I quit!

455
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,500
I've had it with this
corrupt police department!!!

456
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay, fair enough.

457
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,958
What if I could
offer you a new job?

458
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,625
Would you like that instead?

459
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,500
Huh?

460
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,375
Members of the public
were polled regarding

461
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,000
the Federation's plan to drop

462
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,916
the photon annihilation
bomb on Graceland.

463
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,375
58% are against such an action,
and taking into account

464
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,166
those who are conditionally
opposed, the total of those

465
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,416
against dropping
the bomb jumps to 87%.

466
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,458
They say it'll be another 7
days before they drop the bomb.

467
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,833
And Graceland gets
blown off the map.

468
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,541
So did Franca have
anything to say to ya?

469
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, that "Mister is the only
guy I'm talking to about it."

470
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,416
And that it's a secret
from everyone else.

471
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,333
I appreciate it...

472
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,458
Hey, you know what?

473
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,791
It's good to have the
old crew back together.
