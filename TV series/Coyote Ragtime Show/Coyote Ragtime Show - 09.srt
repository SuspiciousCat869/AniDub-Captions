1
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,750
You know, you might
wanna consider

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,875
sending that
docking clearance signal.

3
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,416
And you might wanna
shut the hell up!

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,583
I've got it covered,
all right?!

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,583
If by "covered" you mean
you're still looking through

6
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,541
the "Flying Federation Shuttles
for the Brain--Dead" manual,

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,041
then we're in trouble.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,750
Requestin' clearance is
small craft operator 101

9
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,875
and it shouldn't be
kickin' your ass like that.

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,291
Unless you just plain
forgot how, of course.

11
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,958
Just get off my ass!

12
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,666
How am I supposed
to get this figured out

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,583
if you keep on flappin'
yer yap--trap?!

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,708
Knew you forgot!

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,916
I'm REVIEWING the
procedure, dammit!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,416
I'm not some senile
old bastard like you!

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,166
Take a look out the
window, "genius."

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,791
You just ran out of
"review time."

19
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,875
What?

20
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,000
Holy crap!

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,125
Ok, ok....

22
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,083
Stay calm!

23
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,500
STAY CALM??!

24
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,875
Yeah, maybe you're right.

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,208
Where was I
in this stupid manual?

26
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,208
Hey Mister,

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,500
how do you suppose Swamp and
Bishop are doing right now?

28
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,125
Well, my guess is...

29
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,791
not too good at all.

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,375
I don't need to guess.

31
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,958
I'd even be willing
to put money on it.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,291
Probably bitching up
a storm as we speak.

33
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,708
Or better yet throwing
punches already.

34
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,916
Hey

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,291
We oughta put out some
bandages for Bishop.

36
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,041
So why in the world did you
put the two of them together?

37
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,041
'Cuz that oughta make
things more entertaining!

38
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,416
Huh?

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,291
I'm having fun already.

40
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,375
What?!

41
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,916
Oh, shit!

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,458
Why didn't we think to put a
hidden camera in the cockpit

43
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,166
when we had the chance?
That'd been sweet.

44
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,791
Ah no big deal.

45
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,166
I mean who wants
to watch a movie when

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,375
when you already
know the ending?

47
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,125
Yeah, but we coulda
used the footage to

48
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,791
embarass them later, right?

49
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,916
Oh yeah!

50
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,833
Still feeding that
bottomless--pit, I see.

51
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,250
Oh, morning.

52
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,708
You're up early, aren't you?

53
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,458
Not as early as you.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,166
Inspector...

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,708
where are you going...

56
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,041
wait for me...

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,291
Hey, May.

58
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,333
Seeing you awake too
makes me wonder.

59
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,166
Are all your sisters
early risers like you are?

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,625
And why would you
concern yourself with that?

61
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,166
Oh, it doesn't concern me
that much, really.

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,000
Only 24 hours until
til things go boom...

63
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,916
Hopefully we'll be able to see
another sunrise like this.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,166
We will.

65
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,458
I'm counting on it.

66
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,750
That sounded pretty confident.

67
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,000
So what's your
plan of action now?

68
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,166
Wait.

69
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,083
For what?

70
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,083
Him.

71
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,000
He's definitely on the way.

72
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,708
After all, Mister is after the
same thing as your mother

73
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,083
and he doesn't like to lose,
so you can bet he'll find

74
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,500
a way to get here.

75
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,750
Gosh, Inspector.

76
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,083
With you it's always
Mister--this and Mister--that.

77
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,750
You should give it
a rest once in a...

78
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,000
Wha...?

79
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,500
You've already had breakfast?!

80
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,958
I'm surprised you don't get
sick from eating all the time!

81
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,208
As they say, you can't wait
for Mister on an empty stomach.

82
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,625
The proverb is you can't
WAGE WAR on an empty stomach...

83
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,583
Orders from the top brass, sir!

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,041
Ok, let's have a look.

85
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,041
Could you acknowledge them
with your signature, Ensign?

86
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,541
Here, right?

87
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,166
You've come quite a way.

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,666
Good work.

89
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:38,750
Sir!

90
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,083
Is there any way possible

91
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,416
we could get our ship
refueled before we leave?

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,166
And, we were also hoping to
have a mechanic have a look

93
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,708
at our portside engine.

94
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,541
It's been acting up
a bit lately.

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,708
Shouldn't be a problem.

96
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,916
I'll get the flight crew
on it right away.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,083
In the meantime, you can wait
over there 'till we're finished.

98
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:55,750
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,500
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,041
Whew!

101
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,250
So I suppose you were just
"brushing up on the procedure"

102
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,666
on how to ask the deck officer
for gas when you started

103
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,291
shittin' your
britches back there?

104
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,083
There's a whole planet
on the line here

105
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
so give me a break, ok?!

106
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,750
I was just about to get to it.

107
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,541
Hey!

108
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,041
What're you up to now?

109
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,583
We're not gonna get anywhere
just by standin' around.

110
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,333
Hey!

111
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,875
Now wait a second!

112
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,416
Oh, man...

113
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,875
Yeah...

114
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,833
That's definitely it.

115
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,333
No way.

116
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,291
How are we supposed to
get up close and personal

117
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,583
with that big--ass
thing from here?

118
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,500
I mean, if it was closer,
we could slip right in, but...

119
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,083
Afraid sweety? Want me to hold
your hand or something?

120
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,583
Screw you!

121
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,041
I don't see you
making any moves you jerk.

122
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:51,750
Well, now.

123
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,375
Maybe I'll just do that.

124
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,166
Alright, let's see it.

125
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,333
You'd best shut the hell up
while I'm doin' my thinkin' boy!

126
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,583
Yeah right, you're one to talk.

127
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,916
I even had to send
your damn docking signal.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,625
You can kiss my ass.

129
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,791
Yeah!

130
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,416
I'd bet you'd love that,
you old fruitcake.

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,083
How about I kick your ass?!

132
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,791
Ok. Who the hell is that?

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,958
I'll be damned
if I know what it is.

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,083
That's Malcolm!

135
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,500
Pardon me, gentlemen.

136
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,333
Now that we're all here,
let's get started.

137
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,625
General Boniek, I'm sure
you'll agree that how we

138
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:54,375
end this war is as important as
when we end it at this point?

139
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,208
Well, Senator Hewlitt, I would
dare say that your presence here

140
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,083
is an inspiration for all
parties to behave reasonably.

141
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,250
The Graceland Liberation
Forces are certainly open

142
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,291
for discourse.

143
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,500
Definitely.

144
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,416
I appreciate that.

145
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,333
After all, we certainly
do not want to leave behind

146
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:12,375
a sullied legacy as politicians
who obliterated a planet.

147
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,791
Simple enough, if you
don't drop the bomb.

148
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,166
God damn it!

149
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,875
What are those idiots
talking about in there?

150
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,750
You brought this on yourself!

151
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,541
You're sitting at
this table because of

152
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,875
your damned revolution!

153
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,458
I apologize.

154
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,208
We've already wasted effort
going down that road

155
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,000
so let's pull back.

156
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,625
Aren't we there yet?! Come on!

157
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,750
Yeah, April, I'm bored!

158
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,666
I wanna go play!

159
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,250
I wanna play NOW!

160
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:44,875
Yeah!

161
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,875
Let's play, April!

162
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,541
Patience, little ones.

163
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,416
You'll have plenty of
playtime once we get there.

164
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,958
Wake up, Dece!

165
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,958
Okay...

166
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,458
Aww man!

167
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,416
How do we get in there, huh?

168
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,541
Well, all right.

169
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,833
That makes sense.

170
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,458
Found my way in.

171
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,625
See ya!

172
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,916
At your service.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What the hell do you think
you're doing you idiot?!

174
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,958
Watch and learn, old man.

175
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,500
You crazy?

176
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
Pardon the interruption!

177
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,708
I've brought you gentlemen
something cool to drink!

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,708
We didn't request
a beverage cart!

179
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,208
But the galley told me to get
this over to the conference room

180
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,125
right away, Admiral.

181
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,625
All this juice is
gonna go to waste...

182
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,416
Fine, that's enough, soldier.

183
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,375
Just leave the cart here,
and let us get back to work.

184
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,208
I'll just leave it.

185
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,250
Pardon the intrusion!

186
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,250
What the hell were you
doin' back there?!

187
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,916
I've got what it takes
when it counts the most.

188
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,833
We're running
short on time, gentlemen.

189
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,750
So let's keep
this moving, shall we?

190
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,291
Perfect!

191
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,541
Well, other than
the lack of space...

192
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,791
You got a huge ass

193
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,541
Shut your mouth and listen, boy!

194
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,583
I'm surprised you didn't
pick the ladies room.

195
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,125
We'd be least likely
to get caught here.

196
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,250
You picked this spot in case
your bladder acts up, old man!

197
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,291
I aint the one who peed his
pants because he couldn't

198
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,250
send the signal.

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,000
Again with the signal.

200
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
You want a gold star, Pops?!

201
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,416
Achoo!

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,750
You want someone to hear us?!

203
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,750
J--Just do s--something
about that d--damn hair...

204
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,583
Hey, Mister.

205
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,166
Yeah?

206
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,208
Shouldn't we be using
a less--direct route

207
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,458
to the Gigabanks?

208
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,875
Yeah we should.

209
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,416
Heh.

210
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,083
But we're not.

211
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:18,708
Franca.

212
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,083
Hm?

213
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,583
Why is it a bad idea for us
to go flying straight to

214
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,333
the Gigabanks?

215
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,083
Hmmm...

216
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,583
Because Marciano's already
there looking to ambush us.

217
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,750
Is that right?

218
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,583
On the nose!

219
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:37,708
Their own "welcoming party." And
since we have next to no time

220
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,041
to get this done, we pretty much
have to roll with the punches

221
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,375
no matter how hard
they try to hit us.

222
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,166
And if I were her, I'd already
have them laying in wait for us

223
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,833
along our flight path.

224
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,333
Radar's picked up something.

225
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,958
Bin--GO!

226
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,708
Boss, I wouldn't be
so happy about that.

227
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,958
How many we got out there?

228
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:57,750
Hmmm...

229
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,375
looks like about a dozen.

230
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:01,875
Boy!

231
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,500
We sure are popular today!

232
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,000
As much as I'd like to play with
Marciano, I'd rather hang out

233
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,125
with a classier dame.

234
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,041
Heh...

235
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,791
Hail Queen Angelica the First!

236
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,916
Hey!

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,208
Stop that!

238
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,083
Sorry.

239
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,708
You keep on playing around like
that you're gonna get us killed!

240
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,250
Yes, ma'am!

241
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,500
Take it easy, kids.

242
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,958
Huh?

243
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,458
So, are you two ready
to get this party started?

244
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,583
The Federation's conditions
for peace are as follows...

245
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,666
One: Federal arbiters will
be included in the drafting

246
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,458
of Graceland's new constitution
after the signing of the treaty.

247
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,583
Two: All combat arms and
materiel used to develop same,

248
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,708
plus any items that could
be misappropriated for their

249
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:03,291
manufacture will be immediately
regulated by the Federation.

250
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,416
Three...

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,958
Hey, Katana!

252
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,958
Get us down on
the ground, willya?

253
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,750
Find us a hole in the formation
and get us through it!

254
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,208
No problem, I'm on it.

255
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,250
Katana!

256
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,625
Three ships
starboard underneath us!

257
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,958
Roger!

258
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,041
Time to wake up, little ones.

259
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,458
Our objective is making sure
the photonic bomb

260
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,625
never reaches Graceland.

261
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,958
It's aboard the
that ship, the Jupiter.

262
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,458
And don't hit the bomb
itself, or we're done for.

263
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,166
Understood?

264
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,625
Uh-huh. Ok.

265
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
This should buy Mother the
time she needs to seek out

266
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,791
this "treasure."

267
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,000
This proposal seems to favor the
Federation rather heavily

268
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,458
doesn't it?

269
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,125
We're all feeling our way
through these negotiations,

270
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,375
General.

271
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,875
Of course we are still
open to your concerns.

272
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,791
"Feeling" our way through
these negotiations?

273
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,875
Who do you think you're kidding?

274
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:33,916
What?

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,166
Marciano's 12 Sisters are here?

276
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,208
Call battlestations
to all decks.

277
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,125
And don't let them
get near the Jupiter!

278
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,166
Hooray!

279
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,583
Yay, yay, yay, woo!

280
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,333
Gentlemen, in light of
the present circumstances

281
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,416
I need you to consider your
safety and evacuate the ship.

282
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,583
So, if you please...

283
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,333
They can stay here
if they want, Admiral.

284
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,916
What?

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,208
I don't know why the Guild would
feel a need to attack the bomb.

286
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
Unless, of course...

287
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,458
They're intervening
on your behalf?

288
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,458
Ridiculous.

289
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not so certain.

290
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,583
We need to hurry, gentlemen!

291
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,875
If that photonic bomb
detonates with us here,

292
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
then all this
negotiation will be lost!

293
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,041
Actually, it won't
be detonating.

294
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,541
Mr. Hewlitt.

295
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,666
We'll do what we can
against the 12 Sisters,

296
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,833
but you should consider
evacuating in case they succeed.

297
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,708
And I'm telling you that even
if the Jupiter is destroyed,

298
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,416
we're quite safe here, Malcolm.

299
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,333
The press releases about
the nature of your mission

300
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,916
we allowed on the
news were deceptions.

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,208
There's no bomb aboard
that ship, Admiral.

302
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,583
There never was.

303
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,875
Huh?!

304
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,916
What?!

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,208
Are you saying
you deceived us?!

306
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,375
We prefer the term
"misinformation."

307
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,166
Federation science has never
created a weapon sturdy enough

308
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,875
to be dropped from outer space,
through an atmosphere and

309
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,916
survive long enough
to annhilate a planet.

310
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,958
If you light a firecracker
in the palm of your hand,

311
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,750
you burn your hand.

312
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,708
But as we all know, if you
close your fist around it,

313
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,625
you go to the hospital instead.

314
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,333
Dear God no.

315
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,583
The real photonic bomb is
already buried deep inside

316
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,833
Graceland and ready to
crack it open like an egg.

317
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,625
No way!

318
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,083
Holy shit!

319
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,541
Persistent little bastards, huh?

320
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,541
The bomb is quite real
and the timer's already set.

321
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,250
And you can be sure
it will explode on time.

322
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,416
So then.

323
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Still think I'm
"deceiving" you, General?

324
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,333
You piece of filth.

325
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,333
My, I'm insulted.

326
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,125
But I'm feeling generous
so I'll tell you this.

327
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,958
There are two ways
to stop the underground bomb

328
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,291
from detonating.

329
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,125
You could search the
entire planet and disarm

330
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,041
the ignition device directly,
or enter the disarm code

331
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,791
into this remote control device.

332
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,958
Well now, look at that.

333
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,583
19 hours, 18 minutes,
and 36 seconds remaining.

334
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,916
And now that I've proven
definitively that we're

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,875
running out of time,
let's wrap this up, shall we?

336
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,916
So, do we bust in?

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,333
No, wait.

338
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,708
They could still
work it out on their own.

339
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
One, two...

340
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,916
three!

341
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,750
We're sorry, April!

342
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,541
No.

343
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,875
Huh?

344
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,416
The...

345
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,333
bomb it's...

346
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,083
What the hell happened?

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,541
Well, it appears that
we've settled things

348
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,250
to our mutual
satisfaction, General.

349
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,500
Your signature, if you please.

350
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,875
Where did you bury it?

351
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,333
You can drop the pretenses
and tell me that, can't you?

352
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,333
We're not in a position
to contact our comrades

353
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,916
even you did tell us.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,166
And even if we could attempt
disarming it, you probably have

355
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,875
jamming signals
around the burial site.

356
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,416
Besides, you already have us in
custody if we don't cooperate.

357
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,500
You've got quite an imagination.

358
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,625
Where did you bury it
in the middle of the war?

359
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,833
The Godwing Valley.

360
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,583
The place where
the gods descend.

361
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,250
Right where
he buried the vault!

362
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,875
Are you serious?

363
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,375
W--Who are you?!

364
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,708
What the hell?!

365
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,791
You sold us out you traitor!

366
00:19:59,333 --> 00:19:59,750
Um...

367
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,041
the remote?

368
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,916
We might wanna try to get
that remote control?

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,416
Uh...

370
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,250
right!

371
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,458
I saw it myself!

372
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,125
If there was a bomb,
we'd all be dead by now!

373
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,708
You fool...

374
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,125
Graceland's Liberation
Forces will continue

375
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,583
the fight against
the Federation!

376
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
This definitely reminds me
of that old proverb

377
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,291
about your allies being
the very last to turn on you.

378
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,583
Ridiculous!

379
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,833
If they'd just let things be,

380
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,666
Graceland wouldn't be
in any danger right now!

381
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,291
Let's go.

382
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,250
This ship is toast!

383
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,833
People like that
are nothing but idiots!

384
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,208
So they start wars to
figure out who's stupidest.

385
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,750
May, I've got everything
I need from you.

386
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,333
Hm?

387
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,500
We've got a little more
than half a day left before

388
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,833
the Federation drops
the bomb on this planet.

389
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,083
For all I know,
we could end up dying here.

390
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,833
And I don't want to see
that happen to you, you know?

391
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,041
And of course, I not in a
rush to die myself, mind you.

392
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,583
After all,
I've never been married...

393
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
And also...

394
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:34,000
And you haven't captured
Mister yet, either, have you?

395
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,125
It's time we part company.

396
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,125
I really enjoyed
the talks we had.

397
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,541
Seriously.

398
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,791
Thank you.

399
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,375
When I tell my Mother
and sisters about you,

400
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,458
she might try
to come after you.

401
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,250
I don't think they'd bother.

402
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,125
What makes you say that?

403
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,083
Just call it my "intuition."

404
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
Huh?

405
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,500
May!

406
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,250
Damn jamming signals
are all over the place.

407
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,708
There's no way for us to
contact the Coyote like this.

408
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,250
We'll just have to
go down there.

409
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,541
So how much time
do we have left, anyway?

410
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,041
About as much time as we've got
left to live, I'd dare say.

411
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,208
So are ya still
goin' down there?

412
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,250
Damn straight!

413
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,250
So do we stop the bomb first...?

414
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,625
or take back Bruce's
legacy first?
