1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,458
For interfering with my plans,

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,333
I'm going to destroy
you here and now.

3
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:17,125
It's time for the two of us
to have one last party...

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,833
Mister!

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,375
Listen to me, Marciano!

6
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,666
Bruce's legacy of ten billion
space dollars is in here!

7
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,375
You let us leave in one piece,

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,333
and you can have
every penny of it!

9
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,833
You hear me?

10
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,625
And I suppose you want to
leave BEFORE the bomb goes off?

11
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,416
Figured that one out, did ya?

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,166
Sounds to me like you were after
something more than money,

13
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,166
weren't you?

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,291
With all the little dolls
you brought with you,

15
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,375
I'd say you have a fair bet
on getting it all outta here.

16
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,291
A business deal is something
that happens when each party

17
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,625
has something the other one
wants, but I'm not willing

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,541
to give you what you're after.

19
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,125
This is BRUCE'S LEGACY, honey!

20
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
I have come here
to settle a score.

21
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,166
Huh, why doesn't
that surprise me?

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,291
And it appears you successfully
settled one of your own.

23
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,208
But I'm going to kill you.

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,166
I'm going to do this
with my bare hands,

25
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
and then I'll take the money.

26
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,000
Ready...?

27
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,958
Showtime!

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,708
We only have two hours
left before that photonic bomb

29
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,583
goes off, gentlemen.

30
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,083
I need answers.

31
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,333
Have we evacuated all of our
troops out of Graceland yet?

32
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,916
Mister President, we've been
informed by our commanders

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,708
in the field that
our evacuation status

34
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,375
currently stands at 97 percent.

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,708
Incidentally, sir, we're
also received a report

36
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,875
that over 300 spacecraft from
Graceland's Liberation Forces

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,041
have evacuated
the planet as well.

38
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,500
Did they find out about it?

39
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,000
But Mister President...

40
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,458
Is it absolutely necessary
to take this course of action?

41
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,000
What choice do we have?

42
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,583
The GLF made their bed.

43
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,625
Now let them lie in it.

44
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,208
Mister President!

45
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,208
We're out of alternatives here.

46
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,708
It was Colonel Richard's people

47
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,416
who destroyed the remote
control, after all.

48
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,750
There should be a long--range
transmitter here somewhere.

49
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,750
We'll split up
and search for it!

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,666
Ok, where are you?

51
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,416
Transmitter...

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,625
Transmitter...

53
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Hands in the air!

54
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,541
D--Don't shoot!

55
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,916
What are you doing here?!

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,250
Doing my job.

57
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,875
I was told to delete the
data from these computers.

58
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,250
And you are?

59
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
I'm the director
of this facility.

60
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,916
And who in the hell are YOU?

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,208
I am Angelica Burns, and
I'm a Federal Investigator

62
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,166
I'm gonna need your assistance
getting the transmitter running.

63
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,208
I need to contact the Federation
President right away.

64
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,916
You can't use the
transmitter here for that!

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,625
I'm getting on the next
transport outta here

66
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,416
and you should do the same!

67
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,708
Stop right there!

68
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,125
You wanna get shot?

69
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,291
I need to talk to
the President now!

70
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,375
And I said it's impossible!

71
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,708
Yeah, sorry, but I
happen to know better.

72
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,791
All Federation bases
are required to have

73
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,125
a direct line to
the President's office!

74
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,500
If I were you I'd get that
word, "impossible" out of

75
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,250
your vocabulary, and fast!

76
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,166
You wanna try me?

77
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,333
Mother!

78
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,875
I'm sorry we didn't
make it on time!

79
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,708
One! Two!

80
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,958
This place is caving in!

81
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:28,666
Mother?

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,958
What?!

83
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,541
Mister!

84
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,500
So is this really gonna
take us to Mister?

85
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,583
Back when he buried
the Gigabanks...

86
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,916
Bruce told me all the aquifers
under Godwing were connected.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
So you're say this should
eventually get us there?

88
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
I aint guaranteein'
a damn thing!

89
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,541
But if it gets us close, we
can fake it 'till we make it.

90
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,333
Well looky here.

91
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,000
Whattya got, old man?

92
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm getting a signal from
the Gigabanks right above us.

93
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,291
You gotta be kidding!

94
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,750
This can't be right.

95
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,750
Is the compass
broken or something?

96
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,125
What the hell?!

97
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,333
Katana!

98
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,375
Huh?!

99
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,458
The Gigabanks!

100
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,750
Mister and Franca!

101
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,208
ah this is beautiful!

102
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:19,750
Heh...

103
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,875
we made it!

104
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,125
Damn, we're good!

105
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,250
Yeah!

106
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,333
Mister!

107
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,083
Get in the ship, Franca!

108
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,208
Yeah but...

109
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
what're you gonna do?

110
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,625
I'll be there in
a second, so wait up.

111
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,458
Fine, I will!

112
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,041
I'm not letting you go!

113
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:04,583
Swamp!

114
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,083
Do it now, man!

115
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,583
Say your prayers.

116
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:16,708
Mother!

117
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,875
Are you all right?!

118
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,166
Looks like the tables
have turned on ya, Marciano.

119
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,791
You damned miserable
filthy coyotes...

120
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,083
have kept me from getting
what I want long enough!

121
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,250
At this rate, the two of us
are gonna bite the dust here.

122
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,708
You know that?

123
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,583
As long as I get to see you die,
I could really care less,

124
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,166
you arrogant bastard!

125
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,375
Well, if you're gonna be that
way about it then I've got

126
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,291
no choice but
to kick your ass...

127
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,750
you BITCH!

128
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,791
You "coyotes." I hate you
and everything you stand for!

129
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,333
If there was only another life
for me outside of the Guild...

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,750
If I'd only had what he had,

131
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,375
the ability to have
my own children...!

132
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,791
Don't you see
that when I kill you

133
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,583
I'll get rid of
that pain FOREVER?!

134
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,583
Why give in to your hatred
like that, Marciano?

135
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,041
You must get awfully
damn tired draggin'

136
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,458
all that baggage around,
isn't that right?

137
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,708
How dare you...

138
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,833
I'm not going
to let some coyote...

139
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:02,416
an animal who can barely look
after his family INSULT ME!

140
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,750
What a sad story.
Completely pathetic.

141
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,416
Mister! Watch out!

142
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,583
We are not animals.

143
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,666
We drink together!

144
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,500
We share our dreams!

145
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,083
We trust our families and risk
our lives for our friends!

146
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,791
And THAT...

147
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,000
That's who coyotes are.

148
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,041
Angelica Burns?!

149
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,833
What in the hell are
you doing on Graceland?

150
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:08,000
Mr. President, please tell me
where they buried the bomb.

151
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,916
We can stop this
if you tell me now.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,583
Now wait a minute, Angelica.

153
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,375
Are you telling me
you know about...?

154
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,166
We're running out of time,
Mister President!

155
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,166
Angelica, even if you get to the
bomb, how are you going to...?

156
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,708
The coyotes will
find a way to handle it.

157
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,958
What are you talking about?

158
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,666
Just tell me, Mister President.

159
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,708
NOW!

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,958
Mister President, do you
remember how I got ahold

161
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,208
of Super Soul on Ku--Rong?

162
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,625
What if he found out YOU
were in the Guild once?

163
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,500
No!

164
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,541
Now let's not get too hasty,
all right, Angelica?

165
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,958
All you have to do is tell me
where the bomb is buried...

166
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,791
Mister President.

167
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,375
Mother.

168
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,750
No...

169
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,291
Mister!

170
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,458
Don't act so surprised.

171
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,500
You didn't think she was
gonna kill me, did you?

172
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,750
No.

173
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,291
'Course not.

174
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,125
Mister!

175
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,500
Listen to me. You
better get up here, man!

176
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,458
So, what's up?

177
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,250
Ready for a shock?

178
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,416
I think you're gonna like this.

179
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,625
Angelica?!

180
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,791
I found out where
they buried the bomb.

181
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,000
Really?!

182
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,458
You've got a little more
than an hour.

183
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,708
Make it count.

184
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,875
Your call.

185
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,166
I mean no one could blame you

186
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,291
if you wanted to leave
the planet right now.

187
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,750
So what are you
gonna do about it...

188
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,625
Mister?

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,750
Well I'll be damned if
you sure didn't stick us

190
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,708
with one big pain
the ass legacy, Bruce.

191
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,458
So what now?

192
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,500
Looks like we got
one more party to go to!

193
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,875
Yeah!

194
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,166
All right, Angel!

195
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,708
Where'd they bury it?

196
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,375
It's under Godwing
at coordinates

197
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,583
E--zero--zero--eight--three,
N--zero--zero--eight--zero.

198
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,666
Cancellation code is
E--L--V--I--S zero eight two.

199
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,541
Good.

200
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,000
Punch those in for me, Bishop.

201
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,083
Already on it.

202
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:33,500
Yeah?

203
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,666
Ata boy.

204
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,166
Thanks for everything,
Angelica.

205
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,625
Coordinates are in
the ship's mainframe.

206
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,750
Sending them to you, Katana!

207
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,333
Why's it so damn
far down there?

208
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,333
So what's wrong?
Scared or something?

209
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,875
Don't you ever doubt...

210
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,458
Master Katana's Super
High Speed Express!

211
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,291
Sunrise!

212
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,041
Now that's gorgeous!

213
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,375
We're already past the time;
aren't we, Inspector?

214
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,916
Looks like it.

215
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,125
Then it's safe to say
Mister and his gang stopped

216
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,625
that photonic bomb
from going off, right?

217
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,500
Something's approaching
off our bow, Chief!

218
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
Huh?

219
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,583
Could that be...?

220
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,916
'Fraid it is, Bishop.

221
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,791
You will not defeat me...

222
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,708
You will NOT defeat me!!!

223
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
Katana, turn us around.

224
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,166
What for?!

225
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,541
Marciano wants to settle
this up once and for all.

226
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,500
But...!

227
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,583
This'll be a one--round fight.

228
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,750
All right, then.

229
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,583
Let's go!

230
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,791
Marciano!

231
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,416
MISTER!!!

232
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,750
Marciano was...

233
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,750
she wasa coyote,
a long time ago.

234
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,208
But even then...

235
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,375
I never shared
a drink with her...

236
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,541
So...

237
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,125
the planet's really safe, huh?

238
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,041
All thanks to Mister's Coyotes.

239
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,958
Yeah that's pretty much it.

240
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,916
Oh, God, this situation
is so heart--breaking!

241
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,708
Where the heck
did that come from?

242
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,333
When you think about it it's
really amazing, Angelica!

243
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,708
They risked their lives to
save everyone and no one's

244
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,625
give them any credit
for it, are they?

245
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,041
No one at all.

246
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,041
People are just gonna
see them as criminals.

247
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,958
Oh, don't be dramatic.

248
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,458
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving!

249
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,583
You can't be serious!

250
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,208
These should do for now.

251
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,125
Huh?

252
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,083
When it comes
right down to it...

253
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,041
Mister and his coyotes saved
Graceland and everyone on it

254
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
because that's
who coyotes are.

255
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,625
It's really not
that complicated.

256
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,041
You're right.

257
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,708
The "Coyotes."
Has a nice ring to it.

258
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,000
As your President,

259
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,833
I accept full criticism for
the photonic bomb scare.

260
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,291
However, a greater truth was
served during this crisis.

261
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,416
The one million plus
inhabitants of Graceland

262
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,333
are alive and well today.

263
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,083
And for that reason above all,

264
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,708
I take pride in, and
stand by my decision.

265
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,791
Recent public polls indicate a
growing public approval rating

266
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,208
for the President's handling
of Graceland, keeping the number

267
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,541
of casualties to a minimum.

268
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,416
Hey, Katana.

269
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,083
Are you up for some
gold--hunting?

270
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,166
I heard there was 20 tons
of it that got shipwrecked

271
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,500
out in the middle of...

272
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
On snowy--ass mountain?!

273
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,708
Too cold for me, thanks.

274
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,250
I also heard there was
someone smuggling a Da Vinci!

275
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,125
Whattya say?

276
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,750
Paintings are more YOUR speed.

277
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,666
No, thanks!

278
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,916
Come on!

279
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,666
You're gonna help
my fix my church first,

280
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,958
after all that trouble
you caused, right?

281
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,958
C'mon now, Swamp.

282
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,458
You're not gonna begrudge us
a couple stops along the way,

283
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,708
are ya?

284
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,083
Besides, we can probably
use some of those soggy

285
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,750
space dollars to fix
your church afterwards.

286
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,041
And I just remembered
a legendary whiskey

287
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,791
on a planet called Scotch!

288
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,333
One case left!

289
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,583
Aged in a barrel
just like the old days;

290
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,291
ya can't tell me that you
don't wanna drink some of that!

291
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,083
Whiskey?

292
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,416
So I'm left out
of this celebration?!

293
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,916
You could have your fill of
that famous Scotchian cheese!

294
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,208
Cheese, huh?

295
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,166
All right!

296
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,875
This is gettin cheesey.

297
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
All right!

298
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,208
Hey, we're still doing
that Aquaria trip, right?

299
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,416
Summer Babes!

300
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,708
Waitin' for ME!

301
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,083
You wish, poser.

302
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,916
We'll have to
re--open the Pirate.

303
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,541
I just got
some new menu ideas!

304
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,958
Oh, yeah!

305
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,750
The boys are probably
starving their asses off now!

306
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,833
And the LADIES are
crying themselves to sleep

307
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,208
waiting for me!

308
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,291
Humor me here!!

309
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,333
Just buy me drink
when we get there!

310
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,833
I said we're fixing
my church first, God damn it!

311
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:37,625
Relax!

312
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,333
We'll do all that stuff!

313
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,166
Hell yeah!

314
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,958
Let's do it!

315
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,791
Get a grip Katana!
