1
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,666
And, it's all done!

2
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeeaaahhh...

3
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,708
Well, what're we waitin' for?

4
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,166
I'll explain the nuts and
bolts of this one more time

5
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,750
while we get
through breakfast.

6
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,250
Thanks for the grub, Franca!

7
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,208
So, if we're where
the bacon is...

8
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,125
HERE, then this is Graceland.

9
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,875
At the Coyote's normal cruising
speed, that's a 21--day trip.

10
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,750
Of course, we don't have 21
days to make it there and save

11
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,416
our sweet little treasure from
gettin' swallowed into oblivion.

12
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,083
So...

13
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,625
that means we're gonna have to
try and find us a warp gate...

14
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,541
right?

15
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,041
Right.

16
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,375
Just so happens the closest
stargate complex is Big Pink

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,125
in the Woody System.

18
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,958
Now, if we can tap that, it's
a straight shot to Graceland.

19
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,416
It'll be a rough ride
so hang on tight...

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,666
Did you say "tap that?"

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,208
Sounds good to me!

22
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,833
There'll probably be an
inspection, and I'm betting

23
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,958
the Guild has their hands
all over the operation.

24
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,166
Them again?

25
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,708
That's just the way it is.

26
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,083
Every star system out there
wants to pretend they're clean,

27
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,458
but it's all bullshit.

28
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,916
It's gotten to the point
where the Guild has a piece

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,416
of everyone's action.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,708
Ya know...

31
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,708
I love this!

32
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,541
I've never had
anything so good!

33
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm glad you like it!

34
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,000
I added it to the menu at
The Pirate just last month.

35
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,458
Oh, yeah?

36
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,416
Well...?

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,041
This is amazing!

38
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,333
You are one
helluva cook, Franca!

39
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,125
Yeah?

40
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,375
Fantastic!

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,875
Mm--hmm!

42
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,041
Even if we make it to
Graceland, we'll be droppin'

43
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
right in the middle
of a war zone.

44
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,875
On top of that, Bruce's
"Gigabanks Wonderland 2.0"

45
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,583
replica ain't gonna
be an easy crack.

46
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,625
And you can bet your ass the
Coyote's gonna attract attention

47
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,541
from anyone lookin' for a quick
bounty - so we'll beat 'em

48
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,791
to the punch.

49
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,166
Send a bait message...

50
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,666
a thousand space
klicks toward Big Pink:

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,250
"Looking for someone to feed the
Persian Kitty some fall salmon."

52
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,458
Sounds good!

53
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,416
But first I wanna feed my face!

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,416
Franca, ya got
any more of this stuff?

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,208
Sure do.

56
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,916
Want me to get you some?

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,916
Nah, that's all right.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,583
I'll help myself.

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,833
And there's more of this, too...

60
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,375
Oh!

61
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,208
Thank you!

62
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,791
Whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa
WHOA, hold on!

63
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,416
Oops!

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,291
Sorry about that!

65
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,083
At 6:00 pm Geteldova
local time this evening,

66
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,333
the new generation photonic bomb
"Jupiter" left its moorings

67
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,916
with several
security escort vessels.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,833
While the day and time
of the bomb--drop haven't

69
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,458
been announced, the convoy
appears to be en route

70
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,458
to Moonwalk's Fussa Gate.

71
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,291
All right.

72
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,416
It's time you gave us
some answers.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,833
What was the point
behind the assassinations?

74
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,250
Certainly your "Mother Dear"
and the Guild's inner circle

75
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,333
were more powerful
together, weren't they?

76
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,375
It's pretty obvious
my mother has her own agenda.

77
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,833
What sort of agenda?

78
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,125
My sisters and I carry out
our Mother's orders,

79
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,166
and that's all
we really need to know.

80
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,708
And you just blindly follow?

81
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,625
Well think about it this way.

82
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,458
Do you analyze your motivations
to continually gorge yourself,

83
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,083
or do you just follow
your programming?

84
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,125
Then, if you can't rationalize,
tell me your orders.

85
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,333
You can do that...

86
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,500
Can't you?

87
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,125
Yeah, I guess I can...

88
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,291
I was instructed to go to planet
Ku--Rong and round up Mister

89
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,833
and some brat named Franca,
but she said not to kill 'em.

90
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,083
Just bring 'em back to Mother...

91
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,000
then get 'em to spit out
the location of the treasure.

92
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,625
The plot thickens...

93
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,958
Add Mister...

94
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,000
Franca...

95
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,416
and now a treasure too?

96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,625
So why do you want to know
about it so badly, anyway?

97
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,875
For one thing...

98
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,916
it's my job to know.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,375
That's right.

100
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,458
The Inspector's been dogging
Mister's every move since

101
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,041
she became a detective
over four years ago!

102
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,500
Well, my hat's OFF
to you, honey...

103
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,625
It still doesn't
make any sense.

104
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,083
A treasure, Franca, and some
connection between Mister

105
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,458
and Marciano?

106
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,541
And where in the hell is
Mister trying to go anyway?

107
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,666
I know their destination.

108
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,458
Huh?!

109
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,750
You really know?

110
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,916
Of course I do...

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,958
...but it ain't gonna be easy...

112
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,291
Hey, Mister...

113
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,041
You think the Federation
and Graceland could

114
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,125
just call a cease fire
and stop the bombing?

115
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,000
I couldn't tell ya...

116
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,791
The whole thing started as
a misunderstanding between

117
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,000
the Federation government
and Graceland's government.

118
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,750
The bureaucrats on both sides
have been rattling sabers

119
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,416
and pointing fingers
at each other ever since.

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,416
So, the hawks on each side
have to decide whether

121
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,125
peace is an option?

122
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,916
Oooooo--right!

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We might as well plan
for the bomb--drop.

124
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,791
I'm gonna go check
the autopilot real quick.

125
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,166
Okay.

126
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,708
Hey and shouldn't you
be performing maintenance

127
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,625
or something?

128
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,166
Shut up!

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,708
Shouldn't YOU be getting ready
to break into the Gigabanks

130
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,416
or something, ya jerk?!

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,708
Wrong again, boy.

132
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,833
I'm only here to see
if this guy's man enough

133
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,250
to avoid getting
his ass shot off

134
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,250
tryin' to get Bruce's money.

135
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,791
Oh, really?

136
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,125
Whatever!

137
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,916
Huh?

138
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,791
Hey there!

139
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,875
Whatcha doing there
all by yourself, Franca?

140
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,916
Nothing.

141
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,625
What are you gonna do after
this job's done, Katana?

142
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,208
What?

143
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,625
Me?

144
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,208
That's a good one.

145
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,208
I really don't think about my
future that much, you know?

146
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
How about you, Franca?

147
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,208
Are you gonna go
back to The Pirate?

148
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,833
You and Mister oughta...

149
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,791
Yeah, I was
wondering about that.

150
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,583
About whether he's
just taking care of me

151
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,291
to get ahold of the treasure.

152
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
Five days, and that's it.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,500
After that he can cut me loose
in space for all he cares.

154
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,375
That's a total load of crap!

155
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,750
Whether you
believe it or not,

156
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,791
you're more important to
Mister than just the money!

157
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,875
Yeah, that's
exactly what he said.

158
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,125
But I have no idea if
that's really true or not.

159
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,833
I don't want
not to believe him,

160
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,125
but it could definitely
happen that way.

161
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,375
That's why...

162
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,291
That's why I couldn't
hand over this pendant.

163
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,041
If I did, he wouldn't
have any use

164
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,916
for keeping me around would he?

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,583
Then where would I go?

166
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,208
Franca...

167
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,625
I'm just wondering if
I'm gonna be alone again

168
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,666
once we're done with all this.

169
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,125
Katana.

170
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,333
Please don't tell anybody...

171
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,541
what I just said.

172
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,708
OK?

173
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,750
You got it...

174
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,375
Not a single word.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,125
Bingo!

176
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,291
This is Persian Kitty,
Persian Kitty here.

177
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,375
Do you have any
tasty fall salmon?

178
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,000
Feelin' the need
for some fall salmon.

179
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,250
We have 1200 of them,
Persian Kitty.

180
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,791
That's 1200.

181
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,041
Roger!

182
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,333
Requesting guidance data.

183
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,125
Looks like we're in!

184
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,250
Ready to go back there?

185
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,875
Ahoy there, Skipper!

186
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,333
Boy, I tell you what, this is
one hell of a ship y'got here!

187
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,125
Damn glad ta meetcha!

188
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,166
You wanna keep yourself
in style, doncha, boys?

189
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,541
Now these here Hawaiian
shirts are 150 years old,

190
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,916
spotless and straight from
the Mall--Warts collection

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
in super--mint condition!

192
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,833
And for you guys, only 10,000!

193
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,083
What?!

194
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,333
Hey, no "try before you buy,"
soldier--boy!

195
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,916
It ain't "mint condition"
with fingerprints on it!

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,166
Well...

197
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,666
you can't tell me
that that ain't a BARGAIN!

198
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,625
Now if you were goin' over
to a lady's place after this,

199
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,166
I'd go with the yellow!

200
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,500
Now this yellow is made from
the legendary Kamchatkan thread

201
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,708
and wouldn't ya know it,
it's the only one we got left!

202
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,500
So how about it, fellas?

203
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,000
Shore is purdy!

204
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,166
It's SUPER purdy!

205
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,583
Well, if yeller ain't yer style,
we've got some nice manly

206
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,250
blue ones that
oughta drive 'em wild!

207
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,708
No really, I don't need
to buy any shirts today.

208
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,041
And where's the STUFF
that you promised us?!

209
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,125
Huh?

210
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,458
I'm talking about the
damn "Persian!"

211
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,875
Hoo--ee!

212
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,375
Girls don't like a man
who's in too much of a hurry.

213
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,500
Nope.

214
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,041
You can't hurry love
or Persian, right?

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,541
Well, test it!

216
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,666
Right!

217
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,166
99 point nine--
nine percent, sir.

218
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Purest I've ever seen!

219
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,916
So, what do you say, fellers?

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,625
We'll take it, of course!

221
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,208
Well, this here DEAL...

222
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,375
is done.

223
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,625
Much obliged, Skipper!

224
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,833
You made a damn fine choice!

225
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,000
By the way, Captain,
what's your next port of call?

226
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,166
Big Pink and then over
to Fussa via the stargate.

227
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,000
Suppose you'd be willing to take
a few "unregistered passengers"

228
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,916
I'd be willing to forget about
that whole transaction for ya...

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,375
Fine, you can stay aboard.

230
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,083
Thanks a bunch, Skipper!

231
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,458
Boy, those export restrictions
on vintage clothes are

232
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,083
a real hassle, ain't they?

233
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,083
Yeah, they're a real shame.

234
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,125
How 'bout you,
Mister--Second--in--Command?

235
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,708
No, I'm not
interested in anything.

236
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,541
Really.

237
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,666
What about this here color?

238
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,958
You'd be gorgeous in it!

239
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,916
Take it easy, now!

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,958
Naw!

241
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,791
You need one of
these instead, man!

242
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:29,250
It's a hundred for those, but
you can have 'em for 90 instead.

243
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,208
You win.

244
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,291
I'll buy both of your shirts.

245
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,125
Thank ya very much!

246
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,416
OK, where did I
put my wallet...?

247
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,125
Hey man.

248
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,250
I'll hold that for ya.

249
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,875
Thanks.

250
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,458
Docking sequence underway.

251
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,333
Commencing gate approach.

252
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,833
Helm, all ahead slow.

253
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,041
All hands, stand to
your mooring stations.

254
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:12,041
Vessel number B9--664582,
you have clearance to dock.

255
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,708
Please proceed
on course to Gate 5.

256
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,208
Vessel number B9--664582,
you have clearance to dock.

257
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,916
This is it.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,916
Please work, okay?

259
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,666
Gate cleared.

260
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,000
On course for
the scanning block.

261
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:36,166
Commencing scan of
vessel number B9--664582.

262
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,250
Please maintain
your current speed.

263
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,083
This is the Control Tower.

264
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:53,083
Scan of vessel number
B9--664582 is now complete.

265
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:58,166
Please follow guidance signal
75--8, and proceed to Gate N--6.

266
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,708
Following arrival, all
passengers must proceed through

267
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,666
immigrations and customs.

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,916
Where in the world
didja get that getup?

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,958
Oh come on!

270
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,291
I'm just tryin'
something different!

271
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,541
What's wrong with it?

272
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,541
Man, that looks like crap!

273
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,375
Huh?

274
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,166
These threads are awesome!

275
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,000
Whatever!

276
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,250
You're just gettin' too old!

277
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,750
What do you think, Franca?

278
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,750
Oh, I get it -
you guys are jealous...

279
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,083
Well, we made it this far,
so now let's relax a bit.

280
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,916
Looks like we're gonna be
sittin' here drinking tea

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,208
for a while...

282
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,750
Yeah, just our luck.

283
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,125
The Graceland gate is closed.

284
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,333
Just bein' here's
the important thing.

285
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,791
Exactly.

286
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,000
They can close the entrance,
but the gate still works.

287
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,875
We can always bust
through the thing on our own.

288
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,583
Yeah, but you screwed up
on Sandvil hoping for things

289
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,541
to "go right," didn'tcha?

290
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,208
WOULD YOU FOR ONCE GET
THE HELL OFFA MY ASS??!!

291
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh...

292
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,000
We have a plan, don't we?

293
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

294
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,416
The Graceland gate
is over here.

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,916
We already know that.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,458
And we also know that the gate
is being operated remotely

297
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,208
by the crew in
the control tower.

298
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,583
So we cut the link between

299
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,208
the two and the Coyote
has a free run at the gate.

300
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,875
Yeah, but it seems to me
like something's missing here.

301
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,791
Like how about some blueprints?

302
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,291
Oh, like these?

303
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,666
When we were back on Ku--Rong

304
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,958
I got 'em from some buddies
at The Pirate Hideout.

305
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,875
What'd you have
to do for those?

306
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,333
Wait for me, Angelica!

307
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,083
Getting upset isn't going
to change anything, you know!

308
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,666
Well I have every reason!

309
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,625
We go to Security and
they tell us to run over

310
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,208
to Traffic Safety!

311
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,541
And then those brain surgeons
give us crap and nobody knows

312
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,250
who's responsible for what!

313
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,541
There's no time to spare
and we're up to our eyeballs

314
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,333
in government idiots!

315
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,541
Hel--lo!

316
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
dont' you work for the
government yourself?

317
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,916
Knock it off!

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,958
Stop it, you idiot!

319
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,166
Cut it out, dammit!

320
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,583
You have to be careful with it!

321
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,083
Take it easy!

322
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,541
Uh--oh, boss--man.

323
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,750
That lady's definitely
tuned in to your frequency.

324
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,041
That's no good.

325
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,625
Tea time's definitely over,
let's get movin'.

326
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:45,583
Huh?

327
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,583
Hey, Franca - what's up?

328
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,666
Wow, that's such
a beautiful place...

329
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,125
I wonder if Graceland
ever used to be like that?

330
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,041
Aquaria, huh?

331
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,500
"Never change." Staying
the same for eternity...

332
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,083
So have you ever been
to that planet, Mister?

333
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,791
A place like that isn't made
for people like us, Franca.

334
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,166
Oh...

335
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,208
Hey, Mister, what's the deal?

336
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,666
Where you goin'?

337
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,291
Just wait, will ya?

338
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,000
Hey, you got a minute, man?

339
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,083
Sure.

340
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,625
What can I do
for you today, sir?

341
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,541
One of my friends took a liking
to that poster of Aquaria

342
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,083
you have out there
and I was wondering

343
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,666
if I could get one from you.

344
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,125
Um, I'm not sure I can do that.

345
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,000
You sure?

346
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,666
'fraid not.

347
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,125
I'm sorry, sir.

348
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,416
OK.

349
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,083
What if I sign up for the trip?

350
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,500
I can have it then, right?

351
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,958
Sure, I could do that.

352
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,083
All right!

353
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,500
Five tickets from
Ku--Rong to Aquaria!

354
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
A nice vacation.

355
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,125
To celebrate the
conquest of Graceland!

356
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,750
Sounds good to me!

357
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,958
Hey, you sure
we can afford that?

358
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,125
Your worry lines are
starting to show, old man!

359
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,583
Aw, bite me, Methuselah.

360
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,291
We'll split into three groups.

361
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,708
One will take the Coyote here
from the Guild ship to the gate.

362
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,416
The next group cuts

363
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,416
the link between the gate
and the control tower...

364
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,958
Bishop.

365
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeeeeahhhh...

366
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,000
do I look like a...

367
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,416
"group" to you?

368
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,541
Then the third group will
open the gate to Graceland!

369
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,541
Chief!

370
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,708
The identification code for
Madame Marciano's battleship

371
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,833
is on the inbound vessels list.

372
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,375
No one told me
she was coming here.

373
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,000
They want to dock and
check our port entry lists.

374
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,791
What should I do?

375
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,250
Just do what they tell you.

376
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,166
But, sir...

377
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,041
Give them what they want!

378
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,583
We don't have a choice here.

379
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,791
You don't want 'em to blow away
the entire terminal, do you?

380
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
"Never change," huh?

381
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,083
Katana and Swamp, once you
get the Coyote moving,

382
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,250
leave the moorings and head
straight to the Graceland gate.

383
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,583
Do it quickly,

384
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,375
but no so fast that
you're attracting attention.

385
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,166
And if someone
does notice you...

386
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,916
Well, go like hell and
bust through there already.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,958
Heh.

388
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,625
That's what
you're best at, right?

389
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,708
Bishop, head straight for
the gate when you're done

390
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,166
cutting off the control
link from the tower.

391
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,458
Easy enough for him to say.

392
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,791
Dammit!

393
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,375
Even if they detect the problem,
we'll be long gone before

394
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,541
those bureaucrats
even get off their asses!

395
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,208
What?

396
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,583
Sir!

397
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,916
We're getting an error code
from the Graceland gate!

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,291
It's not working again?

399
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,666
What shall I do, sir?

400
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,583
Well, it's already shut down.

401
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,875
Call the repair center
or whoever.

402
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,333
Right.

403
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,541
Let's do it!

404
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,833
Katana here...

405
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,458
And...

406
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,416
Swamp's here too!

407
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,958
No problems so far, boss.

408
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,291
We're headed for
the Graceland gate now.

409
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,875
Bishop the Great speaking!

410
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,958
And no screw--ups on my part,
preacher--man!

411
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
Over and out!

412
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,375
What?

413
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,458
Is this it?

414
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,166
Where the hell am I?!

415
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,875
That's what I've been
telling you, damn it!

416
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,541
You need to put guards on the
Graceland gate immediately...

417
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:37,333
and do a thorough check of every
ship that comes into port!

418
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,333
I can't make that
happen right away!

419
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,333
You're in charge here,
aren't you?

420
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,750
We're running out of time!

421
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,000
I may be in charge,

422
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,291
but something like that
isn't entirely up to me.

423
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,583
Idiot!

424
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,791
We have entered
the docking area.

425
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,416
On course to
the Graceland gate.

426
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,541
Port of entry list is verified.

427
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,000
Cross referencing
with data we already have

428
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:03,458
produces five people
who are 95 percent matches.

429
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,125
Deploy our attack fighters
around the Graceland gateway.

430
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,791
And make sure our stormtroopers
are prepared to land.

431
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,958
Link up with the control
tower's security cameras and

432
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,583
get every video feed between the
moorings and the gate itself.

433
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,416
Get your sisters
ready to go, April.

434
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,916
I'll need you out there.

435
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,833
Yes, Mother.

436
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,833
Canned peaches, canned peaches!

437
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,291
Can we finish
eating first, mother?

438
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,291
Franca, how's it
goin' over there?

439
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,000
Fine.

440
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,083
I'm almost done here.

441
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:44,750
Okay.

442
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,291
It's opening up now!

443
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,750
We did it!

444
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,958
OK, so where are we
going now, Inspector?

445
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,875
To the Graceland
gate of course.

446
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,458
Shouldn't we get permission
to do that first?

447
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,041
Somehow I get the
feeling that Mister

448
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,500
isn't going to be asking
anyone for permission.

449
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,375
Duh!

450
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,833
You finally figured that out?!

451
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,583
I'm not so sure
this is a good idea...

452
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,916
We've got the gate open,
so move it!

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Boss!

454
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,791
Trouble here!

455
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,708
We've got Guild
fighters on our ass!

456
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,291
You've gotta be kidding me!

457
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,916
I don't know where I am!

458
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,375
Gimme a break,
will ya for the love of...

459
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,458
WHERE THE HELL AM I?!

460
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,916
Stop fooling around and
move your ass, Bishop!

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,875
C'mon, let's hook up with 'em!

462
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,375
The rendezvous's impossible!

463
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,791
We're gonna get blown
to bits if I slow down!

464
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,208
I'm out!

465
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:00,958
At least...

466
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,875
I THINK so...

467
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:03,500
Bishop!

468
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,791
Over here!

469
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,208
Sons of bitches!

470
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,666
So, are you ready
to finish this?

471
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,708
Yes.

472
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,416
We're ready, Mother.
