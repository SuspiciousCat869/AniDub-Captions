1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,833
We're going after
Mister and his crew!

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,583
Do anything you want with them.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,166
As long as they can still talk.

4
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,833
Hell yeah!

5
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,958
Man, this has been
a long time comin'!

6
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:15,791
Right?

7
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,333
You might want to wait.

8
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,000
Until after we've gotten the
treasure for your celebration.

9
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,208
Gimme a break, man!

10
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,541
We made it this far

11
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,791
so all we gotta do is
collect the money, Bishop!

12
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,250
Wouldn't know about that...

13
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,375
Huh?

14
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,708
Come on!

15
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,666
The worst of it's behind us!

16
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,791
Right, Mister?

17
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,041
We're not out of
the woods yet.

18
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:37,958
Oh?

19
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,208
No, we're not.

20
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,666
Take a look behind you.

21
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,458
Huh?

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,041
Behind us...?

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,625
Th--They're right on top of us!

24
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,958
Oh, you noticed, did ya?

25
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,333
So what are you
gonna do about it?

26
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,958
Situations like these
obviously call for...

27
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,208
running away.

28
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,083
That's all you've got,
"Master" Katana?!

29
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:00,833
Hey!

30
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,541
Umm...

31
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,625
sorry 'bout that.

32
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,916
What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,375
Look, in any case we've got
the pendant, all right?

34
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,458
So all we have to do is ditch
these guys and go straight

35
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,750
to Graceland!

36
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,125
No.

37
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,625
That won't work - if we
"go straight to Graceland,"

38
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,916
we're gonna end up taking
them straight to the treasure!

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,333
Oh, give it a rest!

40
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,791
All we have to do
is get 'em off our tail!

41
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,458
And what if we can't do that?

42
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,458
Hell if I know!

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,750
Runnin's our only choice!

44
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,625
You didn't plan
for shit, did you?!

45
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,541
Hey!

46
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,041
That's more shit than you did!

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,875
Hate to interrupt.

48
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,666
But plans or not, it's
all gonna turn to "shit...

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,708
"If we make it to Graceland
without someone to guide us.

50
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,083
What the hell are
you talking about?

51
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,333
Did I stutter?

52
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,750
If we were to set down
on Graceland right now

53
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,625
we wouldn't find a damn thing,
can't you boys see that?

54
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,208
Well what about the pendant?

55
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,875
Oh, you think there was a
MAP inside or something?

56
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,875
Then, what is it for, exactly?

57
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,166
Let's solve the
heavy mysteries later.

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,708
Right now let's just get
these dolls off of our asses.

59
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,750
So, how do we go about
capturing them alive?

60
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,000
Hand to hand combat
should be effective.

61
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,041
But I'd rather not ruin this
outfit just to get the job done.

62
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,250
Me either!

63
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,791
I just got this tailored
to fit me recently!

64
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,208
Well, actually, I just
bought mine off the rack.

65
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,958
But still...

66
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,083
If it isn't too much
trouble, April dear...

67
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,791
leave us somebody
to play with.

68
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,375
If you make it
to the party on time,

69
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,458
you won't miss any of the fun.

70
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,833
That aside, have we
heard anything from May?

71
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,750
Still no contact, April.

72
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,875
I see...

73
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,708
I'm sure that she'll be fine.

74
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,416
Here they come!

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,083
Let's get this party started!

76
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,916
Now there's a line
that takes me back!

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,708
Yeah.

78
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,875
Just like three years ago!

79
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,375
Let's do it!

80
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,333
YEEEEEEEEE--HAWWWWWWWWW!

81
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,208
Shoot them to bits!

82
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,750
But just don't kill them.

83
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,666
Oh yeah, I forgot!

84
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,875
Dammit...

85
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,625
Gettin' a little carried away!

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,416
Bastards!

87
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,500
Sorry 'bout that, guys!

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,708
OHHHHHHHH YEAHHHHHHHH!

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,416
Even with the Coyote
at full speed...

90
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,375
Graceland is still
three days away via Moonwalk.

91
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,416
Then, it's another half--day to
find the Pirate King's legacy

92
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,125
and bring it back with us.

93
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,625
Bishop!

94
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,250
How much time do we have left
before they drop the bomb

95
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,125
on Planet Graceland?

96
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,666
Well, we're looking
at just over 5 days, 11 hours

97
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,708
Keep it simple!

98
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,375
5 days, "11 hours"...

99
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,208
minus 3 days
leaves us with 2 days.

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,166
So...

101
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,416
Two days it is!

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,083
So what are we
going to do, exactly?

103
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,041
Yeah, really!

104
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,416
Fill us in, Mister!

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,041
Franca!

106
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:04,416
Uh...

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,416
yeah?

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,875
Ya been in touch
with Swamp lately?

109
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,500
Wait a minute.

110
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,291
"Swamp?" Oh!

111
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,666
THAT Swamp?

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,916
Swamp Gordon was the
only guy they ever referred

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,166
to as Pirate King Bruce
Dockley's right--hand man.

114
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,583
Bruce and Swamp always worked
together like clockwork

115
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,333
and never missed a beat.

116
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,458
Oh that reminds me, the two
of you got into it one time.

117
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,875
Didn't you, Bishop?

118
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,166
So, he kicked your ass?

119
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,125
Leave my ass outta this!

120
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,916
Know where he's
hanging out nowadays, Franca?

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,791
Well, he was a pretty
frequent guest at the bar

122
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,166
and he'd always ask...

123
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,125
"How's it goin'?"

124
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,083
He said the door's open
if I ever need any help.

125
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,958
That's our hook--up!

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,791
Damn it!

127
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,666
Is there anything on the radar?

128
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,208
All righty then!

129
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,416
Looks like we need to drop in on
Swamp for some tea and cookies!

130
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,916
Yeah right!

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,166
It's not like you guys were
like best buds or anything!

132
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,083
Reminds me of a story...

133
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,958
See, there was this small town
where everyone was fightin...

134
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,083
so some of the local kids
got together and decided

135
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,583
they were gonna fix it.

136
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,500
They wondered if they could
cook up some kinda situation

137
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
that would force their idiot
parents into cooperatin'

138
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,250
with each other.

139
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,666
And then suddenly,
they had an idea:

140
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,375
An invisible enemy... germs!

141
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,375
Pretty clever, huh?

142
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,250
Anyway, their plan
worked like a charm!

143
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,250
The grown--ups got over
themselves and scrambled

144
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,250
into action together
against a common foe.

145
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:44,958
So?

146
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,041
Come on!

147
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,958
You boneheads don't get it?

148
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,416
Hell, in our case we don't
have to invent an enemy

149
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,833
'cause we've already got one!

150
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,291
Hel--lo???

151
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,958
Marciano!

152
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,666
Bin--go.

153
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,041
Marciano...

154
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,833
Papa!

155
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,416
Target sighted!

156
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,750
After them!

157
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,750
I definitely like
playing hide--and--seek

158
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,083
better than tag!!

159
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,166
We'll let the dolls
keep chasin' us...

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,791
and then we'll just drop 'em
off at Swamp's front door!

161
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,875
You up to it?

162
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,833
Hey, who do you
think you're talking to?

163
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,166
Katana Express...

164
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,583
special delivery!

165
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,833
Let us embrace this blessed
day and spend it joyfully!

166
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,833
Reflect on your past

I mean, John,
who's gonna get it...

It's Franca's money!

So then don't HIT 'em.

216
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,208
Just shake 'em up a bit.

chose is on his way.

Don't let those choppers

You hear me?!

239
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,541
Can't we at least take it easy
while we're on the ship?

240
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,375
Overworking ourselves
isn't going to get us

241
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,041
to Ku--Rong any
faster, Inspector.

242
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,208
Somethin' the matter?

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,458
Huh?

244
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,833
It has been 2 days since
the announcement of the plan

245
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,000
to attack planet Graceland
with a photonic bomb.

246
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:20,791
Protests against the use...

Captain!

248
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,750
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to get this ship to Ku--Rong

249
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,916
a lot more quickly than this!

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,625
Marciano makes her move...

251
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,333
She rebels against the
Criminal Guild at the

252
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,958
same time her 12 Sisters
appeared on Ku--Rong...

253
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,916
Coincidence?

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,916
I don't think so!

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,041
Now look here...

256
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:37,916
Inspector...

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,791
Just get this bucket moving!

258
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,875
What's going on?

259
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,916
Shouldn't I know, too?

260
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,875
So tell me.

261
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,125
What's going on here?

262
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,750
The senior members
of the Criminal Guild

263
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,541
are all assassinated
by Madame Marciano.

264
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,583
After the twelve of you show up
on Sandvil and Ku--Rong...

265
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,750
Why?

266
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,958
What does your family
want from Mister?

267
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,541
You ought to know the
answer to that, at least.

268
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,208
Sounds bad...

269
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
Sounds REALLY bad.

270
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,916
They've actually started
the damn countdown...

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,250
Chief of Staff,
General Malcolm Lloyd, age 42.

272
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,958
At the age of 29, he was the
youngest ever to be promoted

273
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,541
to the rank of general.

274
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,208
He was appointed Chief of Staff
at age 38, and has since been

275
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,375
known by those around him as a
man who possesses an iron will.

276
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,416
General Lloyd is already aboard
the same DK--9981...

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,000
Not exactly the
flexible type, huh?

278
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,375
Bastard!

279
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,208
Makes you wonder if
they'd postpone the bombing

280
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,625
if something "unfortunate"
happened to him.

281
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,291
Oh, you mean like I did
to you back in the day?

282
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
What'd you say?!

283
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
You wanna go for round two,
ya old sack of crap?!

284
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Didn't learn the first time?

285
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,166
Screw you!

286
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,375
You want some'a this?

287
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,375
Then come get you some'a this!

288
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,916
I don't see ya movin'!

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,833
How about if I close my eyes?

290
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,916
First shot's free, sweetie!

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,166
Don't embarrass yourself.

292
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,500
Shut the hell up!

293
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,291
Hey bud, it's been a while!

294
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,458
How about you put on some
tea for us or somethin'?

295
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,625
We're a little tired out

296
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,958
from playin' with
Marciano and her dolls.

297
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,750
You haven't changed
a bit, have ya?

298
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,333
I s'pose not.

299
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,083
I tried to turn over a new leaf
in the slammer, "Reverend,"

300
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,833
but it's kinda hard to change
once ya pass a certain age,

301
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,166
wouldn't ya say?!

302
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,083
You sure you can afford
to be acting so laid back?

303
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,041
I thought you were
strapped for time.

304
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,208
How about you try begging me?

305
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,375
"Oh, please, Mr. Swamp, tell me
the secret of the inheritance

306
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,791
Bruce left behind!"

307
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,708
I already know how
the pendant works...

308
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,916
Good one!

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,458
You almost had me
there for a second.

310
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,083
So you think I'm lyin'?

311
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,041
Well, if you're
so short on time...

312
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,541
what in the hell
are you doin' here?

313
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,333
See?

314
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,375
Can't even answer me, can ya?

315
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,458
It's Bruce's eye!

316
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,416
Bruce had an artificial eye
that saw everything HE saw,

317
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,416
and recorded it.

318
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,708
You knew that?

319
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,291
Hell yeah.

320
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,041
Okay, then...

321
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,083
So you know what
the pendant does.

322
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,791
You come here just to make a
fool out of me or somethin'?

323
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,583
I need ya.

324
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,166
You what?

325
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,333
I'm sayin' I need help from the
Pirate King's right hand man,

326
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,583
cuz this prob'ly ain't
gonna work without ya.

327
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,000
Sorry, friend...

328
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,208
You can't smoke in here.

329
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,791
Uh, Oh...

330
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,875
Wait a minute!

331
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,041
You already know
what the pendant does.

332
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,750
Let's just get underway for
Graceland without this jerk!

333
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,458
There's no way you're
considerin' takin' him up

334
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,333
on this, are ya, Boss?

335
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,833
Why don't you say something?!

336
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,333
Chill out, we've
got the provisions.

337
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,791
Oh come on...!

338
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,875
Just knowing the secret of
the pendant won't be enough.

339
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,125
It sure doesn't mean that we'll
be able to find the treasure.

340
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,125
The person who lays
claim to it has to be

341
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,125
as powerful as
the Pirate King...

342
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,083
or even more so,
wouldn't you say?

343
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,625
How 'bout it, preacher--man?

344
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,875
Good morning!

345
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,041
Ladies, Ladies!

346
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,500
What a pleasant surprise!

347
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,000
Good morning to you!

348
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,833
So now...

349
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,125
who are they?

350
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,875
Just some friends
from a while back.

351
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,041
well isn't that wonderful?!

352
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,541
This town is so much in debt

353
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,458
to you for your lovely
services, Reverend.

354
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,875
Right?

355
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,750
This is perfect timing
now that your friends are here.

356
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,166
Belinda brought some beautiful,
ripe tomatoes from the garden!

357
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,458
Cathy has homemade
cheese and bacon,

358
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,041
and we also have vegetables,
fresh from Jane's farm.

359
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,083
So everybody,
now --eat hearty!

360
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,291
Eat hearty now!

361
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,666
Thanks again for
all your trouble, ladies.

362
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,791
Thank you kindly!

363
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,208
See you again
tomorrow, Reverend.

364
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,666
We'll be looking forward
to your next service!

365
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,791
You're kinda...

366
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,500
spoiled rotten
around here, arentcha?

367
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,833
Let's have some breakfast!

368
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,375
Wow - these tomatoes
look delicious!

369
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,041
Looks like they won't need any
dressing at all, will they?

370
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,041
Yeah, you're right.

371
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,208
I'm gonna get
the bacon started,

372
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,125
so finish washing
these for me, okay?

373
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,083
You got it!

374
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,875
Got anything for me to do?

375
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,875
Hey, Katana,
can you lend me a hand?

376
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,416
Gotcha!

377
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,375
You go help her, too.

378
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,583
Yessir!

379
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,208
I still can't believe
"Swamp Gordon -- the Pastor."

380
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,041
Talk about shady...

381
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,375
When you were a kid,
didn't you ever keep a journal

382
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,250
about what you wanted
to be in the future?

383
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,916
No way!

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,583
So I had aspirations...

385
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,666
Maybe you didn't.

386
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,708
I still don't believe it...

387
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,041
Okay then, Bishop...

388
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,375
What would you write?

389
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,250
Is this what you want?

390
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,416
You mean, like right now?

391
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,666
Right now.

392
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,833
Well I think it'd
be a no--brainer.

393
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,041
It's the reason
I came here, after all.

394
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,208
Oh, well...

395
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,708
Veggies are ready.

396
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,958
I need a break.

397
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,625
Now, listen...

398
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,833
If you think I'm recognizin'
you as Bruce's heir,

399
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,833
then you're outta
your damn mind.

400
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,000
Now why don't you tell me

401
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,458
about this little
scheme you're hatchin'?

402
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,791
Oh, now it's a
"scheme?" Well...

403
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,666
I'm takin' Franca with me.

404
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,833
I saw Franca working
in that bar of yours

405
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,250
while you were makin'
big rocks smaller.

406
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,208
All I want to do is give that
inheritance over to Franca.

407
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,291
That doesn't mean
giving you a damn dime.

408
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,000
And you don't want YOUR cut?

409
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,625
NO!

410
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,500
It's been 3 years since
Franca came to live with me.

411
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,791
I think she turned out okay...

412
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,916
That doesn't mean you're the
heir to his legacy, does it?!

413
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,666
I don't think so...

414
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,541
And now I need to know why Bruce
chose you in the first place.

415
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,083
Do you, now?

416
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,041
So was Franca any
good as a barkeep?

417
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
I think she wore it well.

418
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,916
Good for her...

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,833
So, you really opened up
that bar and gave up bein'

420
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,958
a pirate all for her sake?

421
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,500
I wanted to be there for her.

422
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,583
I...

423
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,000
really hope you're
still a good shot.

424
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,083
Just make sure you don't miss.

425
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,083
Same to you.

426
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,375
What are you doing?

427
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,708
Don't just stand there!

428
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,375
Here!

429
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,125
Choke on this!

430
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,458
Pastor Swamp!

431
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,833
Be back in a week!

432
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,000
Give everyone
my blessings, OK?

433
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,791
Oh, it's you!

434
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,041
Glad you could make it.

435
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,791
I had no choice - my church
got busted up pretty bad

436
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,250
back there because of you guys.

437
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,208
So shake 'em off.

438
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,583
I'm on it.

439
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,041
As for you.

440
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,583
You still gotta
prove to me you deserve

441
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,375
the Pirate King's legacy,
ya got that?!

442
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,416
Relax...

443
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,166
I'm tryin' ta smoke!

444
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,750
Judgement day!

445
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,500
Oh, I see.

446
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,166
So Swamp joined
Mister on his quest.

447
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,916
Mother, Sep...

448
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,208
Sep is dead.

449
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,583
Thank you, April.

450
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,666
Get my ship ready.

451
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,458
Hey, Mister...

452
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,375
About that story with the kids
and the germs and stuff...

453
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,708
There's something
I was wondering.

454
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,708
On which planet
did that happen?

455
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,291
Never said it was real!

456
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,875
Always DID like
children's fables...
