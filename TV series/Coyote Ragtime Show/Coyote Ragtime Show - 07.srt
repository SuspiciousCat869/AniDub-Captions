1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,208
We've got some more
company in front of us!

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,541
Damn it!

3
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:15,750
Shit!

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,708
So what do we do now, boss?

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,000
Mister, what's up?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,416
Mister?

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,916
Starboard, dammit!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,833
What?

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,041
You sure that's the right gate?

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,958
Just get us in there!

11
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,750
Fire!

12
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,583
One, two...

13
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,125
three.

14
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,458
Hurry up, man!

15
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,750
This ain't good.

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,000
We're all outta
friggin painkillers.

17
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,250
What the hell?

18
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,416
Look!

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,250
We gotta get these
bullets out of his back

20
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,541
or he's gonna be a dead man!

21
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,666
Do it...

22
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,958
Forget the anesthetic.

23
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,875
Just do it.

24
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,458
But Mister...

25
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,500
I'll be fine...

26
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,166
just do it.

27
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,916
Okay Boss, here goes.

28
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,041
Guess we're done...

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,791
I don't think so.

30
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,541
Oh, yes we are...

31
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,625
Calculating our course ahead...

32
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,041
from our current position...

33
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,166
we'll arrive
at Graceland just in time...

34
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,041
to meet our maker.

35
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,750
We're sure not going
to Graceland now.

36
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,916
Not with the "boss"
out of commission.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,666
We're screwed no matter
how you wanna look at it.

38
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,166
So, unless you've got any
bright ideas we're finished.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,625
What, are you happy about that?

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166
Nope.

41
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,666
All right then.

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,875
What we need to do is turn the
ship around and get to Graceland

43
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,375
using Big Pink.

44
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,666
I imagine the exit gate'll
probably be useless because

45
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,000
of the mess that
Marciano made back there.

46
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,333
But I'm betting the entry gate
is still operational.

47
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
Man, you just don't get it.

48
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,000
Big Pink is tightening
its security as we speak!

49
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,750
You ain't gonna
accomplish a damn thing!

50
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,916
Ahh!

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,375
Sweet Jesus,
you gonna get us all busted!

52
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,958
Will you just
quit your bitching!

53
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,875
All right, man!

54
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,833
Let's do this!

55
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,250
Yeah!

56
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
Okay!

57
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,041
Severe damage to Gate 5!

58
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,083
Damage report!

59
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,958
64 percent capacity, sir!

60
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,458
Inform all space gate stations
of the cruise restrictions.

61
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,125
Well, Inspector, looks like
we're not going after Mister

62
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,166
with the gate in this condition.

63
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,291
You don't suppose they made
it through the gate all right,

64
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,666
do you?

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,875
Lemme see...

66
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,791
OK...

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,458
The exit gate got damaged.

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,583
Yes.

69
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,916
Right .

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,916
One mid--sized spacecraft
with an unknown registry

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,333
passed through the gate...

72
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,583
Yes.

73
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,916
I appreciate the information.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,791
Inspector, what is it?

75
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,625
It looks like
the Coyote made it.

76
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,916
Pretty Red return gate warp
space stream reversal

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,291
operation complete!

78
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,291
Fire when ready, Mother!

79
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,416
Energy at 99.9 percent...

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,458
and...

81
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,750
maximum firepower
now available!

82
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,916
Very well.

83
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,666
Fire!

84
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,791
Attention: all flights
to and from Pretty Red

85
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,916
are suspended at this time.

86
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,333
Oh yeah...

87
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,583
we fly right in,
don't bother asking anyone,

88
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,083
and we're out before
anybody knows we were

89
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,916
even in the neighborhood!

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
Now there ya go!

91
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,125
Oh my G--!

92
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,500
Well...

93
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:12,125
it looks like we just
cut off his return route.

94
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,083
Helmsman, set course
for the Graceland gate.

95
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,500
And get...

96
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,250
every one of our shock troops
back aboard the ship!

97
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,375
Nothing is going
to stop us this time!

98
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,083
Have the control tower
open the gate immediately!

99
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,791
Do it now!

100
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,708
What the hell was that?

101
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,833
Marciano, obviously.

102
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,125
That lady is
seriously messed up.

103
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,416
How's she keep findin' us?!

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,916
Dammit!

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,625
Yep, we're done...

106
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,708
What?

107
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,541
Did I say somethin' I shouldn't?

108
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,958
You're an asshole!

109
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
Why the hell don't you
just admit it to yourself?

110
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,708
It's over, dammit!

111
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,083
Shut the hell up!

112
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,166
Didn't I tell you that
we're not done trying yet?!

113
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
Pardon me!

114
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,750
Should I leave you two
lovebirds alone?

115
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,541
M--Mister?!

116
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,000
So, can I play?

117
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,291
Hey, are you sure
you're all right?

118
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,708
Yeah.

119
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,500
You woulda been better off
just gettin' yo' rest.

120
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,083
Beating yourself
up to get to Graceland

121
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,125
ain't gonna help us that much.

122
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,333
It's no use.

123
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,125
We're already way behind
on schedule anyway.

124
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,750
Are we really?

125
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,333
Yeah...

126
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,708
Without a gate to get us there,
we're pretty much gonna arrive

127
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,000
at Graceland right
around the time they drop

128
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,166
that photonic bomb on it.

129
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,750
Boom...

130
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,875
See?

131
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,083
You might as well
rest and recuperate

132
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,750
to your heart's content.

133
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,875
We're all done here...

134
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,041
Put a sock in it...

135
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,500
This game's finally
getting interesting to me.

136
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,250
All right!

137
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:49,666
Wha...?

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,000
Really?

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,416
Okay, you got some kinda plan?

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,875
Well, now...

141
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,000
Can't say that I do...

142
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,750
but that doesn't mean
we're out of alternatives.

143
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,333
The bureaucrats on both
sides could end this by

144
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,708
signing a peace treaty...

145
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,166
and for all we know
that photonic bomb of theirs

146
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,041
could be dud of some kind.

147
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,166
Hell, the goons transporting
the bomb might not even

148
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,166
get there on time!

149
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,333
Might as well start prayin'
for a miracle then...

150
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,250
Ye of little faith...

151
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,500
Before he took the Gigabanks,
Bruce didn't have any assurances

152
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,208
he could get away with
a job like that either.

153
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's go ahead and try it.

154
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,291
That's what he woulda done.

155
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,291
The Pirate King
was just that kinda guy.

156
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,208
We've got our share o'
problems; that's for sure.

157
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,583
On the other hand,

158
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,125
Bruce had a whole lot
more hoops to jump through.

159
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,458
He had to research every
little pain--in--the--ass

160
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,708
piece of the puzzle.

161
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,750
But we've already
seen how it went down,

162
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,000
thanks to that pendant.

163
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,291
That might be...

164
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,208
but we're running up
against the clock.

165
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,750
Don't you forget that.

166
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,875
When Bruce planned
the Gigabanks job,

167
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,500
he couldn't afford to let
anybody else know about it.

168
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,916
But we don't have that problem.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,250
Our problem is that Marciano
knows and she wants to kill us.

170
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,958
Yeah, but we have "friends."

171
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,791
I'm not so sure.

172
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,125
Sounds kinda
optimistic to me...

173
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,291
Oh come on.

174
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,125
You GOTTA believe
we have a chance.

175
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,708
Right?

176
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,875
Admit it...

177
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,750
You don't claim to have
any sort of optimism...

178
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,333
But inside you're just a...

179
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,500
Pollyanna!

180
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,166
Bin--go!

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,416
Gates 5 and 2 are
out of commission!

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,916
I wanna see ALL
damage reports A.S.A.P!

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,291
What are we gonna do, Angelica?

184
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,791
You okay in there?

185
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,875
You look fine to me.

186
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,541
Angelica?

187
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,125
We're going to Graceland.

188
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,541
Mister's looking
for something there

189
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,125
and that's where we need to be.

190
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,791
Trust me.

191
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,291
It is Mister, after all.

192
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,583
That's one tough old bastard.

193
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,250
Ain't that the truth...

194
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,041
All right.

195
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's try this
one more time, shall we?

196
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,250
If you're ready,
dude, I'm ready...

197
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,000
Graceland, we're on our way!

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,291
Now, start with your index
finger and move them in order.

199
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,625
Looks good.

201
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,916
All right, why don't we
try a little typing test?

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,083
Go ahead and type what you see.

203
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,791
So...

204
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,750
Are you having any discomfort?

205
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,916
No, it feels fine.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,458
Good.

207
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,875
Glad to hear it.

208
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,625
Pardon me, Master Nilson?

209
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,291
What is it, my dear?

210
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,041
The clothes that you
and mother got for me...

211
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,916
got ruined in our last battle.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry, sir.

213
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,458
Mine were too.

214
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,916
Oh, is that all?

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,541
It's no trouble.

216
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,791
It just means
I'll have the pleasure

217
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,166
of giving you gifts again.

218
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,291
Why don't we all go
shopping together after

219
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,750
this Graceland business is done.

220
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,333
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,166
Bruce's eye, huh?

222
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,208
Yes...

223
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,041
how was the
maintenance on my girls?

224
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:58,875
Good?

225
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,458
Everything went quite well.

226
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,458
I see.

227
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,291
Good job.

228
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,083
Locating Bruce's treasure...

229
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,583
isn't going to be an easy task.

230
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,708
Then again, that IS
what you'd expect from

231
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,958
the King of the space pirates.

232
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,458
He was stupid.

233
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,791
Orchestrating that heist

234
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,833
and then losing your life
makes it all meaningless.

235
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,125
If I remember, YOU shot him.

236
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,625
Are you having regrets about it?

237
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,666
Regrets?

238
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,375
How absurd!

239
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,875
Killing him only left things
unsettled between us.

240
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,541
If that's your idea of
"regret." That's the reason

241
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,000
we're going to Graceland.

242
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:46,333
"Unsettled?" With whom were
you really settling a score?

243
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,416
Was it Bruce?

244
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,250
Or could you be
talking about yourself?

245
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,708
It seems we've arrived.

246
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,041
And I'm needed back up
on the bridge.

247
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,458
She's fooling herself.

248
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,041
Multiple contacts sighted
near the Graceland gate.

249
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,750
Distance 2000.

250
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,333
One battleship,
12 cruisers sighted.

251
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,000
Cross--checking tactical
views of the battleship.

252
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,375
Eldorado--class.

253
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,083
It appears to be the Hunter.

254
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,458
Hunter...?

255
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,750
So it's a Guild fleet...

256
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,291
Transmission incoming
from Hunter Bennet.

257
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,791
Shall I put it through?

258
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,166
What's the problem, April?

259
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,416
Mother...

260
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,791
Our ship is being hailed
by Hunter Bennet.

261
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,458
So how shall I proceed?

262
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,166
What?

263
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,750
Not THE Hunter Bennet?

264
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,333
I guess I should be honored to
see the Guild's top assassin.

265
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,583
It seems like Hunter's battle
group is trying to keep us

266
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,750
from passing through
the Graceland gate.

267
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,791
April.

268
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,625
Yes?

269
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,708
Rather than worrying,
let's try to enjoy this.

270
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,958
As you wish.

271
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,083
It's been quite a while, Madame.

272
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,750
Too long, Hunter,
wouldn't you say?

273
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,625
You're looking good as ever.

274
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm flattered, really.

275
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,583
And I see you're still handling
your business with the usual...

276
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,458
theatrics.

277
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,458
The recent spat you had with
those Coyotes back there...

278
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,208
was something of a turn--on.

279
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,708
Really?

280
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,625
Surely, Madame, a woman as
keenly intelligent as you are

281
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,166
can already figure out
the reason I'm here.

282
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,916
My battle group
has orders to capture you.

283
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,875
Otherwise, we must
report back to the rest

284
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,500
of the Guild with your head.

285
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,833
Certainly you can see
the waste in Guild brethren

286
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,750
fighting each other.

287
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,125
Guild "brethren?"

288
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,250
Return with me and have
the Guild place you on trial.

289
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,541
Certainly you are aware
of what the consequences

290
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,125
would be otherwise, Madame...

291
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,958
Seems you've been
climbing the ranks.

292
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,375
Huh?

293
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,666
Yes, I have, actually.

294
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,541
And is your wife well?

295
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,083
She is...

296
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,833
I understand you two
had a baby last year.

297
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes...

298
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,625
Are you sure about this?

299
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,958
What?

300
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
While you're posturing at me

301
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:28,458
my soldiers could be paying
the two of them a little visit.

302
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,833
Very well then.

303
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,750
I'll consider that
answer your final words.

304
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,458
Attention everyone.

305
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,625
This is Marciano.

306
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,166
This battleship and those under
its care will break through

307
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,291
the skirmishing line ahead
and continue to Graceland!

308
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,125
Those of you who have chosen
to follow my lead have upheld

309
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,916
the true principles
of a criminal "guild."

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,958
The current Guild
is soft and corrupt,

311
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,083
and is little more
than a corporate entity!

312
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,833
It is WE who represent
the TRUE Criminal Guild,

313
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,125
and WE who nurture and
protect its original spirit!

314
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,333
It is time for the corrupt
power brokers to take

315
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,166
their place at our feet!

316
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,708
It's time to show this
Artificial Guild the nature

317
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,333
of TRUE power!

318
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
Ooh, we're going after Hunter!

319
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,041
Really?

320
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,750
It's been a while.

321
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,625
Mobilizing an entire battle
group against a single target

322
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,333
isn't MY idea of "smart."

323
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,208
The Marciano has
launched three small vessels

324
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,416
in our direction, sir.

325
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,750
Launch all of
our attack fighters.

326
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,416
Have our battle group maintain
formation at slow speed.

327
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,625
Madame, I have
always appreciated

328
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,041
your spirited disposition...

329
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,875
but the fact that you chose
to engage my fleet with only

330
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,708
a single vessel is the very
definition of recklessness!

331
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,833
I'm inclined
to feel sorry for you.

332
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,041
OK, I'm gonna go in first!

333
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,083
You cheater!

334
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,583
After all that...

335
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,750
We finally made our way
to the Graceland gate.

336
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,375
And the fun is
just about to start.

337
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,083
You're so tough, Angelica.

338
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,708
I mean, I'm only six years
younger, than you but...

339
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,875
My skin is still all smooth...

340
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,458
I guess all that time
spent chasing after Mister

341
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,375
really took quite a toll...

342
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,916
Magnifying fighters.

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,833
Damage control,
prepare for debris hits!

344
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,541
Ted Roy.

345
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,083
I'm the gate manager.

346
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,375
Inspector Angelica Burns.

347
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,916
I'm sorry I caught you
in the middle of all this.

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,166
I got word from the
Federal Inspectors' Office.

349
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,291
You're looking for Mister.

350
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,416
Right.

351
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,708
Do you understand
the risks associated

352
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,375
with going to Graceland?

353
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,666
Yes I do.

354
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,500
All right then...

355
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,500
I can get you a ship, but I'm
sure you can appreciate that

356
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,500
our current predicament
is going to keep us

357
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,625
from getting you a pilot.

358
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,791
Yes, I understand.

359
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,416
I've lost control!

360
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,625
Shit!

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,541
That's eight!

362
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,208
And eight for me, too!

363
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
You're not gonna beat me!

364
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,083
Guild ships
fighting each other?

365
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,750
What the hell?

366
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
Five cruisers sunk,
three disabled!

367
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,291
Our fighter squadron
is almost gone, sir!

368
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,375
Who the...

369
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,041
hell are those people?!

370
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,541
Enemy fighter
approaching the bridge!

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,208
Fire!

372
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,625
NOW!!!

373
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,833
You'd have been better off
worrying about your own safety,

374
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,250
little man.

375
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,041
Graceland...

376
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,625
We can gravity--
assist our way through

377
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,291
the Logos and
Thanatos systems...

378
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,708
Plus, if we overboost the
engines coming out of the arc,

379
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,250
we should be able to get
even more momentum.

380
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,833
Well then?

381
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,833
It means we might
possibly be able to save

382
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,583
half a day and some
change on the way.

383
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,625
That oughta work!

384
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,375
Looks like we're
gonna make it, huh?

385
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,833
Mister!

386
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,416
You feelin' okay?

387
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,666
Well I'm not
just gonna lie around.

388
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,458
Have you decided how
we're gonna move forward?

389
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
Yep.

390
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,708
Looks like the only chance
we have left is making 'em

391
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,916
delay the bomb--drop.

392
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,666
Give me that!

393
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,083
Lay off of this stuff!

394
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,625
You think it's medicine?

395
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,791
Yeah, really!

396
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,041
Well, Bruce, your boy here is
finally taking this seriously.

397
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,083
I guess you're watching this

398
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,625
from somewhere
out there in space.

399
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,250
Let's both see this
through to the end.
