1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,500
All right.

2
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,416
We have the pendant...

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
It's time to find out
about Bruce's legacy

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,208
and what it really means.

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,750
Franca...

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,166
Our friend Bruce was the only
man in this whole galaxy to be

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,083
known as "The Pirate King."
And he loved Franca

8
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,333
so much he left her this.

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,458
It contains a memory chip
from his artificial eye.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,750
With a complete record of
the universe's greatest heist.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,416
Cops said it couldn't be done,

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,791
and most Coyotes
wouldn't even try it...

13
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,583
The theft of 10 billion space
dollars from the Central Bank.

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,166
What?!

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,375
That can't be!

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,541
I've never heard about
any heist like that!

17
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,708
Think about it, Mister.

18
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,875
A job as big as hitting
the Central Bank?

19
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,416
It would have been
all over the news!

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,166
And that's why the bank
kept it under wraps.

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,583
Central Bank isn't just the
backbone of universal finance,

22
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,958
folks look up to it.

23
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,833
If people found out
about Bruce's heist,

24
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,916
it'd be chaos out there.

25
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,833
Anyway...

26
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,500
why don't we take
a look at this...

27
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,333
Attention passengers:

28
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,916
we are decelerating
for atmospheric entry.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,416
Please fasten your seatbelts
and lock your tray tables

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,416
in their original positions.

31
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,833
You feelin' all right, Franca?

32
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,500
The final exam for Central
Bank executive trainees will

33
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,458
begin at 10:00 am local time
at Central Bank's main facility.

34
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,041
Have a nice day!

35
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,041
Looks like the place.

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,875
That's a helluva building!

37
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,666
Well when you think about it the
entire planet is a giant bank.

38
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,375
But yeah, at first glance,
that is impressive.

39
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,083
Cameras were off--limits.

40
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,333
And they sure as hell

41
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,875
didn't want the media
snoopin' around there.

42
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,625
So let me get this straight.

43
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,083
Shouldn't we be able
to use the video

44
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,916
like some kinda
"treasure map" or something?

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,958
'Fraid not.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,500
Tell 'em why, Swamp.

47
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,833
Bruce knew that "The Pirate
King" wasn't going be able

48
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,458
to assault the Central Bank's
vaults so he just decided

49
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,625
to be someone else.

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,250
And of course, that's
the day "Mister Otis Ray"

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,125
showed up to class.

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,708
Got the answers yet, Katana?

53
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,833
Shut up - I'm workin' on it!

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,000
So, Mister Ray, why do you want
to work with the Central Bank?

55
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,791
Sir, I believe my experience

56
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,958
in the Silver Stocks division
will be most helpful.

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,875
Leveraging our
universe--wide network,

58
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,708
we can acquire several planets'
finances over the next 10 years.

59
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,750
All above--board, of course.

60
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,375
Ladies and Gentlemen, this
is Mister Ray, who will be

61
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,375
in charge of the New Ventures
Division as of today.

62
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,250
Hi, my name is Otis Ray.

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,583
Pleased to meet you.

64
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,125
And without further ado,

65
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,875
let's take a look at the first
order of business, shall we?

66
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,916
The Primary Planetary Survey
Commission offered this report.

67
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,875
Bruce adapted to the
tight-assed culture in the bank

68
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,458
by working harder than all of
them, but he never lost sight

69
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,750
of the prize.

70
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,375
Getting acceptance
wasn't a problem, either.

71
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,208
If you know what I mean.

72
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,166
And with all that
wheelin' and dealin...

73
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
he still found time
to do research on how

74
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,625
to get that 10 billion.

75
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
That was incredible getting
out to 4 different planets

76
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,125
this month AND getting them all
to sign off on the project!

77
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,458
Just don't go popping off
the champagne corks until

78
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,000
the Investment Division
signs off on it.

79
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,833
Piece o'cake, Mister Ray!

80
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,166
The Bank President
knows you'll get it done!

81
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,416
Alex, you're going out
to Planet Columbus.

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,291
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,875
Kris, you'll go to Teuton.

84
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,083
Right!

85
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
Give me everything
you've got out there.

86
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,041
Yes, sir!

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,458
He was there a year:

88
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,416
kickin' ass, takin' names
and lookin' good doin' it.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,041
He got their trust...

90
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,750
now it was time to
get some of their money.

91
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,625
Don't move.

92
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,083
Whatever you do, don't shoot...

93
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
It's me, Swamp!

94
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:50,791
Bruce, man!

95
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:51,791
What's wrong with you?

96
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,208
I almost messed
my damn drawers!!

97
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,708
Haven't caught up
with you in a while, man.

98
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,666
Hey, man!

99
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,291
You're gettin'
kinda porky, huh?

100
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,500
How 'bout you stop showing me
all this "brotherly love,"

101
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
all right?

102
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,333
So...

103
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,958
that's really our target?

104
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,583
The Central Bank?

105
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,416
That's right.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,541
It's just sitting there.

107
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,833
The grand prize.

108
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,041
It might be the grand prize,

109
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,541
but it sure as hell
ain't gonna be easy, chief...

110
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,208
Wait a minute...

111
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,916
These are the plans to
the Central Bank's vault.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,250
No way, you gotta be
kiddin' me, Bruce!

113
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,416
I mean, it's so damned
impossible to break into,

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,333
even God himself
ain't got the key!

115
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:41,083
Genuine blueprints for the
old "Gigabanks!" Aw, man...

116
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,250
howdja get ahold of this stuff?

117
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,583
That's only the beginning.

118
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,125
These plans are to help us
make a "certain something"

119
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,041
that we're gonna need.

120
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,875
What "certain something?"

121
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,375
Heh, you're gonna love it.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,916
Anyway, shouldn't you be gettin'
ready for your part in this?

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,166
Hold on!

124
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,541
I haven't even decided
if I'm gonna do this!

125
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,791
I mean, sure, it's a once
in a lifetime job an' all...

126
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,041
But I don't really know if I'm
ready for somethin' like this.

127
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:09,708
Hey.

128
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,708
Point taken.

129
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,125
I gotcha.

130
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:12,833
No, really.

131
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,541
I hear you.

132
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,916
Perimeter checks out.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Got anything else?

134
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,250
Nah.

135
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,416
You did good out there.

136
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,041
That map right there has all
the guards' patrol routes

137
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:35,166
and video camera locations
between you and the Gigabanks.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,416
Nice...

139
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,125
I'm impressed.

140
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,833
Did a good job out there.

141
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
Ah, thanks.

142
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,958
I was just thinkin', Swamp...

143
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,083
Huh?

144
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,791
Get some time off.

145
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,041
'Bout the middle of next week.

146
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,500
Um...

147
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,166
sure.

148
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,833
I've got a little
something to show you.

149
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,833
I also have Hank
and Norman coming in.

150
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,416
Really?

151
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,958
Finally, this is
startin' to get good.

152
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,583
Yeah.

153
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
What planet is that?

154
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,625
That's Graceland,
believe it or not.

155
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,541
Sure doesn't look like
today's Graceland.

156
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,500
Yo, D--Boni!

157
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:37,583
Gentlemen, this is the last
member of our operation...

158
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,833
Say hi to D--Boni.

159
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,083
Hey.

160
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,625
Well, Maestro.

161
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,000
It's time for the unveiling.

162
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,375
What the heck is that?

163
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,708
A full--scale working replica
of the Central Bank's vault.

164
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,458
They call it "Gigabanks."

165
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,208
Whoa, that's a bank vault?

166
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

167
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,708
Bruce gave me this as
a memento of the job.

168
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,166
It's a thousand to one scale
model of the real thing.

169
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,708
Gigabanks used 50
moving modules around

170
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,083
12 different
articulation points.

171
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,416
THOUSANDS of combinations.

172
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,375
But here's the kicker:
withdrawals and deposits

173
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,458
always got processed
through the "central ball."

174
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,250
The five sections of the vault
that actually had cash in 'em

175
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,208
would rotate to the top
on every major transaction.

176
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,083
Otherwise, they can't connect
to the elevator that takes money

177
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,083
the last mile to the top.

178
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,750
Vault operator
never touches a dime.

179
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,125
Wanna look inside?

180
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,291
Me?

181
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,750
What the hell is
that crazy thing?

182
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,416
If I had the answer
to that question,

183
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,375
I wouldn't need the mock--up.

184
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,583
There's another catch: the
modules get "reshuffled" after

185
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,833
every authentication attempt,
and every 30 minutes regardless.

186
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,375
So, even if you find your way
in, you'll be screwed if you

187
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,500
lose your bearings in
there for even a second.

188
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,208
One wrong move and you're
a permanent resident.

189
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,041
Greeeat...

190
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,666
"Hotel California," huh?

191
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,500
Well I guess it's
my turn, isn't it?

192
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,000
Hey Bruce, quit messin' around.

193
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,500
Come on, man!

194
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,875
I didn't build this mock--up
just to stare at it and say,

195
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,666
"ooh, pretty...

196
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
"Besides, the
damn thing cost me

197
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,041
a hundred million
space dollars to build.

198
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:52,875
WHAT!

199
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,041
A hundred million bucks!

200
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,875
When you gamble, you gotta
put money in the pot to play.

201
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,875
Yeah, but you could buy
a used battleship for that.

202
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,291
So why in the hell waste
the time, effort and money

203
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,666
building a replica of
the Gigabanks on a planet

204
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
as far away as Graceland?

205
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,208
I mean wouldn't it have been
easier on a closer planet?

206
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,541
Yeah, exactly!

207
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,666
Then this whole thing
wouldn't have to be

208
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,875
such a wild goose chase!

209
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,041
Planet Graceland is where
my father first met my mother.

210
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,625
Huh?

211
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,666
That's the reason...

212
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,791
Take a good look.

213
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,083
All told, there are 4 security
measures that stand between us

214
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,708
and getting in.

215
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,000
First, there's the master key.

216
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
Then the system
demands a voiceprint.

217
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,541
The rain in Spain
falls mainly on the plain.

218
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,458
Retinal scan...

219
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,583
digital vascular pattern scan...

220
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,958
and after all that,
you're as good as in.

221
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,083
But Bruce, that's three levels
of biometric authentication!

222
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,916
And the bank president's
probably the only guy

223
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,916
the system's keyed to.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,958
Hey.

225
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,125
Who do you think
you're dealin' with?

226
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,916
Yes, what is it?

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,916
Mr. Ray is here to see you, sir.

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,291
Oh yes, well let him in.

229
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,208
Pardon the intrusion.

230
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,250
Otis, my boy!

231
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,708
How have you been?

232
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,708
I have the mid--term report
on "the project" for you.

233
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,875
Wonderful.

234
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,375
Let's see...

235
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,958
3 out of 4 mines anticipate
over a 200% profit increase

236
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,625
within 2 years...

237
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Ah, I see, I see...

238
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,541
Nice, this is a very
nice forecast indeed!

239
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,625
Hey there.

240
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,666
How's it comin'?

241
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,041
Ya done yet?

242
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,416
Now that's niiice.

243
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,250
So that's not working yet?

244
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,958
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

245
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,416
So, on the night
before the job went down...

246
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,791
Synchronize your
watches to 20:15 in 3...

247
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,791
2...

248
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,958
and 1!

249
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,208
We're gonna do it
just like we drew it up.

250
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,166
And we meet at
the bank tomorrow.

251
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,458
Hello?

252
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,666
Who is this?

253
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,000
Bruce, is that you?

254
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,958
Yeah.

255
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,958
So to what do I
owe this pleasure?

256
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,250
Tomorrow...

257
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm hitting the Central Bank.

258
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,291
Thought you'd have
more to say than that.

259
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,875
What do you want me
to say, Bruce?

260
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,125
You say you're gonna do it,
so go ahead and do it, right?

261
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:50,875
Heh!

262
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,166
Guess that's true, huh?

263
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,291
Just get home safe
when the party's done.

264
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,458
Will do...

265
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:07,083
Oh, and hey - I ran into
Little Bear a while back.

266
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,791
Heh!

267
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,916
That guy's still alive?!

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yep!

269
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,583
Bastard hasn't
changed a bit, either!

270
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,250
Here we go!

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,416
Good morning.

272
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,708
Normally the 5 vault rooms
with all the cash in Gigabanks

273
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,333
don't all come together on the
top level at the same time.

274
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,375
There is one exception, though.

275
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,416
Hey!

276
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,916
How are you this
morning, Mister Ray?

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,666
Natural disasters that threaten
the vault such as floods,

278
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,083
fire or earthquake
set off the emergency reset,

279
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,541
bringing all the cash up
to the top at once.

280
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,958
It gets airlifted out until
the vault is safe again.

281
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,791
Good morning, Mister President.

282
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,166
Ah, Otis, my boy!

283
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,916
Now what can I do for you?

284
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,000
It's me.

285
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,500
Don't let anyone in here
for the next hour.

286
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,750
No phone calls either.

287
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,000
Understood, sir.

288
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,541
It's the President.

289
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,375
Hey, you don't need to report
it when it's him, ya know...

290
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,791
Yeah, I guess you're right.

291
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,541
The rain in Spain
falls mainly on the plain.

292
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,625
Huh...

293
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,833
he's gone all the way
to the last checkpoint.

294
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:00,833
Yeah!

295
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,958
You still don't
have to report it!

296
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,375
Uh... hey...

297
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,541
Ah, it's back on.

298
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,708
So where'd the President go?

299
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,791
He's probably in
the center ball.

300
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,208
That's about the only place we
don't have any cameras set up.

301
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,208
Damn!

302
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,166
That's the center
of Gigabanks?!

303
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,541
That's right.

304
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,333
Only one man in the universe
has seen it up close.

305
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,291
Bingo!

306
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,333
What was THAT?!

307
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,666
An explosion from
inside the Gigabanks!

308
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,333
What?!

309
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,958
What are ya doin'
just sittin' there!

310
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,083
GO!

311
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,500
Yessir!

312
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,375
Like Bruce said: a major
disaster will cause Gigabanks

313
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,416
to spin all of its cash vault
modules to the top to meet

314
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,125
the cash elevator.

315
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,833
So, he made sure
a disaster happened.

316
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,791
Oh!

317
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,416
Thank god you guys made it!

318
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,166
We're here to recover
the funds in accordance

319
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,208
with the disaster
recovery outlines, sir!

320
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,125
This way!

321
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:50,833
Hurry up!

322
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,333
Come on!

323
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,583
All right, it looks
like we've got all of it.

324
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,083
Good.

325
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,208
Thanks.

326
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,958
No way...

327
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,750
It can't be!

328
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,583
What's that guard doing?

329
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,125
Why is Mister Ray there?

330
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,666
Huh?!

331
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,666
Mister Ray?!

332
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,208
No way...

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,833
That kicks ass!

334
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,083
Friggin' hilarious!

335
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,500
That guy's--freakin--unreal!

336
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,166
Well, there you have it -

337
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,541
a complete record of
the Central Bank heist.

338
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,666
Anyway guys, that's the
beast we're up against.

339
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,375
So...

340
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,583
you wanna go?

341
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,375
Boss, you don't
even have to ask.

342
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,791
I'm all over it!

343
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,041
And after that went down,

344
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,541
Bruce gave us the shares we
agreed on and that was that.

345
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,458
He put the rest in the vault on
Graceland, and sealed it away.

346
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,833
So how did the latest
caper go, boss--man?

347
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,000
It was incredible.
