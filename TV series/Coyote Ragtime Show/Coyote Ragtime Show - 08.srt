1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,208
Bruce...

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,250
How does it feel, knowing
that I'm taking your legacy

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,416
while your daughter
gets nothing?

4
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,291
It's all your fault for
getting yourself killed!

5
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,000
Millennium Dug Mark Two.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:50,000
An interstellar
transport shuttle built

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,833
by the Millennium Corporation.

8
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,291
Model year is...

9
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,250
G.C. 1992??!

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,833
That's crazy!

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,708
This was built the same year
my grampa was born!

12
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,833
Is this hunk of junk
even gonna launch?

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,750
Seems to be well--maintained.

14
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,416
Maybe if you're a fan
of garbage transports.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you sure they don't have
anything newer around here?

16
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,208
No, that would be a big waste...

17
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,333
Oh, really?

18
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,375
I don't get to work with

19
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,541
a vintage ride
like this every day.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh my God!

21
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,791
It says you can adjust the
speed of descent manually!!!

22
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,333
Check it out, May!

23
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,500
Here I was...

24
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,958
thinking I was malfunctioning.

25
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,416
Chelsea!

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,958
Chelsea!

27
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,625
Got a sec?

28
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,625
What is it, Inspector?

29
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,375
Would you mind helping me
load these onto the shuttle?

30
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,208
All of those boxes are FOOD?!

31
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,500
Uh--huh.

32
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,000
Boy, Franca sure seemed
broken up, didn't she?

33
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,666
Yeah, she shoulda known that she
didn't have to worry about us,

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,625
ya know?

35
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,083
I imagine...

36
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,333
she just grew bitter living
with us grown--up Coyotes

37
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,916
and not having
any kids to be with.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,250
And that's why...

39
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,791
when we finish this job,

40
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,166
I'm gonna try and give
the kid her childhood back.

41
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,375
Main engines optimal.

42
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,208
Descent point
coordinates are set.

43
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,541
All sections green.

44
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,958
All systems operating normally.

45
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,791
Then it seems we're ready.

46
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,458
Take us down.

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,125
Courier approaching Gate 7: You
are clear for docking manuvers.

48
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,875
I'm carrying written orders
for Admiral Malcolm

49
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,583
from Fleet Admiral Mill.

50
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,208
Outstanding.

51
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,708
By carrier pigeon, huh?

52
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,458
I take it all the cross--talk,
scuttlebutt and jamming signals

54
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,875
made it necessary to
deliver these orders by hand?

55
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,125
This mission demands an
extremely strict adherence

56
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,916
to the Federation
manual, Admiral.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,708
And a leak of any portion
of this information

58
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,250
would be catastrophic.

59
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,166
Yes, I guess you're right.

60
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,083
Admiral Malcolm, I have
some good news for you.

61
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,291
General Boniek of the Graceland
Liberation Forces has agreed

62
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,666
to a last--minute cease--fire
to negotiate a peace treaty.

63
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,541
We're getting ready
for this under the table,

64
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,416
if you follow me...

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,833
Good.

66
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,250
Looks like we're not going
through with it after all.

67
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,791
Right.

68
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,250
Regardless, I'll still need
you to continue on your course

69
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,833
for Graceland.

70
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,125
I'm concerned that there might
be other factions who won't

71
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,916
take so kindly to our
settling the issue with Boniek

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,958
"behind the scenes,"
if you will.

73
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,583
So you're saying there might
be a backlash from either side,

74
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,333
then?

75
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,583
Possibly.

76
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,750
With that in mind, the
negotiations with Boniek

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,125
and his people
will be on your ship.

78
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,500
Senator Hewlett, the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs,

79
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,791
is already en route
to meet you.

80
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,291
Yes, go ahead.

81
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,041
Sir, we just received word
from the Graceland patrol fleet

82
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,500
that a single Guild battleship
is descending to the surface.

83
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,166
A Guild battleship?

84
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
Okay then.

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,416
So what do we do
about this, sir?

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,208
Damn.

87
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,708
Why now?

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,291
Are they selling weapons?

89
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,125
Or did Boniek's people call
them in to stir things up?

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,166
So they're engaging
in peace talks to buy time

91
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,208
for a counteroffensive?

92
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,708
Well, we can't afford to
take provocative action;

93
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,458
dropping a bomb or not.

94
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,916
Tell the patrol fleet
not to intercept them.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,083
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,333
So you're really going to
Graceland after all, are you?

97
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,250
Absolutely.

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,875
And thanks a lot
for the shuttle!

99
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,500
It sure is cool!

100
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
Well I'm speechless.

101
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,875
I thought giving you that
old scrap heap would surely

102
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,458
make you give up.

103
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,166
We appreciate it.

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,083
You should also know that
a Guild battleship went down

105
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,458
to the surface
a little while ago.

106
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,208
And did the fleet fire on them?

107
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,041
No, the Federation
didn't engage them at all.

108
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,958
It's more like they just
wave at 'em going by.

109
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,083
That tells me...

110
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,958
They're still
dropping the bomb.

111
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,583
Otherwise they wouldn't
have let them pass.

112
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,625
Meaning that
they're not going

113
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,666
to affect the
outcome of the war.

114
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,833
I'd agree with that assessment.

115
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,500
And you're still going to
drop into the middle of that?

116
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,708
Yes.

117
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,375
I still have a man to catch.

118
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,625
Descent speed optimal.

119
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,958
60 seconds to arrival
at destination point.

120
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,500
Visibility good.

121
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,208
Landing area clear.

122
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,750
We have touchdown
at the destination point.

123
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,416
Prepare for ground operations.

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,166
All right then...

125
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,083
It's time to start
this treasure hunt.

126
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, man...

127
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,083
Marciano and her goons
are probably digging up

128
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,583
the whole planet by now.

129
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,208
Hey!

130
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,666
Shut up, will ya?

131
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,166
You're makin' me wonder
why we're even doing this

132
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,250
in the first place.

133
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,875
Damn, this is so frustrating!

134
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,625
Ah, those greedy bitches ain't
gonna find Bruce's legacy.

135
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,958
In case you've
already forgotten...

136
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,000
They've got Bruce's eye,
not us, Pops!

137
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,333
So what if they've
got Bruce's eye?

138
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,833
They're still not
gonna find anything.

139
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,291
Oh?

140
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,833
You seem pretty damn sure
of yourself all of a sudden.

141
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,666
You said it yourself, kid,
when you saw the video.

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,625
Graceland didn't seem like
the same planet at all, did it?

143
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,500
Yeah, I said it
"looked" different.

144
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,291
Yeah, well, it's more
than just looks.

145
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:12,666
Compared to what you saw in
that video, Graceland is now...

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,750
far different
than what it was before.

147
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,000
We can't possibly determine
from the video data where

148
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,250
the cave containing
the Gigabanks is now.

149
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,833
How can...

150
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,916
you possibly eat
at a time like this!

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,791
I mean...

152
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,041
don't you get motion--sickness?

153
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,208
Nah.

154
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,875
I'm used to eating
inside ships, ya know?

155
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,625
With an iron stomach like that,

156
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,625
you're sure to be
all right out there.

157
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,458
Even if...

158
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,250
something...

159
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,541
goes wrong...

160
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,791
We're going to miss our
designated landing point

161
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,541
by a few clicks.

162
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,833
A few clicks?

163
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
How many?

164
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,250
Well, to be honest, I really
don't know how far off...

165
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,750
Wait a minute!

166
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,250
How can you possibly
not know that?

167
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,500
Come on!

168
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,000
This is my first manual
descent, Inspector!!!

169
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,291
June's team is starting
their search of sector B--6

170
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,750
and January's team is
moving to sector D--4.

171
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,208
April's team has finished
with sector A--2

172
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,000
with no sign of the Gigabanks.

173
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,125
August's team has
gone over sector E--1,

174
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,625
still with no sign of the vault.

175
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,791
And March's team has completed
their survey of C--4

176
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,375
with no sign of the Gigabanks.

177
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,833
Next...

178
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,041
OK, guys, listen up...

179
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,708
The only way we're gonna
get a leg up on searching for

180
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,125
the treasure is to do something
about that bomb on our own.

181
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,916
One step ahead of you, boss.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,916
You want to have a team
to board the Jupiter

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,375
and another team to start
looking for the Gigabanks.

184
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,291
Am I right?

185
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,666
That's right.

186
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,000
Here's the thing.

187
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,333
Even if we stop this bomb
from going off it won't

188
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,583
make any difference if
Marciano beats us there.

189
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,125
Thought of that, too.

190
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,750
We can't expose Franca to the
hazards on that ship, right?

191
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,000
Katana needs
to pilot the Coyote.

192
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,000
And the old fart here
knows all about the vault.

193
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
And that leaves me.

194
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,458
Which is fine,
because I can handle it.

195
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,416
I just need to stop the
photonic bomb, am I right?

196
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,291
Well, Bishop.

197
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,041
I'm glad ya thought this out.

198
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,500
But actually, I want you
on the Jupiter, too.

199
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,875
Him?

200
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,291
There's a change in plans.

201
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,916
You'll be goin' with Swamp.

202
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,708
Now wait a minute, Mister!

203
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,333
He'll slow me down!

204
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,416
I ain't bringin' that old fart!

205
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,250
Hey, keep your
diaper on, crybaby!

206
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,125
Look.

207
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,916
I'm gonna handle this my way.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,125
That's what I'm worried
about, ya damn punk!

209
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,375
Stop sniping at me,
you shrub--headed freak!

210
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,166
Are you sure this is
a good idea, boss--man?

211
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,416
Of course it is.

212
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,666
Just look.

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,875
Those two are havin'
the time of their lives.

214
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,458
Huh?

215
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,958
Wha?

216
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,041
You are pissin' me off, you
damn Bride of Frankenstein!

217
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,041
Y'aint no walk
in the park either, dipshit!

218
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
I'm gonna take some sheep
shears to your skull, old man!

219
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,833
An' I'm gonna yank out them
two chest hairs and beat you

220
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,458
to death with 'em!

221
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:28,958
Hey, Angelica!

222
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,000
I figured out where we are!

223
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,041
Well?

224
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,541
45 degrees North
by 160 degrees East.

225
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,500
I guess we're at this point
on the Paralla Ocean.

226
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,000
Comparing that to our
intended landing site...

227
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,958
we're pretty far away from where
Marciano and her people landed.

228
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
Sorry.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,791
It's all right.

230
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,333
As long as we get there
before Mister touches down.

231
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,625
Inspector.

232
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,458
Is he really gonna show up?

233
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,458
I'm counting on it.

234
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,166
If that's true...

235
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,458
this guy Mister
is way--optimistic.

236
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,708
That's right.

237
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,416
As long as he has
ANY chance, he'll take it.

238
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,041
He's not gonna quit.

239
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,500
It's his crazy side
that makes him strong.

240
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,916
That man is a true a Coyote!

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,250
Yep, you got it.

242
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,666
You see, I'm learning...

243
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,041
It sounds to me like
she kinda LIKES the guy...

244
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,500
Well, shall we get going?

245
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,958
Sure!

246
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,791
Uh, Angelica...

247
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,708
Those people are
evacuating, aren't they?

248
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,291
Yeah.

249
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,875
At this point, it's looking like
"get out, or get blown to bits."

250
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,000
So...

251
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,583
you think we'll find
the Jupiter in time?

252
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,791
You don't know who you're
talkin' to, little lady!

253
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,375
That's right!

254
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,291
They don't have a jammin' signal
out there that we can't crack!

255
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,916
I mean, come on--you're
talkin' to Master Katana here!

256
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:05,416
March's team has
arrived in sector C--2.

257
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,666
June's team has
finished up with B--3.

258
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,916
No sign of the Gigabanks.

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,291
January is finished with D--5.

260
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,541
Again, no sign
of the Gigabanks.

261
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,041
April's team is done with A--4.

262
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,208
No sign there, either.

263
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,791
My...

264
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,333
at this rate we may very well
end up having to search every

265
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,541
last nook and cranny on the
entire planet, don't you think?

266
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,166
Got somethin' on your mind,
preacher--man?

267
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,291
You pretend to be
all miserable.

268
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,625
But you're not foolin' anybody.

269
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,333
You enjoy
getting' on his nerves.

270
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:41,875
What?

271
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,333
You mean Bishop?

272
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,833
He's a dopey kid.

273
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,708
Admit it -- you're
havin' fun with him.

274
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,666
You're the only one
havin' fun with it.

275
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,666
C'mon...

276
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,333
You know you're
enjoying yourself.

277
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,166
I wasn't lookin'
for a joy ride.

278
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,833
This whole deal with Gigabanks.

279
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,041
How can you not enjoy it, man?

280
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,833
I'm havin' the time of my life.

281
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,541
Well good for you!

282
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,041
You know, you're really startin'
to piss me off, actin' like

283
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,625
you can just make decisions
for me and I'll just lay down

284
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,083
and do it for ya...

285
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,916
Yeah, but you're gonna.

286
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,083
Swamp, we have to stop
the bombing, all right?

287
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,625
That ain't easy,
and he needs help.

288
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,875
I can't send him alone.

289
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,333
Yeah, I get it.

290
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,166
Much as you claim
to hate all this,

291
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,458
it makes me wonder why you even
wanna go in the first place.

292
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,916
The reason I'm going is to
see for myself whether or not

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,875
you're the man who should
inherit Bruce's legacy, okay?

294
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,500
Guess we'll see.

295
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,750
Got a question for you.

296
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,583
Go 'head.

297
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,000
Shoot.

298
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,708
Bruce called you the
night before he pulled

299
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,125
the Gigabanks job.

300
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,208
What exactly did he tell you?

301
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,791
Not a thing.

302
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,666
Lemme ask you...

303
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,250
Fire away.

304
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,625
Tell me...

305
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,916
all I wanna know
is whether Bruce enjoyed

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,958
his last big heist.

307
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,125
Need a hand, there?

308
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,416
No, I'm good,
but thanks anyway.

309
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,708
It's pretty much done over here.

310
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,791
All right.

311
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,541
Say, Franca.

312
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,250
You looking forward
to the treasure?

313
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,250
Well...

314
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm not sure.

315
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,041
What do you think you'd do
with 10 billion space dollars?

316
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,666
I never really
thought about it...

317
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,000
With that money,

318
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,625
you could buy anything
your little heart desires.

319
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,083
Honestly, the money doesn't
interest me that much.

320
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,750
I'd really like
to know more about Papa...

321
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,708
my family.

322
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,250
Everybody calls him the Pirate
King and says how amazing

323
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,125
and talented he was...

324
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,625
But I never really got
to know him as a person.

325
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,083
And I certainly didn't have much
experience with him as a father.

326
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,541
Maybe...

327
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,541
if I get to the treasure I
can find out for myself what

328
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,625
kind of person he really was.

329
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,375
That's another
Guild helicopter.

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
All that buzzing around
has got me thinking.

331
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,125
They haven't even come close
to finding the treasure yet.

332
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,833
Makes you wonder what the
treasure is, doesn't it?

333
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,000
I guess.

334
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,541
Don't you wanna
find out what it is?

335
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,458
Eventually.

336
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,666
What difference
does it make, anyway?

337
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,791
It might give me a motive.

338
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,500
It wouldn't make sense
for Mister to go through

339
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,458
all this just for money.

340
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,458
There has to be
something else at work.

341
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,250
And I intend to find out what.

342
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,125
Are you really only doing
this because it's your job?

343
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,708
I've been wanting
to ask you this for a while...

344
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,291
Is there a special reason
you started going after Mister

345
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,625
in the first place, Inspector?

346
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,416
I mean, you started
investigating him

347
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,625
four years ago, right...?

348
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,208
Look at that!

349
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,375
The bounty went up again!

350
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,833
I wouldn't be so damned
laid back about it.

351
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,666
You know bounty hunters
all over the place are gonna

352
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,500
want a piece of that action.

353
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,500
What about that one?

354
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,083
Yep!

355
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,666
That'll do.

356
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,250
Thanks for your business!

357
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,708
But this check is for too much!

358
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,791
Well now.

359
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,083
That depends on
what I'm buying.

360
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,500
I know you've got more than
spaceships for sale here.

361
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,208
Well, I dunno...

362
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,333
C'mon, you've done it before.

363
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,083
I can't be positive...

364
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,625
but the Guild is digging up
Graceland like the whole planet

365
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,208
was made of platinum
or somethin', you know?

366
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,833
Yeah...?

367
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,250
And there's
a rumor going around...

368
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,250
A group of Federation
government bigwigs

369
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,750
is headed over to
Graceland right now.

370
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,416
So tell me who's the
biggest wig on board?

371
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,791
That'd be Senator Hewlett...

372
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:22,791
What?

373
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,416
I can take it, can't I?

374
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,625
Sure thing.

375
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,958
Once I get my money's worth.

376
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,250
Well.

377
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,625
We catch anything?

378
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,500
Not yet.

379
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,083
Let's give it another minute.

380
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,541
Whatcha doin' there, huh?

381
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,333
It's an all--directions
broadcast that forces

382
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,041
repeater stations
to reply back to us.

383
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,416
And then, we look to see
exactly who's answering.

384
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,125
And it's juuuust
like Mister said.

385
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,916
There's an area right there
that isn't returning anything.

386
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,458
I'm guessing there's a huge
jamming net over the whole area.

387
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,750
That, and I just talked
to a little bird.

388
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,208
Says there are carrier pigeons
flying all over the place.

389
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,083
Wait, you can't be serious.

390
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,375
The Feds jam the living
crap out of everything when

391
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,291
they have mission like this.

392
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,583
So not only does the ENEMY
not hear anything,

393
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,583
THEY don't hear anything either.

394
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,541
And that means, all classified
orders get delivered by hand.

395
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
Then that means the
rumor about all of those

396
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,583
government officials
being on their way

397
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,125
to Graceland could be...

398
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,666
More than a rumor, it's true.

399
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,500
I see...

400
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,208
Yep.

401
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,833
That's what I'm sayin'.

402
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,625
So even if Katana and I try
to hack into the Federation's

403
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,250
military information network,
there won't be anything

404
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,958
to dig out of there because of
the information security rules.

405
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,166
Wow, it looks like the two
of you finally got it together

406
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,000
for a change.

407
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,666
Watch it, squirt!

408
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,916
Looks like it's time for us
to get this show on the road.

409
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,083
Here.

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,333
What is that for?

411
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,458
If you're comin' with me,
you're gonna need a piece'

412
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,208
Course an old fart
like you might not be able

413
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,541
to handle something new
and improved like this...

414
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,666
There you go again, making
up for your lack of manhood

415
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,833
with your mouth and your toys.

416
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,416
Amazing!

417
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
After all this time,
he's still got it!

418
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,708
I'll do what you ask...

419
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,708
this time.

420
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,250
Fine by me.

421
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,625
And I'm probably gonna have
to listen to one a'yer sermons

422
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,041
when you get back.

423
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,666
Bet your ass.

424
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,500
Just remember we're
countin' on ya so don't go

425
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,250
screwing this up
for us, you guys.

426
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:30,958
Yeah.

427
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:31,958
Don't go screwin' it up!

428
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:32,875
Sure thing, kid.

429
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,208
Count on us!

430
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,250
We're about to run out
of time here, people.

431
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,583
Let's get this
show on the road!

432
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,833
Did you send for us...

433
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,208
Mother?

434
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,416
I have an errand for you.

435
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
There they are...

436
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,750
The Twelve Sisters.

437
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey, Mister.

438
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:15,791
Yeah?

439
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,375
What's on your mind, kid?

440
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,958
I was just thinking--you were
right when you said that dealing

441
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,583
with the bomb on his own would
have been tough for Bishop,...

442
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,041
but are you gonna be okay
without Swamp to help you out

443
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,916
at the Gigabanks?

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,583
He said so himself.

445
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,833
Graceland's almost a completely
different planet, now.

446
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,833
It's not gonna
be easy, ya know...

447
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,666
Ah, don't worry--we'll
probably figure something out.

448
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,208
"Probably"?

449
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,583
All right, we're ready to go.

450
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,083
I'm right here with ya, kid.

451
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,333
Lookin' good...

452
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,208
ya old fart.

453
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,875
You want me to
give you a "sermon?"

454
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,625
Hey, Mister...

455
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,166
Swamp sent this.

456
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,041
Is that a compass?

457
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,291
Yeah...

458
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,041
So why didn't he just
give it to you himself

459
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,083
instead of asking me?

460
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:23,958
What's that?

461
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,000
Swamp give ya a parting gift?

462
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,625
Yeah.

463
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,875
It's our map.

464
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,208
Straight to the Gigabanks!

465
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:32,666
All right!

466
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,708
They're off.

467
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,416
We're counting on you!

468
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,083
Don't screw up you guys!

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,791
Be careful!
