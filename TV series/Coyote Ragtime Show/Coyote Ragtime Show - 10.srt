1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,000
Damn jamming signals
are all over the place.

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,250
No way we're gonna
contact the Coyote.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,833
We'll just have
to go down there.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,166
So how much time
do we have left, anyway?

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,500
About as much time as we've got
left to live, I'd dare say.

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,583
So are ya still
goin' down there?

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,875
Damn straight!

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,875
So do we stop the bomb first...

9
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,375
or take back
Bruce's legacy first?

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,916
Distance to the Gigabanks
is sixty--three hundred.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,041
That aint too far.

12
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,083
There's the evidence!

13
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,416
The Federation lied to us!!!

14
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,125
This incident should be
all the proof you need!

15
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,791
The Federation used the threat
of destroying our entire planet

16
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,125
against us to force their
political will on us!

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,416
And now,  we've exposed the
degenerates of the Federation

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,333
for who they truly are!

19
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,708
We of the Graceland Liberation
Forces will continue

20
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,375
the righteous battle against
this oppresive enemy

21
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,583
and with God as my witness, we
will cleanse Graceland 

22
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,958
or the scourge of the
Federation... FOREVER!!

23
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,208
We have confirmed that
combat has resumed between

24
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,208
the Federation and Graceland's
Liberation Forces.

25
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,333
New video from the
battlefield has just

26
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,583
come in from the news desk.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,625
Hostilities seem
to be escalating,

28
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,833
with the fiercest
in Godwing Valley.

29
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,416
While Colonel Richard
was giving his address,

30
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,166
Graceland Liberation Forces
were already launching

31
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,083
a maximum offensive.

32
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,916
Right now, for the
benefit of our viewers...

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,333
So, the Federation
was bluffing, hm?

34
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,083
I'd dare say that's
welcome news.

35
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,875
We should be able to search for
Bruce's legacy at our leisure,

36
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,833
now.

37
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,083
I wonder about that...

38
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,750
Madame? Is there something
that's got you concerned?

39
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,083
I'd just rather be cautious.

40
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,833
Well, it's more than
a little inconvenient that

41
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,375
the hottest spot in the war
and our dig site happen

42
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,416
to be this close together.

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,708
How is May doing?

44
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,083
She should be up

45
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,333
and around and back to her
old self in half a day.

46
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,833
What the hell's
going on here anyway?!

47
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,958
Yeah, it's messed--up.

48
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,541
I thought they were
saying up until yesterday

49
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,708
that there was a cease--fire on
account of the photonic bomb.

50
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,583
So why are they shooting up
the country side again?

51
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,458
Murphy's Law.

52
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,625
Bishop and Swamp check in yet?

53
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,750
Nothing.

54
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,208
I've been monitoring
the whole time

55
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,000
but I haven't gotten a word.

56
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,625
February.

57
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,875
What is it, Mother?

58
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,791
Have April and the
triplets contacted you yet?

59
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,500
No, not yet...

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,041
I want to see that Federal
investigator who spent

61
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,541
the last week with
May in my quarters.

62
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,250
Right away, Mother.

63
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,541
I don't have any
information about the bomb.

64
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,583
In fact, since you just
told me that the bomb

65
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,958
aboard the Jupiter was phony,
I would guess you know

66
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,791
a lot more about it than I do.

67
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,166
All right.

68
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,541
I have a question for you.

69
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,125
Really?

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:20,250
What brought you and Mister here
to planet Graceland, Marciano?

71
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,916
My, where did that come from?

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,416
Huh?

73
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,375
What about it interests you?

74
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,541
I want to know what in the
universe is powerful enough

75
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,916
to motivate you to come
to Graceland in the middle

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,250
of all this.

77
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,291
I want to know why a coyote
like Mister would willingly

78
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,500
risk his life to do this.

79
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,250
It's that simple.

80
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,500
Money, my dear.

81
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,750
Huh?

82
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,958
All kinds of big strong
self--assured men risk

83
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,083
their lives unnecessarily...

84
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,166
for money.

85
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,500
Right.

86
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,750
He's probably got a shovel

87
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,250
or two in the dirt
on this planet right now.

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:02,916
Then he's already made it?

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,333
I'm surprised
you're so laid--back.

90
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,541
If it's the Mister I know,

91
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,708
he may already have
reached the treasure.

92
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,166
Don't get her mad at us!

93
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,500
There's one other thing.

94
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't say it, Inspector!

95
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,541
Is May all right?

96
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,916
Huh?

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,375
She's fine.

98
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,416
That's good to hear.

99
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,541
What are we gonna do now?!

100
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,875
They're gonna hang us

101
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,083
or shoot us push us out
an airlock or something!!!

102
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,958
I'm too cute to die!!!!!!

103
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,541
Let's go.

104
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,750
You okay?

105
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,166
I'm fine.

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,666
Figures she'd have a bunch of
goons watching the entrance.

107
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:51,958
You ready?

108
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Yeah!

109
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,083
Good to go over there?

110
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,041
Sure am.

111
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,333
Yeah.

112
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,125
Hey, Mister.

113
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,375
We're screwed if they see you.

114
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,541
Keep your head down.

115
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,708
I've just got
a strange feeling.

116
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,375
Like we're not headed in the
right direction, you know?

117
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,708
Maybe we should
try going in over there.

118
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,541
All right.

119
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,458
Fine.

120
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,500
Close the box.

121
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Ok.

122
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,708
Made it past those guys.

123
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,375
Hey!

124
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,083
You think this is it?

125
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,833
We're in the last lap of
this race and we're about

126
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,458
to take the lead on
the final curve, Boss!

127
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,666
If Bishop were here he'd
tell you we're not there yet.

128
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,541
Hey Mister!

129
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
Pick up the horn, willya?!

130
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,708
Hey, it's Bishop!

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,041
Bishop, it's Franca.

132
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,458
Can you hear me?

133
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,041
Yeah, loud and clear.

134
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,333
Is everyone all right?

135
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,500
Of course we are!

136
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,041
What about the treasure?

137
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,041
We're gonna make our way
into the cave right now.

138
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,000
All right.

139
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,333
Is Mister there?

140
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:45,875
Yeah.

141
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,833
I'll put him on.

142
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,416
Here ya go.

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,750
So, how'd it go?

144
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,083
Well...

145
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,416
it didn't go all that well
to tell you the truth.

146
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,041
Yeah?

147
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
Yeah, okay.

148
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,791
Let's do that.

149
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,333
Right, we'll wait for you.

150
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,458
Catch up with ya later, Bishop.

151
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,250
What happened?

152
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,833
He didn't blow it, did he?

153
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,458
They didn't get a chance.

154
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,875
Not even close.

155
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,375
But the bottom line is
we've still got a countdown

156
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,750
to beat before that photonic
bomb blows us all away.

157
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,291
So it's still active.

158
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,541
According to Bishop the bomb
aboard the Jupiter was a bluff.

159
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,041
And on top of that it looks
like the Federation buried

160
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,666
the real photonic bomb right
under where we're standin'.

161
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,625
Huh?!

162
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,125
That's just the beginning.

163
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,583
Those guys from
Graceland's Liberation Forces

164
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,541
don't even know
the bomb is buried here.

165
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,166
They don't even know
they're sittin' on top

166
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,833
of the same problem.

167
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,333
And that's why they
started fighting again.

168
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,791
So, you're telling us
we only have half a day left

169
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,791
before this planet
gets blown up?

170
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,666
We're the only people
around with any idea

171
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,375
that there's another
bomb set to explode.

172
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,166
I couldn't care less about
all the soldiers who woke up

173
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,916
wantin' to kill
someone else today...

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,416
but knowin' about the bomb
and doin' nothin' about it?

175
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,041
That idea makes me sick.

176
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:57,916
Bruce.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,625
I sure wasn't countin' on this.

178
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,791
Heh.

179
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,541
You know you're
getting a kick out of it.

180
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't even have to say it.

181
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,666
I know what you're thinking.

182
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Take care of
Franca for me, my friend.

183
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,291
So are ya ready?

184
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah!

185
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,041
Ok now what?

186
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,000
It's definitely ahead.

187
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,166
All that bombing might have
caused some of the chambers

188
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,083
to collapse.

189
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,083
Wait.

190
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,583
Does that mean
the Gigabanks...?

191
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,666
We can't be sure about that
until we get near the site.

192
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,916
Let's backtrack.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,250
Looks like there was

194
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,166
a side passage we can try
that might get us there.

195
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,666
Tell August to assist
January with the search.

196
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,791
Have June move her
squad to sector B--8

197
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,166
and have March go to G--3.

198
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,125
Inform the troops that we will
be continuing with our operation

199
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
into the night and that we
will continue our search until

200
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,000
the Gigabanks is located!

201
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,375
What's the matter?

202
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:34,250
You're acting like
we're already out of time.

203
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,833
I don't know.

204
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,541
But I'm not going to
take any chances, either.

205
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,625
It doesn't even
feel like my body.

206
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,791
Looks like this way is clear.

207
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,458
C'mon.

208
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,583
Dead end here, guys.

209
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,958
Let's go back.

210
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,583
Katana, did he
just tell us to go?

211
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,291
Looks like it.

212
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,541
What do you wanna do?

213
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,458
Let's go.

214
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,041
We're running out of time.

215
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,041
If I know Mister, he'll find a
way to catch up with us again.

216
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,541
Let's do it, then.

217
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,708
Sounds like that idiot
detective stood up to Mother.

218
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,791
Detective?

219
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,041
Yeah, the smart--mouth
on Sandvil.

220
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,125
Oh, THAT detective!

221
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,458
Angelica?!

222
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,541
Nah, I think she's still alive.

223
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,291
Angelica's here?

224
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,833
Shit!

225
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,625
10 hours left...

226
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,541
I just can't
leave her where she is.

227
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,958
Damn it!

228
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,166
Should be all right now.

229
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,916
Let's go!

230
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,541
Angelica, what did
you break your shoe for?

231
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,958
You really don't want
to die here, do you?

232
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,958
No...

233
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,375
but how are
getting out of here?

234
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,750
A detective is always prepared.

235
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,083
Huh?

236
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,291
Let's go!

237
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,666
Right!

238
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,625
May, it's you!

239
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,958
They fixed your body?

240
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,333
You're probably
better off going that way.

241
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,458
Thanks a lot!

242
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,041
See ya!

243
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,916
I really hope
you catch up with him.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,916
Another dead end?

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Looks like.

246
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,500
We can backtrack again and see
if there's another side tunnel

247
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,208
or something that'll get us
around all these dead ends.

248
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,583
That's a good plan.

249
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,625
Don't give up, okay?

250
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,750
Don't you go dyin' on me, Angel!

251
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
Angelica!

252
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,291
That Gal sure has
a lot of spunk!

253
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,416
Angelica!

254
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,250
Stop screaming!

255
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,708
Or you'll bite your tongue.

256
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,208
M'kay!

257
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:47,916
Angelica!

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,583
Get in!

259
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,875
Hurry!

260
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:51,625
Chelsea!

261
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,708
Right!

262
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,666
Angelica, I need you
to help me fight them off.

263
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,125
Right...

264
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,666
And you, young lady, I need
you to handle this beast.

265
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,041
Gotcha.

266
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,333
You wanna die or somethin'?!

267
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,291
They're here!

268
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,208
Bastards!

269
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,458
Last one!

270
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,791
Why did...

271
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,041
you save us back there?

272
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,083
Oh, you know how it is, Angel.

273
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,750
When I heard an old
acquaintance of mine

274
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,000
came out all this way
to see me...

275
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,791
Figured I just had
to stop by and say hi.

276
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,041
Did I interrupt something?

277
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,000
No, not at all.

278
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,541
Y'know...

279
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,500
I'd love to sit around
and play catch--up, Angel.

280
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,666
But I don't have a lot of
time left before that bomb

281
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,541
goes off and takes
this planet with it.

282
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,416
The bomb?

283
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,208
It was just a political ploy!

284
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,875
No it wasn't; and I don't
have the time to explain it.

285
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,541
But you can bet your bottom
space dollar that in less than

286
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:11,125
10 hours this planet is really
gonna be gone and so are we!

287
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,000
You're lying!

288
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,458
Leave now and you'll make it.

289
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,291
And take that girl
you're draggin' around

290
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,666
with ya while you're at it.

291
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,958
No I...

292
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:18,791
won't do it...

293
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,291
Get outta here!

294
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,500
But Mister...

295
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,625
why the hell
are you staying here?

296
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,958
I'm stayin here,

297
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,041
'cuz I still have business
left to take care of.

298
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:28,750
Fine.

299
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,291
Then I'm not leaving!

300
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,458
If you're staying
I have to stay.

301
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,250
After all, you still have all
those nagging arrest warrants.

302
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,666
I understand ya.

303
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,291
Yeah, you've got
a job to capture me,

304
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,250
but as a policewoman, you've
also got a duty to save lives.

305
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,000
Am I right?

306
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,000
What?

307
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,541
Here's the deal, Angel.

308
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,791
Right now you and I are the
only two souls on this planet

309
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,125
who know that the godforsaken
bomb is still gonna blow.

310
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,708
I couldn't give a shit less
for the guys who are out there

311
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,208
killing themselves over
politics, but it'd be

312
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,000
pretty damn lousy if all the
good people just blew up today.

313
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,416
I want you to try to get
as many civilians off of

314
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,833
this planet as you can in the
time we have left, Angelica.

315
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,708
Can you do that?

316
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,833
You still...

317
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,416
haven't said why
you're staying.

318
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,750
Because I still have family
on this planet, Angel.

319
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,916
And you already know

320
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,291
that coyotes don't
betray their families.

321
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,458
Even if it kills 'em.

322
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,333
Mister...

323
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,916
I...

324
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,833
I...

325
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,083
I'm not much
of a romantic, either.

326
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,625
Hm?

327
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,583
Slide over, honey.

328
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,625
I'll take the wheel.

329
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,166
Okay.
