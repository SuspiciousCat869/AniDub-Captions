1
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,625
Inspector!

2
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,625
You TRYING to leave me behind?

3
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,500
New "partner," MY BUTT!

4
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,458
Welcome to your
impeachment hearing Marciano.

5
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,708
Name, Luis Gonzalez.

6
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,916
Charged with causing a 25--car
pileup after drunken driving.

7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,625
Sentenced to 1 year
of prison with hard labor.

8
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,250
So just who is
this guy anyway?

9
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,333
His real name
and age are unknown.

10
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,250
He's always gone by "Mister."

11
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,291
Con--man, strong arm robber
and self--employed pirate...

12
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,625
an outlaw who
masquerades as an angel.

13
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,166
And definitely
a romantic egoist.

14
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Okay, but...

15
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,833
what does that mean?

16
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,041
It means he's a Coyote!

17
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,083
You wasted the 12 Sisters

18
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,416
just so you could
capture a single coyote?

19
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,125
Think of the politicians and
police we'll have to pay off.

20
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,875
Your actions will impact
the rest of the Guild.

21
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,625
She's obscuring something!

22
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,083
You're already in trouble.

23
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,666
Own up and spare
yourself some grief.

24
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,625
What're you hiding from us?

25
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,083
What do those Coyotes have...

26
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,333
that's so damned
valuable to you?

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,375
Hey, Doctor Watson...

28
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,166
Uh, my name is Chelsea.

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,000
So have you found out what
the most important piece

30
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,375
of information in
the Gonzales record is?

31
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,541
Huh?

32
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,666
Ah, well...

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,041
It's his sentence.

34
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,166
His sentence?

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,791
He was only in for a year.

36
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,375
Meaning he chose to break out
of prison with only ten days

37
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,625
left on his sentence.

38
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,666
HUH?!

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,958
I can't figure out
a motive for it, but...

40
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,291
Mister wouldn't have done that
unless he was really pressed

41
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,416
for time.

42
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,291
A coup d'etat,
Madame Marciano?

43
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,375
Don't you think
that's a bit hasty?

44
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,583
7 days remain before the
Federation drops its photon

45
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,708
annihilation bomb, and the
Graceland Liberation Forces have

46
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,833
continually refused to surrender
to the Federal government.

47
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,750
If this bomb is dropped,
the planet Graceland itself

48
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,333
will be wiped out of existence.

49
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,500
As negative public
opinion intensifies,

50
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,375
galactic leaders are...

51
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,791
Wake up and smell the litter,

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,583
all you cats and kitties -
cuz it ain't so pretty!

53
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,208
My name is Super Soul!

54
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,541
An' I SOLD it all
for rock 'n roll, baby!

55
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,250
But I ain't no sellout like them
no--good POL--I--TI--CIANS!!!!!

56
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,000
Cuz dey sellin' out
to whoever's SHELLIN' out!

57
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,958
We be comin' atcha LIVE
from my own private frequency!

58
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,958
You ever heard of
a space carjack?

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,541
Well, this is an airwave...

60
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,500
Damn...

61
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,875
Not every channel again!

62
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,500
Ah well...

63
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,166
The three hours is almost up.

64
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,125
You've got 30 seconds left.

65
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,458
Shut up and stop distracting me!

66
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,375
10!

67
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,291
9!

68
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,083
8!

69
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,000
7!

70
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,000
6!

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:07,958
5!

72
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,875
4!

73
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,000
3!

74
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:10,666
2!

75
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,791
Oh hell yeah!

76
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
Ah, crap...

77
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,000
Told ya so!

78
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,208
Maybe that'll teach you not

79
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,583
to underestimate
Master Katana's technique!

80
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,291
Here!

81
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,333
All right!

82
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,375
A Galactica Gadgets
limited edition!

83
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,333
And now it's mine!

84
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,208
Looks better on me,
doesn't it?

85
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,125
We can get
underway anytime now.

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
And now I guess
I owe you an apology.

87
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,833
When I told you that Franca
wanted to talk to you...

88
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
I made that up.

89
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,458
I just hope it works out.

90
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,250
Doesn't surprise me.

91
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,958
Of course it doesn't.

92
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,250
So, seven days is all the time

93
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,333
we've got not one
single minute more.

94
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,291
After that, Graceland's going
to be nothing but a memory.

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,875
Shit.

96
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,875
Stop acting like an idiot!

97
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,166
Let's just get going.

98
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,375
Who's the man baby!

99
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,833
Huh?

100
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,250
A night has come and gone
since Marciano's 12 Sisters

101
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,291
attacked Sandvil Penitentiary.

102
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,625
The extent of the damage

103
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,583
is becoming more and more
apparent as time passes.

104
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,000
The death toll
currently stands at 8,

105
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,500
with 263 wounded
and one prisoner missing.

106
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,041
Authorities are scrambling

107
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,250
to investigate any possible
connections with the prisoners.

108
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,833
Cheers!

109
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,375
Well, I've got a pretty good
guess about where he's at...

110
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,833
I say he's still hiding out on
Sandvil Ain't no doubt about it!

111
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,666
Gimme a break!

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,583
Mister ain't gonna hang
around that planet waitin'

113
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,500
to get busted.

114
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,083
Man, you don't get it at all.

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,958
He never do what anyone expect
-- dat's what make Mister tick,

116
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,000
ya know!

117
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,041
Hey, look - it's
the Lollipop guild!

118
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,125
You're about a 100,000 light
years short of bein' a Coyote!

119
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,500
Ya sissy--ass
little greenhorns!

120
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,416
Y--y--y--you rusted--out
sack of crap!

121
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Bring it on, bitches!

122
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,458
Who's kickin' whose ass now?!

123
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,083
NOW you've asked
for it, ya old bastard!

124
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,041
You pinche piece o' crap!

125
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,625
Wipe the floor with 'em!

126
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,458
All right!

127
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,458
Time for an ass--kickin'!

128
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,083
Okay, how would
the rest of you idiots

129
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,000
like me to do that to you?!

130
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
Aw, come on Franca.

131
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,500
Even Mister didn't mind a
little fight once in a while...

132
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,375
Damn, chill out girlie.
Be cool alright?

133
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,500
Say, Franca, have you heard
anything from Mister since

134
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,958
he busted out?

135
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,125
Stupid!

136
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,791
Don't go runnin'
your mouth off like that!

137
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,500
I spend a couple days out of
town and my little bar

138
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,958
and grill's turned
into a funeral home?

139
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,833
Wake up, dammit!

140
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,833
Long time no see, Honey.

141
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,708
I heard that
ya bought it, man!

142
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,541
NAH!

143
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,125
I ain't got time for dying!

144
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey there, it's been
a year, hasn't it?

145
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
Been doin' any growin'?

146
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,625
Looks like your hair has.

147
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,708
And LOOK...

148
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,750
you're BUDDING there,
aren'tcha...!

149
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,458
we still got that ice machine?

150
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
It might have been easier
on poor little Franca if

151
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,000
he'd just come out and
asked her, "Hey, Franca,

152
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,500
where's the treasure hidden?"
He never gave it any

153
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,666
serious thought, and now things
have gotten all complicated.

154
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,833
But anyway...

155
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,750
They had to get all that
business out in the open -

156
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,375
know what I mean?

157
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,458
Mister and Franca knew they were
going to see each other again...

158
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,041
so it's all good!

159
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,666
I just hope it all works out...

160
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,375
you know?

161
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,875
Me too.

162
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,708
You've gotten good at that.

163
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,708
So you broke out, huh?

164
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,291
Sure did.

165
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,750
Even though you were almost done
serving all of your sentence...

166
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,291
Yeah.

167
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,166
Why'd you do it?

168
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,291
Forget I asked.

169
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,625
Graceland will be gone soon,

170
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,833
and that means the
treasure's gonna be gone, too.

171
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,833
You need ME to tell you
where it is before Graceland

172
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,166
gets destroyed - otherwise
you've wasted all this time

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,791
taking care of me.

174
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,583
Come on now...

175
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,375
Believe it or not,
it's important to me

176
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,166
that I hear what you
have to say about all this.

177
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
If you say so...

178
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,791
Look Franca!

179
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,125
The reason the Guild killed your
dad was 'cause of something

180
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,458
he left for you on Graceland.

181
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,416
Don't you even wanna
know what it was?

182
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,333
If you do, then you
should come with me.

183
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,375
LIAR!

184
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,208
All you want is to know how you
can get your hands on his money!

185
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,041
I can't believe
you'd lie like that...

186
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,708
you're using me!

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,083
Commence operation.

188
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,791
All units spread out.

189
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,958
Roger.

190
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:44,000
This time, I WILL
deliver him to you, Mother.

191
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,000
You are Marciano's 12 Sisters.

192
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,916
I expect your actions to
bring no shame upon that name.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,083
Yes, Mother.

194
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,208
Mother, Dear...

195
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,041
Why didn't we get the girl?

196
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,500
We could have just

197
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,000
captured her and made her
say where the treasure was.

198
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,458
You're not getting it.

199
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,416
Mister could have
forced her talk, too...

200
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
if he wanted to.

201
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,375
If she was the key, then
Mister would have gotten

202
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,458
the information and cut
her loose a long time ago.

203
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,291
It's something
we're just not seeing...

204
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,375
And we can't find out what
that is until we catch HIM.

205
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,583
Are you there Bishop?

206
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,500
Damn it!

207
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
They're jammin' us!

208
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
You think those
Guild bastards would be

209
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,125
a little more considerate
of the neighbors!

210
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,250
Oh, like YOU have room to
talk about being considerate!

211
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,000
Mister!

212
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey!

213
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,250
Now what?

214
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,541
Well, It's been a while
since you've called me that.

215
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,333
"Mister," that is.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,458
Just go ahead and
check in my room,

217
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,791
I've got a few
weapons in there.

218
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:06,916
Okay, then!

219
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,708
Jesus!

220
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,250
Over here, guys!

221
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,583
You'll pay me back
with interest for this!

222
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,375
Every Coyote knows...

223
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,416
"Even if it costs you
your life...

224
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,125
NEVER pay ANYone back!" "...

225
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:36,916
You guys!

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,500
Okay, ya got me!

227
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,958
Fine, I give it to you!

228
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,166
Now you get moving...

229
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,541
comprende?

230
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,208
Appreciate it, old timer.

231
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,791
I love you guys.

232
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,000
Really.

233
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,333
Now let's get those putos!

234
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,083
Damn it!

235
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,375
The Guild beat us to him!

236
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,291
Have the Ku--Rong
police responded?

237
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,708
They must be using the chaos

238
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,083
as an excuse
not to go in right away.

239
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,458
And someone probably pressured
them to stay out of it.

240
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,833
But who could it be?

241
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,583
Well, it's either Ku--Rong's
governor or the police.

242
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,583
The Guild must have a lap dog
they're feeding money

243
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,833
to in the government.

244
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,875
Oh, I see...

245
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,166
But that's OBVIOUS!

246
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,583
Do you have anything to offer

247
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,833
other than your "good
memory" and big boobs?!

248
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,583
Well?

249
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll have you know...

250
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,541
these boobs come in
really handy!

251
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,083
WHAT?!

252
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,083
Well, for one thing, it's easier
to make friends at parties!

253
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,375
Not to mention all the times
I've been asked out to dinner!

254
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,416
Chelsea!

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,750
A woman is more than
just her BODY!

256
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,541
Well then...

257
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,000
so they DO work!

258
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,500
Damn!

259
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,541
Not again!

260
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,208
What the hell is goin' on?!

261
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,291
Why'd you come here?

262
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:10,125
Figured maybe you'd want someone
to come hear your last words.

263
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,166
The pendant that holds
the secret to the treasure...

264
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,916
Huh?

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,166
You could have taken it
by force if you wanted.

266
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,875
But you didn't do that.

267
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,250
You gave up on space travel

268
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,333
and decided to make do
by running a bar instead.

269
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,875
All for me.

270
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,166
Oh, it wasn't that bad once
I took a crack at it, y'know.

271
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,541
I'm not buying it -

272
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,333
being a barkeep isn't
exactly a job for a Coyote!

273
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,333
So tell me - why didn't you just
take the pendant and run away?

274
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,166
Oh, whatever.

275
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,625
The way things are going,

276
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,458
it's all gonna be atomized
in less than a week anyway.

277
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,333
You knew about this pendant
all along, didn't you?

278
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,291
And that the location of
Papa's legacy is hidden inside.

279
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,375
So go ahead - take it.

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,833
I can't take that.

281
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,916
'K, I need a breather...

282
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
On second thought...

283
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,208
let's not and say we did!

284
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,416
Come on!

285
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,333
Target detected in abandoned
building at point A9.

286
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,750
Again: Target detected in
abandoned building at point A9.

287
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,500
Target is fleeing
on foot and heading toward

288
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,166
the 1st floor exit.

289
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
Surround the building
perimeter at point A9.

290
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,333
Take your positions.

291
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,916
They re--planted
the tracer as a decoy!

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,875
Checking the roof!

293
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,000
Bastards are fast,
aren't they?!

294
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:29,875
Hey, wait a minute!

295
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,500
We're too close!

296
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,250
We'll lose all of it
if they die!

297
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,375
I'm sorry, Mother.

298
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,750
I'll send out
a recovery team.

299
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,291
Mother?

300
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:49,916
Mother, come in!

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,625
Can you hear me?!

302
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,166
What's happening here?

303
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,583
What the hell?

304
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,125
We just lost all
communications out here.

305
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,625
What the heck
is goin' on here?!

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,958
It couldn't be...!

307
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,875
Can't say no
to THEM boobies, cutie!

308
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,166
Screw it, I'll do it!

309
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,166
You mean it?

310
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,916
Oh, thank you sooo much!

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,833
Use a crook to catch
a crook, I always say!

312
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,875
Hey all ya'll pretty
kitty cats gettin' down

313
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,541
in this litter box of a town!

314
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,791
Super Soul is back around!

315
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,375
We're hijackin the airwaves
again tonight, all right?

316
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,000
Tonight's broadcast
is all about BOOBS, baby!

317
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,000
Did you know that
all them politicos...

318
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,083
is BOSOM buddies...

319
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,458
with the M--O--B?!

320
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,291
I'm gonna throw this!

321
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,000
So let go of me right when
I do and catch it, all right?!

322
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,291
NO, Franca!

323
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,791
You idiot!

324
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,625
Who do you think you're fooling
 with that act of yours?!

325
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,583
Damn it!

326
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,666
You've been trying to make me
believe it for three years...

327
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,666
just give it up already!

328
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,041
Once you find out where
the treasure is I won't be

329
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,250
any good to you anymore.

330
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,041
So you might as well let me go!

331
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
Understand?

332
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,666
You don't have to pretend
that you care about me anymore.

333
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,916
You've been...

334
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,125
so kind to me already...

335
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,958
but it's not real, is it?

336
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,166
The treasure I was watching

337
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,333
wasn't the thing
around your damn NECK!

338
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,958
It was YOU!

339
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,250
Mister!

340
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,250
Just take it!

341
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:08,833
Please!

342
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,375
I can't do that!

343
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,333
We can't let them die!

344
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:26,250
Coyotes don't run in packs,
but I'll tell ya this!

345
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,166
We don't betray our families,
even if it ends up killing us!

346
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,041
We're out of time!

347
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,500
Never underestimate
Master Katana!

348
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,000
Bishop!

349
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,125
It's all on you!

350
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
As it should be!

351
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,666
Come on!

352
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,208
You win this time...

353
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,291
You still haven't
given me an answer...

354
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,875
Do you want to see what
your father left behind?

355
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,375
Mind if I help you find it?
