1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:12,958
Franca!

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,375
How's it going over there?

3
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,958
Fine, I'm almost done here.

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:16,625
Okay.

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,708
It's opening up now!

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,416
We did it!

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,791
OK, so where are we
going now, Inspector?

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,625
To the Graceland gate of course.

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,333
Shouldn't we get
permission to do that first?

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,291
Somehow I get the feeling
that Mister isn't going

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,291
to be asking anyone
for permission.

12
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,166
Duh!

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,125
You finally figured that out?!

14
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,541
We've got the
gate open, so move it!

15
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,083
Boss!

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,333
Trouble here!

17
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,333
We've got Guild
fighters on our ass!

18
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,625
You've gotta be kidding me!

19
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,208
The rendezvous's impossible!

20
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,041
We're gonna get blown
to bits off if I slow down!

21
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,625
I'm out!

22
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,208
At least, I THINK so...

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:07,875
Bishop!

24
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,333
Over here!

25
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,625
Sons of bitches!

26
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,291
Deploy the Guild Skies
immediately.

27
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,416
Right away, Mother.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,083
Attention!

29
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,791
Launch Guild Skies!

30
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,000
Now.

31
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,166
Let's bring this to
a finish, my darlings.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,875
Yes, Mother Dear.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,250
Holy shit!

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,875
Here they come!

35
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, what do
we do now, Mister?!

36
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,208
Like I told ya,

37
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,000
you just bust through the
gate if you get noticed!

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,333
Okay, what's going on here?

39
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,416
My sisters are here.

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,708
Huh?

41
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,875
And Mister!

42
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,291
Wait, Angelica!

43
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,791
What the hell?

44
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,250
Hey, Katana!

45
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,583
Where the hell are you?

46
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,458
It's time to rendezvous!

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,583
Where am I?

48
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,666
Jeez, gimme a minute...

49
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Hey Swamp, are you ready yet?

50
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,458
Keep your shirt on!

51
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,833
This is my first time
playin' with this damn toy!

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,041
Okay, I could use
a pickup any time now.

53
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,625
It's time to hunt down
the coyotes, girls.

54
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,791
We're going to
split into two teams.

55
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:36,958
March, June, August,
January, engage their ship.

56
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,416
I'll be going after Mister.

57
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,916
January!

58
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,250
After what he did
to Sep, Mister's mine!

59
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
Let's get 'em!

60
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,166
Careful!

61
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,666
Bishop!

62
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,458
Katana!

63
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,666
Do you read me?

64
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,958
Can't make you out, Mister!

65
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,583
Boss!

66
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,625
Where are you?!

67
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,875
Damn!

68
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
I KNEW it!

69
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,666
Hey, where are you going now?!

70
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,541
Dammit Coyote, answer me!

71
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,833
Mister!

72
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,458
Hey, Katana!

73
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,500
Mister, it's me.

74
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,375
It's Katana!

75
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,666
Yeah, we established that.

76
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,541
Where are you?

77
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,125
Well, let's have a look here...

78
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,500
I, uh...

79
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,875
WHOA!

80
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,875
We're headed up, Mister!

81
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,583
I found a way up!

82
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,958
Up where?

83
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,333
What do you mean
by "up", Katana?

84
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,791
Hey, it's Bishop!

85
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,041
You're still alive!

86
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,833
Obviously, now come
and get me already.

87
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,833
Where the hell
are you guys, anyway?

88
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,208
I'm a few seconds away
from the marketplace.

89
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,291
Okay!

90
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,916
We'll meet up
in the marketplace!

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,916
I'm countin' on ya.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,916
We made it!

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,375
And we're alive!

94
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,583
You won't get away...

95
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,708
MISTER!!!

96
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,416
Have some of this!

97
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,208
Damn!

98
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
Mister's luck
is about to run out!

99
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,583
We're punchin' outta here!

100
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,875
Damn I'm good!

101
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,791
Attention: This is an
emergency announcement.

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,708
We ask that all customers please
evacuate as quickly as possible.

103
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,875
Repeat, this is an emergency...

104
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,041
Yo!

105
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,333
I could sure use some
fire support there

106
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,708
"mister right--hand man!"

107
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,833
Dammit!

108
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,541
It's been a while,
and I'm kinda rusty!

109
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,708
So get off my ass, will ya?

110
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,166
Pretty good!

111
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,791
Swamp!

112
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,833
We've got company!

113
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,416
Now where in the world
are they hiding?

114
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,625
What a bother...

115
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,083
we'll have to destroy
the buildings, too.

116
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,000
Huh?

117
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:43,875
Whoa...

118
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,333
What the hell are they doing?

119
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,916
Holy crap!

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,833
They're gonna
bury our asses alive!

121
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,208
Are they tryin'
to kill everyone?!

122
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,458
April!

123
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,291
You probably shouldn't
stand so close.

124
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,500
Booby trapped?

125
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,416
That's just Mister's
way of entertaining us.

126
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,041
Aw!

127
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,166
That didn't make 'em any
easier to find at all!

128
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,166
Come on, don't even act
like you didn't wanna do it.

129
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,083
They're persistent little
buggers, aren't they?

130
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,500
Coyote.

131
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,000
Coyote.

132
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,125
Do you read?

133
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,333
There you are!

134
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,125
Bishop, it's the Coyote!

135
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,083
Katana?

136
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,583
I'm in the marketplace's
central plaza right now.

137
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,416
Where are you?

138
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,333
Hiding between
a couple of buildings.

139
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,250
Damn death--girls are
still chasin' after us.

140
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,333
Oh, you're breaking my heart.

141
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,625
Now how about a lift?

142
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,333
Roger.

143
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll see what I can do.

144
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,000
I've finished hacking the
surveillance system, Mother.

145
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,750
Coyotes detected in the central
plaza and section A--3.

146
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,250
En route to the marketplace.

147
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,833
Be sure to inform April.

148
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,291
Yes, Mother.

149
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,458
Mister, you're running
out of places to hide.

150
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,250
He's where?

151
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,833
You heard that, January?

152
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,333
One step ahead you,
sister--dear.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,291
Coyote, can you read me?

154
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,875
Coyote!

155
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,000
Huh?

156
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,458
Damn you, Mister!

157
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,833
We have to go, January.

158
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,125
Mister, you okay down there?

159
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,750
Gimme a second while
I bring the Coyote down.

160
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,833
Man, we were sure in demand up
until a minute ago, weren't we?

161
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,583
Lucky for us, it looks
like the tide's going out.

162
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,500
Hey, what's happening, Mister?

163
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,208
Franca, Katana!

164
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,583
Get outta here!

165
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,500
Just get the hell out!

166
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,750
Fire!

167
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,416
February.

168
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,041
Get my ship ready.

169
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,958
We'll do it right away, Mother.

170
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,458
Your ship, Mother?

171
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,166
I want to have
a little chat with Mister.

172
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,208
Franca...

173
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,125
Franca!

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,458
Hey Mister!

175
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
Franca!

176
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,666
Mister!

177
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,041
Franca!

178
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,041
Mister!

179
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,125
Are you all right?

180
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:11,791
Wait for me!

181
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,500
I'll be right there!

182
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,791
Mm--hmm!

183
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,291
NO...!

184
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,208
Do you feel lucky?

185
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Mister?

186
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,625
What's going on?

187
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,541
Who's shooting over there?

188
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,166
So, she's right
over there, isn't she?

189
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,875
And...

190
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,958
what if she is...?

191
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,333
Mister...

192
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,875
Papa...

193
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,416
I haven't seen you
since that day.

194
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,875
You look well, and that's
what's most important.

195
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,791
I have some business to attend
to with your "guardian."

196
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,583
Where is he?

197
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,083
Is that Marciano?

198
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,916
Right here, Mother.

199
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,916
Oh.

200
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,250
It looks like
we've found him...

201
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,541
Are you all right?

202
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,458
Say something!

203
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,791
Franca!

204
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,500
I've already
disabled him, Mother.

205
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,208
Quite impressive work, April.

206
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,083
God damn it!

207
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,666
Don't you lay a hand on her!

208
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,208
I'll make you pay, bitch!

209
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,083
I wouldn't dream
of touching this child.

210
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,458
Provided YOU tell me everything
you know about Bruce's legacy

211
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,916
and where it is.

212
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,833
If you'd like,
I can shoot him again.

213
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,291
May I, Mother?

214
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,416
No.

215
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,708
I doubt it would
help anything, April.

216
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,125
Looks like I'm out of choices.

217
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,333
I'd rather conduct my business
in a more tasteful fashion,

218
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,291
but...

219
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,041
MARCIANO!

220
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:41,125
Well, well, this
looks so familiar.

221
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,750
Mister, if this girl's
life means anything to you...

222
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,125
Look - just leave
Mister alone...

223
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,083
I'll tell you.

224
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,291
Oh, really?

225
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,375
You have to promise me!

226
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,625
No, Franca!

227
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,875
She'll betray you the
first chance she gets!

228
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,083
Mister!

229
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,708
Here it is.

230
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,166
The secret of my father's
legacy is inside this pendant.

231
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,500
Franca, no...

232
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,375
You better keep your promise.

233
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,875
Yes.

234
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,708
But I've decided that you're
coming with me to Graceland.

235
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:35,708
No!

236
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,541
Stop it!

237
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,625
Let me go!

238
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,875
Franca!

239
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,458
Marciano, you bitch!

240
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,041
I'll tear your friggin...!

241
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,541
Hey I thought we had a deal
you were gonna spare my life,

242
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,750
remember?

243
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,750
Guess I missed that part
of the conversation.

244
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,583
Well don't worry
yer pretty head.

245
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,791
I wasn't expectin' a BREAK!

246
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,583
Mister!

247
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,750
Mister!

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,083
April.

249
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
Come back to the ship.

250
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,333
Yes, Mother.

251
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,291
Give the poor man his space.

252
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,916
After all, he just lost
his best friend's treasure

253
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,916
and that best friend's
daughter all in one day.

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,208
I wonder which is worse?

255
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,250
Stop right there!

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm gonna borrow this
for a little bit.

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,500
That was just a warning.

258
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,750
I'm trying to stop you, damn it.

259
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,583
Otherwise you'll get
killed out there.

260
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,291
I promised her.

261
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,166
I told her...

262
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,833
that I was taking
her to Graceland!

263
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,541
You mind hoppin' out for me?

264
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,083
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,166
It's true coyotes
don't run in packs.

266
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,916
But even so.

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,833
They don't betray family,
no matter what.

268
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,250
Even if it kills 'em!

269
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,708
Both your heart rate and your
body temperature escalated.

270
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,958
That indicates a vehement
or excited mental state.

271
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,166
So why didn't you shoot him?

272
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,000
That IS the man you've been
after for the last four years,

273
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,125
right?

274
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,833
Angelica...?

275
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:31,666
Mister?

276
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,208
Do you read me?

277
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
Yeah, yeah I can
hear ya just fine.

278
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,208
You OK?

279
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,375
I'm peachy.

280
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,250
We've hit snag or two here,

281
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,125
but we oughta be able
to take off real soon!

282
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
OK: pressure valve...

283
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,291
That's not it!

284
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
Well what, then?

285
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,625
Marciano got
her hands on Franca.

286
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,250
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna leave behind!

287
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:00,666
I wonder what kind of secret
this could possibly hold.

288
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,625
We'll know soon enough...

289
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,083
Unidentified aircraft astern.

290
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,291
Mister!

291
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,375
What?!

292
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,250
Mister!

293
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,500
That was pretty
damned reckless!

294
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,708
Perfect timing!

295
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,166
Catch 'em, Bishop!

296
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,458
Gotcha!

297
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,625
Bishop, Katana!

298
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,333
Just take us straight
to the Graceland gate!

299
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:44,958
Hell, yeah!

300
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,583
We're on our way!

301
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,958
You're not getting away!

302
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,791
We've got some more
company in front of us!

303
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,750
Damn it!

304
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,583
Shit!

305
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,375
So what do we do now, boss?

306
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,791
Mister, what's up?

307
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,416
Mister!

308
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:16,916
Katana!

309
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,458
Watch your heading!

310
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,125
Starboard, dammit!

311
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,000
What?

312
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,708
You sure that's the right gate?

313
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,541
Just get us in there!

314
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,708
Fire!

315
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,750
MISTER!!!
