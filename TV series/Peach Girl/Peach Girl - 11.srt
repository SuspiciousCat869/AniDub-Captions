it's no bother that you're

I mean honestly, if you guys
were actually in love,

then why would Toji even listen
to anything I had to say?

opened your eyes to that fact.

felt a little sorry for you.

it kinda freaked him out.

that he used was 'stalker'.

So let me guess,

170
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,416
Kairi was hitting on Momo again

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,791
and you had to teach
him a lesson?

quite a beating yourself.

00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,083
I don't know.

317
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,166
Toji's the only one who
knows the answer to that.

318
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,041
I guess he just wanted
to be with someone

319
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,500
who was more attractive than me.

320
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,916
Are you kidding me?

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,500
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever laid eyes on.

322
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,500
Whatever.
You're just saying that.

323
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,208
[KAIRI] What?
You really don't think you are?

324
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,958
[MOMO]
No. I really don't.

325
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,708
[KAIRI]
Well!

326
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,958
I guess I'll just
have to prove it you.

327
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,625
[MOMO]
W-What?!

328
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,791
[KAIRI]
Hey! This store looks cool!

329
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,333
You'd look great
in any of these!

330
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,583
[MOMO]
Wait, Kairi...

331
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,375
[KAIRI]
Or maybe this store?

332
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,625
[MOMO]
Uh, either one, but...

333
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,250
[KAIRI]
Now this is really hot.

334
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,166
[MOMO]
You think so?

335
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,833
[KAIRI]
Let's see, not this one.

336
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:25,916
[MOMO]
What about this?

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
[KAIRI] Oh, wow!
That's perfect for you!

338
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,125
Excuse me!

339
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,250
Can my friend please
try this dress on?

340
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,083
Kairi, no!

341
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,416
Don't worry about it!

342
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,416
[MOMO]
Cut it out!

343
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
You shouldn't have
brought me here!

344
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,250
[KAIRI chuckles]

345
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,791
Relax, you don't have to buy it;

346
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,166
you're just trying
it on so have fun!

347
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,208
[MOMO]
Mm.

348
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,708
Well, how's it fit?

349
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,250
[MOMO]
Well...

350
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,333
[KAIRI]
Whoa!! Bravo! Woo hoo!!

351
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,583
[SALES WOMAN]
It looks fantastic!

352
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,125
[KAIRI] Great! Where are we
going next? This is fun!

353
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,708
Stop! Kairi!
We can't just leave!

354
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,625
I have to take
the dress off first!

355
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,625
[KAIRI] No you don't.
It's yours, I paid for it.

356
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,583
[MOMO]
What?!

357
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,416
[KAIRI]
Hey look at this!

358
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,875
This would look great
with your dress.

359
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,458
What did you mean?

360
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,083
When you said you
already paid for it?

361
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,916
I meant that today, we don't
have to worry about money.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,666
[MOMO]
Uh?

363
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,083
[KAIRI]
Check it out!

364
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,458
My brother made some
extra cash on a project.

365
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,791
So he gave me this for the day,

366
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,458
and told me to use
it however I wanted.

367
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,083
[MOMO] This is too much.
You don't have to do all this.

368
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,750
Of course I don't.

369
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,125
That's why they call it a gift.
I want to do it for you.

370
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,083
Try it on!

371
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,666
[MOMO]
Well. I guess...

372
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,666
[MOMO]
I guess it's okay.

373
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,250
[MOMO]
Just this once.

374
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,916
Oh, wow!

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,791
You look amazing!

376
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,916
Just stunning!

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,083
Foxy lady!

378
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,083
You're the hottest
thing I've ever seen!

379
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,916
Okay, that's enough.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,041
[KAIRI]
Okay, you're right.

381
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,125
You're not hot,
you're beautiful!

382
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,375
Radiant!
Brilliant!

383
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,583
A box-office hit!

384
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,083
[MOMO laughs]
You're a dork.

385
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,666
Hey, I'll take 'dork' anyday,

386
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,416
as long as it comes
with that smile.

387
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,458
See? Everyone's
checkin' you out.

388
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,958
It's because you're
so drop-dead gorgeous.

389
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,583
When are you gonna
start believing that,

390
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,916
and stop putting yourself
down all the time, Momo?

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,833
Hey, Kairi, with all
you've done today.

392
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,333
I feel I should pay you back.

393
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,625
[KAIRI]
I told you, they're gifts.

394
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,875
You're not supposed to.

395
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,916
[MOMO] That's sweet,
but I can't accept it.

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,208
I'll pay you back with the money
I'm getting for New Year's,

397
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,250
please? I insist.

398
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,916
Of course you do.
You're so stubborn.

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,958
Yeah, well.

400
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,708
All right, all right!

401
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,750
But only if it'll
make you happy.

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,166
[MOMO]
Mom! I'm home!

403
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,583
[KAIRI] You're beautiful!
Radiant! Brilliant!

404
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,458
[MOMO] If one of my other
friends had said those things,

405
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,375
I don't think it would've
made me feel this way.

406
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,166
It was really sweet of him
to take me out today.

407
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,416
I guess I'm glad he did.

408
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,041
I didn't think I was
ready to laugh again.

409
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,416
[dog barking]

410
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,166
[MOMO]
Uh?!

411
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,791
[foot steps]

412
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,083
[MOMO gasping]

413
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,958
[dog barking]

414
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,291
[MOMO sighs]

415
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey, what are you doing
out here, Momo?

416
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,750
I was just coming to see you.

417
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,333
There was something
I forgot to ask you

418
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,041
while we were out today.

419
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,583
Will you please come back
to school tomorrow?

420
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,958
I know it's hard,
but I think you'll be all right.

421
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,166
[MOMO] Toji's never
coming back again, is he?

422
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,916
[KAIRI]
Huh?

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,583
Uh.

424
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,500
[MOMO]
I didn't wanna believe it,

425
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,291
but I guess it's true.

426
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,000
He's not going to
change his mind.

427
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,458
[MOMO]
It's really over.

428
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,666
[MOMO]
It just isn't fair.

429
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,541
It seems like everytime
I'm feeling low,

430
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,333
he shows up just in time
to make me smile.

431
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,291
Am I falling for Kairi?
What should I do?

432
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,250
Next time on Peach Girl:
The Peach Flower, Blossomed?
