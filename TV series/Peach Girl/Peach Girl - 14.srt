I promise I won't ask
you for anything again.

Kairi wasn't at school today?

Who cares.

call or even text me all day.

What's he waiting for?

30
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,083
Even he knows that you're
supposed to apologize

in a situation like this.

But what if Kairi and that
girl still have feelings

00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,291
for each other?

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,083
If I don't watch out, they
could get back together.

You said you wanted
to be with me, Kairi.

you leave me for that other girl

you'll be sorry. Come out here

I've been trying to reach
you for two months.

Why are you avoiding me?

Did you think you could
ignore me forever?

You know how Morika and I
were talking in the bookstore?

66

It was all about seeing him.

67
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,166
Apparently he's been
avoiding her lately,

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,083
so she came to me to help
them get back together.

69
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,500
I guess she thinks I'm actually
an influence over him.

70
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,750
Wait a minute.

71
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,125
So Morika just used you
to get to your brother?

72
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,041
Pretty much.

73

kicked over this little thing.

after I thought I'd lost him,

than anyone else in the world.

was only a matter of time

and place are memorable,

with doing it, right?

It's about Kairi.

115

I had no idea Toji  was so
boring! I swear,

116
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,375
dating him is no different
than watching paint dry.

117

Now that Momo's in love with
Kairi, I guess it's too late.

118

It got pretty ugly back there.
Sorry 'bout that.

Oh, right.

120
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,708
Honestly, I've been so
busy with work lately

121
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,333
that I haven't had
time to call Morika,

122
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,500
let alone any of
my other friends.

123
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,250
I think Kairi told me that
you make video games

124
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,375
for a living, right?

125
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,208
Yeah. The deadline
for our first beta's

126
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,875
coming up so I've been swamped.

127
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,291
So what did you wanna
tell me about Kairi?

128
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,125
[RYO]
So, what all do you know?

129
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,833
About Kairi and
Morika's past? Tell me.

130
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
I know they used to go
out with each other.

131
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,250
[RYO] And what did Kairi tell
you about Morika and me?

132
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,500
[MOMO]
Uh...

133
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,458
Yeah my brother
stole her from me.

00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,791
[MOMO]
That's it.

135
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,625
[RYO] So that's what he's
believed all this time.

136
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,125
[MOMO]
Isn't that the truth?

137
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,083
No it isn't. I guess I should
tell you the whole story.

138
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,875
What really happened.

139
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,166
Morika and I dated way before
Kairi ever got involved.

140
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,250
When Kairi started
cutting classes,

141
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,541
I asked Morika if she
would tutor him,

142
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,375
and before I knew it they were
involved with each other.

143
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,000
Kairi took it all
pretty seriously.

144
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,166
But she was only doing
it to turn us against

145
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,000
each other for her
own entertainment.

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,041
She enjoyed having two
brothers fight over her.

147
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,333
But when I tried to break
off contact with her,

148
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,666
she freaked out and dumped
Kairi on the spot,

149
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,416
which he never saw coming.

150
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,083
Later on she and I ended
up getting back together,

151
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,833
--but Kairi couldn't handle it.
--[MOMO growls]

152
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,250
But couldn't you have
avoided all that

153
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,750
by just telling him the truth?

154
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
[RYO] If he found out that
Morika was just having fun

155
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,083
at his expense, do you have any
idea how hurt he would feel?

156
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,125
I couldn't bring myself
to tell him that.

157
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,250
But Kairi still thinks that
you stole his girlfriend,

158
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
and he's just gonna keep
on believing that until

159
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
you set things straight.

160
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,041
Wouldn't you rather the two
of you be on good terms

161
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,291
instead of fighting
all the time?

162
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,500
To be perfectly honest,

163
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,916
I really don't care what
Kairi thinks of me.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,291
That's why you have to promise
me that you will never tell him

165
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,333
about any of this,
no matter what.

166
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,791
Lately Kairi's been really
upbeat and happy.

167
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,750
I was wondering what brought
on the sudden change,

168
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,833
then I figured it out. It's
because he started seeing you.

169
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,916
[MOMO gasps]

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,416
Ever since you've
entered his life,

171
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,291
he's become a better person.

172
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,625
I mean that. You're a
good influence on him.

173
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,375
And he deserves nothing but the
best.

174
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,416
I can't believe how nice he was.

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,291
[KAIRI] Momo! I'm here!

176
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,458
Which do you prefer? The
oceans or the mountains?

177
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,208
Although a weekend
trip to the hot springs

178
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,291
would be nice too, huh?

179
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,166
Sounds good.

180
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,416
[KAIRI]
Mm.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,458
Geez Momo, can you
be any less enthusiastic?

182
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,208
We have to pick the
perfect spot together,

183
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,416
or it'll all be meaningless.

184
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,916
You're right. Sorry.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,041
Oh, I ran into your brother
after you took off.

186
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,625
He seems like a really nice guy.

187
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,375
That whole nice routine is
just a façade he puts up.

188
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,750
He's probably just working
on some kind of scheme.

189
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,583
Whatever you do,
don't be fooled by him, Momo.

190
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,916
He's just telling you what
he thinks you wanna hear.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,416
Come on.

192
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,958
You make it sound as if like
he's the devil or something.

193
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,208
What the hell?
You don't believe me?

194
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,916
My brother is like a
male version of Sae.

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,375
He thrives on
stealing from people

196
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,375
he's manipulated
into trusting him.

197
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,083
If he found out that Morika
was having fun at his expense

198
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,791
do you have any idea
how hurt he would feel?

199
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,583
To be honest with you Kairi,
I think you're just biased

200
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,958
against him since
he took Morika from you.

201
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,666
[KAIRI]
I thought you, of all people,

202
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,583
would understand me on this.

203
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,791
[MOMO]
Yeah, well,

204
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,875
you don't even know how
your brother really feels.

205
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,208
Do you think you're the only
one who was hurt by that girl?

206
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,666
I thought that looked familiar.

207
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,833
That's the beach
where we first met.

208
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,208
My gosh.

209
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,666
How many travel agencies
did he go to this morning?

210
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:28,166
[phone rings]

211
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,333
[RYO]
Hello?

212
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,625
[MOMO]
Hey Kairi, i-it's Momo.

213
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,291
Sorry about earlier.
Are you still upset?

214
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,500
[RYO]
No.

215
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,250
Well, would you like
to hang out tomorrow?

216
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,375
[RYO]
Sure.

217
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,250
I'll meet you at the
park at ten, okay?

218
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,916
[RYO]
Cool.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,833
[MOMO]
It's ten after. Where is he?

220
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,875
[RYO]
Momo.

221
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,375
How are you?

222
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,375
Ryo, hi.

223
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,916
Sorry.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,333
Something kinda urgent came
up so Kairi couldn't make it.

225
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh. Well those things
happen sometimes I guess.

226
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,083
[MOMO] He could've
called to tell me himself.

227
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,541
Maybe he's still mad
at me about yesterday.

228
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,041
[RYO]
Sorry about all this.

229
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,583
Oh. You don't have
to apologize for him.

230
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,458
I only wish I had your
cell phone number on me.

231
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,750
I would have let you know
about this ahead of time.

232
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,791
You came all the way over
here to tell me Kairi

233
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,500
couldn't make it? I'm sorry.

234
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,958
Nah. I was coming to
this part of town anyway.

235
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,125
Don't worry about it.

236
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,000
[MOMO]
Kairi must be out of his mind.

237
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,875
His brother is so nice!

238
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,416
Comparing him to Sae
doesn't make any sense.

239
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,166
[SAE chuckles]

240
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,541
So what are you up to now?

241
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,083
[MOMO] Uh?

242
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,166
There's a company party I'm
heading to just down the street.

243
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,250
How 'bout you come along
with me as my special guest.

244
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,458
[phone ringing]

245
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,791
[KAIRI]
Hello?

246
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,291
[MORIKA] Kairi! I'm so
glad you picked up!

247
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,000
Look, I need a favor from you.

248
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,833
Morika?

249
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,375
[gasps] Oh wow.

250
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,625
Thanks Ryo.
But I don't think I belong here.

251
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,333
Don't be silly, Momo.

252
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,375
[MOMO]
Sorry.

253
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,541
Let's mingle.

254
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:37,083
[MOMO] I've never been
escorted like this before.

255
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,583
I have butterflies,
but it feels kinda nice.

256
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,625
[SAE]
Cheers!

257
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,875
Oh my gosh! Sae, what
are you doing here?!

258
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,750
Ha, ha. What do you mean?
I'm just enjoying the party.

259
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,750
You liar!

260
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,958
Why hello there.
I'm Sae Kashiwagi.

261
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,416
Momo and I are,
like, best friends.

262
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,791
[MOMO]
Best friends?

263
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,958
How could she say that
after what she's done!

264
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,125
And what's your name?

265
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,750
Or should I just call
you Mr. Gorgeous?

266
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,625
I'm Ryo Okayasu.

267
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,416
Uh. Okayasu?!!

268
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,458
Hey Ryo! When'd you get here?

269
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,750
I can't believe he
actually showed up!

270
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,291
[crowd chattering]

271
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,291
[MAN B] It is a huge
honor to meet you, sir.

272
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,625
[WOMAN B] I love your games!
I have every one.

273
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,750
[MAN C]
I can't wait for the new one.

274
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,333
I hear it's revolutionary.

275
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,958
Crazy. I had no idea that
he was such a popular guy.

276
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,500
It's too bad that's
Kairi's older brother.

277
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,750
[SAE sighs]

278
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,875
[MOMO] If you try to date him,
that would mean

279
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,208
you'd have to deal
with Kairi everyday,

280
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,833
and seeing that you can't
stand to be around him,

281
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,958
that makes your chances
look pretty slim, huh?

282
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,041
It's too bad really. You'd
probably make a cute couple.

283
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,750
He's obviously more
sophisticated than Kairi!

284
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,666
[SAE cries] Why do you
have to be so mean, Momo?!

285
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,083
[MOMO] Sae? Shed tears
over a man? No way.

286
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,166
She's just acting again.
I still got her. [laughs]

287
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,750
[MOMO] Sae should be happy.
After all, she has Toji.

288
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,583
[MOMO]
This garden is beautiful!

289
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,708
The flowers smell amazing.

290
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you sure it's all right
to sneak away like this?

291
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,958
Won't your fans be disappointed?

292
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,416
[RYO]
Forget about them.

293
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,875
Besides, I'm having more
fun spending time with you.

294
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,166
[MOMO]
Mm.

295
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:27,708
Ah. This is nice.
I feel so relaxed with you.

296
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,833
Of course, you remind me

297
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,833
of someone I loved
very dearly a long time ago.

298
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,291
[MOMO]
Uh?

299
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,958
[MOMO] That is a little
strange, I guess.

300
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,166
What kind of person was she?

301
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,000
[RYO]
She's no longer of this world.

302
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,375
[MOMO gasps]

303
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,125
I was certain that she
and I would share

304
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,625
the rest of our lives together.

305
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,958
[MOMO] I'm sorry.

306
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,375
The thing is, I'm happy.
It's as if I've been given

307
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,375
one last chance to
see my lover again.

308
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,333
[MOMO] You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

309
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,541
I can never forget her.

310
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,791
Because it's not like
we ever broke up.

311
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,541
I think that's the
reason why things

312
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,708
haven't worked
out with Morika.

313
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,625
I just need to get
used to the idea

314
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:13,208
that I can never love again.

315
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,875
Hey, Momo?

316
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,041
Would it be all right if
I held you for awhile?

317
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,375
[MOMO]
Uh!

318
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,916
Oh, no... I mean...

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,916
Please forgive me.
That was way over the line.

320
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,333
[MOMO]
You can, if you want.

321
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,875
[SAE]
Uh!

322
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,416
[MOMO] I can't believe
I said that. But just this once.

323
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,166
So he can hold onto his
memories one more time.

324
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,500
Ryo's at a party
inside this building.

325
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,708
Will you go in there

326
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,916
and tell him I'm out
here waiting for him?

327
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,041
What's in it for me?
Let me guess, nothing.

328
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,041
But you're the only
one I can rely on.

329
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,500
Come on. Pretty please?

330
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,541
Fine.

331
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,333
[MOMO] I feel like I'm
being held by a prince.

332
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,625
What kind of a woman was she,

333
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:09,208
to be loved by
such tender hands?

334
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:13,458
[MOMO]
Uh? Kairi!

335
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,250
This isn't what you think!
I swear!

336
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,125
Ryo. You son of a bitch!

337
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,208
[RYO grunts]

338
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,041
[RYO groans]

339
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,458
Stop it! You've got him all
wrong, Kairi. You don't--

340
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,875
I'm sick and tired of you trying
to steal my girlfriends

341
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,791
away from me. I'm not
gonna take it anymore!

342
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,250
Hold on. Sorry, Kairi.

343
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,541
I haven't considered
your feelings.

344
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,125
It's just that seeing her
brought back so many memories.

345
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,666
Memories? I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

346
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,291
Listen.

347
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,250
I don't think so.

348
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,416
Come with me.

349
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,666
[KAIRI]
Screw you!

350
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,625
Let's go.

351
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,875
[MOMO]
Uh...

352
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,291
[RYO]
Hmph.

353
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,750
[MOMO] Kairi, will you just
hold on for one second?

354
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,208
Didn't your brother explain
what that was all about?

355
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,625
He's--

356
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,958
Look, don't allow yourself
to fall for his advances.

357
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,083
In fact I don't want you
ever talking to him again.

358
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,416
If he ever approaches you again,
just walk away.

359
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,708
Keep at least thirty feet
away from him at all times.

360
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,250
Get your hands off me.

361
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,291
It's my business who
I choose to speak to.

362
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,875
Just because we're dating

363
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,083
does not mean you're allowed to
control every part of my life.

364
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,875
I'll admit that it was
wrong to let myself

365
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,458
get in a situation that could
easily be misunderstood.

366
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,958
I take full responsibility
for that, but what you saw

367
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,666
was innocent. Your
brother didn't want me,

368
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
he wanted to embrace
his dead girlfriend.

369
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,750
[KAIRI]
Huh?!

370
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,416
Besides, who are you to barge
in here and judge me?

371
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,375
I'm not the one who
stood me up for our date.

372
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,833
We had a date? No we didn't.

373
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,791
We set it up over the
phone yesterday.

374
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Have you already
forgotten?

375
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,375
Ryo. He must've
answered my phone

376
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,875
while I was in the shower
and pretended to be me.

377
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,083
You're crazy. Blaming him
for your own forgetfulness.

378
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,291
[KAIRI] I swear I didn't
know we had a date today.

379
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,958
Momo, Ryo is trying
to trick you.

380
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,500
Right. I bet you can't even
give me one good reason

381
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,250
why he'd do that. You don't
have the slightest clue

382
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,958
as to how your
brother really feels.

383
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,000
That's why you hate him.

384
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,833
Oh, come on.
Am I hearing you right?

385
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,125
You believe my brother,
who you just met, over me?

386
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,708
That's not the issue.
It's you who doesn't believe me!

387
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,083
I do believe in you Momo.
More than you know.

388
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,708
Then stop trying to
tell me what to do.

389
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,375
I can make those
decisions on my own.

390
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,375
And I would never even
consider getting involved

391
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,750
with your brother in that way.

392
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,791
You can say that all you want,
but it won't matter.

393
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,250
He always gets what he wants.

394
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,750
I've told you from the beginning
to stay away from him.

395
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,208
That he isn't to be trusted.
Why can't you understand that?

396
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,416
[MOMO]
Uh...

397
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,958
[KAIRI sighs]

398
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,625
Just Forget it.

399
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,000
[MOMO]
Uh.

400
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,041
[sighs]

401
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,250
[MOMO]
Why are we doing this?

402
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,750
I don't wanna fight
with you, Kairi.

403
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,833
You're the only man in my life.

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,666
[MOMO] If he can't understand,
then I'll have no other choice

405
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,375
but to tell him everything
his brother told me.

406
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,291
[MOMO]
Uh! Sae?

407
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,875
It's the truth.

408
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,166
Momo is an incredibly shallow
person who thinks that stealing

409
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,958
boyfriends from other girls
is just some kind of game.

410
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,625
She even stole my
boyfriend recently.

411
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,916
I always thought
she was my friend.

412
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,375
[MOMO] That liar! She's the
one who stole my boyfriend!

413
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,250
Listen, Sae.

414
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,750
Yes, love?

415
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,250
It's not polite to talk about
someone behind their back,

416
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,083
especially your friend.

417
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,250
[SAE]
Uh!

418
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,583
And as far as I can tell,

419
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,625
Momo's definitely
not that type of girl.

420
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
[SAE gasps]

421
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,458
Well, trust me,

422
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,916
I don't usually talk about
my friends behind their back.

423
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,458
You just seem like a nice guy,

424
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,083
and I wanted to warn you about
what she's done in the past.

425
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,333
Uh... Bye!

426
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,125
Somehow I get the feeling that
girl isn't really your friend.

427
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,583
She's my sworn enemy!

428
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,291
Thought so.

429
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,541
Uh.

430
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,833
[MOMO]
Ryo understands me so well.

431
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,041
He's definitely related
to Kairi in that respect.

432
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,083
[RYO]
Where's Kairi?

433
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,791
[MOMO]
He ran off upset.

434
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,916
I think I should tell him
the truth about your history

435
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,333
with him, and I wanted to
know how you felt about that.

436
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,875
I see. Do what you need.

437
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,458
All right then,
I'm gonna go tell him.

438
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,000
Uh, wait.

439
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,541
There's something that I would
really like for you to have.

440
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,875
But I...

441
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,666
[RYO]
It won't take long.

442

[MORIKA]
Kairi!

443
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,916
Morika. If it has anything to do

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,416
with my brother then
I'm not listening.

445
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
But I've looked all
around for Ryo,

446
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:32,916
and I can't find him anywhere.
He must be hiding from me.

447
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,125
Oh, no!

448
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,208

Here.

I hope this makes up for all
the trouble I've caused you.

Morika has a necklace just
like this, doesn't she?

457
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,666
She does. That's because I was
the one who gave it to her.

458
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:14,250
Momo. You're so cute.
It's such a shame

459
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,791
that Kairi doesn't
know how to treat a lady.

460

[MOMO] Oh no. This is bad.
I have to get outta here.

[MOMO]
This is amazing.

465
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,208
I've never felt as strongly for
someone as I do right now.

466
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,958
But something's wrong. He's not
acting like his usual self.
