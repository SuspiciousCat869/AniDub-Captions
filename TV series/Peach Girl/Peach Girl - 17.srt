1
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,375
That's fine. You can have
me any way you like,

2
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,583
as long as I get a fair
second chance with you.

3
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,583
[laughs] I do love
you, Momo. I do!

4
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,375
But I'm still second?

5
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,291
For now.

6
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,083
[MOMO]
I have a question.

7
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,166
Is there any way that you
can make the guy you like

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,958
forget about the girl he likes?

9
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:24,875
Let me think.

10
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,666
Uh... You could get a makeover?

11
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,333
Be more interesting.

12
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,125
What do you mean
by "interesting?"

13
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,875
Like, you could talk about
the things you have in common.

14
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,166
Yeah! Is there maybe a sport
that both of you can play?

15
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,625
[MOMO sighs]
You guys make it sound so easy.

16
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,500
I wish there was some
way to make Kairi

17
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,666
fall in love with me right away.

18
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,083
[BOY A]
Is that for real?

19
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,208
--[BOY B] Move over, let me see!
--[BOY C] She looks hot!

20
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,416
What are you guys looking at?

21
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
Oh no!

22
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,500
[TEACHER A]
I'm afraid your appearance

23
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,041
in this type of magazine puts
us in a difficult situation.

24
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,500
I just don't understand
what you were thinking!

25
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,041
Say something, Sae.

26
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,208
But It's not me. That's a model!

27
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,708
I swear! I mean, that's my
face, but it's not my body.

28
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,250
I never posed for
those pictures!

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,458
So, you mean...

30
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,416
[TEACHER C]
It's a composite photo?!

31
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,291
[SAE] Yes, but I know everyone
will believe it's me.

32
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:32,541
How could someone do this to me?
I'm just so embarrassed. [sobs]

33
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,833
[KAKO] Can you believe they
let Sae get away with this?

34
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,125
[RITSUKO]
It's not really her, is it?

35
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,458
[HIRO]
I've gotta get her number!

36
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,083
I guess those pictures
are real aren't they?

37
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,041
[MOMO]
Why would she do that?

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,375
[TEACHER D]
Pencils down. Time's up.

39
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,291
--[HIRO] I blew that one.
--[YUKI] Glad that's over.

40
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,666
[NAMI]
I hope I pass.

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,125
[MOMO]
Sae didn't come today.

42
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,583
I wonder if she's
feeling embarrassed

43
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,000
about those photos.

44
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,166
[KAIRI]
Hm. I don't really think Sae

45
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,333
would ever skip
school out of shame.

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,458
This isn't good. She could
fail if she keeps this up.

47
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,916
[KAIRI] What?! You're
going to go see Ryo?

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,208
[MOMO]
Mm. Yeah.

49
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,166
[KAIRI]
You really are too nice, Momo.

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,583
I mean, do you really care
about Sae that much?

51
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,333
Look, it's not that I care
about Sae "that much."

52
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,833
I'm just concerned.

53
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,958
You see, that's what I really
love about you, Momo!

54
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,958
[MOMO]
This is worth it.

55
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,916
Dear God, please let me keep
my relationship with Kairi.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,791
I'll never ask for
anything ever again.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,750
Oh, hi.

58
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,291
Toji?!

59
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,625
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,000
I have a few questions

61
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,500
I wanted to ask Kairi's
brother about Sae.

62
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,916
So do we.

63
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,000
Uh?!

64
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,208
Oh my gosh that's... that's Sae!

65
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,958
[RYO]
Wow, this is very nice.

66
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,291
You said you wanted
one like that before.

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,375
I heard These are pretty
expensive, aren't they?

68
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,625
[SAE] Nah. It's nothing
at all, I got a new job

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,416
so I have a little more
money to play with now.

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,208
Well In that case, thank you.

71
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,875
[SAE]
You're so welcome!

72
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,958
[SAE]
Oh!

73
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,666
I'm takin' you somewhere
special tonight.

74
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
Really, Ryo?

75
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,166
[MOMO] What do you
think you're doing, Sae!

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,666
Did you pose for that magazine

77
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,500
just so you can support
that worthless loser?!

78
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,166
"Support?" C'mon I got
a reputation to keep.

79
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,666
Don't be so dramatic. I did
this because I wanted to.

80
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,458
Sae, you don't want to get
involved with this creep,

81
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,375
trust me. He's going to use you

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,500
for everything you've
got and then leave!

83
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,708
[SAE]
You're crazy!

84
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,250
You don't know
what you're saying!

85
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,500
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,916
Why would you stand up
for someone like him?!

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,291
Because I love him!

88
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,750
[KAIRI]
Huh?

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,541
Uh?! What are you saying?

90
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,708
I can't believe you would
do something like this

91
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,250
while you're dating Toji.

92
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,416
Newsflash: We broke up.

93
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,625
Sorry to disappoint.

94
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,875
Shall we go?

95
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,333
Absolutely.

96
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,166
What the hell?

97
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,166
[MOMO]
So, do you think that Sae's

98
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,750
really in love
with your brother?

99
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,833
[KAIRI mumbles]

100
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
I mean, what's Toji gonna do?

101
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,041
I dunno. That's Toji's problem.

102
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,958
I'm so glad our tests are
finally over. And with summer

103
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,125
break coming up we'll have
more time for ourselves.

104
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,666
Wanna go back to
my place and play?

105
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,583
[MOMO gasps]

106
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
[KAIRI groans]

107
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,958
No!

108
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:29,666
Aw, why?! Just for a
little while? Come on.

109
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,208
[MOMO]
Whatever.

110
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,625
Like I don't know what going
to his house to "play" means.

111
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,958
That's fine.

112
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,416
You can have me
any way you like,

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,250
as long as I get a fair
second chance with you.

114
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,833
[MOMO] I guess I said
that at the time,

115
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,041
because I just wanted
him to choose me.

116
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,541
But what if all he
wants to do is "play?"

117
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,000
[KAIRI]
Uh?

118
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,166
[MOMO]
Huh?

119
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,750
Call me brilliant!
I have the best idea!

120
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,458
Let's go away together, like
we planned before, remember?

121
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,208
We could always go to the beach.

122
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,750
I mean after all, that is
the place where we first met.

123
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,208
Well?

124
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,583
[MOMO]
Uh?

125
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,625
[MOMO]
What if he's planning this trip

126
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,750
so I'll change my mind about
sleeping with him?

127
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,583
--[KAIRI]  Don't worry.
--[MOMO] Uh!

128
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,333
Look, I know what you're
thinking and you can trust me.

129
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,541
I'm not gonna ask you
to do anything like that

130
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,125
until you're ready.

131
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,333
Thank you.

132
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,416
[KAIRI] Let's create
some special memories.

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,875
Okay.

134
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,708
I know we're gonna
have a great time.

135
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,166
Me too.

136
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,333
[MOMO]
I can't believe I ever doubted

137
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:38,333
the way he feels about me.
I'm... I'm so happy.

138
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,000
[MOMO]
We're going on a trip together!

139
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,041
Should we stay at
an Inn or a hotel?

140
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,333
I wonder which one
he'd like more.

141
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,333
[MOMO gasps]

142
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,958
[KAIRI laughs]

143
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,583
Hey! Kai...

144
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,583
[MOMO]
Uh... Uh!

145
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,416
[MOMO]
I'm freaking out. What do I do?!

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,000
[KAIRI] It's too bad summer
vacation's coming up.

147
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,541
Why's that?

148
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,000
[KAIRI] Because I won't be able
to see you every day, Misao!

149
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,250
I know! We should go somewhere
together this summer!

150
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,583
Idiot. Don't you think you're
asking the wrong girl?

151
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,125
[MOMO] I told him I
understood how he felt,

152
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,375
and that I'd be patient.

153
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,666
[MOMO]
Why am I letting it get to me?

154
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,208
Why can't I stop being jealous?

155
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,375
I'm so sick of this.

156
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,416
[MOMO] I'm not okay with being
his second choice anymore.

157
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,791
I don't want him to act that
way with anyone but me!

158
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,750
I want him to love me more!

159
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,666
I want him to want me,
and only me.

160
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,375
[KAIRI]
Hey, Momo!

161
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
[KAIRI laughs]

162
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
[MOMO]
You're working?

163
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,375
[KAIRI]
Yeah. At the convenience store.

164
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,250
You should get a job there too,
so we can work together.

165
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,750
We can earn money for our trip
and if we're at the same place,

166
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
we'll get to see each
other every day!

167
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,416
What do you say?

168
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,708
[MOMO]
Thanks! Have a good day!

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,333
See ya next time!

170
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,166
[MOMO]
This is just what we needed.

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,791
I was starting to resent Kairi.

172
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,791
But I realized that jealousy
will get me nowhere.

173
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,458
Besides, if I become
more interesting to him,

174
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,041
he'll only want to
be with me, anyway.

175
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,583
Thanks! You guys
have a great day!

176
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,541
Good afternoon! Can we help y--

177
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,958
[BOTH]
Uh?!

178
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,708
Yeah, hi...

179
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,041
[SAE laughs]
Wow! Momo,

180
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
I cannot believe you're working
in a place like this!

181
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,125
I'm an impoverished student.
I can't help it.

182
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,625
You're a brave girl.
I could never bring myself

183
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,125
to work somewhere like
here for so little money.

184
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,500
Uh! Speaking of cheap,

185
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,041
how's your little modeling
career coming along?!

186
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,333
Well actually. I'm becoming
a film actress now, too.

187
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,458
You're acting?

188
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,333
Oh, yeah, Ryo got me the job.

189
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,458
I told him I was looking
for something part time,

190
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,791
and what does he do but
go out of his way to find

191
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,208
the ideal situation.

192
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,916
It's because he just
loves me so much.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,458
What am I doing?! I don't
have time to waste chatting!

194
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,875
Um, I'll take this.

195
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,041
Four ninety-five.

196
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,833
That loser got you this job?!

197
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,916
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,375
Of course it is!
It's a promo for a brand new

199
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,541
computer game
and I'm the lead.

200
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,625
Oh, are you jealous?

201
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,458
Thanks guys!

202
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,375
Keep the change!

203
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,541
It's a promo for
what kind of game?

204
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,416
Yikes.

205
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,625
[MOMO, KAIRI]
We're taking off now!

206
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,041
[BOSS]
See you tomorrow!

207
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,333
[KAIRI]
I'm thrashed.

208
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,125
[MOMO] Being on your
feet all day is hard work.

209
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,708
[CAMERAMAN] Okay Sae,
start running this way.

210
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,791
[SAE]
Got it!

211
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,750
[MOMO]
Sae?

212
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,916
I guess she is an actress now.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,291
That's the take!
Great work today, Sae!

214
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,541
Thanks, love!

215
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,000
You're really good at this.

216
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,125
I think I've seen
that guy before!

217
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,375
You have?

218
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,375
Looks like we're doing
the next scene together.

219
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,958
I'm looking forward to it.

220
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,750
Pokki Suzuki!
I remember him now!

221
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,750
So who is he?

222
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,666
Ready to head to
our next location?

223
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,916
[SAE]
You bet!

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,625
This is bad. She's not
shooting a video game.

225
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,083
[MOMO]
Huh?

226
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,041
[SAE humming]

227
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,833
[DIRECTOR] You seem like
you're in a good mood!

228
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,375
Oh yes I am. I really want
to do a good job you see.

229
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,500
[POKKI]
'Cause why?

230
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,375
Because my boyfriend
got me this job,

231
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,166
and I want him to
be proud of me.

232
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,541
[SAE]
Uh?

233
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,791
This is Sae!

234
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
Sae listen, it's important.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,125
Hey there, Momo.

236
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,458
[MOMO]
Get out of the car!

237
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,000
[SAE]
What?

238
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,208
Look, those guys in the car,
they're in the porn industry.

239
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,708
Kairi knows them...

240
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,875
We saw you filming and he
recognized the blond guy.

241
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,125
Sae, you're about
to be a porn star!

242
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:10,041
[SAE laughs]
Momo, you're ridiculous!

243
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,291
It really is tragic to hear
the depths of your jealousy.

244
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,791
Maybe you should just get
your own acting career.

245
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,208
Making porn is not acting!

246
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,916
[SAE] You're disgusting!
What kind of proof do you have?!

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,166
Well, Kairi is a
porno connoisseur,

248
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,791
if he says he recognizes them,
that's proof enough. I promise.

249
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,250
[SAE gasps]

250
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,500
[MOMO] He just saw the guy
that's with you in a movie.

251
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,041
You need to get out
of there right now!

Here we are!

00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,291
Time to get this show started!

256
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,416
[VOICEMAIL OPERATOR] The person
you are trying to reach

257
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,666
is unavailable or traveled
outside the area...

258

Oh great. Out of area.

259

[MOMO]
Uh?

260
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,916
She's obviously not gonna listen
to you. So why waste your time?

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,916
So, she's just gonna have to
learn the hard way, I guess.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,458
No. I can't do that.

263
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,083
I'll just ask your loser
brother where she is.

264

Uh... What if... Uh. Hey!

What's going on? This is
supposed to be a video game!

Just who told you that lie?

269
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,375
This is not the kind of acting
I wanted to do! I'm leaving!

[DIRECTOR]
Sorry. It's too late.

271
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,333
You signed a contract.

272
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,458
Ryo misunderstood your terms!

273
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,833

to get me to do a porno movie!

Well yeah, did I forget
to tell you that?

[SAE]
What?

283
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,375
[RYO]
I thought that was something

284
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,125
you were interested in.

285
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,833
Sorry, I guess I must
have misunderstood you.

286

So, don't do it if
you don't want to.

that you'd like to say

Ryo...

351
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,666
When you told me you loved
me, did you mean it

352
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,125
or was it just a lie?

353
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,166
Or were you just using me?

I trusted you.

[RYO]
I'm not a very nice person, Sae.

356
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,750
I'm sorry. It's just, you can
be so naïve sometimes.

357
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,750
I was trying to open
your eyes a little bit,

Oh well. Take care
of yourself, okay?

that we can work it out!

There's no working
it out with him!

again and again!

Oh, Sae.

[KAIRI] Should we have kept Sae
from chasin' after that jerk?

370

There was no one
who could stop her.

371

She's in love and there's
nothing that Ryo can do

372
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,875
that her heart won't make
up an excuse for.

Maybe I'm being paranoid, but...

I keep hoping that if we spend
enough time together

379
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,125
he'll eventually fall
in love with me, too.

What if I'm wasting my time?

you've done for me, and...

[MOMO, KAIRI]
Uh...

391
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,583
[SAE] I'm sorry for the way I've
treated you in the past, Momo.

392
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,125
I've been a jerk. I've given you
every reason never to speak to

393
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,625
me again, and you still went
out of your way to rescue me.

394

I hope someday
you'll forgive me.

I'm very grateful
to both of you.

I think Hell just
had a snowstorm.

I guess I can believe her.

sincere, at least.

to you about something.

409
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,500
[MISAO]
Well, I just saw Momo and Sae

410
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,666
walking outside together.
Is everything alright out there?

411
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,833
Oh, yeah! It's totally fine!

412
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,208
But you gotta hear
the whole story, though!

413
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,500
Sae's apparently had
a huge change of heart,

414
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,666
and even came in here
to buy us ice cream!

415
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,708
She apologized for everything!

416
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,375
Head down, teary eyes,
the works! I guess

417
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,666
it took a jerk like Ryo to make
her want to be a good person.

418
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,666
I guess it's like fightin'
fire with fire, ya know?

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,666
[MISAO]
Yeah. That's wonderful news!

420
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,958

change tomorrow though.

00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,250
You probably thought I was
really stupid, didn't you Momo?

427
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,541
Well, maybe.

428
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
It's okay. He made
such a fool of me,

429
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,208
even I think so, but still...

430
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,583
It's the first time I can say
I've really been in love.

431
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,708
I just kept thinking that if I
stayed around for one more day,

432
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,875
I might be able to
help him, ya know?

433
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,375
What?

434
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,958
Nothing. You just don't sound
like the Sae that I know.

435
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,125
Well, I suppose love
can change everyone.

436
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,541
I mean, I never would have
realized how much I was hurting

437
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,375
you before this, you
must've really felt betrayed.

438
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,500
I did a lot of terrible
things to you Momo.

439
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,333
I want you to know
that I'm not proud of that.

440
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,291
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,250
Thank you, Sae.

442
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,625
[KAIRI]
On a diet?!

443
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,125
What good is it
to go on a diet

444
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,541
if all it's gonna do is
make you anemic?

445
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,375
I know. But men like tiny
girls like Momo and Sae.

446
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,583
I don't want to be
single forever.

447
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,250
You won't be. Not all men
like those kind of girls.

448
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,166
Beautiful women come
in all different sizes.

449

Thanks, that's sweet.

450

Look, stay here until
you're feeling better.

451
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,916
I'll be back to check on you.

452
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,208
And no more dieting
for you. Promise me.

453
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,916

Uh!

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,250
I can explain.

to fight for you.

it be worth it?
