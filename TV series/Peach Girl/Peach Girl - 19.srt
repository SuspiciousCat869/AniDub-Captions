1
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,958
Today's my last day.
I don't work here anymore.

2
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,916
I see.

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,375
So what are you going
to do over summer break?

4
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,791
[KAIRI]
Well, as of right now,

5
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,708
I plan to thoroughly think
things over while walking.

6
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,666
[MOMO]
While walking?

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,000
[KAIRI]
Oh, yeah.

8
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,666
They say you do your best
thinking while walking.

9
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,541
I figure I'll walk
as far as I can

10
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,958
and see what I can
discover about myself.

11
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,416
Well, I'm off. Take care!

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,916
Happy walking!

13
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,958
[MOMO] I need to do
some discovering as well.

14
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,541
I need to become stronger.

15
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,208
That way, I'll be able to handle

16
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,041
whatever decision
he finally makes.

17
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,750
Good morning, ma'am.

18
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,416
[screams]

19
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:51,000
[phone rings]

20
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,000
[RYO]
What the hell's your problem?

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,166
Where do you get off leaving

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
a note saying you're
going on a trip,

23
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,833
but don't say where?
Mom is worried sick over this!

24
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,416
[KAIRI]
What, like you give a crap?

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,541
Just tell mom not to worry.
I'll be home in a few weeks.

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
[BOTH snicker]

27
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,125
This is a lot further
than I expected it to be.

28
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,291
[GUY A]
Comin' through!

29
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,958
[KAIRI groaning]

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,333
Are you okay, man?

31
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,333
You should pay attention
to where you're walkin', dude.

32
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,583
[KAIRI groans]
You son of a... Hey!

33
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,500
--[GUY A] Loser!
--[GUY B] Dork!

34
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,083
Keep on running, you cowards!

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,166
So the manager mentioned
that Kairi worked

36
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,416
here right before I was hired.
Do you know why he quit?

37
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,916
[SAE] Kairi and I have decided
to keep our distance right now.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,625
He had another girl that he
was crushing on besides me,

39
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,125
but when he made his move, she
slammed the door in his face.

40
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,916
Now, with his ego
bloody and bashed,

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,416
he's taken a trip to do
some serious thinking.

42
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,583
Kairi said that until he
gets his own feelings

43
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,083
in check, he can't date me.

44
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,916
But if he wants to
give me another shot,

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,416
then on the last
day of summer break

46
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,041
we may go on a daytrip together.

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,833
I gave him a ticket
and everything.

48
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,958
I'm starting to wonder
if he'll even show up.

49
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,583
[MOMO] Sae! Will you
knock it off already?!

50
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,375
I'm just doing my job!
Spreading the truth!

51
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,875
[KAIRI]
That was delicious!

52
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,041
[slurping]

53
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,833
She'll roll over in
her grave for this,

54
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,333
but these noodles are
better than grandma's.

55
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:51,125
[KAIRI] That must be the chef.
Bet he runs a tight ship.

56
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,958
That'll be five hundred yen.

57
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,916
[KAIRI]
Okay.

58
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,708
[KAIRI]
My wallet... It's gone!

59
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
[KAIRI]
Those punks!

60
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh, no. Now what am I gonna do?

61
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,791
[WAITRESS]
Oh.

62
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
--[foot steps]
--[KAIRI] Uh?

63
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,250
[CHEF grunts]

64
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,958
[KAIRI]
Uh!

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,333
That poor thing.

66
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,916
Having this wallet stolen
like that, it's so awful.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,583
The boy can only blame himself.

68
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
There's no reason to let
him eat without paying.

69
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,000
You just had to come
out with that knife

70
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,208
and scare him to death.

71
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm surprised he didn't
faint right there.

72
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,166
If anything, I should
be the one apologizing.

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,958
[WAITRESS]
Thanks for your help.

74
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,750
[door opens]

75
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,166
[WAITRESS]
You're a very hard worker.

76
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,625
Oh. Thank you.

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,791
My husband and I are about
to close up for the night.

78
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,416
Do you need a ride somewhere?

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
No, I can't go home quite yet.

80
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,708
I still have some things
that I need to figure out.

81
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,000
Is there something
that's troubling you?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,416
Well, there's this
girl back home

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,250
and we've agreed to
keep our distance for now.

84
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,583
Before we started dating,

85
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,458
there was someone else
I was madly in love with.

86
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,291
Unfortunately, there's
no future with her,

87
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,125
so all I can do is
walk away from it.

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,333
But at the same time,

89
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,166
I can't just act like it
meant nothing to me

90
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,583
and start dating
this other girl.

91
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,041
And how do you
feel about the girl

92
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,708
you've become involved with now?

93
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,333
I'm crazy about her.

94
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,541
Now if Misao hadn't let...
I mean,

95
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,875
if the girl who turned me down
hadn't been in the picture,

96
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,583
I'm pretty certain this new girl
would be the love of my life.

97
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,000
[WAITRESS] It's getting late.
Why don't you stay here tonight?

98
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,708
If you want, you can work here
with us for a few weeks.

99
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,750
You are gonna need some extra
money in order to get home,

100
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,625
don't you think?

101
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,208
Really? That would be awesome!

102
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,166
[door opens]

103
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,708
[SAE]
Momo!

104
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,208
[MOMO] Shouldn't you
be in summer school?

105
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,125
Class doesn't start
till noon. Where's Toji?

106
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,791
He's on his break right now.
Why, do you need something?

107
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,416
No, not really.
I'm gonna go say hi!

108
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,083
Momo. You mind getting some
more soda from the back?

109
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,541
Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,750
[SAE]
Congratulations!

111
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,833
I guess that means you're
officially free of me now.

112
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,791
[TOJI]
And this is everything?

113
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,833
[SAE] Yup. I've erased
everything about

114
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,416
Momo and Jigoro from my cell
phone and my computer.

--It's gone forever.
--[sighs]

116
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,375
I'm sorry, Toji.

117
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,541
I understand if you hate
me for ruining your life.

118
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,041
I have to admit,
I never thought I'd hear

119
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,625
those three words
come out of your mouth.

120
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,958
[MOMO]
Neither did I.

121
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,125
Over the last few days
I've come to realize

122
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,125
that if I hadn't of threatened
to release those photos

123
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,750
of Momo and Jigoro to the media,

124
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,125
you never would have
split up with Momo.

125
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,750
And the only reason you started
dating me was to make sure

126
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,500
I couldn't do anything
bad to her, right?

127
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,083
--To keep an eye on me.
--[gasps]

128
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,416
To think that you put up with
my games all that time,

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,458
just to protect the girl you
were forced to give away.

130
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,708
Be honest, Toji. Are you
still in love with Momo?

131
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,791
[TOJI] Hm. I have to
get back to work, Sae.

132
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,416
So, how's it going with
you and Kairi's brother?

133
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
Still hitting it off?

134
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,958
It's going well.
Thanks for asking.

Although, Ryo's been
busy with work lately,

136
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,416
so I haven't seem him much.

137
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,958
I really don't get what
you're looking for in a guy,

138
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,375
and I honestly don't know
what you see in him, but,

139
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,583
since you've started dating
him you've turned into a really

140
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,625
sweet person and I'd really like
to see more of that side of you.

What you said the other night.
It really affected me.

You said that if...
if you want to be loved

you have to just come
out and tell the person.

00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,500
And I think you hit the
nail right on the head.

158
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:37,000
Truth is, I never told Ryo
how I felt. I was too afraid.

159
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,416
Uh.

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,166
I want you to know your
confession made me very happy.

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,708
It's given me the confidence
to finally tell Ryo the truth.

162
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,916
[MISAO] I have to
lay it all on the line,

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,791
and not be afraid
of the results.

164
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,000
[KAIRI]
Misao.

165
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,458
[MOMO] You used a photo of me
and Jigoro to blackmail Toji?

166
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,708
If I had gone through with it,

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,125
you'd have been
scarred for life.

168
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,583
And to protect you,
Toji agreed to be with me.

169
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,833
You have no idea how lucky
you are to have som--

170
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,875
Shut up.

171
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,500
But Momo I...

172
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,291
Get out of here. I can't bear
to look at you right now.

173
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,791
[MOMO] I had no idea that
had happened. No idea at all.

174
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,208
This whole time I've thought I
was the only one who got hurt.

175
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,750
But that's obviously
not the case.

176
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,166
[MOMO]
That day.

177
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,625
[MOMO]
My gosh.

178
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,375
[MOMO] Did he break up with me
because he loved me too much?

179
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,375
I think I'm getting sick.

180
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,666
[CHEF]
Hey.

181
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,250
What is this?

182
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,375
Have you heard of
the group called

183
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,500
the National Noodles
Fan Organization?

184
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,583
Every year they pick the
best buckwheat noodles

185
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,458
in the country and
award the chef a prize.

186
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,375
Woah! You won an award
for these? Can I try 'em?

187
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,750
--[CHEF] Mm-hm.
--Thank you sir.

188
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,291
I can't believe I'm about to eat
the best noodles in the country.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,916
[CHEF]
What do you think?

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,750
--Uh...
--They good?

191
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
They're really awful.

192
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,000
[CHEF chuckles]
Good answer.

193
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,416
They're the cheapest noodles
I could find at the market.

194
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,958
Ah! That's not fair!

195
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,708
[CHEF] I never said
anything about these noodles

196
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,541
winning an award. I merely
said that the award existed.

197
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,625
You just jumped
to that conclusion. Hm.

198
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,791
So, I guess I'll
see you tomorrow.

199
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,875
--[MOMO]  Toji.
--[TOJI] Hm?

200
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,208
I just want to say thanks.

201
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,958
I overheard your conversation
earlier with Sae.

202
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
[TOJI] I'm sorry for all
the nasty things I did

203
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,958
when we were breaking up.

204
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,666
I acted like a spoiled
child when in reality,

205
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,666
you and I probably could
have worked it out.

206
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,375
You're wrong. I'm here
thanks to your generosity.

207
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,791
If that photo had
gotten around,

208
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,625
I would have had to
move away from here.

209
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,708
The fact that I can still
live a normal life here

210
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,583
is all thanks to you, Toji.

211
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,375
And I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

212
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,041
[fireworks]

213
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,750
[MOMO]
Are those fireworks?

214
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,458
I almost forgot. Tonight's
the big fireworks show.

215
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,500
Would you like to go check
it out? Just you and me?

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,875
[CHEF] I merely said
that the award existed.

217
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,333
You just jumped
to that conclusion.

218
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,291
I just don't get it. So what
if I jumped to the conclusion

219
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,833
that they were special.

220
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh wait. Misao.

221
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course.

222
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,375
[groaning]

223
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,416
[WAITRESS]
We must hurry.

224
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,291
I love you...

225
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,375
...Momo.

226
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,250
--What was that?
--Huh? What'd you say?

227
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,833
Um...

228
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,708
[BOTH gasp]

229
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,625
That's so beautiful!

230
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,708
It's hard to believe it's only
been a year since we were here.

231
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah.

232
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,208
[MOMO] Summer break had just
begun when we started dating.

233
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,083
Just holding his hand back then
would get my heart racing.

234
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,416
I remember not paying much
attention to the fireworks

235
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,666
because I couldn't
take my eyes off Toji.

236
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,166
[TOJI]
Momo.

237
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,291
What will happen if
Kairi doesn't show up

238
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,041
to meet you on the
day he promised?

239
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,041
I don't know. I guess
I'll have no other choice

240
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
but to move on with my life.

241
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,541
Do you really think you'll
be able to forget him?

242
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,083
What other choice
will I have, huh?

243
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,083
Well, I hope things
work out with you two,

244
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,666
but if for some
reason they don't,

245
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,541
will you agree to give
me another shot?

246
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,750
Sorry. What was that?

247
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,541
I couldn't hear what you
said over all the noise.

248
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,791
Oh. It's nothing. Never mind.

249
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,041
[MOMO] I don't know why
I pretended not to hear him.

250
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,250
[TOJI] Will you agree
to give me another shot?

251
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,666
He has a advanced case
of acute pneumonia.

252
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,375
We'll keep him for a few days
until his condition improves.

253
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,583
I love you... Momo.

254
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,916
[SAE]
I saw you!

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,708
--[MOMO grunts]
--[SAE laughs]

256
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,041
You and Toji were hamming
it up at the fireworks show

257
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,666
last night together,
you big fat cheater!

258
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,208
[MOMO]
Sae!!

259
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,916
I thought I told you I never
want to see your face again!

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,333
Do I need to repeat myself?

261
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,208
The only thing
I remember you saying

262
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
is that Kairi is your
one and only true love.

263
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,333
Or I guess it's the old

264
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,000
"a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush",

265
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,791
especially since Toji
was your first.

266
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,208
Maybe you were considering
giving him another chance?

267
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,166
--[MOMO] No!
--[SAE screams]

268
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,708
Please. Get lost.

269
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,666
[SAE] You should feel lucky
that you're the only guy

270
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,583
I let manhandle me like that!

271
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,208
[TOJI]
Any word from Kairi?

272
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,416
[MOMO]
Uh?

273
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,291
You've been staring
at your phone all day.

274
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,666
I know.

275
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,208
I don't get it. Why torture
yourself? Just call him.

276
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,291
Because I can't!

277
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,500
We agreed to keep our distance,

278
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,000
and that means
no contact at all!

279
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,291
Besides, I made the decision to

280
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,833
be patient and wait
for his answer.

281
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,791
If I call him then he'll
think I'm crowding him

282
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,083
and being obsessive,

283
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,083
and that's the last thing
I want him to think!

284
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,875
[laughs] Then chill out. Don't
get yourself all worked up.

285
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,791
You get so worried over stuff
that's out of your control.

286
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,083
No I don't. Do you really
think I'm like that?

287
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,541
[TOJI]
Oh, please!

288
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,416
Anyone who threatens
to jump from a window

289
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,416
if I don't listen to her
is a bit high strung.

290
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,541
Wouldn't you say?

291
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,041
[MOMO]
Uh...

292
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,041
She has no reason to lie...

293
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,125
And then there
was the time when...

294
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,166
I'm not listening!

295
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,708
--And...
--Oh, Shut your mouth, Toji!

296
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,708
That's ancient history!

297
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,125
Aw, come on!

298
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,000
I've got a hundred more
stories where that came from!

299
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,166
Sure, you say that about me,
but what about you, Mr. Perfect?

300
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,375
What about me?

301
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,958
[BOTH laugh]

302
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,875
You haven't changed
one bit, Momo.

303
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,958
[MOMO]
My heart is aching.

304
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,666
Why am I having such a
difficult time breathing?

305
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,416
We didn't break up because
we hated each other.

306
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,666
What should I do? I can't stop
this desire to be with Toji.

307
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,458
Where are you Kairi?

308
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,125
I know I said I would
wait for you,

309
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,750
but I'm starting feel swept away
again, and it frightens me.

310
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,833
I don't know if I can resist it.

311
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,750
Toji was looking out
for me the whole time.

312
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,500
He sacrificed himself for me.

313
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,333
Why haven't you called, Kairi?

314
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,416
I need to know what
you're thinking.

315
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,458
I hope you get in touch with
me before it's too late.

316
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,416
[CHEF]
Morning!

317
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,625
Hey!

318
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
[CHEF] You look a lot
better than before.

319
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,791
I'm really loving this
jigsaw puzzle you gave me.

320
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,916
[KAIRI]
What? Uh!

321
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,666
I only have one piece left!

322
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
[CHEF] Oh yeah.
I never could find that piece.

323
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
This was such a waste of time!

324
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,875
I find it quite appropriate that
one piece is missing for you.

325
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,583
You know with your
wallet being stolen

326
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,375
and getting pneumonia in
the middle of the summer.

327
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,500
I really thought I was
gonna die on that beach.

328
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,250
I couldn't breathe and
the pain was so unbearable.

329
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,875
In a way, it kinda
cleared my head

330
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,125
and let me see how
I really feel.

331
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,625
When I was laying there,
thinking I was about to die,

332
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,875
I finally understood who it
is I really want to be with.

333
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,375
Ah. You must mean Momo.

334
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,791
What? How the hell
do you know that?!

335
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,250
How the hell do you think...?

336
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,458
You've been mumbling her
name for the past two weeks.

337
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,791
You know, I finally figured out
what you were trying to teach me

338
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,750
with the whole award
winning noodle thing.

339
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,125
I'd become so enamored

340
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,333
with this unrealistic
dream of being with Misao,

341
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,041
and caused Momo a lot of
heartache in the process.

342
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,000
It makes me wonder if we could
really start over again.

343
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,416
[CHEF] Every person's
life is like a jigsaw puzzle

344
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,791
that's one piece
away from completion.

345
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,166
[KAIRI]
Huh?

346
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,541
We're always looking for the
person that holds that

347
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,750
missing piece, to make
our lives feel complete.

348
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,166
[MOMO]
I'll be okay.

349
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,583
I just need to stay strong,

350
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,541
and not allow myself to
be swept up in the moment.

351
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,083
[MOMO]
But it's so hard to wait

352
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,500
when I haven't heard
from Kairi in so long.

353
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,750
If I had just one glimmer
of hope to hang on to,

354
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,291
that's all I would need.

355
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,333
[phone rings]

356
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,041
Is that him?

357
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,041
Yes, it is. I guess he
hasn't forgotten about me!

358
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,708
[KAIRI] Momo, sorry I
haven't written in so long.

359
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,750
I've been working at a noodle
shop for the past few weeks.

360
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,666
I'll be here for the rest
of the summer so I can

361
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,625
save up some money
for our big trip.

362
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,958
I have so much
to tell you about.

363
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,041
I can't wait to see you.

364
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,666
[MOMO]
I'm such a hopeless romantic.

365
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,250
All it takes is a quick
text message from Kairi,

366
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,125
and I'm on cloud nine!

367
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,000
[MOMO] I can do it!
With that message,

368
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,291
I know I can wait for him

369
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,208
without any
temptation to wander.

370
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,791
It's true! I really am
in love with Kairi!

371
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,958
[STORE MANAGER]
Good work, Momo.

372
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,083
You'll always have
a job here with us.

373
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,375
I may take you up on that.

374
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,166
--[MOMO] Uh...
--[TOJI] Uh!

375
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,625
It was a fun summer.

376
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,083
Yes, it was.

377
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,000
What time are you supposed
to meet up with Kairi today?

378
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,875
At twelve o'clock. I told him
that I'd wait five minutes,

379
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,041
and if he didn't show,
I'd give up on him.

380
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,458
You don't need to worry.

381
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,791
No matter what happens,
I know you'll find happiness.

382
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,416
Thanks, Toji.

383
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,208
Well, I guess
I'll see you later.

384
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,583
Yeah.

385
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,583
[MOMO] Toji. I'm so grateful
for having you as a friend.

386
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:19,125
More than words can describe.
Thanks for everything.

387
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,541
Here's what you've earned in
the time you've worked for us.

388
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,833
We can't thank you enough.

389
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,833
Uh! This is way too much!

390
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,333
We put in a little extra for ya.

391
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,208
I couldn't have found two nicer
people to work for this summer.

392
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,333
Thanks to you I finally got
my heart all straightened out.

393
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,791
Maybe next summer I'll
come out this way again.

394
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,250
[WAITRESS]
Take care!

395
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,666
Hang in there, kid!

396
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,291
[KAIRI]
Will do!

397
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,250
[phone rings]

398
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,125
Hello? Mi-Misao?

399
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
Hi Ryo, Sorry to
call you at work.

400
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,083
I'd like to see you,
if it's not too much trouble.

401
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,083
[MOMO]
I'm almost there.

402
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,791
[laughs]

403
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,750
[MOMO] Just a little while
longer until I see my love!

404
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,500
[MOMO] What happened
to our big reunion?

405
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,333
I thought we would
be together again!

406
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,041
I waited for you, Kairi.

407
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,791
I trusted what you said and I
waited patiently, but for what?

408
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,666
Next time on Peach Girl...
One Stormy Night.
