I'm sorry, but Toji, he...

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,791
...said he doesn't really
like girls with tan skin.

And that's when

00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,625
I started buying sun
block by the caseload.

168

But now I can get
as tan as I want to...

you talking about, Momo?

this summer?

stay out of the sun, huh?

seem to be enjoying high school.

was that he liked

good sense of humor.

do with my secret?

understand why I was so angry.

I wanted him to comfort me and
tell me things would be okay.

all the races,

she'll get more attention,

early in the morning,
