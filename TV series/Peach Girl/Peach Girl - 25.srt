1
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,791
[MOMO] Thank you.

2
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,916
[TOJI] Let's have some fun.

3
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,000
[SAE] There they go.

4
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,458
Looks like our final
shakeup had no effect...

5
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,916
I guess this means
Toji's the winner.

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,458
[SAE] Well that sucks.

7
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,000
I was really looking forward
to a perfect storybook ending.

8
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,458
Oh! I know!

9
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,833
Kairi, do you
still have my cellphone?

10
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,541
Yeah, I do. What's up?

11
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,916
I want it back
so I can call Momo

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,958
and tell her that
we saw everything.

13
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,250
Forget it.

14
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,416
What's with you today?

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
After all you've been through,

16
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,958
you're really
just gonna let them go,

17
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,791
cooing like deluded love birds?

18
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,666
At least give them one last kick
in the teeth before they go!

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,541
If I know Momo,
she'll come back from the trip

20
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,208
pissed at Toji and
looking for someone else.

21
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,250
[KAIRI] I don't want to do that.

22
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,416
Why don't you?

23
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,916
She dumped you to
go out with another guy,

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,291
so you have every right in
the world to be mean to her.

25
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,166
[SAE] Wait!
Where are you going?!

26
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,208
He's gonna confront them!

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,625
[SAE] Kairi!

28
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,916
I'm really sorry
I was so late this morning.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,625
We might not be able to see
everything we wanted to.

30
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,791
It's okay.
We still have half the day left.

31
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,458
[MOMO] I can't believe
he's able to sit next to me

32
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,750
as if nothing happened
without asking me

33
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,541
why I was so late.

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,750
The last thing I'd need to
be is a disappointment to him.

35
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,000
Both Kairi and Toji
love you very much, Momo,

36
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,333
and I think what they
want more than anything

37
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,166
is to see you happy.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,583
[MOMO]
I know what Misao was saying,

39
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,750
but is it really all right
for me to hurt Kairi

40
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,125
and then turn around and
be happy with someone else?

41
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,666
Will I be able to
forgive myself for that?

42
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,875
Aren't you going after Momo?

43
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,208
This train's going
in the wrong way!

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,916
[KAIRI] I'm going to Shiranami.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,083
[SAE] What for?

46
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,750
[KAIRI] I don't know. A funeral?

47
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,833
Huh?

48
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,333
You're gonna kill yourself?

49
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,708
Of course not.

50
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,541
I want to put all my feelings
for Momo in a bottle

51
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,625
and throw them out to sea.

52
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
I have so much pent up emotion

53
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,666
I need to get rid of
before I lose my mind.

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,041
Plus, I hope
this will help speed up

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,083
the recovery process.

56
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,166
Well enough about me.

57
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,666
How did you get over
breaking up with Ryo?

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,791
You wanna know?

59
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,291
I'm not like guys
where they feel like

60
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,583
they have to repress their
anguish and push it deep inside.

61
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,166
That just makes it worse.

62
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,416
I prefer to allow myself to get
as depressed as I possibly can.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,291
Then when it's over,
I feel better.

64
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,666
That's interesting...

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,125
So by pushing yourself
into such a deep depression,

66
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,250
it cleanses you.

67
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,708
I know it works for me.

68
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,541
You did the best
you could, Kairi.

69
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,750
You really love her, don't you?

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm glad we did this.

71
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,708
It would have been nice if the
weather had worked out better,

72
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,000
but oh well.

73
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,625
[TOJI] Are you tired?

74
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,791
You've been acting kind of weird

75
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,291
ever since we
got off the train.

76
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,291
Aren't you having any fun?

77
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,875
I don't know. I feel like I
shouldn't be enjoying myself.

78
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,166
What do you mean?

79
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,583
Did something happen to you?

80
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,125
I guess so.

81
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,083
[KAIRI] Damn you, Toji!

82
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,250
You smug bastard!

83
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,125
Your little trip
isn't fooling anyone!

84
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,041
I can see what you're after,
you sick pervert!

85
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,958
If you don't take care
of Momo, I'll kill you!

86
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,500
And if you don't
believe that, just try me!

87
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,791
[MOMO] Dear Kairi...

88
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,875
I made you a new
cell phone case.

89
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,083
Hope you like it! Momo

90
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,000
[KAIRI] Why, Momo?

91
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,250
Why wasn't I good enough?

92
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,958
[quiet sobbing]

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,291
So Kairi was in Shiranami
with us the whole time?

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,875
[MOMO] I'm just angry
with myself over this.

95
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,708
Without knowing the whole truth,
I really hurt Kairi's feelings

96
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,875
when he probably
didn't deserve it.

97
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,500
I feel guilty about having fun

98
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
when he's miserable
because of me.

99
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,750
[TOJI] Are you thinking that
if you hurt Kairi's feelings

100
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,791
then karma will
eventually catch up to you?

101
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
[MOMO] Maybe.

102
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,291
I just can't stand the idea
that I'm so happy and he's not.

103
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,458
You think he'd be happy
seeing you down on yourself

104
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,166
when you could be
having a good time?

105
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,166
I have to admit
that I was shocked

106
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,166
when you started dating Kairi.

107
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
I guess I just
didn't see it coming.

108
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,416
The only thing
that would have made me

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,583
even more unhappy
is if you'd been alone,

110
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,333
so I was glad you had someone,
even if it was Kairi.

111
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,791
[TOJI] And I think Kairi
would feel the same way.

112
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,541
I also think you're afraid
of hurting people

113
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,500
like Sae has done so many times.

114
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,041
That just shows
how sensitive you are

115
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,333
to other people's feelings,
which I love.

116
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,083
Let's take Sae, for example.

117
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,041
Do you hate her for
what she's done to you?

118
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,000
Would it bother you if
she was having a good time?

119
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,541
Absolutely not!

120
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,041
Sure, it bothers me
when she gets me all worked up,

121
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,750
but I certainly
don't hate her for it.

122
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,416
I mean she's still my friend.

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,375
[TOJI] That's my point.

124
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,958
All wounds eventually heal,

125
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,125
and often they make
the bond even stronger.

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,833
[gasps]

127
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,208
[SAE] You feeling better now?

128
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,333
[MOMO]
It's really coming down now.

129
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,750
[TOJI] The weatherman
said that a typhoon

130
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,083
was supposed to hit us...

131
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,583
What do you want to do?

132
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,291
It's getting late so we could
always start to head back.

133
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,750
Would you prefer it
if we headed home?

134
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,291
I'd like to spend
a little more time with you.

135
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,250
[SAE] This wind is awful!

136
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,458
I wonder if the trains
are still running.

137
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,666
[KAIRI] Sae, why don't you
head on back without me.

138
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,041
I'm gonna hang out
here a little longer.

139
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,666
With a typhoon blowing in?

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,583
What happens if you
can't get back?

141
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,750
It's a long weekend.
I got time.

142
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,666
Take care. See you Tuesday.

143
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,708
Kairi! Hold on a sec!

144
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,666
Can I use your phone?

145
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,833
The batteries died on mine
and my parents will have a fit

146
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,208
if I don't call and
let them know where I am.

147
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,250
Fine. Here.

148
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,625
Thank you!

149
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,666
[KAIRI] Oh crap!

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,750
Where's my cell phone case?
I can't find it!

151
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,958
What? You mean the one
Momo made for you?

152
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,541
I thought you
threw it in the ocean.

153
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,875
Then you thought wrong!

154
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,041
Well so what?

155
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,208
You were just
gonna throw it out.

156
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,625
No I wasn't!

157
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,291
I'm gonna go look for it!

158
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
He just can't seem to let go.

159
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,083
How about if
I made us some tea?

160
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,416
Sounds good.

161
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,500
[KAIRI]
Where is it? Where is it?!

162
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,958
How could I be so stupid?!

163
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,583
[MOMO] I'm sorry.

164
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,125
[TOJI] What for?

165
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,458
[MOMO] I don't know.

166
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,666
Be honest, Momo.

167
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,166
Are you still in love with me?

168
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,791
Of course!
I've always loved you.

169
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,333
Where're you going?

170
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,083
[TOJI]
I just need to go cool off.

171
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
[cell phone beeping]

172
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,333
[water running]

173
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,250
[MOMO] Why would Kairi
be texting me now?

174
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,875
[MOMO] Oh no!

175
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,916
You all right?

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Toji!

177
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,375
Look at this.

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,916
I'm worried about Kairi.
He sent this weird message.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,541
Look.
What should I do?

180
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,916
I tried calling him back
but he didn't pick up.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,125
Are you positive
Kairi sent this?

182
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,500
I didn't think he
was the type of guy

183
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,625
to stoop to this level
just to get some attention.

184
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,666
That's the thing.

185
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,916
I don't think
it's for attention.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,958
He nearly died in the
ocean a few years ago.

187
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
What if he really means it?

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,000
[TOJI] Look, It doesn't say
that he's going to kill himself.

189
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,750
Momo!

190
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,500
I need to go to Shiranami.

191
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,791
What, are you crazy?

192
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,208
His text doesn't even
say he's in Shiranami.

193
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,958
He could be at home
for all you know.

194
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,250
But if we sit
around here and wait,

195
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,958
we'll be trapped by the storm.

196
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,250
If I don't leave now
I may never see him again.

197
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,208
I'll live to regret it
if I don't do something now.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,541
[TOJI] Is Kairi really
that important to you?

199
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,375
[gasps]

200
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,208
I won't let you.

201
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,000
Get off me.

202
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,750
[TOJI] Let's say
you go to Shiranami.

203
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,291
Then what?

204
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,625
You look for Kairi and on the
off chance you do find him,

205
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,791
you talk him off the ledge?

206
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,500
What happens then?

207
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,541
If you show up there now,

208
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,083
he'll expect
something out of you.

209
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,416
I know you don't
want to disappoint him,

210
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,125
so will you just get
back together with him?

211
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,250
If you're just worried
about him, don't leave.

212
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,791
Unless it's more than that!

213
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,666
I can't take any more
of this indecisive

214
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,083
back and forth with you.

215
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,416
Why can't you make up your mind
and commit to one of us?

216
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,750
If you walk out that door,
then break up with me first.

217
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,041
[TOJI] Sorry.

218
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,708
Please understand...

219
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,625
I've been acting like
I'm okay with everything,

220
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,375
but the reality is that I've
been a nervous wreck lately...

221
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,333
I'm afraid you're gonna
leave me and go back to him,

222
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,875
and I don't want that.

223
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,416
Please, look into my eyes...

224
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,250
and for just one minute
pretend he doesn't exist.

225
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,458
[TOJI] I promise
I'll be good to you, Momo.

226
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,958
[TOJI] Leave.

227
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,875
[TOJI] I don't care
what you do, just leave!

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,833
Hey, where are you?!

229
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,083
This is getting ridiculous.

230
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,083
Where the hell did he go
to look for that thing?

231
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,916
[cell phone ringing]

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,458
Momo? Is that you?

233
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,791
Momo, I can't hear you,
are you there?

234
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,666
[MOMO]
Yeah, I'm here, Sae.

235
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,208
Oh, I'm in trouble.

236
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,791
I don't know what to do.

237
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,916
I got this awful text from Kairi
saying he might kill himself.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,291
To think that he'd do that

239
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,416
because we're not going out
anymore is horrifying.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,125
All I can think about
is going to Shiranami

241
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,833
to try and save him.

242
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,083
Right...

243
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,208
So you want to go to him.

244
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,791
Then what's stopping you
from doing that?

245
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,250
[MOMO] I can't just leave!

246
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,291
Do you have any idea how much
that would hurt Toji?

247
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,166
Oh Sae, I'm so confused.

248
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,375
[SAE] Well if you're confused,

249
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,333
then you need to
simplify things, right?

250
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,916
Since you're going to be
offending one or the other

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
no matter what you do,
then just pick which guy

252
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,166
you want to be with more.

253
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,125
[MOMO] I can't.

254
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,291
Ugh!

255
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,625
Look, don't you realize
you're making this

256
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,375
so much harder
than it has to be?

257
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,041
Hell, I thought you already
made up your mind on this

258
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,000
a long time ago.

259
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,791
[SAE] Just do what
your instincts tell you.

260
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,000
But you need to be willing
to break one of their hearts.

261
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,250
That's the ugly truth.

262
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,750
Until you're ready
to do that, you're stuck.

263
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,791
[MOMO] Sae's right.

264
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,375
Sitting around here
trying to decide

265
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,500
isn't going to
accomplish anything.

266
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,583
[MOMO] I have to go.

267
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,250
I have to do something.

268
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,291
[TOJI] Momo.

269
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,083
Momo!

270
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,541
[MOMO] I made up my mind.

271
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,708
I'm going to Shiranami.

272
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,375
Knowing how impulsive
Kairi can be,

273
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,208
he might actually go through
with killing himself.

274
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,500
Sorry, Toji...

275
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,708
I know it's difficult
to hear this

276
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,500
after all we've been through.

277
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,875
And I know I've
had plenty of chances

278
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,916
to go back to Kairi before this,

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,083
but it wasn't until I thought
I might lose him entirely

280
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,416
that I realized...

281
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,000
That I realized how much
I'm in love with Kairi!

282
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,833
[MOMO] I'm sorry, Toji...

283
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,291
I should have figured
this out a long time ago.

284
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,416
It's funny because even
when you picked me over Kairi

285
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,083
at the hospital,
I had a feeling you

286
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,916
weren't entirely sure
of your decision.

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
That's why
I've decided for myself...

288
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,958
You should get going.

289
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,958
The trains will be
stopping pretty soon.

290
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,000
But where does that leave you?

291
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,208
Momo, you don't need
to worry about me any longer.

292
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,875
But I want to say
that you're giving up a guy

293
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,250
who would have made you happy,

294
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,916
and I hope that
whoever you end up with

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,625
treats you as well
as I would have.

296
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,833
[MOMO] Thank you, Toji.
I'm so sorry.

297
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,875
It's okay.
Now go before it's too late.

298
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,541
[MOMO] Thanks, Toji.
You're the best.

299
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,875
Come on, Kairi!
Knock it off already!

300
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,875
It's too dark
for you to even see anything.

301
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,166
Let's come back
when the rain stops.

302
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
It'll be brighter then.

303
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,666
No! I can't wait that long!

304
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,166
What am I supposed to
do if gets taken out to sea

305
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,041
in the middle of the night?

306
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,333
You don't make any sense!

307
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,375
The reason you're here
was to throw it away!

308
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
And even if you
do happen to find it,

309
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,583
it will never bring Momo back.

310
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,541
[KAIRI] I know that! I know.

311
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,333
I can't explain why,
but I need it!

312
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,708
What's wrong with me?

313
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,583
Why am I so incapable
of realizing

314
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,625
how important something
is to me before I lose it?

315
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,875
I don't want to be alone
the rest of my life.

316
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,416
[TAXI DRIVER] Yeah, it's gonna
get pretty messy around here.

317
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,208
The ground in the area
is very loose,

318
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,041
and when we get a lot of rain,
the trains have to stop.

319
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,333
Now I don't mean to pry,
it's just the father in me,

320
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,666
but what's a
young lady like yourself

321
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,791
doing out here in
the middle of a typhoon?

322
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,083
[MOMO] There's someone
waiting for me in Shiranami.

323
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,416
Kairi, I've come to realize
that I've been trying

324
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,750
to run away from you
for so long.

325
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,541
I was hung up on the idea
of losing someone again,

326
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,541
and so afraid of that happening
that I avoided facing you.

327
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,791
Running away
never solves anything,

328
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,875
but at the time it was
the easiest thing to do

329
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,708
to stop the pain.

330
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,625
Well I'm not going
to run away anymore.

331
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,333
This time I'll come
face to face with you

332
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,833
and settle things like an adult.

333
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,666
I just hope I make it in time.

334
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,125
[surfers laughing, chatting]

335
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,000
[KAIRI] Excuse me...!

336
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,166
This is my cell phone case.

337
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,666
I've been looking
everywhere for it.

338
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,333
You don't know
how relieved I am.

339
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,708
Where was it?

340
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,000
Well it's mine now...

341
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Unless you can show
some proof that it's yours.

342
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,375
You want me to prove it?

343
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,000
Sure, no problem.
I'll just have Sae come over.

344
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,166
She's good friends with
the girl that made it for me.

345
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,166
[SURFER A] Oh, she is?
Well I don't see anyone.

346
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,708
If you ain't got no proof,
then you ain't getting it back.

347
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,541
[surfers laughing]

348
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,291
Look man,
I'm not trying to scam you.

349
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,666
Someone very important
made that for me as a gift.

350
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,208
I've been looking
for it since last night.

351
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,666
I just want it back.

352
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,458
Well if this thing really
is that important to you...

353
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,291
...then I deserve a reward.

354
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,916
For finding it!

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,583
Oh, okay.

356
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,041
Huh... That's strange.

357
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,416
I think I might
have lost my wallet, too.

358
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,958
[SURFER B] What an idiot.

359
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,708
[SURFER A] Borrow some cash
from that chick you came with,

360
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,958
if she even exists.

361
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,916
Then I'll consider
giving it back.

362
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,666
Get off me, man!

363
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,125
I'm definitely not
giving it back now, you punk!

364
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,333
Let's jump him!

365
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,333
[KAIRI groaning]

366
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,833
Enough, Johnny, stop it.

367
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,333
Please. All I want
is for you to give it back.

368
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,041
Come on, guys.
Just do what he says.

369
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,458
Yeah, Johnny,
it's not funny anymore.

370
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,666
Sure, I'll give it back...
There!

371
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,875
[SURFER A]
Good luck finding it.

372
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,916
You're a jerk.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,166
Yeah, get lost.

374
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,541
Where're you going?

375
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,708
Hey, wait up!
It was just a joke!

376
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,458
[KAIRI] Okay. Where is it?

377
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,500
[yells]

378
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,333
[coughing]

379
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,708
I'll find it.

380
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,041
I don't care
how long it takes me.

381
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,833
[MOMO] Thank you so much.
Keep the change.

382
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,250
[TAXI DRIVER] You take care.

383
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,833
[coughing]

384
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,083
[KAIRI] I found it!

385
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,708
Is that Kairi?

386
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,208
Oh my gosh!

387
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,916
[KAIRI] This isn't good.

388
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,541
I can't even move my legs.

389
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,791
I don't want to die yet.

390
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,708
Not before I see Momo
one last time.

391
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,666
[MOMO] Kairi! Kairi, wake up!

392
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,208
Can you hear me?!

393
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,708
[gasps]

394
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,333
[MOMO] He's not breathing!

395
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,875
[MOMO]
Come on, Kairi, wake up.

396
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,375
I came here for you.

397
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,000
You can't die on me!

398
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,541
Please, Kairi!

399
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,250
Wake up, Kairi!
Wake up! Open your eyes!

400
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,333
I can't live without you!
Did you hear me? I can't!

401
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,791
Kairi...

402
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,291
[sobbing]

403
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,000
[MOMO] Kairi!

404
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,041
[coughs]

405
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,458
[coughing]

406
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375
Oh hey, Momo.

407
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,791
What are you doing here?
Are we in heaven?

408
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,750
Awesome. If I get to be
with Momo in heaven,

409
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,833
then I don't mind dying.

410
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,458
You dummy!

411
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,375
I just saved your life, so don't
you dare talk to me about dying!

412
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,375
Do you have any idea
how worried I was about you?

413
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,166
[KAIRI] So I'm alive?

414
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,208
Thank you, Momo...

415
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,166
Thank you for saving me!

416
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,708
I adore you.

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,416
I love you so much, Kairi.

418
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,708
Now wait a second...

419
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,916
How'd you know where to find me?
I never told you where I was.

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,958
You're kidding, right?

421
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,041
You sent me that
awful text message.

422
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,750
Where you said you'd
become fish food in Shiranami?

423
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,708
Hold on...

424
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,500
I never sent you
a text message.

425
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,833
Sae still has my phone.

426
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,000
Want a photo to commemorate

427
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,666
the beginning of
your future together?

428
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,041
By the way, the one who
sent the text message was...

429
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,000
...good ole' Sae.

430
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,000
I knew it!

431
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:04,833
Come and get me!

432
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,625
You're gonna pay for that!

433
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,250
[SAE laughing]

434
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,958
[SAE] Who cares?
It all worked out in the end!

435
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,083
[MOMO] That's not
the point, you psycho!

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,583
[MOMO] We met on the beach, and
the ocean has bound us together.

437
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,541
So many emotions
have dissolved in the sea.

438
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,541
[MOMO] I've made up my mind.

439
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,041
I can honestly say
I'm happy now.
