Hey!

00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,500
Let's check out the class list.

5
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,666
[MOMO] Please don't let me be in
the same class as Sae this year.

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,708
I'll do anything. Please,
please, please, please!

7
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,000
There it is! Class 2-3!

8
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,916
Momo! We're in the
same class again!

Uh!

10
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,541
[KAIRI]
Eh?

[SAE laughing]
Oh Toji!

13
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm so glad we're in
the same class again!

14
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,958
[MOMO]
Aw, man!

15
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,833
Am I really going to have to
put up with that all year?

16
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,208
Um, yeah,

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,416
it's obvious that she's just
doing that to show off.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,791
Oh whatever, I don't care.
They can do what they want.

19
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,291
Really? You're not mad?

20
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,833
Not at all. I'm totally over it.

21
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
[MOMO] I guess,
he's really over it, too.

22
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:18,416
[MOMO] We've become strangers
in just three months.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,791
We don't even talk when we
pass each other in the halls.

24
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,791
I was hoping that 11th grade
would be a fresh start,

25
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,125
and I wouldn't have to
be reminded every day

26
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,791
that Toji left me for Sae.

27
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,458
Yeah right. Talk about bad luck.

28
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,625
The only thing that gets
me through the day is--

29
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,041
So, ladies, what's the plan
for the cookout, huh?

30
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,083
Well, barbeques are always fun.
What do you guys think?

31
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,791
Sure, I'm down for that.

32
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,166
[MOMO, NAMI]
Me too!

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
All right, barbeque it is then!

34
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,916
Sae, don't worry about those
bags, they're too heavy!

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,333
You just rest. Let us get them.

36
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,791
[MOMO] When I'm with Kairi,
Sae seems to keep her distance.

37
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,916
She doesn't like being around
him for whatever reason.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,250
He knows this, and he stays
beside me to keep her away.

39
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,000
[MOMO] So I can actually
relax while Kairi's around.

40
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:18,208
But it's not like that.
I'm done with love for awhile.

Oh no.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,416
I wasn't paying
attention! Nami?!

160
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,958
[SAE giggles]

161
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,250
[SAE]
Have a nice hike!

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,833
Weird. Where is everyone?

163
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:30,833
I should've caught up
with them a long time ago.

164
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,000
Wait. I don't remember
passing this before.

165
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:50,041
[MOMO]
Which way did I come from?

166
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,416
[MOMO]
What am I going to do?

167
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,625
How do I find
the trail I was on?

168
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,208
[MOMO gasps, screams]

169
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:03,166
[MOMO groans]
What happened?

170
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,458
[crack]

171
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,083
[MOMO grunts, screams]

172
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,250
[KAKO, NAMI, RITSUKO]
Huh?

173
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,958
Hey, guys.

174
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,833
[KAIRI, KAKO]
Where's Momo?

175
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,833
I thought she was with you?

176
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,208
No, Nori said she
left with you guys.

177
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,041
[NORI, SANGO, AKI]
Ah...

178
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,083
[KAIRI]
Stop, right there!

179
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,125
[NORI, SANGO, AKI gasp]

180
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,625
[NORI, SANGO, AKI stutter]

181
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,666
[KAIRI] Somebody wanna
tell me what's goin' on?

182
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,583
[MOMO groans]

183
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:34,000
[MOMO] I can't.
I can't walk anymore.

184
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:40,666
Kairi! Kako! Nami! Ritsuko!

185
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,666
I see a light. I'm almost there.

186
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,625
I'm saved! I can't believe it!
I never thought I'd make-!

187
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,083
[MOMO]
What's going on?

188
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,166
Why is this happening?

189
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,750
[MOMO]
Toji.

190
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:35,833
[MOMO] I'm still in love
with him. I miss him so much.

191
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,666
Even after all that
he put me though.

192
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:53,583
[MOMO cries]
Toji.

193
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,166
[NORI] Wash that stupid smile
off your face, faker!

194
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,666
[MOMO]
I'm not over him.

195
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,958
I really thought I was.

196
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm trying to move forward,
but it's so hard.

197
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,500
[KAIRI]
Momo, there you are!

198
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
[KAIRI laughs]

199
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,333
Yeah, I knew you'd be crying.

200
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,500
Oh, I uh...

201
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,875
What a dork.
How'd you get lost?

202
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,833
What happened,
did you hurt your leg?

203
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,791
A dork? Do you think
this is funny?

204
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,291
[MOMO]
Mm.

205
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,250
[KAIRI]
It's not funny. I'm sorry.

206
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,791
It must've been scary
to be all alone out here.

207
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,791
Why Kairi?

208
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,791
Why do you always show up
when I'm feeling vulnerable?!

209
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,333
It's not fair.

210
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,166
[MOMO] Don't, Kairi.
Don't be nice to me.

211
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,750
[MOMO]
Am I falling for him again?

212
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,458
[MOMO]
Is that what that kiss meant?

213
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,416
[MOMO]
I'm leaving!

214
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,250
[MOMO]
It wasn't the same.

215
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,291
A kiss is supposed to
consume your entire body

216
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,083
and make you feel like it might
explode from all the passion

217
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:06,166
you're feeling inside.

218
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,208
But it wasn't like that.

219
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,291
[dog barking]

220
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,625
[dog yelps]

221
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,416
[MOMO]
Gross! Stupid dog!

222
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,708
[MOMO] Maybe that's kind of how
it was when Kairi and I kissed?

223
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,666
I'm sorry, Kairi.

224
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,708
I wonder how he feels
about yesterday?

225
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,250
[KAIRI] Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Pick us! We'll do it!

226
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,791
[MOMO]
Uh...

227
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,333
Momo and I will gladly be in
charge of School Beautification!

228
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,541
We what?

229
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, we needed to
volunteer quickly,

230
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,708
or we could've ended up on the
same committee as Toji and Sae.

231
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,333
[KAIRI] I am so sorry!
The whole reason I picked

232
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,375
this committee is because
I thought it would be easy.

233
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,375
I had no idea that we'd
actually be gardening! Really.

234
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,583
But don't worry!
We can make it fun, right?

235
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,166
[crying]

236
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,791
[MOMO]
I just don't know what I want.

237
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,791
I mean, am I in love with Kairi?

238
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:10,000
Or am I just using him because
he keeps my mind off of Toji?

239
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:10,791
Ow!

240
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,875
[MOMO groans]

241
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,750
[MOMO]
Let's see. Here it is!

242
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,500
All set.

243
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,083
Uh. I'm such a klutz.

244
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,166
[MOMO]
Toji's still here.

245
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,666
This is where he sits.

246
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,083
[BASEBALL PLAYER]
Come on, man!

247
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,541
It's not like you have anything
to do at home, right?

248
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,291
Your loss. Call me if
you change your mind!

249
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,250
[TOJI]
Later.

250
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,541
Oh crap Toji's coming back in.

251
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,416
[BASEBALL PLAYER]
Hey Toji!

252
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey man, the captain
wants to talk to you,

253
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,625
if you have a minute?
It shouldn't take that long.

254
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,958
[TOJI]
Sure, no problem.

255
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,833
[door slams]

256
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,000
[MOMO sighs]

257
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,750
[MOMO]
I can't do this.

258
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,000
I still have such strong
feelings for Toji.

259
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,208
There's no way
I could ever date Kairi.

260
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,875
If I'm this confused
about everything,

261
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,666
I know I'll just end up
hurting him again.

262
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,833
But, Kairi's such a good friend.
I couldn't stand losing him.

263
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,083
I don't understand
how I feel about him.

264
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,916
Maybe I need to kiss him
again, just to find out?

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,375
Uh! What am I thinking?
That's insane!

266
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,416
Momo! Where'd you go?!
I missed you so much!

267
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
[MOMO screams]

268
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,000
[KAIRI groaning]

269
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,875
Sorry. That was
a little too hard.

270
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,291
[COMMITTEE MEMBERS]
Aw. We just planted those.

271
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,541
Sorry guys.

272
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,208
[KAIRI] Nice going, champ!
Now we have to stay overtime.

273
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,375
Actually, Your violent
outburst made it possible

274
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,333
for us to have some time alone.

275
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,083
Oh my gosh! I can't
believe I almost forgot!

276
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:21,125
I brought something
to show you. Look!

277
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,833
That's plum seed's
pretty exciting.

278
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,375
It's not a plum seed,
it's a peach seed, silly!

279
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,375
Peach seed, right.

280
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,166
Well, I uh...

281
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,875
I thought that maybe we could
secretly plant it together.

282
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,333
Kind of like a celebration of us

283
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,625
being in the same
class this year.

284
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Momo. Are you upset about
the kiss? Just tell me.

285
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,041
[MOMO]
No.

286
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,583
[KAIRI] Oh come on,
you're fuming!

287
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,375
You know, you've been really
cold towards me lately.

288
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm not mad, Kairi.

289
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,125
[KAIRI] Then what's wrong?
I don't understand!

290
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,666
You're being so mean!
Why are you doing this?

291
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,458
[MOMO]
I don't know!

292
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,666
[KAIRI]
Um, what don't you know?

293
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,500
How I feel right now.

294
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,833
I mean,

295
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm just taking advantage
of your kindness, Kairi.

296
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,875
I'm so comfortable
with you around,

297
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,500
but I also feel kinda
guilty about it.

298
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,583
I'm worried that I'm just
taking the easy way out,

299
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,375
and it's just not right.

300
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,500
But, what's not right about it?

301
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,875
I love Toji.

302
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,833
But whenever I'm down or
just don't want to be alone,

303
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,500
I always call you simply because

304
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,333
it's the easiest
thing for me to do.

305
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,416
I'm not doing anything to try
to stand on my own again.

306
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,958
I keep leaning on you to
avoid the pain and that's

307
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,916
not your responsibility.

308
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,041
I don't know how I feel
about you. I'm sorry, Kairi.

309
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
Of course I think of you
as more than just a friend,

310
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,666
but I'm just not sure.

311
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,083
I can't tell if I'm in
love with you or not.

312
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,750
And that's not fair to you.

313
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,791
Ha, ha, ha!
Is that all it was?

314
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,541
I thought you were gonna say
you didn't wanna be with me!

315
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,083
You still do, don't you?

316
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,958
Of course, but I'm probably just
using you to get over Toji!

317
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,833
And that's fine with me.

318
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,250
Look, this seed
is you, Mo.

319
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,791
Winter is finally over and
Spring is about to begin,

320
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,083
soon flowers will
start to bloom.

321
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,833
But in order for it to grow
it needs water, and sun,

322
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,833
and nutrients from the earth.

323
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,708
You don't have to go
through this on your own.

324
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,333
You can always depend on
those of us around you, okay?

325
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,000
[MOMO] It made me
so happy to hear that.

326
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:42,250
I wanted to cry, would that
day ever come for me?

327
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,166
The day I would blossom?

328
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,500
[bell rings]

329
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,291
[KAIRI] Momo, Hurry!
You've got to see this!

330
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,541
[MOMO]
Where are we going?

331
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,500
[KAIRI]
You'll see c'mon!

332
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,333
Right there, check it out!

333
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,083
[MOMO]
Uh!

334
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,000
[KAIRI]
Can you believe it?

335
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,625
It's only been a week
since we planted it,

336
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,750
and it's already blossomed.
It's a miracle!

337
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,666
Its gotta be a sign
that things are about

338
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,333
to turn around for you.
What do you think, Mo?

339
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,625
Listen.

340
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:28,375
I understand if you're
still in love with Toji.

341
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm just glad I'm with you.

342
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:39,708
[MOMO] Thank you, Kairi, but
isn't it weird that we planted

343
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,916
a peach seed,
and got a quince flower?

344
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,458
Huh?

345
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,875
Quince flower.

346
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,833
This looks absolutely nothing
like a peach blossom.

347
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,500
Uh! Ah! What?!
That man lied to me!

348
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,500
He said it was a peach blossom!

349
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,750
[KAIRI screams]

350
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,750
[MOMO] Peach blossom, huh?
I don't think so.

351
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:01,041
[KAIRI chuckles]

352
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,166
I'm a blooming idiot!

353
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,666
[MOMO laughs]

354
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,666
[KAIRI] I don't need to
plant a peach blossom.

355
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,875
I've got one right here.

356
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,833
Did you know that
peach blossoms

357
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,583
have a very special meaning?

358
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:24,833
They mean I am your captive.

359
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:29,000
[MOMO]
I am your captive.

360
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,791
[MOMO]
Now that I think about it,

361
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,791
I don't know a
thing about Kairi.

362
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,125
Who's that girl? Is she
the one in the picture?

363
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,416
Why is she hugging
him all of a sudden?

364
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
And why does she know
so much about him?

365
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,875
Next time on Peach Girl;

366
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,791
Shock! An Ex-Girlfriend
Barges In!
