Does it mean what
I think it does?

00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,125
That you're still in love with
her, after all these years?

00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,458
Come on. Are you going to
answer me or just stand there?

It's true.

What are you saying?

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,458
You looked straight into my eyes
and told me you loved me.

8
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,250
Was that a lie?

[KAIRI]
I'm sorry.

Uh... Is that all you can say?!

Why did you have
to do this, huh?!

12
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,875
Why'd you have to break my
heart? Tell me why! Tell me!

I'm so sorry.

I'll always love you.

[MOMO] What a liar.
He was stringing me along,

18
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:03,416
the whole time. I'll never
believe anyone ever again!

[MISAO]
Momo.

20
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,041
You left your bag
at my apartment.

21
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,250
Thank you.

22
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,916
So what ever happened
with you yesterday?

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,750
You caught me by surprise
when you left so suddenly.

24
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,458
Did you and Kairi have a fight?

25
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,250
He wouldn't tell
me when I asked.

26
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,041
I just hope it doesn't have
anything to do with me

27
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,250
and those pictures
you were looking at.

28
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,250
I wanna be clear with you.

29
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
There's nothing between
the two of us.

30
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,583
I used to tutor him,
and that's all.

31
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,333
There's no reason for you
to worry, Momo. I promise.

32
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,791
By the way, what did you wanna
talk to me about yesterday?

33
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,375
It's nothing.

34
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,625
If it's something important,

35
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,291
there's no reason for
you to be embarrassed.

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,666
We can go in my office and
talk in private if you want.

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,416
[MOMO gasps]
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

38
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,250
[MOMO]
I know it's not her fault.

39
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,666
But why, of all people, did it
have to be the school nurse?

40
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,250
I mean she's ten
years older than us,

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,791
and not even that pretty.

42
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,333
I can't even stand
myself right now.

43
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,791
Did you have another fight?

00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,208
[MOMO]
Uh?

45
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,958
It's so obvious. You're avoiding
Kairi like the plague.

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,708
What was it this time?
Trouble with an ex-girlfriend?

47
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,625
Just forget it.
It was nothing, really.

I can't forgive him.

00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,583
No matter how much
he apologizes,

56
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,458
I have to stand my ground.

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,125
If he didn't love me, then why
did he let me fall for him?

58
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,458
He should've just left me alone.

59
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,041
I'll swim.

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,125
I'll swim until I can't go any
farther. Until I nearly drown.

61
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,333
I'll keep going until
my heart is a void.

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,125
A dark pit of nothingness.

think about it anymore.

Oh, thank you.

Have you seen Sae
around here at all?

No. I try to avoid her.

That's cool.

Uh?

Wait, do you mean she's with
Kairi's older brother?

71
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,666
Probably. Last time we
spoke was two days ago.

72
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,166
She said she
wanted to break up.

73
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,083
And? What did you say?

00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,583
[TOJI]
No.

00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,500
You did? She flirted with
another guy and you forgive her?

76
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,958
She practically betrayed you!

77
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,250
The last thing I'd ever
do is forgive her,

but the reality of the
situation won't change.

We'll stay together
or we'll break up.

Either way we don't want
those pictures made public.

Besides, this was
never about forgiving.

00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,291
It's about figuring out how
important that person is to you.

your heart's in the right place.

[KAIRI] I didn't approach
you on a whim, you know.

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,416
I was incredibly happy when
I found out you liked me.

I'd wanted that for a long time.

were becoming serious with me,

Because, she was the first
girl I'd ever had such strong

feelings for. She was the first
to acknowledge me for who I am,

and not just as
Ryo's kid brother.

and for a long while,
I ran away from home.

I wanted to go a place
where I was unknown.

I know all about how difficult
a student you've been.

You've gone through eight
different private tutors

148

over the last three years.

I want you to know that
with me it'll be different.

You'll pass your classes
and have fun doing it.

You'll address me as Miss Aki.

Miss Aki, you run in the same
circles as my brother,

154

don't you? If I
were to guess,

155
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,750
I'd say you have
the hots for him.

156
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
What other reason would
you take this job for?

Everyone knows I'm a pain
in the butt to work with.

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,291
I bet you expected someone a
lot cuter than I am, right?

159
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,166
Admit it. You're disappointed
that I'm not as perfect as Ryo.

160
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,833
What're you talking about? Do
you have an identity problem?

161
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,333
Of course I realize you're
different from your brother,

162
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,625
and I, for one, think
that's a good thing.

163
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,375
[KAIRI] That was the first
time anyone had said

164
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,666
such nice things to me.

165
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,458
I was so happy after
that I nearly cried.

166
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,625
Misao had accepted
me for who I was,

167
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,083
and before I knew it,
I was madly in love with her.

168
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,000
I was also glad that she acted
so indifferent with Ryo.

169
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,375
When she came over to tutor me,

170
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,791
I knew she was there
to see me and only me,

171
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,791
and that alone made
me feel good.

172
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,208
But I was wrong.

173
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,000
I finally realized what
Misao's true feelings were

174
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,333
when I tagged along
on a trip one summer.

175
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,375
[RYO] I still don't know
what you're doing here.

[FRIEND A] Hey guys! Come on,
let's take some pictures.

179
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,416
[KAIRI] Thanks for standing
up for me back there.

180
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,000
[MISAO]
Don't worry about it.

181
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,875
What matters is we're here,
so let's have fun, okay?

[MISAO]
Huh?

184
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,416
I mean, I don't think
I've ever seen you

185
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,791
wearing that one before.

186
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,708
Did you just get it?
It really brings out your eyes

187
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,333
and goes great with the
dress you're wearing.

188
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,750
Oh, thank you.

189
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,583
[FRIEND A] Let me get a picture
of you two. Say cheese!

Misao! Are you okay?

00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,833
Hey. The necklace
looks nice on you.

197
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,375
I guess I did pick
out the perfect one.

198
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,833
[KAIRI]
That's when it dawned on me.

199
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,500
Misao wasn't being cold to Ryo.

200
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:24,500
She would get nervous around him
because she liked him so much.

201
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,791
That night she told me she
would no longer be my tutor.

202
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,750
I felt like a dagger had
been thrust into my chest.

203
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,958
I'd been betrayed once again.

204
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,958
I spent that night
wandering aimlessly

205
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,333
around the island during
a typhoon. A surfer found me,

206
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,458
and let me stay at his place
until the storm was gone.

207
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,500
I returned four days later.

208
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,916
I wonder if I'd die
if I went out there.

[MISAO crying]

213
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,125
[KAIRI] During the four
days I was gone,

214
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,541
Misao had searched
for me in the typhoon.

215
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,833
She ignored everyone's warnings
and searched on her own,

216
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,916
risking her life to save mine.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,125
If Kairi turns up there
before I get back,

218
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,208
promise me you won't
get mad at him.

219
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,583
And don't tell him I've been out
in the typhoon looking for him.

220
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:36,125
He's a good kid and I know he'll
just end up worrying about it.

221
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,250
And that had a huge
effect on me.

222
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,125
The fact that there was
no one else in the world

223
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,083
that cared for me
the way she did.

224
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,833
At that point, I didn't care
who it was that Misao loved.

225
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,000
[MOMO]
Kairi.

226
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,416
Kiss me.

[KAIRI]
Uh?

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,041
Kiss me.

Do you love me still?

00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,708
[KAIRI]
Mm-hm.

231
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,666
But, you... But you love
Misao more, don't you?

232
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,125
Yeah.

[MOMO]
That sucks.

234
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,458
[MOMO]
What should I do about this?

235
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,666
[RYO] What's most
important is what you want.

236
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,000
[MOMO]
That's right.

237
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,750
It's useless to force Kairi
to choose right now.

238
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,375
He has to decide on what
he wants on his own,

239
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,083
and it's up to me to
decide what I want.

240
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:50,375
How do I feel about Kairi
right this second?

241
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,833
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

Aren't you forgetting
something?

What happened to
my kiss goodbye?

245
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,958
I can't do that.

Oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,541
A goodbye kiss wasn't exactly
the right way to put it.

248

How about we have a
make-up kiss instead?

249
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,750
Or at least, we could have
a let's-just-get-along kiss.

250
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,958
[KAIRI]
Uh?

00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,916
I'd really like it if we
were friends again.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,166
I admit, I was shocked
and really angry

253

when I found out
that you lied to me.

254

But now I understand where
all this is coming from.

255
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,291
Honestly, it's all right
with me if you're still

256
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,583
in love with her. I just
wanna be near you.

[MOMO] Why? You don't hate me,
do you? I don't understand.

I'll tell you why.

261
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,083
All guys have urges. Mixing love
into that can be dangerous.

262
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,916
Every time we'd see each
other, I'd wanna kiss you.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
All right. I'm okay
with that, really.

264
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,208
Are you sure about that?

265
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,375
What if I were to take you
in my arms, or kiss you,

266
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,791
or stare into your eyes,
but I'm thinking of Misao

267
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,625
the entire time?
Wouldn't that bother you?

268
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,041
The last thing I'd wanna do is
hurt you, and that's exactly

269
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,958
what I would be doing.
That's why we should break up.

270
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,291
Well I don't agree with you.

271
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,708
If we break up I'll cry,

272
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,916
and I won't stop crying
until we get back together.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,750
I don't want that. I'm saying
I'm okay with this, Kairi.

274
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,750
So why can't things just
stay the way they are?

275
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,083
If we keep seeing each other,

276
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,083
I guarantee you'll cry
more than if we broke up.

277
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,041
Because I can't stop
loving Misao. I just can't.

Uh?

312
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,166
[MOMO]
What's goin' on?

313
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,916
[MOMO laughs] I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself lately.

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,333
[MOMO] Oh. Why did I tell
Toji all about our breakup?

315
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,541
It's so embarrassing!

316
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,875
So, did ya need to talk to me?

317
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:10,250
Uh, Toji? Uh!

318
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't take it.

319
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,375
I've held myself back up to now,
but not any longer.

320
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:20,250
I don't care what anyone says.
I can't let him have you.

321
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:25,750
Momo. Come back to me.

322
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,625
Let's start over.

323
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,458
[MOMO]
Start over?

324
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:38,000
[MOMO] Start over with Toji?
Is that possible?

325
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,208
[MOMO]
Uh!

326
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,541
Sorry. Look, Toji.

327
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,583
I can't start over
with you, I just can't.

328
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,625
Why not? Do you still
have feelings for Kairi?

329
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,208
Didn't you tell me yesterday
that he's in love

330
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,541
with the nurse? If that's true,
then come back to me.

331
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,750
That's easier said
than done, Toji.

332
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,125
In case you forgot already,
you're the one who dumped me

333
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,791
so you could start dating Sae.

334
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,166
And now all of a sudden
you want me back?

335
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,791
Do you have even
the slightest idea

336
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,541
of how I felt when
you dumped me?

337
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,708
You really did hurt me, Toji.

338
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,500
It was Kairi who
eased that hurt,

339
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,541
and helped me through
that awful time.

340
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,500
It was because of him that I
was able to get over you.

341
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,208
You have to understand Toji.
I love Kairi and...

342
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,833
and he means the world to me.

343
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,291
Then go to him.

344
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,750
Just tell him how you truly
feel. He'll understand.

345
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,333
[MOMO]
Uh?

346
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:51,125
Kairi would be a fool to
let a catch like you go.

347
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,750
[MOMO]
Did he do that on purpose?

348
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,666
Because I was so depressed?

349
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,375
Thanks Toji.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,625
[MOMO]
Kairi.

351
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,541
[KAIRI]
Huh?

352
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,166
We need to talk.

353
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,500
[MOMO] Listen, about yesterday,
about the whole breakup thing.

354
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,458
[KAIRI sighs]

355
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:21,083
Well, uh... It's okay.

356
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,750
[KAIRI]
Uh?!

357
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,166
[KAIRI] Thanks for
being so understanding.

358
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,416
And I'm truly sorry
that this happened.

359
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,958
I know it's a cliché,

360
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,333
but you'll find someone out
there that's perfect for you.

361
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:37,208
Someone who will cherish
you for who you are. Bye.

362
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,166
Kairi.

363
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,625
I can't flip a switch
and stop loving you.

364
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,666
[KAIRI]
Uh?

365
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,958
I love you so much.

366
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,458
You're the most precious
thing I have,

367
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,083
and I can't live without you,

368
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,875
and that's why I don't
wanna break up.

369
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,916
[KAIRI]
Uh!

370
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,000
Listen, Momo, you're
not making any sense.

371
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,125
That's because you're the
one who wanted to break up.

372
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,500
So fine. Everything that's
happened up to now is done.

373
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,041
Finished.

374
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,250
This time I'll be the
one who chases you.

375
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,916
I'll chase you, and chase you,

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,958
and I won't stop until you
love me more than Misao.

377
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,291
[KAIRI exhales]

378
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,291
That won't work! I'm telling
you if you do that,

379
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,875
in the end you'll only end
up hurting yourself, Momo.

380
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,416
[KAIRI]
Uh?!

381
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,125
Listen. All you wanna do is
make things easy on yourself.

382
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,541
You say you don't
wanna hurt me,

383
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,500
but in reality you're just
afraid of getting involved

384
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,833
in a committed relationship
with someone.

385
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,125
You're afraid of being rejected.

386
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,916
And that's why you can't step up
and declare your love for Misao!

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,208
Don't you realize that no
one will ever love you

388
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,291
if you keep yourself
closed off like this?

389
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,791
You're just pushing people away.
Is that what you really want?

390
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,541
I'm not gonna let
you get away, Kairi.

391
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,750
I don't care what it takes.
I will get you back.

392
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,416
Oh man.

393
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,833
I gotta say,

394
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
I am blown away by how
passionate you are about this.

395
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,833
But if you do what
you say you will,

396
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,666
I won't be able
to contain myself.

397
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,291
That's fine. You can have
me any way you like,

398
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,583
as long as I get a fair
second chance with you.

399
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,000
So do we have a deal?

400
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:17,791
[KAIRI laughs]
I do love you, Momo. I do!

401
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,041
[MOMO]
Hm.

402
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,166
But I'm still second?

403
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,416
Uh?! For now.

404
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,583
[MOMO]
Second best for now.

405
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:33,208
Someday soon, I'll be first
in your heart, Kairi.

406
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,291
[SAE] Ryo! I've done a lot
of thinking about this.

407
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,500
You and I need to start
dating, like, yesterday.

408
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,291
I know you probably
wanna play the field more,

409
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,833
but I can't help it.
I love you Ryo!

410
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,916
