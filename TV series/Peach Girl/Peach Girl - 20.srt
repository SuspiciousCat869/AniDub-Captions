1
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,333
What time are you supposed
to meet up with Kairi today?

2
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,125
At twelve o'clock. I told him
that I'd wait five minutes,

3
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,166
and if he didn't show,
I'd give up on him.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,583
You don't need to worry.

5
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,666
No matter what happens,
I know you'll find happiness.

6
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,041
Thanks Toji.

7
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,833
I guess I'll see you at school.

8
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,500
Yeah.

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,208
[MOMO]
I'm almost there.

10
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:16,750
Ha, ha! Just a little while
longer until I see my love!

11
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,958
[KAIRI]
I'm early.

12
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,541
I guess I'll just hang out here.

13
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,375
Good afternoon.

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,583
[KAIRI]
Hey man.

15
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,208
I'd like to get half
a dozen peach blossoms.

16
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,166
[FLOWER GUY]
Um. Sorry, we're out of peach.

17
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,833
They're out of season right now.

18
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,333
That's too bad.

19
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,916
Kairi?

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,250
Misao. What's up?

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,083
Nothing really. What on
earth are you doing here?

22
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,791
Well, I'm about
to meet Momo,

23
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,875
so I thought I'd get her
some flowers. I was hoping

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,791
to get her peach blossoms,
but they're out of season.

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,125
That's too bad...

26
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,208
So tell me about this
little trip you went on.

27
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,083
Where did you end up going?

28
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,416
I worked at a noodle shop.

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,416
You what?

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,791
Seriously. It's a long story,

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,916
but in the end I found the
answer I was looking for.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,208
[MISAO]
The answer?

33
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,708
That's right.

34
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,666
I finally realized that the
one I love the most is Momo.

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,958
You know, Misao.
I was in love with the idea

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,625
of being with you
more than anything.

37
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,166
I'm curious...

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,666
If you were forced to choose
just one person in the world

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,958
who you would wanna spend your
time with, who would it be?

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,833
Without a doubt,
mine would be Momo.

41
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,541
She's the only girl I know that
can make me feel comfortable

42
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,166
and relaxed all of the time.

43
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,625
Kairi. You changed this summer.

44
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,958
[KAIRI]
Really? How?

45
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,375
I don't know. You just seem
to be more together.

46
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,375
It's a good thing. It makes
you seem more manly.

47
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,666
It does?! All right!
I did it!! Whoo hoo!

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,666
Well I guess you're not the
only one doing some growing up.

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,250
Today I'm going to set
my life straight as well.

50
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,791
Oh really? You tellin'
Ryo the truth?

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,583
[MISAO] I'm actually on my
way to see him right now.

52
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,083
I know he's dating Sae,

53
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,083
and there's probably only
a slim chance of us getting

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,458
back together, but I figure
even if he turns me down,

55
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,708
at least I was true with
myself, you know?

56
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,125
I do.

57
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,083
I have a feeling I'll get
cold feet once I see him.

58
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,541
So I'm gonna give him flowers
to help convey the message.

59
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,916
That's just what I was thinking

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,375
of doing with the
peach blossoms.

61
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,416
Did you know that they're
meaning is "I'm your slave"?

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,958
[laughs] Let me guess.

63
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,000
You looked that up because
it's Momo's nickname.

64
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,250
Yeah, plus I thought she'd
get a good kick out of it.

65
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,166
So have you decided what
kinda flowers to get?

66
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,291
[MISAO]
Red roses.

67
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,208
They represent passion
and true love,

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,791
which is how I feel for Ryo.

69
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Yeah? That's what I'll get, too.

70
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,541
[KAIRI] Where are you
supposed to meet Ryo?

71
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,875
[MISAO]
Somewhere around here.

72
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,916
[KAIRI] Misao,
I have to be honest with you,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,208
I'm kinda hopin' things don't
work out between you two.

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,375
I swear it's not because
I'm jealous or bitter.

75
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,125
I hate to throw cold water on
your dreams now that you've made

76
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,791
up your mind and set
things in motion, but...

77
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,416

78

--[RYO] What am I?
--[KAIRI] Uh?!

79
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,416
Little brother with
big opinions.

80
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,708
Let's not forget who saved
your stupid ass when you found

81
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,416
yourself in the hospital
with pneumonia,

82
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,625
and no health insurance card.

83
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,125
So. Feeling much
better I assume.

84
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,666
I'm fine.

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,416
Then I can stop worrying. By
the way, isn't there something

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,291
you're forgetting to say
to your big brother?

87
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,958
Nope. Nothin'.

88
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,250
I know you're a busy man, so I
wanna thank you for taking

89
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,708
some time out of your schedule
to visit me in the hospital.

90
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,625
You sarcastic son of a...

91
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,458
Excuse me?! I paid for your
hospital visit. Now you owe me.

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,625
It was gonna be a gift
for my sick brother,

but now I want every penny
paid back with int--!

some healthy competition.

Why did he attack us?

anything to deserve that.

[MISAO] Yeah, I'm okay now,
or at least not so hysterical.

Sorry I lost it earlier.

127
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Don't be sorry. You have
every right to react that way.

00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,833
I'm just glad that Ryo
wasn't seriously hurt.

[KAIRI]
He should thank you for that.

If you hadn't thrown
yourself in front of him,

woulda held back.

getting back to the park?

How come? I'll stay here.

what the doctors say.

I don't understand.

I thought you had big plans
to meet up with Momo today.

What kind of a person would I be

to leave you when
you're all upset?

And besides, Momo and I have
all the time in the world

141
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,958
to be together, so she can wait.

she sees it that way.

Huh? Oh, no.

obsessing about Momo,

and being so happy and in love.
But I never told her.

For all she knows I'm
trying to avoid her.

After that, if you don't show
up, I'll assume it's over.

157
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,166
[KAIRI]
I'll be back!

158
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,333
[MOMO]
Why was Kairi with Misao?

159
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,208
Did they just happen
to run into each other,

160
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,416
or had they planned to meet?

161
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,583
[KAIRI] I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

162
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,791
Just wait for me. See you later.

163
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,500
[MOMO] I really do
come second with him.

164
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:22,333
Why did he lead me on then?
Don't hurt me like this, Kairi.

165
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,666
[TOJI]
What are you doing?

166
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,541
Huh?

167
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,333
Where is he?

168
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,458
He said something
urgent came up,

169
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,958
and that I should hang out here

170
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,708
and wait until he
can make it back.

171
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,708
Oh, that's no big deal.
I thought he--

172
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,208
[MOMO]
But, I saw him.

173
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,666
He got into a cab with
Misao and drove off.

174
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,458
[TOJI] There's gotta be
an explanation for that.

175
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,541
[MOMO]
Maybe. But, you see...

176
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,333
I just can't wait any longer.

177
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,666
[KAIRI]
I'll get out here.

178
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,250
Hey! Hey, Momo!

179
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:25,958
Momo, it's Kairi! Hey, Momo,
where are you? I'm here.

180
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,875
[MOMO] Kairi,
I tried. I really did.

181
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,958
I wanted to be the most
important person in your life,

182
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,708
but I guess sometimes,
even when you try your hardest,

183
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,250
things don't work out
the way you'd like them to.

184
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,333
I don't want to be
second anymore.

185
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,750
And if I can't have
you to myself,

186
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,083
then I don't wanna have
anything to do with you.

187
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,416
Hi, is this Nami?
Hey, This is Kairi.

188
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,458
I'm looking for Momo.
Is she over there?

189
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,625
Sorry Kairi, I haven't seen her.

190
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,458
Last time I heard from her she
said she was going on a trip.

191
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,666
Aren't you supposed
to be with her?

192
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,708
So in other words,
you blew off meeting her.

193
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,000
She probably got angry
with you and went home.

194
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,958
That's what I figured,
but when I called her house,

195
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,666
her mom said she wasn't there.
Anyway, if you happen to hear

196
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,000
from her, please call me
and let me know, okay?

197
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,791
Let's see. Where else
could I find her?

198
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,541
[KAIRI groans]

199
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
[SAE laughs]

200
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,041
[KAIRI]
Please, not now.

201
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,333
[ANNOUNCER] Due to
the approaching typhoon,

202
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,708
please make your way
away from the beach.

203
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,208
The surf is expected to pick up,

204
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,250
making conditions
extremely hazardous.

205
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,083
[MOMO] There was a storm
just like this one that day.

206
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,333
[MOMO] I wanted to see
the ocean with you again.

207
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:59,250
Kairi. I waited for you. I gave
myself, but it wasn't enough.

208
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,875
I believed that message
of yours, and I waited.

209
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,708
Good bye, Kairi.
I truly did adore you.

210
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,250
[MASHER]
Woah, cool braids.

211
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,916
Oh, man, are you crying?
Come on, cheer up.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,916
Some friends and I are having
a typhoon party later.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,500
You should hang out.
I'll help you up.

214
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,541
Hey, stop!

215
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,416
[TOJI]
Get your hands off my girl.

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,666
Uh?!

217
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,083
[MOMO]
Toji?

218
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,166
Whoa, chill out. Sorry.

219
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,416
[MOMO]
Why're you here?

220
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,250
I've been following you
since you left the park.

221
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,791
Because I wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

222
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,250
I'd rather be by myself so
I can sort my feelings out.

223
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,083
Okay.

224
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,416
I'm all right.

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
I'll stay here a little
longer and head back home.

226
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,416
I really appreciate you
checking up on me though.

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,791
But you can go home now.
I'll be okay.

228
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,625
I'd rather go back with you.
I'm in no rush.

229
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,500
Uh. But I...

230
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,833
I don't know how much longer
I'm going to be here.

231
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,666
That's fine. It's a good
thing I'm patient.

232
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,750
You idiot! Momo said
she'd wait five minutes,

233
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,041
and if you didn't show up,

234
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,958
she'd turn her back
and forget about you.

235
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,833
How could you break such
an important promise?!

236
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,083
Do you really think she went
to the beach by herself?

237
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,666
It's an awfully long way.

238
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,583
Where else could she have gone?
This boxed lunch totally rocks!

239
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
Listen. You don't
have to come with me.

240
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,291
You can turn around
at the next stop.

241
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,875
You're not gonna get
rid of me that easy.

242
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,041
I'm worried about Momo too,
ya know. I feel so bad for her.

243
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,750
The poor thing was looking
forward to this trip

244
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,875
before you went and shattered
her precious little heart.

245
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,166
What was I thinking
when I called?

246
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm such a dork.

247
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,583
But in all seriousness.
Momo was pinning her entire

248
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,333
love life on this trip.
It was very important to her.

249
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,916
Her entire life changed in that
five minutes she was waiting

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,666
for you, and that was all it
took for you to lose her.

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,416
If you had just
been there on time,

252
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,750
she was ready to accept
all your old girlfriends,

253
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,458
and any other problems
you two've had.

254
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,708
She was ready to accept you for
who you are, no questions asked.

255
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,541
That's how important
that promise was to her.

256
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,583
It meant everything, Kairi.
But I guess it was just too much

257
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,291
effort for you to keep
a simple appointment!

258
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,666
What's wrong with you anyway?

259
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,708
Ryo was attacked.
He's in the hospital.

260
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,125
Uh?!

261
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,333
And you didn't tell me?!
How dare you keep that from me!

262
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,083
I have to be by my
man's side, but I can't

263
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,500
because I'm on this stupid
train! So what am I gonna do?

264
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,375
Lemme off this friggin' thing!

265
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,125
There's no way!
It's an ex-!

266
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,833
[BOTH]
Mm?!

267
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,708
[BOTH]
It stopped.

268
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,583
[STATION MAN]
Ladies and Gentlemen,

269
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,166
due to the approaching typhoon

270
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,708
and the possibility of
landslides on the tracks,

271
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,250
all train service has been
postponed for the time being.

272
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,083
Excuse me.
I'm trying to get home.

273
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,625
Do you expect the trains to be
back up and running by tonight?

274
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,125
I'd say the earliest
would be in the morning.

275
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,375
[MAN A]
This is not what I needed.

276
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,958
I'm gonna end up
missing the big meeting.

277
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,791
[MAN B]
I say we find a hotel quick.

278
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,125
[MOMO]
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,666
If I hadn't taken so long,
we'd be on our way home.

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,291
It's not your fault. I made
the decision to come here.

281
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,583
But if you didn't
already cancel them,

282
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,458
you've still got
reservations at a hotel.

283
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,541
You can just hole up there.

284
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,041
What are you gonna do?

285
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,541
Don't worry about me. I'll just
find a bench to sleep on.

286
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
[STATION MAN]
Uh, sorry sir,

287
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,458
but the station's closing
at eight o'clock tonight.

288
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,166
I'm sorry, but we're
booked up tonight.

289
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,625
Because of the storm, we're
only honoring reservations.

290
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,500
[MOMO] Great.
Now what should we do?

291
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay. I'm gonna head
back to the hospital.

292
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,458
[KAIRI]
Right.

293
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,083
[INN MISTRESS]
You poor things! You're soaked!

294
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,666
[INN MASTER]
You guys made it just in time.

295
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,958
The storm's about to get worse.

296
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,166
I'll get started
on some dinner.

297
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,833
Until then, make
yourself comfortable.

298
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,125
Baths are through that door.

299
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,333
[MOMO]
What am I going to do now?

300
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,583
I never thought
this would happen.

301
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,458
Um. That bath was awesome.

302
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:28,708
Uh, yeah. So, should
we check out the room?

303
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,291
I put brand new linens
down for you guys.

304
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,916
Oh, and remember to
leave your dishes

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,958
in the hallway once you're done.

306
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,625
[MOMO]
This is so awkward.

00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,000
[MOMO] I know. You wanna see
if there's anything on TV?

00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,541
Oh, sure, great.

309
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,916
You'd think they'd offer
TV for free nowadays.

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I got it.

[MOMO laughs] That startled me.
It sounded like a bomb went off.

314
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,333
[TOJI] Momo.
I've missed you, so much

it's impossible kid.

This storm's really pounding us.

320

Your best bet would
be to wait it out,

321
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,208
and hope you can get on a train
first thing in the morning.

322

Otherwise you're SOL.

you going to answer that?

[TOJI]
No.

something important?

329
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,041
[TOJI]
Listen, Momo.

330
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,541
There's nothing more
important to me in the world

331
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,500
than being with you right now.

332
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Do you realize that to
this day I still dream

333
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,083
about the night of
your birthday party?

334
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,833
Every time I think of it,
I'm overwhelmed with regret.

335
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,000
If only I hadn't
answered the phone,

336
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,000
if only I had chosen
to go along with you.

337
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,750
Then you and I never
would've broken up.

338
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,041
I don't wanna lose you again.

You wore these that night.

Oh. Yeah, I can't believe
you actually remember.

341
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,625
That's so sweet.

342
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,250
When it comes to you, Momo,
I remember everything.

[TAXI DRIVER]
I'm curious kid.

345
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,750
What's so important that you're
willing to brave a typhoon

346
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,000
just to get to Shiranami?

347
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,750
[KAIRI]
Someone's waiting for me.

348
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,250
She's been waiting
a very long time.

349
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,083
[TAXI DRIVER] If this person's
been waiting for you so long,

350
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,333
then what harm would it do

351
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,916
to show up in the morning
or the day after?

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,166
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

353
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,291
Unfortunately, I learned the
hard way that's not the case...

354
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,416
I just assumed she would
go on waiting for me

355
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,625
til I was ready.
I was so naïve.

you any further than this.

How much further is it
to the coast from here?

Twenty-five miles?

not to trust these feelings.
