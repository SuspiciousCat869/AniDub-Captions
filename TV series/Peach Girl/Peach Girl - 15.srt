[MOMO] Oh no. This is bad.
I have to get outta here.

00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:54,083
Let go of me! I have to leave.

I won't let you.

Don't. Please get off of me!

00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,916

Why are you doing this?

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
Can't you see that no matter
how much I look like

15
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,833
your dead girlfriend, nothing
you do will bring her back?

16
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,708
You can't just replace
her with me!

17
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,125
Please. I'm begging you, Ryo.

18
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,833
Don't do it. I have nothing
but respect for you.

19
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,291
I know you're better than this.

[MOMO gasping]

00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,291
I can't help myself.
I love you too much.

Mm. No! Kairi!

[KAIRI panting]

24
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,000
He must have taken Momo
somewhere around here.

00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:04,708
But which door? Momo!

26
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,875

No!

Are you okay?

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,125
What happened? Did Ryo try
to hurt you or something?

39
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,541
He did... He tried...

40
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,416
Oh my God!

I'm here Ryo! What
happened to you?

43
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,625
[RYO] I'm all right.
It's nothing serious.

44
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,958
[SAE]
Uh!

45
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,125
[SAE] You're bleeding,
oh, you poor thing.

46
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,083
Wait. Did Momo do this to you?

47
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,375
Yeah. She really took
me by surprise.

48
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,958
She was climbing all over me.

49
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:29,000
And when I told her I wasn't
interested, she attacked me.

50
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,041
I fell backwards and knocked
those tables on top of me.

51
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,083
What?!

52
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,500
You were right
about her all along.

53
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,916
I honestly never imagined she
would come after me like that.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,833
I should've listened
to you before.

55
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,333
[KAIRI] Wait here.
I'll check inside.

56
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,333
[MOMO] But if he's hurt,
then it's my fault.

57
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,583
I'm the one who pushed him.

58
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,791
[KAIRI] If he's alive,
I'll beat him to a pulp.

59
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,083
[KAIRI]
He's not here.

60
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,541
Where did he go?

61
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,041
Look. If he walked
out on his own,

62
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,875
then he's not seriously hurt,
so I wouldn't worry.

63
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,833
Ah. Thank goodness.

64
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,208
Momo. You okay?

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,750
[MOMO]
Uh?

66
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:17,958
Thank you, Kairi.
I'm so glad you're here.

67

[MOMO sighs]

68
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,500
[KAIRI] I'm just glad
nothing happened to you.

69
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,541
[MOMO] I was scared!
He was so nice to me.

70
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,875
I never thought he'd
do something like that.

71
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,000
[KAIRI]
It's gonna be okay.

72
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:36,708
I'm sorry about all this,
Kairi. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,958
[MOMO]
Next time you see your brother,

74
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
will you give this
back to him for me?

75
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:49,208
I don't want it. I can't return
the feelings that he has for me,

76
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,541
and I definitely can't take
the place his dead girlfriend.

77
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,541
Excuse me? Ryo said he had
a girlfriend that died?

78
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,000
That's the biggest load
of crap I' ever heard.

79
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,541
Before he dated Morika,

80
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,958
he went out with another girl
that he also stole from me.

81
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,458
[MOMO] Really? But Ryo
said that he loved me

82
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,708
based solely on the fact
that I look like her.

83
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,833
Hold on. My brother said
that he was in love with you?

84
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,083
What a hypocrite.

85
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,000
You should've heard what
he said to me about you.

86
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,083
[MOMO]
Uh?!

87
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,208
Earlier, when he
pulled me aside.

88
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,958
Listen bro, you need
to leave that ugly broad.

89
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,250
I asked her to come to this
party and she followed

90
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,958
like a sheep. You can tell she's
been around the block.

91
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,375
If you hadn't shown up,
we'd probably be in bed by now.

92
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,750
[KAIRI grunts]

93
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,125
[MOMO]
Uh...

94
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,000
So, when he said he loved me,
that was just a lie?

95
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,500
He'll go to whatever
lengths necessary

96
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,000
just to get
under my skin.

97
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,541
What about everything
with Morika?

98
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,833
Because he said he was dating
her way before you did.

99
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,958
He even told you about that? Is
nothing sacred with that jerk?

100
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,083
Let's get this straight!
I dated her first!

101
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,958
[MOMO]
He lied to me about everything.

102
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,833
Ryo manipulated me just
like Sae used to.

103
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,458
You were right all along.

104
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,916
When we talked yesterday,

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,750
everything he said to me was
so nice and considerate,

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,375
and when I was really
upset with Sae,

107
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,375
talking to your brother
calmed me down.

108
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,708
That's the trick he uses,
and everyone falls for it. See?

109
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,375
And...

110
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,541
And what?

111
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,250
I mean, he is your older
brother after all.

112
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,000
Maybe I saw a future version
of you when I talked to him.

113
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,916
Momo. I will never
be like my brother.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,375
That's good.

115
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,083
I hope you stay just the way
you are right now, Kairi.

116
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,208
Uh. Wait. One more thing.

117
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
Your brother was able
to force a kiss on me.

118
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,333
He kissed you?

119
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,833
I couldn't stop him!

120
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,083
You'll never wanna kiss me
again for the rest of my life.

121
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,291
Uh?

122
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,541
After I sanitize your lips,
you'll be okay.

123
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,750
[MOMO]
Kairi. I love you.

124
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,166
[SAE] Thank God your
injury wasn't serious.

125
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,250
[RYO] Thank you, Sae.

126
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,833
I feel so grateful
that you found me

127
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,916
and walked me to the hospital.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,750
[SAE]
Oh, it was nothing.

129
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,958
Really? I felt like my guardian
angel had come down to save me.

130
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,500
[SAE sighs]

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,791
[RYO]
Oh, I have something for you.

132
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,625
[SAE]
Uh?

133
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,875
For being my angel.

134
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,375
[SAE gasps]

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,166
It's for me?

136
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,333
Let me put it on for you.

137
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,541
[MOMO] I am so late today! Oh
no, all the lockers are taken.

138
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,416
[SAE]
I have an open one over here.

139
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,916
Yeah? Thanks a million.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,041
[MOMO]
Uh?

141
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,125
[SAE laughing]

142
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,625
Uh, hi.

143
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,166
That necklace! Why?

144
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,250
Ryo, who you seem to be so head
over heels in love with,

145
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,708
is now madly in love
with me, bitch.

146
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,708
You two are a couple?
Since when?

147
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,458
Since none of your damn business
so don't worry about it, okay?

148
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,583
He even called me
his guardian angel.

149
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,250
You idiot! It's all
an act with him.

150
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,416
Trust me, Sae, he's playing
you like a fiddle!

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,750
Listen to all the jealousy

152
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,625
just because he didn't give
you the time of day.

153
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,416
Oh please. I am not jealous.

154
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,541
The guy's a scumbag and
besides, what about Toji?

155
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,458
Ah yes, Toji.

156
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,291
Lately I've come to realize
that spending time with Toji

157
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,875
is about as fun as counting
the hairs on my head.

158
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
What is your deal?

159
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, here's an idea! You two
should get back together!

160
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,208
[MOMO]
Uh!

161
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,208
You know you want him
back. Now thank me.

162
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,375
You're out of your mind.

163
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,166
The only man in my
life now is Kairi.

164
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,666
Yeah, sure.

165
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
Then if I were to set
my sights on dating

166
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,041
both Toji and Ryo at the same
time, you wouldn't care, right?

167
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:32,583
Great, I'm glad I have your
blessing. Later, loser. [laughs]

168
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,541
[KAIRI]
What?! Ryo and Sae?

169
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,041
Yup.

170
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,708
Man they'd be a shoe-in for
the worlds scariest couple.

171
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,791
Sae's being ridiculous,
but we've come to expect

172
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,000
that from her. What I wanna
know about is your brother.

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,416
How many of those necklaces
does he carry around?

174
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,958
[KAIRI]
That's it.

175
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,416
I'm going to my brother's office
to confront him about this.

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
[MOMO]
Why?

177
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,291
He called last night to say
he wasn't coming home

178
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,500
for a couple of weeks.

179
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,000
And with the crap he
tried to pull with you,

180
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,125
he and I need to talk
this through like men.

181
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,666
Then I'm coming with you.

182
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,041
[KAIRI]
Uh?

183
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,583
I wanna hear him explain
why he's going out with Sae.

184
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,666
But more than anything else,
I wanna slap him in the face.

185
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,583
Are you sure you're
up to this, Momo?

186
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah. As long as
you're with me.

187
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,375
I almost forgot.

188
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,000
Momo, I want you to have this.
It's for protection.

189
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,250
It's pepper spray,

190
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,208
and If he tries anything
funny with you again,

191
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,541
just spray him in the eyes and
you'll have time to get away.

192
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,916
Thanks Kairi. You're so sweet.

193
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,041
[FEMALE WORKER] Mr. Okayasu?
He was here just a minute ago.

194
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,666
[KAIRI]
Would you mind if we wait?

195
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,791
[FEMALE WORKER]
Not at all.

196
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,083
[KAIRI] Geez, he sure
is taking his time.

197
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,500
He probably found
out we were here

198
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,166
and snuck out through
the back door.

199
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,291
I need to go to
the ladies room.

200
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,458
[water running]

201
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,416
Ryo, I can see you
in the mirror.

202
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,333
Nice try though.

203
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,500
Woah, look at that. Isn't that a
bit dangerous for you to have.

204
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,458
Not when I'm being
stalked by a sicko,

205
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,416
especially in the
women's bathroom.

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
All right. I just wanted
to apologize to you

207
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,333
about yesterday. You're just so
cute, I couldn't help myself.

208
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,333
[MOMO] Is that the same
line you told to Sae?

209
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,583
[RYO gasps]
You know about that already?

210
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,500
Sae really likes to
talk, doesn't she?

211
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,000
What're you doing with her?

212
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,208
How can you fall in love with
someone that you just met?

213
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
Hey, all we did
was make out once.

214
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,666
Who said anything about
falling in love?

215
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,041
[MOMO gasps]

216
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,583
Whoa, hey! I'm sorry.
I'll never touch you again.

217
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,041
Every single thing you said
to me yesterday was a lie,

218
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,333
wasn't it, Ryo?
Kairi told me the truth,

219
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,041
and now it's your
chance to do the same.

220
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,750
Did you really steal
all his girlfriends?

221
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,291
That's true.

222
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
I don't understand why you would
do that to your own brother.

223
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,125
I mean, do you really
hate him that much?

224
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,375
That's not the
case at all.

225
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,791
I happen to love my little
brother very much.

226
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,958
In fact, I cherish Kairi.

227
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,458
[MOMO] He's more
demented than I thought.

228
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,958
[MOMO]
And let me guess,

229
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,666
when Morika slapped you in
the face outside your apartment,

230
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,958
it was because you tried doing
the same thing with her.

231
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,541
Yeah, that sounds about right.

232
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,416
Kairi was right about you
from the beginning.

233
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,166
You truly are a despicable
human being, Ryo.

234
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,666
That's a bit harsh.

235
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,291
I'll be the first to admit that
I'm fast with most women.

236
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,958
But I do possess a
few redeeming qualities.

237
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:04,875
Somehow I doubt that.

238
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,875
If there's someone I truly love,

239
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,375
I'm too scared to make a move.

240
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,750
I guess I'm a lot like
Kairi in that way.

241
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,791
But after all, he is my
little brother, ya know?

242
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,125
[MOMO]
Huh?

243
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,791
Aren't you getting a little
frustrated with him?

244
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,250
Don't you wish he would make
a move once in a while?

245
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,708
Honestly, it just
seemed like you

246
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,583
needed a little
bit of attention.

247
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,125
You don't know what
you're talking about.

248
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,166
Kairi can't keep his...

249
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,708
Why am I talking to
you about this?

250
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,000
It's none of your business,
and you can't be trusted.

251
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,458
Don't come any closer.

252
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,750
I'm gonna get my phone and
have Kairi meet us in here.

253
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,208
[MOMO]
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

254
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,666
What? He's in the ladies room?

255
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,750
Hang on Momo,
I'm on my way right now.

256
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
He'll be here in a minute.

257
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,333
Momo. Just answer
one thing for me.

258
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,875
Does Kairi get
intimate with you?

259
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,375
[MOMO]
You never quit! Yes, he does.

260
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,583
[RYO gasps]
That means you can't be

261
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,416
the one that he's truly
in love with.

262
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,625
[MOMO]
Uh?

263
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,625
He must still be
in love with her.

264
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,333
Wait, what? With who?

265
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,958
[MOMO]
Uh!

266
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,500
I'll See you around, Momo.
If you ever feel lonely

267
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,708
one night, you know
where to find me.

268
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,791
Where is he?

269
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,500
[MOMO]
Uh, he just left.

270
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,541
That bastard.
Are you doing okay?

271
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,333
Who the hell does he think he
is, coming into the ladies room?

272
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,750
[MOMO] I know I shouldn't
let his words bother me.

273
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,916
But there's something
about what he said.

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,750
All done. See ya.

275
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,791
I'm gonna empty
your trash for you.

276
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,041
[MISAO]
Thanks girls.

277
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,291
[MISAO]
You seem little glum.

278
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,291
[MOMO]
Huh?

279
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
Is there something
bothering you?

280
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,666
[MOMO]
Uh...

281
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,250
That necklace.

282
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
Oh, this old thing?

283
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,583
It was a gift from Ryo Okayasu.

284
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,791
It doesn't have any real
significance for me anymore.

285
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,500
It was just the first thing I
saw laying around this morning.

286
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,750
It's been so long,

287
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,875
I can't even remember
the last time I saw him.

288
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
I happened to run
into him yesterday.

289
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,500
You actually saw him?
Where? How's he doing?

290
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,500
Does he still look good?

291
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,458
Um, he's fine I guess.

292
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,708
But don't you think it'd
be a good idea to keep

293
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
your distance from him?

294
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,083
He gives that same necklace
to every girl he meets.

295
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,666
I'm curious, when
he gave it to you,

296
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,000
did he turn real creepy and
try to seduce you with it?

297
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,958
No way. Ryo's a great guy.

298
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,041
He would never try to pull
something like that.

299
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,916
Why would you say that, Momo?

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,541
Um.

301
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,000
[MOMO] Just speaking from
personal experience.

302
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,000
I was talking to Kairi and
he said that his brother

303
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,625
always fools women
with that trick.

304
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,166
[MISAO]
Yeah, well what else is new?

305
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,958
You know he's made a habit out
of badmouthing his brother.

306
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,041
So you're positive Ryo never
tried anything creepy with you.

307
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,000
Of course not.

308
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,875
[RYO]
If there's someone I truly love,

309
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,166
I'm too scared to make a move.

310
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,916
[MOMO] Wait. Maybe the one
Ryo's in love with is...

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,541
[MOMO groans]

312
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,583
What's the matter Sae?

Where do you get off telling
him to break up with me?

319
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,666
Just because he dumped your ass

doesn't mean you have
to sabotage my life!

It's not like they're

Ryo was just polite to her,

intention of actually

334

going out with her. In a few
days, Sae will forget about him.

I came home with him,

Uhh. No. I thought it might be
rude of me to take a shower

been in before, ya know?

I don't think it's rude,
but whatever floats your boat.

Why are you sitting
way over there?

saying about you,

it and doubting yourself?

that you were more together

want are so unreachable.

Yeah, maybe he changed
his mind at the last minute

because he loves me so much.

Because he wants
it to be really special.

then just come out and tell me.

ignoring you on purpose.

to do for my parents.

00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,708
[MISAO]
Go right ahead!

468
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,125
Oh wow, so cute!

469
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,666
Uh! I don't care for that one
so much. Hey, it's Kairi!

470
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,791
[MOMO] This must have been taken
back when she was tutoring him.

471
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,416
Look at how cute
he was back then.

472
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,458
[MOMO]
Uh?

473
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,208
[MISAO] Here you go.
Oh yeah, I like that one.

474
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,791
It was taken when I
went on a summer trip

475
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,375
with the Okayasu boys.

476
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,291
We were in a panic on the way
home because Kairi disappeared.

477
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,333
--[door bell]
--[MISAO] Coming!

478
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,708
[MOMO]
Why did he disappear?

479
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,375
--[door opens]
--[MISAO] You're here again?

480
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,750
[KAIRI] What do you mean
again? Can't I visit?

481
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,416
[KAIRI] I'm getting hungry.
Have anything to eat?

482
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,291
[MOMO]
Do you come here often?

483
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,666
I saw Misao's photo album.

484
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,458
She has the same picture that
I found in your school planner.

485
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,458
When I first saw it I
thought it was Morika

486
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:17,083
that was in the picture, but it
was Misao, wasn't it Kairi?

487
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,625
Does it mean what I think it
does?

488
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,458
That you're still in love with
her, after all these years?

489
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,666
Come on. Are you going to answer
me or just stand there?

490
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,541
[KAIRI]
It's true.

491
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,833
[MOMO gasps]

492
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,291
[KAIRI]
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,958
[MOMO]
What are you saying Kairi?

494
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,375
That you want to break up?

495
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,958
If we do, I'll cry,
I swear,

496
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,375
I'll cry for so long
that I run out of tears!

497
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,250
Kairi, why can't I
be the one you love?

498
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,583
