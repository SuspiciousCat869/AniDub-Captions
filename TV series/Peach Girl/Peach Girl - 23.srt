1
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,958
There's something
you need to know.

2
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,208
I'm pregnant,
and I know it's your baby.

3
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,833
[MISAO]
Huh?!

4
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,125
[TOJI] This is the spot
where we broke up before.

5
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,541
I didn't wanna
have a bad memory

6
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,166
associated with this
place. From now on,

7
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,375
let's agree to do everything
in our power to create

8
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,125
only happy memories.

9
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,583
M'kay?

10
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,583
[KAIRI]
Misao, watch out!!

11
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,708
[SAE] Ah! Let go of me!
I want a piece of that bitch!

12
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,500
This has nothing
to do with you Kairi,

13
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,000
now get your hands off me!

14
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,375
I hate you! I wish you would
drop dead where you stand.

15
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,958
I need you out of the way so
that Ryo will come back to me!

16
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,833
[SAE groans]

17
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,208
[KAIRI]
Uh.

18
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,958
[MISAO]
Calm down, Sae.

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,250
Do I need to remind you
you're carrying a child?

20
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,500
Allowing yourself to get worked
up could harm the baby.

21
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,875
[SAE sobs]

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,708
He gave this to you as a bribe?

23
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,125
[SAE]
I've made up my mind.

24
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,250
I'm having this baby
whether he likes it or not.

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:24,958
Hey Misao. What's going on?
Are you mad at me or something?

26
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,333
Wait, I've never seen you
wear glasses. They look nice.

27
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,583
[MISAO]
What the hell is this?

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,916
I told you to talk
things over with her.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
That's what I did.

30
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,791
I told her I had no intention
of seeing her again,

31
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
or of ever being a father.

32
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,958
How can you say that?
She's having a baby.

33
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
You can't just pay her off!

34
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,083
I gave her the money because
I don't wanna be a father.

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,250
Now she can raise it.

36
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,333
If Sae had just a drop
of common sense to her,

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,708
she would do the smart thing
and go have an abortion.

38
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,708
[MISAO] I think my head's
about to split open.

39
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,458
Maybe your glasses are
giving you a headache.

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,291
Take them off.

41
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,541
The only thing causing my head
to ache right now is you, Ryo.

42
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,208
[RYO]
Huh?

43
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,916
I just never saw it.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,541
In order to look
my best for you,

45
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,458
I would never wear my glasses.
But maybe if I'd kept them on,

46
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,416
I would've seen the kind
of person you really are.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
You're not the man
I thought you were,

48
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,833
and I was a fool to
think otherwise.

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,958
I never would have pursued you

50
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,125
had I seen you with
this much clarity.

51
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,625
Misao.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,250
[MISAO]
Goodbye, Ryo.

53
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,958
You're a cold-hearted bastard
for treating Sae like that.

54
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,083
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

55
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,000
[RYO]
Uh...

56
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,416
[NAMI]
I am so starving!

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,583
[RITSUKO]
Me, too!

58
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,833
Do you wanna grab
a bite to eat with us?

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
No thanks.
I'm gonna wait for Toji.

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,583
Okay then.
I'll See you tomorrow.

61
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,500
Have a good one!

62
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,250
[door closes]

63
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,875
[MOMO]
As long as I keep this picture,

64
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,583
I can't stop thinking of Kairi.

65
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,791
I better put it
back in his desk.

66
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,291
--[door opens]
--[MOMO gasps]

67
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,500
Momo. What are you doing?

68
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,458
[MOMO]
Uh...

69
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,375
[KAIRI]
That's my desk.

70
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,291
I know.

71
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,333
[gasps]

72
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,083
--[phone rings]
--[SAE] Huh?

73
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,375
Hello? This is Sae.

74
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,625
[RYO]
Sae. It's me.

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,791
Ryo!

76
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,208
[RYO] Misao broke up
with me last night.

77
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,583
I think it's for
the best though.

78
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,375
We weren't very compatible
to start with

79
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,875
and to be honest,
she's a bit boring...

80
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,083
But you're different, Sae.

81
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,500
You were always up for
having a good time.

82
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,000
No questions asked.

83
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,458
[RYO] I made a huge mistake
not sticking with you.

84
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,750
[SAE]
Ryo.

85
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,583
[RYO] But I'm probably
being selfish, aren't I?

86
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,166
[SAE]
Mm-mm.

87
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,250
[SAE] I'm so happy to hear this.
I wanna give it another shot!

88
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,708
Really?

89
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,958
[RYO] I'll tell you what.
Let's get together and talk.

90
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm really close to your school
right now. Sound good?

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,083
Sounds great!
Where are you?

92
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,625
Okay... I got it.
I'll be right there.

93
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,875
[KAIRI]
So...

94
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,000
You've been holding on
to this the entire time?

95
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:22,458
No. I just happened to find it.
I just forgot to give it back.

96
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,125
What do you mean you forgot?
Hey... Hold on.

97
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,541
It's because you had that
creepy photo of me inside it.

98
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,500
[KAIRI]
So, what's wrong with that?

99
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,750
[MOMO] Why did you take
a picture of me, Kairi?

100
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,375
Since you're so
crazy about Misao,

101
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,541
why don't you carry a
picture of her around?

102
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,625
Don't walk around acting like
you still care about me,

103
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,125
because it's really annoying.

104
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,791
Momo. I never intended that.

105
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,583
[MOMO] Then why did
you come to my house?

106
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,375
When you start crying
in front of me,

107
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,916
of course I'm going to assume
you still have feelings for me.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,250
[KAIRI] I went to your house
to get advice on Misao,

109
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,291
not to win you back.

110
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,666
I can't take this!

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,541
You don't know how much
I look forward to the day

112
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,916
when I don't think about you!

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,583
Now stop playing
with my emotions!

114
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:03,041
--[KAIRI] Uh.
--[MOMO cries]

115
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,291
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:22,000
[MOMO] Stop it, Kairi. You
don't love me! You never did.

117
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,291
[KAIRI] You're wrong.
I do love you.

118
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,750
[door opens]

119
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,750
Toji! Uh.

120
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,958
Uh!

121
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,125
Don't! Get your hands off me!

122
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:44,958
[KAIRI]
No.

123
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,541
Let her go. Now.

124
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,750
--[KAIRI] I can't!
--[MOMO gasps]

125
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,458
[KAIRI] Toji. I want
another chance with her.

126
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,458
If you took all the
feelings you have for her

127
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,666
and then multiplied them,

128
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,333
you still wouldn't love
her as much as I do!

129
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,000
You have to give her back to me!

130
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,125
Get real man. It's not like
she's a puppy or something.

131
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,041
You had your chance
and you blew it!

132
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,791
Do you really expect me to give
up my girlfriend that easily?

133
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,250
I don't care!

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
Momo's coming back to me,
whether you like it or not!

135
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,416
Do you see how selfish
you're acting?

136
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,833
So, what?

137
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,750
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to get Momo back,

138
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,916
and if that means screwing
you over in the process,

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
then so be it!

140
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,041
Misao was the first girl in my
life to treat me with respect,

141
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,416
which is why she's so important
to me. That hasn't changed.

142
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,875
Sure, I was in love with her
at one point in my life,

143
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,333
but not anymore.

144
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,750
Now I'm in love with Momo.

145
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,000
Let go of her.

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,500
I can't.

147
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:46,208
She's with me now! You're just
gonna have to accept that!

148
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,375
Look, Momo's been
through enough.

149
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,166
Don't make her life
any more difficult.

150
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,041
[SAE]
Ryo!

151
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,208
[SAE laughs]

152
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,541
[MORIKA]
Just as I thought.

153
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
Is that the guy?

154
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,625
Whatever you do,
do not hold back.

155
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
[TOJI] Do you wanna get
back together with him?

156
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,083
Uh... I...

157
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,291
I don't...

158
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,583
[KAIRI]
Now I'm in love with Momo!

159
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,416
[TOJI] Let's go back to
the classroom. Come on.

160
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,875
'Kay.

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,625
[SAE]
Um, Ryo.

162
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,833
[RYO]
Hm?

163
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:41,833
Is it all right with you
if I have this baby?

164
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,083
It's not.

165
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,708
The last thing I wanna
leave in this world

166
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,416
when I die is my genes.

167
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Why's that?

168
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,083
Come on, Sae.

169
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,750
You of all people should know
why I don't wanna have a child.

170
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,541
Can you imagine how
messed up a kid would be

171
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,750
if I were its father?
It gives me the creeps

172
00:09:55,833 --> 00:10:00,250
just thinkin' of what
kind of kid I'd raise.

173
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,541
[SAE] So you never wanna
have children of your own?

174
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,958
[RYO]
That's right.

175
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,083
[SAE] What about your parents?
Won't they be lonely?

176
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,791
I'm sure they wanna
have grandchildren.

177
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,291
[RYO] Kairi can have enough
kids for the both of us.

178
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,416
I know my brother, and I know
he'll make a good father.

179
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,125
You really think that?

180
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,041
Oh, yeah. Ever since
he was a little kid,

181
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:23,166
he was just very charming,
and everybody really loved him.

182
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,916
Even though lots of
people noticed me,

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
when compared to Kairi, the
friends I made never lasted.

184
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,041
And the few times when I
would hold onto a friend,

185
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,666
they'd end up ignoring me
because I wasn't who I said

186
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,750
I was, or because I was
depressing to be around.

187
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,541
I know my parents
preferred Kairi over me.

188
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,958
I just never quite understood
how he was able to work

189
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,666
his way into people's hearts.

190
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,291
I envied him. I envied him
so much it sickened me.

191
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,708
I love my brother,

192
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,541
but there've been times where
I wished he were dead.

193
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,666
[SAE]
Oh...

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,250
See? I'm just really messed up.

195
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,916
I understand. I'm the same way.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
[RYO]
Huh?

197
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,333
[SAE] I've been obsessed
with Momo for years.

198
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,375
Even though she was a loner, she
always had a positive attitude.

199
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,500
Anyone who came in contact
with her would walk away

200
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,166
with a smile on their face.

201
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,666
No matter how hard I tried
to ruin her reputation,

202
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,375
someone always figured
out that I was behind it.

203
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,416
I began to lose friends and Momo
started to become more popular,

204
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,625
which made me so angry.
I would always act so hostile

205
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,666
towards her because of that.
Why can't I be loved like Momo?

206
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,166
I was so envious of what she had
because it was like she didn't

207
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,166
even have to try. And you
were the same way, Ryo.

208
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,833
That's why I was so
attracted to you.

209
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,625
It was like looking in a mirror.

210
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,083
[RYO]
Uh?

211
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,291
I'm willing to start
a good family for you.

212

00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,000
[ALL]
Uh!

317
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,833
I need to speak
with you about that.

318
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,208
[RYO]
Of course.

319
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,000
[door slams]

320
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,375
[KAIRI]
We better call Sae's parents

321
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,041
and let them know what happened.

322
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,125
[MOMO]
I don't know their home number.

323
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,000
[TOJI] Why don't we
look in the phone book?

324
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,250
Ka... Ka...
Kashi... Kashiwa...

325
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,083
Kashiwa.

326
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,041
Okay. Here it is.

327
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,875
Show me.

328
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
[MOMO]
Here.

329
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,208
Ah, hello there. Is this
the Kashiwagi residents?

330
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,041
My name's Toji...

331
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,875
[MOMO]
I couldn't do it.

332
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,208
[TOJI] We'll have Momo choose
which one of us she wants.

333
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,000
[MOMO] I wasn't able to
say Toji's name. Why?

334
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,500
There's not a single thing
I don't like about him,

335
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,375
yet for some reason,
I hesitated.

336
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,708
I just don't know anymore.
It's too much pressure!

337
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,000
[KAIRI] She looks better than
I thought she would.

338
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,125
I was expecting her
to be all scratched up

339
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,625
and bloody like Ryo.

340
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,875
I'm surprised we haven't
heard anything yet.

341
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,958
Huh?

342
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:16,250
[MOMO]
About what happened to her baby.

343
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,708
You serious?

344
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,750
Yes. We just confirmed
it with ultrasound.

345
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,750
[RYO]
So the baby is...

346
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,166
I'm afraid so, son.

347
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,791
[SAE sighs]

348
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,833
[MOMO]
She's awake!

349
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,208
[SAE]
Uh...?

350
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,458
Where's Ryo?

351
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,583
He's in the other room,
talking to the doctor.

352
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,250
[KAIRI] Don't worry.
He'll be right in.

353
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:44,125
[sobs]

354
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,916
What's wrong, Sae?
Do you need a the nurse?

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,875
I'll call.

356
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,500
[SAE sobs]
The baby. It's gone.

357
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:56,041
The doctor said they couldn't
find it with the ultrasound.

358
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,875
Our baby's dead...
They killed it.

359
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,375
[SAE sobs]

360
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,041
[MOMO, TOJI, KAIRI]
Uh...

361
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,500
[door opens]

362
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:22,458
Ryo... I'm sorry... I wasn't
able to keep my word.

363
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
[RYO]
There was no baby.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,375
[ALL gasp]

365
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,458
[RYO]
The baby never existed.

366
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,791
It was an imaginary pregnancy.

367
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,125
[SAE]
Uh! What? No way!

368
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,416
I used a pregnancy kit,
and it came out positive.

369
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,750
I even had morning
sickness for a week!

370
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,041
[RYO] But you never went to
the doctor to get a real test,

371
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,041
did you? An imaginary
pregnancy can register

372
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,250
a false positive
with a home test.

373
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,083
[DOCTOR] The human mind
is an incredible thing.

374
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,166
Sae suffers from pseudocyesis.

375
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,875
Sometimes, a woman's body will
produce the same hormones

376
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,125
as those that are found
in a true pregnancy.

377
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,625
The menstrual cycle stops,
they get morning sickness,

378
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,166
and their abdomen even swells.

379
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,125
This usually happens to
women who desperately

380
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,666
want to get pregnant.

381
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,375
[SAE] That's ridiculous.
A made-up pregnancy?

382
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,458
What a joke. I told him I'd have
the baby and give him a family,

383
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,166
but apparently the baby
never even existed.

384
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,250
I'm so stupid.

385
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:34,708
[SAE sobs]

386
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,125
[MOMO] Do you think it's
okay to leave her alone?

387
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,666
[KAIRI] She said
that's what she wants,

388
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,416
so let's give her some time.
She deserves that much.

389
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,958
Yeah.

390
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,916
Well, what should we do now?

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,958
Momo still needs to
make her decision.

392
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,041
[KAIRI]
Uh...

393
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,708
[MOMO]
Umm... Right here?

394
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,666
Ok then... We can
go somewhere else.

395
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,041
[MISAO]
Ryo!

396
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,166
Misao?

397
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,250
[MISAO gasps]
My god. You look terrible Ryo.

398
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you know who did this to you?

399
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,416
What about Sae?
Is she all right?

400
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,416
I can't believe they
kicked her in the stomach.

401
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,583
She wasn't at a stable point
in her pregnancy yet,

402
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,708
--she could have a miscarriage.
--[RYO laughs]

403
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,958
--[gasps]
--[RYO laughs]

404
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,166
What's so funny?

405
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,125
[TOJI]
What's Misao doing here?

406
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,083
Oh, I called her
when we got here.

407
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,375
That's nice of you.

408
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,750
[MOMO] Oh. It was Misao
he was texting earlier.

409
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,208
[MOMO]
Kairi...

410
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,083
[KAIRI grunting]

411
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,083
[TOJI]
Where you going?!

412
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,416
[KAIRI]
I'll be back in a minute!

413
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:20,458
Come on. I'm really startin'
to freak out about this.

414
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,583
Get a grip.

415
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,583
[TOJI]
Momo.

416
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,833
Uh?

417
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,875
[TOJI] If you don't choose me,
I'll understand.

418
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,666
If your heart tells you
to choose someone else,

419
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,375
follow that. Time could
change your mind.

420
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,666
But, if it doesn't, who am
to I stand in the way?

421
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,666
Don't bother beating
yourself up over it.

422
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,666
If you decide that
Kairi's the one,

423
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,833
it'll be because he can
offer you something I can't,

424
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,916
and I'm fine with that.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,833
I just want you to make
the right decision,

426
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,458
so you can be happy.

427
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,458
But I am happy.

428
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,208
[KAIRI] Sorry! I didn't
mean to keep you waiting.

429
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,708
Uh!

430
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,625
[MOMO]
I'm sorry, Kairi.

431
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,125
I just don't believe it
can work out between us.

432
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,125
[MOMO]
No! That can't be true!

433
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,791
Kairi acted just
like he always did,

434
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,708
even after coming
back from the beach!

435
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm supposed to meet up
Toji soon, but I can't,

436
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,833
not when I feel like this!

437
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,166
