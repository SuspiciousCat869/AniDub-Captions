1
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,833
[KAIRI]
What good is it to go on a diet

2
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,250
if all it's gonna do
is make you anemic?

3
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,041
[MOMO] 
Hey Kairi, guess wha--!

4
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,875
I can explain.

5
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,166
[STORE MANAGER]
Uh!

6
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,666
[MOMO groans]

7
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,000
[STORE MANAGER] 
I'm so sorry!

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,666
The door opened so fast,
I didn't see you!

9
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,166
Oh, great.

10
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,916
I... I'm sorry.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,041
--[MOMO cries]
--[STORE MANAGER] Ah!

12
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,500
No, please don't.
It's not that bad!

13
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,333
This stuff is almost
expired anyway!

14
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,583
[MOMO] It's pointless.
This isn't going to work out.

15
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,833
[MISAO] 
I'm so sorry about that.

16
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,916
I didn't mean to
pass out on you.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,375
Hey, as long as you
don't sleep n' drive!

18
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,875
Hey, Momo, you don't look
like yourself today.

19
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,416
Is everything okay?

20
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,500
No, it's not.

21
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,666
Oh. Okay. Wow, it's
really stuffy in here!

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,333
[KAIRI chuckles]

23
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,791
[KAIRI gasps]

24
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,458
I'm sorry. 'Kay?

25
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,041
[MOMO] It's okay. I never
expected you to apologize.

26
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,833
You told me when we started
dating that you were into Misao.

27
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,916
I accept that.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,541
And I know it's only natural

29
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,291
that you would want to
kiss the one you love.

30
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,750
I was just surprised

31
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,416
that you tried to do it
while she was sleeping,

32
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,416
I mean that was a
pretty smooth move.

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,708
Personally, I would've
slapped you across the face!

34
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,291
[laughing]

35
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,000
[MOMO] Oh well, there's
nothing I can do about it.

36
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm his second choice.

37
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,666
[MOMO] I wonder if we
should've broken up then?

38
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,166
[MOMO] 
I'm back!

39
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,500
[MOMO'S MOTHER] Hi sweetie. Your
friend is here to visit you.

40
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,291
Which friend?

41
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
Hi!

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,916
[MOMO groans]

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,916
What the...?!

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,083
Aw, c'mon Mo,
don't be mad.

45
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,541
I thought it might be fun to
have some girl talk, please?

46
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,416
[MOMO] 
Mm. I don't know about that.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,125
[phone rings]

48
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,375
[SAE] Oh! It's Kairi!
You should answer it!

49
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,000
This is Sae,
what do you want?!

50
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,333
Uh! Sae...?! But...

51
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,708
Look, Kairi. I heard about
what you did to Momo,

52
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,416
and I'm absolutely shocked
who, does that? C'mon!

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
[KAIRI]
Uh-um... But... Wha-?

54
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,666
So, what exactly happened
between you two?

55
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,208
I'll just ask Kairi if
you don't wanna tell me.

56
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,875
[dial tone]

57
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,791
[SAE] 
What?!

58
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,208
Wow. So Kairi's got two girls.

59
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:35,208
Are you like his favorite?
I mean, who does he like more?

60
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know, Sae.
Please stop asking.

61
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,500
Come on! You've told me
this much already, so...

62
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,416
I get it. You're making all
this up so I'll start a rumor

63
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,541
about Kairi and turn
everyone against him.

64
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,291
Sure.

65
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,958
You would never do that.

66
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,208
School's out.
It would be pointless.

67
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,375
[MOMO] I would never do it
because I'm not like that!

68
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,708
[MOMO] 
Besides, if we break up,

69
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:03,083
they'll be plenty of rumors
already without your help.

70
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,208
[SAE] You really think you
guys might break up?

71
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,375
I hope not, but it's possible.
Just because I love him

72
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,916
doesn't mean he feels
the same way about me.

73
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,791
I can't believe it. If he had
done something like this

74
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,291
to me a year ago,
I would've killed him, but...

75
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,583
Now I just let it go because I'd
rather feel this kind of pain

76
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,166
then the pain of losing him.
It's sick.

77
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,208
I'm not myself anymore.
Everything I do is for him.

78
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,916
I love him so much. I want to
be with him more than anything.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,916
Why does it hurt like this?

80
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,166
You seem to have forgotten
that you're still together.

81
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,208
Uh?

82
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,458
[SAE] Listen Momo.
Love isn't always easy.

83
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,291
There are going to be
challenges like this.

84
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,666
You can't assume every time
your relationship is tested

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,958
that it's over, or even
something's wrong.

86
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,583
It's not easy to find someone
you can fall in love with,

87
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,166
and it's even harder to find
someone who loves you back.

88
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,708
You're taking it
all for granted.

89
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,333
He hasn't left you for this
girl so the fight isn't over.

90
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,791
I mean, If I haven't
given up on Ryo,

91
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,166
then you can hang in
there for Kairi.

92
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,208
[MOMO]
Uh...

93
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,125
This is weird. I never thought
you would cheer me up.

94
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,083
[BOTH laugh]

95
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,583
[MOMO] 
Sae made me feel better.

96
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,166
I guess stranger things
have happened.

97
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,500
How are you doing today?

98
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,000
Great! What a lovely smile!

99
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,458
Thank you! That's very sweet!

100
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,416
Would you like me to heat
up your lunch for you?

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,791
[MALE CUSTOMER] 
Sure! Thanks!

102
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,083
[MOMO]
Sae was right. There's no reason

103
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,666
to be depressed when the
fight isn't even over yet.

104
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,250
I'm not giving up on Kairi.

105
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,791
[KAIRI] 
Sae? What the...

106
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:04,541
So, how do you really
feel about Momo, Kairi?

107
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,208
Listen.

108
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,833
Listening.

109
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,333
Did Momo really confide in you,
or are you just making that up?

110
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,333
Of course she did. But I
had to push her a little.

111
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,208
Great. I can't believe
she's that depressed.

112
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,083
She's so hurt by me that
she can be consoled by you.

113
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,416
And what, exactly,
does that mean?!

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,958
[KAIRI] She used to say I was
the only one she could talk to.

115
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,791
I feel sick. I...

116
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,791
I've really messed
things up between us.

117
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,250
So here's a
question for ya:

118
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,083
Does this mystery woman know
she's Momo's competition?

119
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,208
No, she has no idea...

120
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,916
I've never told her how I
feel, but I'm with Momo,

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,750
it doesn't matter.

122
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,583
[SAE] Oh my gosh, that's it!

123
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,291
You need to tell this girl
how you feel about her!

124
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,041
Until you can get
your feelings out,

125
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,333
you're just gonna keep
obsessing over this girl,

126
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,875
and you'll never be able to
focus completely on Momo.

127
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,250
Thanks Sae, You're right.

128
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,500
I can't believe I'm taking
advice from you.

129
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,375
Everyone's doing it now!
But this was too easy.

130
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,791
Anyone could see what was wrong
with a jerk like you. [laughs]

131
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,416
[SAE] 
This was so much fun!

132
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm gonna have to hang
out with Momo more often!

133
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,041
[MOMO] 
What?

134
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,791
Sae came by here?

135
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,166
[KAIRI] Yep. She gave
me advice and then left.

136
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,000
[MOMO] She did? Do you
think she's trying to help us?

137
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,375
Possibly.

138
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,541
What's really going on?

139
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,125
[KAIRI] 
I don't know,

140
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,500
but all of these changes seem
a little too good to be true.

141
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,916
When she starts giving good
advice and being nice,

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,208
it just makes me suspicious.

143
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,666
[MOMO] Yeah! I know
exactly what you mean!

144
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,166
You do?

145
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,583
[BOTH laugh]

146
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:14,750
I'm really sorry Kairi. I didn't
mean to become so possessive.

147
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
It's just that,
I keep forgetting I'm not

148
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,500
the only girl in
your life right now.

149
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,250
You must've thought I
was some kind of psycho

150
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,791
with the way I
reacted to the kiss.

151
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,583
And by the way,
it's your responsibility

152
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,041
to tell me if I'm crazy.
Since you're the sane one.

153
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,208
[gasps] "The sane one," huh?

154
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,541
Well, don't forget,
confusion's my middle name!

155
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,958
[MOMO] 
I'll wait, Kairi.

156
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,166
I'll wait for you to
make your choice,

157
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,375
but be honest, do you think
you'll ever love me back?

158
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,041
Have a good night.
See you tomorrow, 'kay?

159
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,750
[KAIRI]
 Yeah. Okay.

160
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,750
[MOMO] I'll wait for you
to make your choice,

161
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,291
but be honest, do you think
you'll ever love me back?

162
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,916
[door bell rings]

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,083
Kairi!

164
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,833
[screams]

165
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,291
What are you doing here?
It's really late.

166
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,000
[KAIRI] What's all
over your face?

167
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,916
Oh, this? It's a mask.
Now, what do you want?

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,375
Well...

169
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,750
I, um...

170
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,750
[KAIRI] I wanted to know
how you're feeling.

171
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,416
Oh, I'm feeling great, actually.

172
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,833
I mean, I just took
some iron pills.

173
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:22,291
[KAIRI] Iron pills,
that's great. Bye.

174
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,000
[MISAO] 
Kairi, wait!!

175
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,375
[KAIRI]
Uh?

176
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,333
What are you doing running
outside like this?

177
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,583
[MISAO] 
You didn't come by

178
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,416
just to find out if I was
taking iron pills.

179
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,625
[COUPLE laughs]

180
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,291
I should take this mask
off, just give me a minute.

181
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,291
Oh, don't be silly.

182
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,708
[MISAO]
Huh?

183
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:57,166
That's what's so great
about you. You're so carefree.

184
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,625
Yet you take care of everyone.
And you... you have a big heart.

185
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,750
That's why...

186
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm in love with you.

187
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,250
[laughs] Oh Stop! You're joking!

188
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,958
I'm not joking.

189
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,666
[MISAO] What on earth
are you talking about?!

190
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,916
You're dating Momo!

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,625
I know that, but I'm in
love with you, okay?!

192
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,291
I've kept this secret
long enough.

193
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,416
[MISAO gasps]

194
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,833
[KAIRI] 
Please, say something.

195
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,208
[MISAO] I'm sorry...
I'm just in shock.

196
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,958
I never would have guessed
in a million years

197
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,666
that you felt this way about me.

198
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,916
Well, it's 'cause I used to
constantly hide my feelings

199
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,958
from everyone, but now...
Momo's helped me to see

200
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,666
that I can't keep shutting
the ones I love out or...

201
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,791
or they will never love me back.

202
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,875
I realized that I had to tell
you how I felt about you,

203
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,333
or else there might never
be an opportunity for us.

204
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,916
Misao, would you ever
consider going out with me?

205
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,333
Sorry. No.

206
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,833
It's just that, I love you
like a little brother, Kairi.

207
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
And I always will.

208
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
Thank you. I actually
feel a lot better now

209
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,583
that I've gotten that
off my chest.

210
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,333
[phone ringing]

211
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,041
Yeah?

212
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,416
[KAIRI] 
Hey, are you asleep?

213
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,583
Kairi? Uh.

214
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,875
[KAIRI] So I just told Misao
that I was in love with her.

215
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,416
[MOMO]
Oh.

216
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,083
She turned me down! And, uh,
I actually feel okay about it.

217
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,166
You know I always thought
that being rejected by her

218
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,291
might feel like it was the
end of the world, but...

219
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,375
But we ended up talking
for a long time.

220
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,791
I actually think we're gonna
be really good friends!

221
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,000
[KAIRI] 
So that's it.

222
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,541
Nothing's ever gonna
happen with me and her.

223
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,208
I'm sorry for drivin' you
crazy all this time.

224
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,916
Kairi.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,791
[KAIRI]
Hm?

226
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,333
[MOMO] 
Are you okay?

227
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,291
Yeah. Ya know, the
truth always hurts,

228
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,458
but I'm sure I'll be
over it soon, I mean,

229
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm alive, and mostly that's
because you're here to talk to.

230
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,291
[KAIRI] Knowing that there's
someone who does love me

231
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,500
helps a lot. Thanks.

232
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,625
[KAIRI] But I'm not gonna be
a jerk and come running back

233
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,708
to you just because
Misao doesn't want me.

234
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,708
That's not right.

235
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, thanks.

236
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,875
[KAIRI] Momo, remember
when we first started dating

237
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,375
and you were confused
about how you felt?

238
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,583
Yeah.

239
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,416
Well, that's where I'm at now.

240
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,208
I've learned some things about
myself that I need to consider.

241
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,916
I think we should take a break
until I know exactly how I feel.

242
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,291
I don't want there to
be anymore confusion.

243
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,500
Until then, will you wait?

244
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:24,541
[KAIRI] What am I saying? If you
find someone else, go for it.

245
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,083
But don't get your hopes up.

246
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,500
You're not going to find
anyone better than me!

247
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,291
Ha, ha! I know.

248
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,708
[MOMO] I'll wait for you,
as long as it takes.

249
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,625
Even if that means forever.

250
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,500
I trust you, Kairi.

251
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,375
[SAE] I can't believe
Kairi's not here today!

252
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,708
That really sucks!

253
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,583
I had so much I wanted
to tease him about! Hm!

254
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,875
You're quite a
piece of work, Sae.

255
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,500
So what's the latest?
There any new drama?

256
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,541
Um, no.

257
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,250
So, did he ever
tell that other girl

258
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,750
that he was in love with her?

259
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,583
Wow! He actually told her.
Well, what'd she say?

260
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,208
He said that she
turned him down.

261
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,416
[laughs] That's great!
Wait just a minute!

262
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,833
That means he's gonna try
and get back together with you!

263
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,208
That's not fair! I won't let it
happen! You're too good for him!

264
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,458
Listen to you.

265
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,791
[SAE] 
Momo! You liar!

266
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,375
You told me he wasn't
working today!

267
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,916
Hi Sae. Why are you here?

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,291
Is that how you greet all
of your customers?!

269
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,625
So, how did the meeting go?
What did he decide?

270
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,958
[KAIRI]
Can I talk to you for a second?

271
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,208
The boss said we
could take a break.

272
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,583
[MOMO] You don't have
to follow us everywhere!

273
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,625
[MOMO] You were in there
a long time talking to him.

274
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,666
[KAIRI] Yeah he was
tryin' to change my mind.

275
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,000
[MOMO] Change your
mind about what?

276
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,000
Today's my last day.
I don't work here anymore.

277
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
I see.

278
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,166
So, what are you going to
do over summer break?

279
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
[KAIRI] Well, as of right now,

280
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,708
I plan to thoroughly think
things over while walking.

281
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,916
[MOMO] 
While walking?

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,250
[KAIRI] 
Oh yeah.

283
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,625
They say you do your best
thinking while walking.

284
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,375
I figure I'll walk
as far as I can,

285
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,791
and see what I can
discover about myself.

286
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,916
[MOMO] Hm. Well, why
don't you give some

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,208
thought to this while
you're walking?

288
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,583
What is it?

289
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,666
I'm glad you asked.
Remember when we talked about

290
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,166
going on a trip to the
beach where we first met?

291
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,708
Well, I made us a reservation

292
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,416
for a couple days during the
last week of our summer break.

293
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,958
If you discover
somewhere on your walk

294
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,333
that you still
wanna be with me,

295
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,125
then meet me at the plaza
in front of the station

296
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,666
at noon on that day.

297
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,625
I'll only wait for five
minutes, after that,

298
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,833
if you don't show up,
I'll assume it's over.

299
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,833
[KAIRI] 
All right then.

300
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,208
Well, I'm off.
Take care!

301
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,916
Happy walking!

302
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,083
[MOMO] I need to do
some discovering as well.

303
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,375
I need to become stronger.

304
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,208
That way, I'll be able to handle

305
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,875
whatever decision
he finally makes.

306
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,833
Well that was hardly
worth it... Ugh!

307
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,458
I guess it's time
to put this up.

308
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,000
[SAE laughs]

309
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,916
[phone rings]

310
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,083
[MOMO] 
Nothing.

311
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,875
I have to stop doing that.

312
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,416
I keep forgetting
that "taking a break"

313
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,666
means that he isn't
going to call me, either.

314
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:52,125
I guess it's only natural
to hope it'll ring.

315
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,458
I'm so lonely without him.

316
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,041
This is pathetic! I don't
want to be this girl anymore!

317
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,583
When Kairi gets back,

318
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:05,000
the girl who freaks out over
every little thing will be gone!

319
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,083
I need to start living my life
for me and not a telephone call.

320
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,125
I need to stop doubting
myself so much.

321
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,708
I just need to be stronger!

322
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,333
Good morning, ma'am.

323
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,625
[MOMO]
Uh...

324
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,708
[screams]

325
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,916
Wha-What are you doing here?!

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,958
Well, I'm... I'm working.

327
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,583
[MOMO]
You... you work here?

328
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,291
Yeah.

329
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,750
[MOMO] 
Since when?

330
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,375
[TOJI] As of right now,
it's just for the summer.

331
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,625
Oh...

332
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,791
I... I can't believe it,
I mean, I work here too!

333
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,041
Ah!

334
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,291
Here, since when?

335
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:42,416
[MOMO] I've been here
since school let out.

336
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,208
[TOJI] This is insane...
What the hell was Sae thinking?

337
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,500
Are you saying that
Sae got you this job?!

338
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,916
[TOJI]
Yeah, she called me yesterday.

339
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,416
Hey, Toji!

340
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,250
It's me! I was wondering if you
still needed a summer job?

341
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,000
Today is your lucky day!

342
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,833
I had to quit my job
at the convenience store

343
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,916
because I have so
much to catch up on.

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,416
They're looking for
someone to replace me,

345
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,833
so I told them that
you were interested

346
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,500
and that you could start
tomorrow, so don't be late!

347
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,208
Wait! Sae! Don't hang up!

348
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,000
So, here we both are.

349
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,708
[MOMO] 
Sae!

350
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,916
[SAE laughs]

351
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,125
[MOMO]
Sae! What are you tryin' to do?

352
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,958
As if school wasn't bad enough!

353
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,458
I can't believe we're both
working in the same place.

354
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,208
This is insane!

355
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,916
What am I supposed
to talk to him about?!

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,875
Hey. I can quit, if you want.

357
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,416
Huh?

358
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,208
I totally understand if this is
making you uncomfortable.

359
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,416
It's no big deal. I'll find
someone to take my place.

360
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,333
Find someone else?
What are you talking about?

361
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,541
Don't be silly!
I'm not uncomfortable!

362
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,541
Hello??

363
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,583
--I'm so sorry, ma'am!
--I'll be right with you!

364
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,708
[MOMO] Ugh! Why am I
over-reacting like this?

365
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,125
I'm such an idiot!

366
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,000
I bet this is exactly why
Sae got Toji the job here!

367
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,333
She wants me to be tempted
while Kairi is gone!

368
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,208
Well, it's pointless. Toji
and I are a thing of the past.

369
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:20,375
The only one on my mind is
Kairi. I miss him so much.

370
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,208
[MOMO] 
What am I going to do?

371
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,250
I can't deny that I'm starting
to have feelings for Toji again.

372
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,458
Oh, where is Kairi?
I told him I'd wait for him,

373
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,000
but for how much longer?

374
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:21,000
Next time on Peach Girl:
The Emotional Puzzle.
