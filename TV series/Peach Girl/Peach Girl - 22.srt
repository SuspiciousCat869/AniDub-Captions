[MOMO gasps]

2
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,250
[MOMO]
But why?

3
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,500
Hey, Momo?

4
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,916
What are you doing
in here? You okay?

5
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,041
[MOMO]
Mm? I'm fine.

6
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,791
[whistle blows]

7
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,000
[MOMO] What was Kairi
doing with my picture?

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:37,958
Why? I thought...

9
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,791
I thought if he were to have any
picture, it would be of Misao.

10
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,333
[TOJI]
Momo.

11
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,125
[TOJI]
What do you wanna do?

12
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,708
We could catch an early
movie if you want.

13
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,500
[MOMO] I'd rather avoid groups
of people, if that's okay.

14
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,000
We could just do
it at my place.

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,083
I have tons of movies on
DVD we could watch.

16
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,500
Uh?!

17
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,416
[MOMO]
Oh my gosh!

18
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,125
I can't believe I agreed
to come here alone!

19
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,375
Great! Now I'm nervous!

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,250
Here we are.

21
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,875
You all right?

22
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:17,041
I'm fine. I just had
a bit of a flashback.

23
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,500
What?

24
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,083
[MOMO] Last time I was here,
you closed the door on me.

25
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,208
[TOJI]
Uh!

26
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,625
Forget it. Pretend
it didn't happen.

27
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,833
[MOMO] I haven't been
in Toji's room in ages,

28
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,458
although it does seem
like yesterday.

29
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:55,041
What am I talking about?
It hasn't even been a year!

30
00:03:55,125 --> 00:04:00,083
So much has happened since then.
So much stupid drama.

31
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:04,375
I never did give
that back to Kairi.

32
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,500
I wonder if he even realized
he was missing it.

33
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,875
And that photo...

34
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,083
[TOJI]
Are you bored?

35
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:16,708
[MOMO]
Huh?

36
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,416
No. Do I look it?

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,125
It's just... It seems like your
mind is somewhere else today.

38
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,666
[MOMO]
Uh.

39
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,083
No, I'm having a good time.
Maybe I have ADD or something.

40
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,375
Oh.

41
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,833
[MOMO]
Come on, Momo.

42
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,625
How long are you gonna keep
thinking about Kairi?

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,875
He's in the past now.
Toji's my future.

44
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,041
He's the one I need
to concentrate on.

45
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,583
[MOMO inhales]

46
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,708
[MOMO]
Mm!

47
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,250
Wait!

48
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,750
[TOJI]
Uh?

49
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,541
[MOMO]
Uh...

50
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,416
[MOMO]
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,583
Don't be.

52
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,208
I'm sorry, too.

53
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,041
When I see you
looking pre-occupied,

54
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,458
like you did just a minute ago,
I get anxious and nervous.

55
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,625
I start to believe that
you're thinking about Kairi.

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,833
[MOMO]
Uh.

57
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,083
[TOJI] With the way
you two ended things,

58
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,708
and it being less
than a week ago,

59
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,083
I can understand if you're
still thinking about him.

60
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,458
I guess more than anything,

61
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,166
I really want things between
us to be normal again.

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,708
I'm sorry, Toji.

63
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,041
Don't be. I'd be shocked if you
weren't thinking about him.

64
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
It's perfectly natural.

65
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,916
I mean, you two were
serious for a while there.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,041
I'm totally cool with that.

67
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,583
[MOMO]
Uh?

68
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,375
And until you feel like
you can devote

69
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,583
a hundred percent of your
heart to me, I'll be waiting.

70
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,166
Toji.

71
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,708
You're amazing.

72
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,833
[MOMO]
Seriously, I'm fine.

73
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,458
[TOJI]
But I wanna walk you home.

74
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,000
[MOMO] I can't believe
how relaxed I feel.

75
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,833
Toji really has
a way with words.

76
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,833
But at the same time,
I kinda feel guilty.

77
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:16,333
The truth is, I was really happy
to find that photograph.

78
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,333
Really happy.

79
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,416
[RYO] Okay, I'll see you
guys later guys. Hey you!

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,916
Hi there.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,208
I didn't realize you were still
working this late. Sorry.

82
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,958
Don't be sorry. It's cool.

83
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,708
I've actually had a tough time
concentrating since you called.

84
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,708
How 'bout if we make
this a real date?

85
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,333
Ryo. Listen...

86
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,916
--[phone rings]
--[RYO] Mm?

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hello?

88
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,708
You're late, you ugly,
conceited jerk!

89
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,541
We agreed on six o'clock at the
plaza in front of the station.

90
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,708
Where are you?

91
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,791
Oh, right. It slipped my mind.

92
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,666
Just hold tight little brother.
I'll be there in ten or fifteen.

93
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,500
You were supposed to
meet Kairi tonight?

94
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,791
[RYO] Yeah, he wants to
talk to me about something.

95
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,125
Let's go, I wanna
show you off.

96
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,375
Misao?

97
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,708
Hey, are you all right?

98
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,208
[MISAO] Do you remember when I
said I loved you the other day?

99
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,500
I want you to forget
that ever happened.

100
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,000
Huh? But why?

101
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,375
[MISAO] I was being very
selfish when I said that.

102
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,208
I was so consumed with
the need to tell you,

103
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,416
but I never intended to get in
the way of your relationship

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
with Sae. I just assumed
you were single.

105
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,541
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

106
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,500
There's no need
to worry about it.

107
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,541
Even if you hadn't
said that to me,

108
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,583
Sae and I have
no relationship.

109
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,875
What do you mean?

110
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,625
The reality is Sae's been
following me around

111
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,083
like a lost puppy and it's
borderline stalking.

112
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,375
She's decided to make me
her imaginary boyfriend,

113
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,375
and let me tell you, it's really
startin' to creep me out.

114
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:48,708
Wait. So she's stalking you?

115
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,583
She's just an inexperienced
kid with a crush, that's all.

116
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,500
I'll let her down easy, 'kay?

117
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,958
[SAE]
Uh...

118
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,583
[RYO, MISAO gasp]

119
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,291
Explain yourself, Ryo!
Why are you with her?

120
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,125
You tricked me.

121
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,416
You are such a bastard!
Here you are with this slut,

122
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,083
and you won't even
answer my phone calls!

123
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,750
Now what's going on?!

124
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,333
I'm with Misao because she
heals me like no other can.

125
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
She heals you?
That sounds like a load of crap!

126
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,083
You're obsessed with this
make believe relationship.

127
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,125
We've never had an
ounce of chemistry.

128
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,958
You're just in love with
the idea of being in love.

129
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,416
[SAE gasps] That's not true!
I do love you, Ryo!

130
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,208
I love you more than
you can ever imagine!

131
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,166
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you!

132
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,625
I just don't understand
what you see in her!

133
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,416
What is it that she does
that I don't, huh? Tell me!

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,375
That's easy.
Whenever she's by my side,

135
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,833
all of my worries and
problems seem to disappear.

136
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,666
That's what you don't do.
It takes no effort on her part.

137
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,708
Her presence alone
is like magic.

138
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,875
Damn you.
This is all your fault!

139
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,250
None of this would've
happened if you had

140
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,916
just stayed out of my life!

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's enough. This is the
last time I'll say it.

142
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,791
We have never had a
relationship, and we never will.

143
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,000
[SAE]
Uh?

144
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,916
[MOMO] Thanks. You can
head back now if you want.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,791
You sure?

146
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,041
[MOMO]
Huh?

147
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,291
'Cause I don't really want
tonight to end.

148
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,125
'Kay. Let's keep going.

149
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,666
[people murmuring]

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,500
It looks like something's
happening. Let's check it out.

151
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,958
[SAE] If that's how
you really feel,

152
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,541
then why did you sleep with me?!

153
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,208
You said you loved me!
You said I made you happy!

154
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,250
[TOJI]
Sounds like a stupid argument.

155
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,916
[MOMO]
I know that voice. Uh!

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,375
It's Sae!

157
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,166
Are you denying that you
said those things now?

158
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,750
Look, you need to stop

159
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,541
before you embarrass yourself
any more than you already have.

160
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,125
[SAE]
Uh!

161
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,375
Nothing you say can change the
way I feel. Come on, let's go.

162
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,833
[MISAO]
But...

163
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,291
There's something
you need to know.

164
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,416
I'm pregnant, and I
know it's your baby.

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,708
[ALL gasp]

166
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,041
[MOMO]
Pregnant?

167
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,416
Are you gonna man up now?

168
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,416
[MAN A] I can't believe
he knocked her up!

169
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,916
[MAN B]
I can.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,291
What did you say?

171
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,875
Weren't you listening?

172
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,583
I said I'm pregnant,
and it's your responsibility.

173
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,458
Lying won't solve anything, Sae,

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,875
no matter how good
you are at it.

175
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,458
So try giving it a rest.

176
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,291
[SAE gasps]

177
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,625
[MAN B]
You tell her man!

178
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,833
Trust me, it's not a lie.
It's the truth! I swear.

179
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,583
She was always
pulling stunts like this.

180
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,291
Calling me up with
some ridiculous lie

181
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,083
so I'd agree to meet her.
Let's go.

182
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,291
[RYO]
Uh?

183
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,875
A young girl has accused you
of something very serious,

184
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,958
and the only thing you can do is
claim it's some elaborate story?

185
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,583
I noticed that you
never actually denied

186
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,458
sleeping with her, so it
could be true. Couldn't it?

187
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,791
[RYO]
U-Uh... Uh-huh.

188
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,708
You and Sae should go someplace
more private to discuss this.

189
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,750
Follow me.

190
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,625
[MAN A]
Show's over!

191
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,333
[KAIRI, MOMO]
Uh...

192
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,625
Hey guys! Did you get
to see that lover's spat?

193
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,750
It was like watching one
of those soap operas!

194
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,541
Uh... We got here
in the middle of it.

195
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,916
Why's your brother with the
nurse? Do they know each other?

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,166
Huh? Wait, you mean
you haven't heard?

197
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,333
Where've you been, dude?

198
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,791
Misao confessed her
love to my brother,

199
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
and now they seem to be
an item! Who'd of thunk it?

200
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,125
For all the details, you can
ask your lady friend here.

201
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,583
Me? I don't know
anything at all.

202
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,083
This is the first
I've heard of it.

203
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,958
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
[chuckles] So much drama.

204
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,000
And I assume you heard
the other bit of gossip.

205
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,041
Sae's pregnant with
my brother's baby!

206
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,833
But is Sae really pregnant?

207
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,333
Your brother seems to think
it's one of her lies.

208
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,375
I honestly have
no idea if it's true.

209
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,791
This is the first time
I've heard of it.

210
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,916
Either way, I think my brother
handled it like a jerk,

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,583
but that's no surprise.

212
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,375
[MOMO] Listen to him. He's
acting like everything's normal.

213
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,541
Did Sae ever say if she
slept with your brother?

214
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,000
[KAIRI]
Why would she tell me?

215
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,833
All I know is I'm gonna
catch up with them,

216
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,916
and see if I can find out
any more dirt. Later!

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
Do you wanna get
outa here, too?

218
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,083
Okay.

219
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,541
[MOMO] Maybe that photo
didn't mean anything,

220
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,041
or maybe it means Kairi
still has feelings for me.

221
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,083
I guess he could be hiding them.

222
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,375
Wait, I'm way
over-thinking this.

223
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,625
[KAIRI] Why can't
I forget you, Momo?

224
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Huh. Where's my ID book?
I thought I put it in here.

225
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,791
Uh!

226
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,041
Did I drop it?

227
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,291
If anybody finds those
pictures, I'm in deep trouble!

228
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,208
But we were dating
exclusively for months,

229
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,375
so having a photo of her
wouldn't be out of the ordinary.

230
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,166
Yeah I have nothing
to worry about.

231
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,208
Oh, Momo.

232
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,166
You're so beautiful.

233
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,291
[MOMO] Just being with you
makes me happy, Kairi.

234
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,208
[KAIRI]
Momo.

235
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,416
I love you so much.

236
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,791
[panting]

237
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,958
I can't take it.
I have to have her!

238
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,166
I will find a way to
get you back, Momo!!

239
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,875
She isn't home yet.

240
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,375
Oh, right... Toji.

241
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,833
Uh?

242
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,375
[dog barking]

243
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,041
You'd think after all this
time that dog would like me.

244
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,666
Stupid mutt.

245
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,500
What the... It stopped.

246
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,625
Maybe they let him inside
the house for once.

247
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,500
--[dog growling]
--[KAIRI] Uh...

248
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,166
Thanks for walking me home.

249
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,291
It's good to know I have a
my own personal bodyguard.

250
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,541
You're welcome. I like
being your bodyguard.

251
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,041
I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, then.

252
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,541
Yeah.

253
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,083
[KAIRI]
Uh.

254
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,541
[dog growls]

255
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,666
Night, Momo.

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,250
Good night, Toji.

257
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,000
[MOMO]
Mm.

258
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,541
[dog groans]

00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,000
[dog barking]

260
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,583
All I ask is for one night
without any barking. Hold on.

261
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,625
[KAIRI]
Uh?

262
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,708
Wha... What are you doing here?

263
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,166
[KAIRI sighs] I must've taken
a wrong turn because I'm lost.

264
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,250
Sorry 'bout that. But I know
where I am now. See ya later.

265
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,833
[MOMO]
Kairi!

266
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,625
Kairi... I know you're not lost.

267
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:09,375
You came here for
a reason, didn't you?

268
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,791
[MOMO]
Uh...

269
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,083
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,875
Kairi?

271
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,166
I'm just emotional. Sorry.

272
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,708
[MOMO]
Uh!

273
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,500
[MOMO]
Why was Kairi crying?

274
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,708
I just couldn't do it... Momo.

275
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:41,750
Wow! Look, it's the ocean!

276
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:45,750
A-ha! I'm so happy!

277
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,875
[RYO]
Aren't you tired, Sae?

278
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,625
Oh, no, I'm fine.

279
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,208
I can't tell you how
long it's been

280
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,458
since I've felt so
relaxed and happy.

281
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,458
Great.

282
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,625
[laughs] Thank you, Ryo.

283
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,875
Yesterday, I could've sworn

284
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,791
you didn't wanna have
anything to do with me.

285
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:07,458
[MISAO] Now I want you two
to talk this out like adults.

286
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,541
[SAE]
Uh?

287
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,125
Why's that? I promised
I'd take you on a drive,

288
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,083
and I'm not one to
go back on my word.

289
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,416
Yeah. You're right.

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,208
Where do you think
we should go next?

291
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,041
I'd love to see more
of the coastline.

292
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,583
First, we need to talk,
Sae. Right now.

293
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,791
Huh?

294
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,791
Here you go.
I want you to have this.

295
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,125
Please, just take it.

296
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,833
[SAE]
What is it?

297
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,416
Huh?

298
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,291
[RYO] Sae... I don't wanna be
involved with you any longer.

299
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,458
[SAE gasps]

300
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,125
I realize now that I
wanna be with Misao.

301
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,375
I need to focus all
of my effort on her.

302
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,958
What're you talking about, Ryo?

303
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,708
What am I supposed to do with
this? And what about our baby?

304
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,375
You can't just expect me
to raise it all by myself.

305
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,500
Damn you.

306
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,666
If you're really pregnant,

307
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,583
then I have no intention
of being a father.

308
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,000
You can use the
money for the baby,

309
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,458
or go shopping for all I care.

310
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,291
[grunts]

311
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,791
You're a heartless bastard!

312
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,541
[RYO]
Hm.

313
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,333
As far as I'm concerned,
you and I are finished.

314
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,666
Now let's head back.

315
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,083
Do whatever you want.
The train station's that way.

316
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,541
[SAE] Wait, don't go.
I need you, Ryo.

317
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,875
Please don't leave me. Please!

318
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,250
I'll do anything you
want me to do,

319
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,625
just promise you won't
leave me. Please Ryo!

320
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,166
Anything? In that case,

321
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,583
there's a very important
favor I'd like you to do.

322
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,375
Whatever you want. I don't
care what it is, I'll do it.

323
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,875
[RYO] I want you to
never contact me again.

324
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,166
[SAE]
Huh?

325
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,291
[engine revs, tires squeal]

326
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,708
Ryo? No!

327
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,708
[MOMO] I wonder how
long he was out there.

328
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:51,291
He probably saw Toji and I kiss.

329
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:56,541
Was that the reason
he was crying?

330
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,333
[SAE] It's that no good
bitches fault. I know it is.

331
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,208
Hey, Sae?

332
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,833
[SAE]
Hm?

333
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,000
You look as pale as a ghost.
Are you feeling all right?

334
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,875
Okay, uhh. On Friday,

335
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,750
Toji and I were at the plaza
near the train station and we...

336
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,333
We happened to overhear
your conversation with Ryo.

337
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,333
[SAE]
Oh?

338
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,958
So, um... Is it really true
that you're pregnant?

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,916
Oh my gosh. Are you okay?

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,666
What are you gonna do now?
Is Ryo gonna help?

341
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,500
[SAE]
Oh yeah. Everything's fine.

342
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,250
We ended up working it all out.

343
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,416
[MISAO]
Uh!

344
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,083
[BOY A]
Nurse Misao, are you okay?

345
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,333
[BOY B] If you had
taken one more step,

346
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,041
it would've hit
you in the head.

347
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,333
[KAIRI]
This looks like the work of Sae.

348
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,708
I just saw her in the hall
and she looked strange.

349
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,166
[MISAO] There's no reason
to jump to conclusions.

350
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,791
It's not like I
saw who did it.

351
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,500
Who knows, it could've
been an accident.

352
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,083
Maybe.

353
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
[MISAO] Although if I were to
suspect anyone it'd be her.

354
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,916
She really hates my guts.

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,583
[KAIRI] I think it's a warning
to keep your distance from Ryo.

356
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,166
That's funny.

357
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,166
I've been seriously considering
breaking it off with Ryo anyway.

358
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,708
Oh, really?

359
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,500
If you decide to go through
with that and break up with him,

360
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,583
it'll be the smartest
decision you ever made.

361
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,583
The coldhearted side
you've seen of lately

362
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,666
is what he's really like.

363
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,833
[sighs]

364
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,500
I can't believe I've been
acting like such a fool.

365
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,416
All this time I've
been so preoccupied

366
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,291
trying to look pretty
and impress Ryo,

367
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,750
that I never took the time
to look at the real him.

368
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,500
Deep down, I know I should give
up on him, but I can't deny

369
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,125
these feelings I've had
for him all these years.

370
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,583
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,208
I know exactly how you feel.

372
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,750
Your heart's in a knot because
what you feel is conflicting

373
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,541
with what your brain
is telling you to do!

374
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,875
Kairi?

375
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,166
[KAKO, RITSUKO, NAMI,
MOMO laughing]

376
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,458
I don't believe my eyes!
Check it out!

377
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,041
[RITSUKO]
Woah!

378
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,166
[MOMO]
Uh...

379
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,250
We should tell those
two to get a room.

380
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,833
[KAKO]
Let's get out of here.

381
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,875
[KAIRI]
Uh!

382
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,041
Momo, wait!
It's not what you think!

383
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,791
Momo!

384
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,916
[KAKO]
What?!

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,291
Oh, it's nothing.
Sorry to bother you.

386
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,666
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

387
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
[KAKO]
Uh?

388
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,416
[MOMO]
Kairi.

389
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,041
[KAIRI]
Huh?

390
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,875
Well?

391
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,333
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

392
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,541
I was in shock about
Misao last night,

393
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,958
and somehow I ended up
wandering to your house.

394
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,458
Uh?

395
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,333
You're the only one I've told
about my history with her,

396
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,666
and I had no one
else to talk to,

397
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,500
so I figured I'd stop by,
in case you were home.

398
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,625
[KAIRI]
I'm just emotional. Sorry.

399
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,083
[MOMO]
So that's why he was crying?

400
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,083
Sorry you had to see me
actin' like a baby. See ya.

401
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,125
[MOMO] It was Misao he
was emotional about.

402
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,500
There I go with another mistake!

403
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,541
[traffic noise, horn honks]

404
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,250
--[TOJI] The light's red, Momo.
--[MOMO] Uh!

405
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
Ya know, you've been
acting funny all day.

406
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,750
Did something happen?

407
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,958
No, of course not I'm fine.

408
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,916
[MOMO] I'm sick of these games
I've been playing with myself.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm done being dragged
around by Kairi.

410
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:22,291
From now on, I refuse to waste
one moment thinking about him.

411
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,625
[MOMO]
Wow!

412
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,500
[TOJI]
Ya know...

413
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,416
[MOMO]
Huh?

414
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,291
[TOJI] I've been looking forward
to bringing you here again.

415
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,541
This is the spot where
we broke up before.

416
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,958
I didn't wanna
have a bad memory

417
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,333
associated with this place.

418
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,958
[MOMO]
Uh?

419
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,125
But if we have fun tonight,
then whenever we think of

420
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:46,541
being on this ride together,
it won't make us sad.

421
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,958
From now on, let's agree to
do everything in our power

422
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,333
to create only happy memories.

423
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,583
M'kay?

424
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,750
[MOMO cries]

425
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,125
[MOMO] Choose?
Right here? Right now?

426
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,583
Between the two of you?
Why am I hesitating?

427
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,958
This should be a no-brainer.
I don't know!

428
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,750
I don't know how I feel!

429
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,708
Next time on Peach Girl:
Forced to Choose.
