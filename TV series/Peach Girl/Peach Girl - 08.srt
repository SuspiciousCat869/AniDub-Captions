Remember, he was going out
with you last semester

always believe what I had to say

00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,375
Ugh. Give me a break! See ya.

159
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,875
Well, aren't you going to
tell me all about yours?

160
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,416
[SAE]
Excuse me?

161
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
What was it that made
you fall for Jigoro?

162
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,958
[SAE] I'll take one of these
and one of those.

163
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,333
Screw it. I'll take
one of everything!

164
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,791
[STORE CLERK]
Thank you, ma'am.

165
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,875
Let's hurry to the next shop.

166
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,625
You want more?

167
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,083
Did I hear you wrong?

168
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,625
I thought you were buying me
everything I wanted today.

169
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,958
You're right. While we're at it,
let's just buy the whole store.

170
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,416
I want more!

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,958
More. More!

172
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,291
I don't care what it is

173
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,708
just bring me the most
expensive thing you have!

174
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,833
It's not enough!
It's never enough!

175
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,500
Are you happy now?

176
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,375
What's going on? You've been
acting funny all day.

177
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,666
Well... How would you feel
about us having a secret sign?

178
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,333
Lke a signal.

179
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,833
A secret sign?

180
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,125
Yeah! Like if we make
an L with our fingers

181
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,875
like this it would
mean "I love you."

182
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,416
What do you think?

183
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay. I see what's going on.
You just want to hear me say it.

184
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,166
Look... I have no problem
saying that to you

185
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,875
so we don't need a silly
hand signal to show our love.

186
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,416
Not good enough.

187
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,916
Huh?

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,416
[SAE] That's just not enough!
I'm not satisfied at all!

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm better than her
in every way!

190
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,458
Better boyfriend!
Better clothes!

191
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,958
Yet how come she seems
so damn happy all the time?

192
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,750
I have everything a
girl could want,

193
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,875
yet why do I feel I've lost?

194
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm always in second place!

195
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,375
What is it that she has
that I don't?!

196
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,250
Dammit!

197
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,625
[SAE panting]

00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,041
Calm down, babe.

[SAE panting]

200
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,166
What was it that made
you fall for Jigoro?

[SAE panting]

202
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,250
He makes me happy every day.

203
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,708
And I love him more
as each day passes.

204
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,666
[SAE sighs]

205
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,083
It might be fun but
I'm dating the man I love.

206
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,375
If you have that,
what more can you ask for?

207
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,708
[SAE]
Huh...

208
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,958
I think you're jealous, Sae.

209
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,875
What's the one thing she
has in her life that I don't?

210
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,291
[JIGORO]
Sae.

211
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,333
Just tell me what it is
that you really want.

212
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,625
I'll get it for you.
Price isn't an issue.

213
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,583
You deserve the very
best money can buy.

214
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,875
No thanks.

215
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,041
What I want more than anything

216
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,875
is something you
could never give me.

217

[gasps]

218
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,125
Sorry, Jigoro, but I can't
go out with you anymore.

219
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,958
The only man I want in
my life is named Toji.

220
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,583
[MOMO]
Uh?

221
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,333
Your birthday's coming up
in a few weeks, right?

222
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,250
I was thinking you and I
could have a little party.

[MOMO gasps]

224
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,416
Toji! That's a genius idea!

[MOMO giggles]

226
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,375
I'm so excited for my party!
And it'll be just the two of us!

227
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,083
He remembered my birthday
without me having to remind him!

228
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:22,000
He's so perfect! I'm so lucky
to have such a caring boyfriend.

229
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,166
Is there anything in particular

230
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,708
you'd like me to get you
for your birthday?

231
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,791
[MOMO]
Uh.

232
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,875
Anything you give me,
I'll love. Really.

233
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,125
Could you just give me a hint?

234
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,291
You saying that
makes it even harder.

235
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,541
Think it over tonight.

236
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,833
Maybe you'll have some
ideas in the morning.

[MOMO]
Okay.

Thanks for being so sweet
and walking me home.

to getting my second kiss.

progress since the first one.

could have a little party.

Hold on!

00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,916
What are you running away from
me for? Do you have any idea

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,625
how rude that is?
If you're not gonna listen

269

then I'll just have
to force you to stop!

Stop being so stubborn!

I know what's going on.

273
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,041
You're obviously too disgusted
to look me in the face.

274
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,000
Not to mention you
haven't said one word to me

since school started,
and that was a week ago.

Are you mad at me?
And be honest.

277

I have no right to condemn you
for the decisions you've made.

I'm happy things are going
well for you and Momo.

Heck, you guys even have
your own secret sign

to say "I love you."

this looks to you?

[SAE]
I don't like him like that.

287
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,125
He's only chasing me around
for fun. He's one of those guys

288
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,625
that thinks that all women
are in love with him.

289
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,916
It's just hard because I don't
have any friends at school,

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,708
and at least being with
Jigoro makes it easier

291
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,375
to handle everything.

292
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,208
[SAE] I could see it in your
face when you looked at me.

00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,625
You think I'm a slut.

Uhh...

[SAE]
I don't blame you if you do.

296
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,291
[SAE] I convinced my best
friend's boyfriend to kiss me.

297
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,458
I manipulated you and fed you
all those lies about Momo.

298
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,000
I know, I'm a terrible person.

299
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,708
But I know how I feel
and I know what's right.

300
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666
I couldn't bear to see
you and Momo together.

301
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,208
And at that point,
I was willing to do

302
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,416
whatever it took
to break you two up.

meant playing dirty.

[TOJI gasps]

305
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,041
[SAE]
It's because I love you, Toji.

00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
That's the truth.

307
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,250
Remember when I asked you
to practice kissing on me?

308
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,708
When I said I had experience,

309
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,833
it was just an excuse
to kiss you.

310

That kiss was the first kiss
of my entire life.

wasting any time this year.

It got cold quick. Oh well.

Ah.

316
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,041
Earth to Toji.

317
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,375
Hey.

318
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,291
Did something happen?
You're staring into space.

319

Uh... No.

Ow!

Momo, are you okay?
Here, let me see it.

[MOMO]
He's so perfect.

Maybe we'll pick up
where we left off yesterday.

[MOMO]
I hope there's no one around

326
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,833
this time to ruin
the big moment.

327
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,291
Here goes nothing.

328
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,208
[MOMO]
Mmm.

330

[MOMO] This is so embarrassing!
What's he waiting for?

331
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,208
That kiss was the first kiss
of my entire life.

[TOJI gasps, sighs]

[MOMO]
Uh...

334
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,000
[TOJI]
We should head out.

335
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
[MOMO]
Stupid Toji!

336
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,791
Why didn't he kiss me
when he had the chance?

337
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,750
I was totally in the mood and
no one was around to ruin it!

338
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,208
I must have looked like
a complete idiot

339

standing there with
my lips all puckered.

340
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,958
[MOMO] Now that I think
of it, Toji was acting

341
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,916
a bit strange today. His mind
seemed to be somewhere else.

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,958
Did I do something to offend
him without realizing it?

[gasps]

344
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,708
[MOMO] Maybe when he went in
to kiss me I had bad breath!

345
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,250
Or what if I had something
hanging out of my nose?

346
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,958
Could that be why
he turned away from me?

Toji!

You got my letter! I'm so happy.

[TOJI yelps]

352
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,875
So after yesterday
I assume you must know

353
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,541
how I feel about things.

354
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,000
The fact is I'm still
in love with you, Toji.

355
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,750
I tried to get you out of my
mind, but it never worked.

356
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,333
You're the only one
I can ever love.

357
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,875
Sorry... I'm flattered,

358
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,708
but I don't feel the
same way about you.

359
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,750
There's only one girl
for me and that's Momo.

360
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,791
But you can't deny that
the reason you kissed me

361
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,041
was because you felt
something between us.

362

[SAE whimpers]

363
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,583
So you're not interested in me
at all? Not even a little bit?

364
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,750
Sorry.

[SAE whimpers]

366
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,000
So you mean to tell me

367
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,375
that you didn't feel one
spark when we kissed?!

368
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,625
Not one damn spark?!
'Cause if you are, you're lying!

There's no way you were
thinking about Momo!

This conversation is over.

Then at least tell me
what's so great about Momo!

374

Her love is unconditional.

You have to give me
one last kiss for the road.
