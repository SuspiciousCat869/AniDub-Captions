1
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,791
[MOMO] You and I have
nothing to talk about,

2
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,958
so leave me alone before
I do something you'll regret.

3
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,916
[KAIRI] Toji's in the hospital
with appendicitis.

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,375
[MOMO gasps]

5
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,625
I think Sae's tried to
keep it a secret from you.

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,375
[MOMO]
I'm gonna kill her!

7
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:07,791
Woah... Chill out,
Momo... Settle down.

8
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,333
Sae!

9
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,125
[KAIRI screaming]

10
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,791
[KAIRI] Too fast! Momo, slow
down, ease off the gas some!

11
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,000
No way! Now, shut up!
I'm trying to concentrate!

12
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,500
[KAIRI whimpers]

13
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,791
[KAIRI grunts]

14
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,125
My tailbone's
crammed into my chest!

15
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,833
[KAIRI yelps]

16
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,541
I'm such a moron!

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,541
Sae got the entire class to
keep me out of the loop.

18
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,583
And here's me, never
suspecting a single thing!

19
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,166
It eats me up to
think of that sick,

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,083
satisfied look on
her face when she saw us!

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,916
I need you to explain
to Toji that it was you

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,750
who put your arms around me,
and not the other way around.

23
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,958
Even though I know she's
probably already shot off

24
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,083
at the mouth to Toji
about whole thing by now.

25
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,666
Yeah, sure. But why'd
you tie my hands up?

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,875
[MOMO] That's to teach you to
keep your hands to yourself!

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,625
[KAIRI grunts]

28
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,166
Oh, come on!

29
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,458
Okay, now you've done it, Sae!

30
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,583
This time you have
gone way too far!

31
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,000
[KAIRI screams]

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,083
[SAE] When you first told
me the whole situation,

33
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,375
I thought it was way messed up.

34
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,125
There's no reason
you should have to keep

35
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,875
your relationship a secret.

36
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,625
But now, after what
I've seen today, I get it.

37
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,166
It's the only way she could go
out with both Kairi and you.

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm not one to speak
poorly about my friends,

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,583
but I never thought Momo would
act so whore-ish like that.

40
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,291
People who cheat are
the absolute worst.

41
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,458
I would never put up
with it. If it were me,

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,583
I'd dump that person
the second I had the chance.

43
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,166
Oh! I-I didn't mean that
you two should break up.

44
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,958
Tha-That's not what I'm
saying at all. Seriously.

45
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,583
[MOMO]
This train is too slow.

46
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,875
The driver must be
asleep or something.

47
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,125
[KAIRI] Momo, chill. Can't we
just sit down for a sec?

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,291
I kow you're in a rush, but
dragging me through the train

49
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,500
isn't going to get
you there faster.

50
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:05,541
I know that. I'm not an idiot.
I just feel anxious.

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,833
Thinking about Sae alone
with Toji makes me flip.

52
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,333
[SAE]
Open wide.

53
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,875
You wanna tell me
why you and Sae

54
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,375
are even friends in
the first place?

55
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,875
[MOMO]
I wouldn't call us friends.

56
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh.

57
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,250
[MOMO] Before school started
this semester, I caught a cold.

58
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,166
[KAIRI]
Uh-huh.

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,375
[MOMO]
It lasted for a while,

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,541
and I missed the first
week of school.

61
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,250
When I came back,
it wasn't a disaster,

62
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,875
it was just an embarrassment.
No one even noticed me.

63
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,833
All the school cliques
had already come together

64
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,333
and there wasn't any
room for a newbie.

65
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,541
The one thing that made me happy
was that Toji was in my class.

66
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:48,041
Only I couldn't really talk to
him. Maybe I was intimidated.

67
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,791
Then the rumor mill
started production

68
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,250
and I became a punch line.

69
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,208
Everyone was saying how
I'm easy, a slut, whatever.

70
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,583
Like any of them
had even bothered

71
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,250
to lower themselves
to talk to me.

72
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,583
That sucks.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,708
Keep in mind I didn't know
any of this at the time.

74
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,333
It's all just stuff crammed into
my ears by Sae since I met her.

75
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,125
[MOMO] Maybe that's how
the whole thing started.

76
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,916
I was depressed
and feeling alone,

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and then someone was there.

78
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,958
It's good to see
you again, Momo.

79
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
Remember me?

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,875
I'm the girl who gave you
the eraser during the exam.

81
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,208
[chuckles]

82
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,750
[MOMO] I hadn't felt that
happy in a long time.

83
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,083
Ugh... I should have
noticed back then.

84
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,125
Sae swore she could help
me out with the others,

85
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,625
but none of the cliques
would even bother

86
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,875
to look in my direction.

87
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,916
[KAIRI gasps]

88
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,833
[MOMO] Maybe that's it.
Maybe Sae got to Toji

89
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,416
and messed with his head
like she did with mine.

90
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,666
And if that's the case,
then nothing is actually wrong.

91
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,958
He could tell me one more
time that he loves me.

92
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,166
And everything would be okay.

93

94
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,916
No. I just spaced out.

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,916
[SAE] Here. This'll clean you
up. I'll get the mess down here.

on to girls like that.

Oh, it's nothing.

Uh... Hmm...

107
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,125
I can't believe
Toji's in the hospital

108
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,541
and we never heard about it.

109
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,958
Yeah, thanks for telling me.

110
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,458
Sure.

111
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,208
If you hadn't told me about
Toji, I still wouldn't know.

112
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,375
And I probably wouldn't

113
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,250
until they released
him from this place.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,333
It makes me kinda sick
to say it, but I think

115
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,708
you're the only person
who's on my side right now.

it's time you changed your gown.

Let go of me.

00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,541
Sae just slipped on
some water I spilled

140
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,166
and she landed on me.

141
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Oh, sure. Like I believe that.
And of course such an accident

142
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,541
would happen right
as I walk into the room.

143
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
[TOJI] Before you start
pointing fingers at both of us,

144
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,708
take a look at yourself.

Why did you show up
here with him?

146

Who, me? Don't worry,
I'm just here as counsel

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,708
to the accused
in these proceedings.

148
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,125
I'm sure we're all aware
of the events of recent days.

149
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,625
Momo was concerned that some of
these happenings have construed

150
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,458
some misunderstandings
of said events.

151
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,791
These are simply rumors
she'd like to dispel.

152
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,041
And for these reasons,

153
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,250
Momo and I decided to
arrive here together.

154

Would you please try
making some sense?!

How about this: You haven't
seen Toji in a while,

Momo had her arms around me

likes me, which is wrong.

00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,666
[BOTH laugh]

313
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,083
[SAE] Ow. O-Ow, that hurts!
My face doesn't work like that!

314
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,416
You've got guts.

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,625
That filthy mouth of yours

316
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,750
just spits out venom
like nobody's business.

317
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,791
[SAE yelps]

318
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,000
So do you want
to do this or not?!

319
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,583
Not in a million
freakin' years.

320
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,125
[SAE]
Wha--

321
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,458
Leave me, alone

322
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,666
[SAE gasps]

323
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,041
[MOMO]
Where should I begin this thing?

324
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,625
Oh yeah, right.

325
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,958
I'll start with the phone call
when you weren't feeling well.

326
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,833
Wait. I gotta ask
you something.

327
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,500
And I need you to
be honest with me

328
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,166
if we're gonna move any further
with this relationship.

329
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Yeah?

330
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,666
After that, I'll listen to
everything you have to say.

331
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,875
[MOMO]
What's the deal?

332
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,583
I just wanna tell him
how horrible Sae is.

333
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,750
That's fine. What is it
that you need to know?

334
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,708
It's just one detail.

335
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,625
Kairi.

336
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,375
Okay.

337
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,416
How do you feel about him?
Is he your boyfriend

338
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,458
or the just some guy you see
in the halls at school?

339
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,000
Stop it. You only think that

340
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,833
because Sae has messed
with your head so much,

341
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,000
that you can't tell what's real

342
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,166
from what she wants
you to believe.

343
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,541
[TOJI]
No, you're wrong.

344
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,583
Everything that's happened
has made me nervous.

345
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,666
But to tell you the truth, I was
worried about him a long time

346
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,166
before you and I
even got together.

347
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,208
I was shy, but I knew if
I didn't make my move soon,

348
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,500
he'd get you first.

349
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,958
You don't have to worry.

350
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,000
I have much better sense
and better taste

351
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,000
than to waste my time
with a cocky, slacker,

352
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,458
know-it-all like him.

353
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,500
All right.

354
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,291
[TOJI]
But when I see you two together,

355
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,250
I see something that works.

356
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,541
You're so natural, full of life.

357
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,125
And your personalities
are more alike

358
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,541
than either of you would
probably care to admit.

359
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,791
Are you calling me 
a know-it-all?

360
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,125
No. You're missing my
point completely--

361
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,166
[gasps]

362
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:02,625
Feel that? My heart is racing.
The only time my heart beats

363
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,791
that quickly is
when I'm with you.

364
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,750
I've never felt that with Kairi.

365
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,875
He's had his arms around me, and
he's even told me he loves me

366
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,916
but nothing compares to you.

367
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,000
I fell in love with you
the day I met you,

368
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,583
and that hasn't
changed since then.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,375
[FEMALE PATIENT B]
Give them their privacy.

370
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,916
[MALE PATIENT A]
Aw, I was just--

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,416
[MALE PATIENT D] Eavesdropping
on teenagers. Come on, now.

372
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
[BOTH laugh]

373
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,833
[MOMO]
This is the first happy moment

374
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,500
Toji and I have had
together in days.

375
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,125
[KAIRI] It's only a matter of
time before your secrets

376
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,041
and lies wear thin on Toji.

377
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,750
This might be the perfect
opportunity for you to back off.

378
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,708
You know, before all your
bridges go up in flames.

379
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,500
Back off? Then you're going for
the same cautious approach

380
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,750
with Momo, I'm assuming?

381
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,166
Not a chance. Why should
I have to give up?

382
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
I can still love
whichever lady I choose.

383
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,166
Oh yeah? You can just
keep pushing forward?

384
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,958
Why do I have to be the one
who has to back off then?!

385
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,625
Because you don't
actually like Toji.

386
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,208
You're just chasing him
down to get at Momo.

387
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,833
I think you probably
have some weird,

388
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,666
misdirected jealousy issues.

389
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,916
You should see the counselor.

390
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,875
[SAE]
Uh! I do not have issues!

391
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,166
Of course not. Look, Sae.

392
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,583
You're not gonna win Toji
over by tricking him.

393
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,083
You need to try a
more direct attack.

394
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,208
[SAE growls]

395
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,791
[KAIRI] Keep in mind
this is my advice.

396
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,041
And seeing how I kissed Momo
before we had ever gone out,

397
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,833
I'd take me with
a grain of salt.

398
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,416
[SAE] So that rumor was less of
a rumor and more of a fact.

399
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,458
[KAIRI]
Yep.

400
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,958
Thank you, Kairi.

401
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,666
Later!

402
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,458
[KAIRI] Uh! Oh, great!
I opened my big mouth again!

403
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,875
[SAE chuckles]

404
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,666
[SAE] With this ammo,
I'm ready for my direct attack!

405
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,875
[MOMO] I never changed the
meeting place to the cafeteria.

406
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,166
I swear. I was at the pool.

407
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,291
So that was another
of Sae's lies.

408
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,208
Huh, I wonder why she
keeps doing all this.

409
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,416
I already told you.

410
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,875
It's so you'd dump me
and go out with her.

411
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,958
It just doesn't seem like
something Sae would do.

412
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,916
[MOMO]
Uh...

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,333
I've said it before.

414
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,708
Sae is a genius when it comes
to the art of the lie.

415
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,500
And talk about a mimic.

416
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,333
She's always copying
everything other people do.

417
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,208
[BOTH gasp]

418
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,291
Momo's the one who's lying!

419
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,666
Don't fall for her crap again!

420
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,166
Uh...

421
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,000
In which of your sick fantasies
have I been lying to Toji?

422
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,125
Oh, shut up. You have a
relationship with Kairi. I know!

423
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,500
What are you talking about?

424
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,750
[SAE] Don't act all innocent.
You kissed him.

425
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,791
[BOTH gasp]

426
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,291
Didn't expect that,
did you, Momo?

427
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,083
I'm sorry! It slipped out!

428
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,875
Eh... So, how's it going?

429
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,000
Are they telling the truth about
this, Momo? Did you kiss him?

430
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,458
Uhh... Why, don't you let
me explain what happened--

431
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,916
I'm not talking to you.

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,416
[KAIRI gasps]

433
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,708
[TOJI]
Momo, tell me.

434
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,000
Did you kiss Kairi or not?

435
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,791
[KAIRI grunts]

436
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,666
I don't believe it.

437
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,500
[MOMO] I'm sorry you had
to find out like this,

438
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,750
but I never lied to you, Toji.

439
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,041
I kissed Kairi,

440
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,166
but it was before you and I
started going out.

441
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,208
[TOJI]
So nothing that happened

442
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,833
before we started
dating matters?

443
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,000
It's not like I wanted to.
Before I knew it,

444
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,458
he was kissing me. I didn't
have a chance to push him off.

445
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,583
[TOJI sighs]

446
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,833
You had the chance
when I made a move.

447
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,125
[MOMO gasps]

448
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,333
You really are in love
with Kairi, aren't you?

449
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,166
No way. The only person
that I love is you!

450
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,500
It was the kiss.

451
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,666
He kissed you once and you
completely fell for him.

452
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,500
You sound like you've lost it.

453
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,083
[TOJI]
Maybe. Maybe not.

454
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,083
What've you two been doing
since I've been in the hospital.

455
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,458
Laughing at me behind my back?

456
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,958
Are you seriously suggesting

457
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,083
that Kairi and I would
do something like that?

458
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,208
You should really try screwing
your head on straight!

459
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,458
[TOJI gasps]

460
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,875
Oh, and while we're on the
subject of kissing people,

461
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,125
why don't you go ahead and
explain to me what was going on

462
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,125
between you two in the garden.

463
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,875
I saw you with Sae
so don't try to deny it!

464
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,375
It wasn't a kiss.

465
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,958
[MOMO]
That wasn't a kiss?!

466
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,458
Uhh... No, it was...
something else.

467
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,333
What else could it have been?

468
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,333
[SAE]
Practice.

469
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,208
[MOMO gasps]

470
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,583
[MOMO]
Practice?

471
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,041
Yeah, for when you
finally got to kiss Toji.

472
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,666
Toji... you didn't.

473
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,375
[MOMO] You did this with her
so you would be prepared

474
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,458
for the same thing with me?

475
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,291
Yes.

476
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,375
Are you insane?!

477
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,833
Where did you get the idea
that its okay to go around

478
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,875
kissing other girls to practice
kissing the girl you like?!

479
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,666
I didn't think it was humanly
possible to be that stupid!

480
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,625
You're a stupid,
stupid boy, Toji.

481
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,875
[TOJI] Call me stupid,
but you're a liar!

482
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,250
At least I'm honest.
You can't even do that much.

483
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,458
So I don't think this
is gonna work out.

484
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,916
We should break up.

485
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,958
[MOMO gasps]

486
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,833
[MOMO]
Get over yourself!

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,416
Who do you think you are?!

488
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,916
How could you even
say that to me?!

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,333
I can't believe
you took that away!

490
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,333
It was the only
thing I had left.

491
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm the one who should be
breaking up with you!

492
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:17,916
[MOMO cries]

493
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,250
[KAIRI]
Momo, don't go! Momo!

494
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:33,916
[SAE cries]

495
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,541
[SAE]
Meow!

496
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,291
[MOMO] So there's this swim meet
and Sae recommended me for it.

497
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,375
Sounds like another one
of the rat's plans.

498
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,416
That psycho feeds on the
unhappiness of others

499
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,000
like she's never had a meal.

500
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,208
Next time on Peach Girl:
"The Swim Meet from Hell."
