1
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,916
[MOMO] I'm sorry, Kairi.

2
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,375
I just don't believe it
can work out between us.

3
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,541
Is that your final decision?

4
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,666
[MOMO] Yes.

5
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,791
So...

6
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,500
You're saying you
want to be with me.

7
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,625
[TOJI] Did you hear that, Kairi?
She said yes.

8
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,625
Now let us live
our lives in peace.

9
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,875
Let's go.

10
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,666
[KAIRI yelling]

11
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,708
Toji!

12
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,541
[TOJI] Kairi!

13
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,333
What did you teach that girl

14
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,000
when she was living with you
for all those years?

15
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,500
There you go again.

16
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,500
Blaming me for anything bad
that happens in this family.

17
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,166
Don't act so innocent.

18
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,458
[KAIRI] Taxi!

19
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,250
Just start driving!

20
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,791
[MOMO]
Where are you taking me?

21
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,041
Kids...

22
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,833
They don't even know how
to apologize these days.

23
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,458
[TOJI] Kairi!

24
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,083
Wait, Kairi!

25
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,750
Son of a bitch.

26
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,666
[SAE'S MOTHER]
Excuse me.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,416
Are you the one who called us?

28
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,583
Huh?

29
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,166
It was about Sae.
We're her parents.

30
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,750
How come you don't
wanna be with me?

31
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,416
There's plenty of reasons.

32
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Most of all, being with
you gives me anxiety.

33
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm tired of looking
forward to being with you,

34
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,375
waiting around, and then
being totally disappointed

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,791
when you flake on me.

36
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,458
Toji... He's not like that.

37
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,625
He's good to me, ya know?

38
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,416
And he really knows
how to treat a girl.

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,541
It's relaxing to
spend time with him.

40
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,458
While I was with you,
I cheated myself

41
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,375
by staying with you when
I wasn't your first choice.

42
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,208
I told myself
I was okay with it,

43
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,500
but in my heart
I knew it was wrong.

44
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,250
Kairi, I need someone
who's going to love

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,125
and treasure me
unconditionally.

46
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,375
That's why it'll
never work out between us.

47
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,875
But you're wrong, Momo...

48
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,708
I know I've made mistakes
but I won't make them again.

49
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,791
If you just give me another
chance I'll prove it to you.

50
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,291
You're such a liar!

51
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,916
How can you say that when
you're still in love with Misao?

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,375
No... That's not true!

53
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,833
She and I are only friends!

54
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,125
[cell phone ringing]

55
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,125
Hi.

56
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,208
Momo! You okay?

57
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,541
[MOMO] Yeah, I'm fine...

58
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,916
Right now we're
on Commerce Street

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,333
near the 4th Street bridge.

60
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,916
Where are you?

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,041
--Well... I'm--
--[MOMO] Oh, my batteries are--

62
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,083
Listen, Momo.

63
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,166
Misao is no more
than a friend to me.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,625
I don't have feelings for her.

65
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,375
You're the only girl in
my life now, and I love you!

66
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,083
You have to believe me!

67
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,625
Sorry, Kairi,
but I can't do that.

68
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,666
Come on... Why not?

69
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,666
I...

70
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,083
I love you so much, Momo.

71
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,291
So much it actually hurts!

72
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,166
[MOMO] I'm sorry,
but that's just not enough!

73
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,125
Then what...

74
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,041
What can I do to make it enough?

75
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,208
Well...

76
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,958
At this point you
can't change my mind.

77
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,208
'Cause this is the
way I feel about you.

78
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,750
[MOMO] I can't live my life
as a nervous wreck,

79
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,458
and I know that if I
gave you another chance,

80
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,333
I'd be making a mistake.

81
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,000
[TOJI] Momo!

82
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,666
[MOMO] My love.

83
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,791
[MOMO] Toji's the one.

84
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,208
[MOMO] Oh no...
My grades are in trouble.

85
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
At this rate,
I'm gonna have a hard time

86
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,625
getting into a decent college.

87
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,916
[TOJI] Don't worry.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,875
You still have a whole
year to get your grades up.

89
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,041
I guess so.

90
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,958
Do you wanna go to
the same college as me?

91
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,291
[MOMO] Are you crazy?

92
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,791
I mean, sure, that'd be great,

93
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,416
but I'll never be able to make
the kind of grades you do.

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,791
[TOJI]
Don't decide you can't do it

95
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,041
when you haven't even tried.

96
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,291
[MOMO] Some kids
are already prepared

97
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,666
for their entrance exams,

98
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,500
which means I need to
study constantly this year

99
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,541
to catch up.

100
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,166
I won't have any
free time, ya know?

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,208
Say, there's a three day
weekend coming up.

102
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,625
Do ya wanna go somewhere?

103
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,041
Uh, what?

104
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,666
A vacation!

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,458
With Toji?

106
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,458
No way!

107
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,791
Well...

108
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:00,833
Pretty soon, it'll be time
to start thinking about

109
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,250
getting into college
and all that,

110
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,166
so we wanted to get away
before things got too busy.

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,166
Oh...

112
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
I see where you're
going with this.

113
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,333
You want us to help you
figure out an alibi, don't you?

114
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,666
No, I don't think I'll need one.

115
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,875
We'll only be gone two days.
Three at the max.

116
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,291
[MOMO] But if another
typhoon were to hit

117
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,375
and we were stuck there,
then I guess I would need one.

118
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,583
[NAMI] That's true, Momo.

119
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,041
You have to be careful
and protect yourself

120
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,625
because you never really
know what's gonna happen

121
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,041
when you're on vacation.

122
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,333
So if I need one,
just in case...

123
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,958
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
We'll cover for ya.

124
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,541
So when are you going?

125
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,791
[MOMO]
Two weekends from now.

126
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,291
[KAKO]
And where are you going?

127
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,541
[MOMO]
We're not sure yet.

128
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,708
[SAE] You guys should
totally go to the beach!

129
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,083
That way you'd be able
to check out Toji

130
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,875
in his swim suit, right?

131
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,458
Sae?

132
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,625
[SAE laughs]

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,583
[MOMO] You seem to be
doing pretty well.

134
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm so glad.

135
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,625
Now that I know
I'm not pregnant,

136
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,791
I can finally get
on with my life

137
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,125
and try to have some fun...

138
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,958
It's like a tremendous
weight's off my shoulders.

139
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,500
What's up with you
and Kairi's idiot brother?

140
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,958
[SAE]
I know I did the best I could

141
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,625
and now I've put it behind me.

142
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,250
I wasn't able to
get Ryo to love me,

143
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,791
but that's okay 'cause it was my
first time to ever be in love.

144
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,250
Looking back,
I have no regrets about it...

145
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,875
It's a good experience.

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,666
[MOMO] I've never seen you
be this open before.

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,416
Well I guess I learned something
about myself, didn't I?

148
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,833
[laughing]

149
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,875
[MOMO] She went through
so much pain recently

150
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,875
and yet she seems fine.

151
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,875
But it's not like
she's putting up a front,

152
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,541
like she used to.

153
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,708
See ya later!

154
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,666
[MOMO] I gotta admit...

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm a little envious of her
being so in touch

156
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,791
with how she feels.

157
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,291
[SAE] Look at you moping around
feeling sorry for yourself!

158
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,166
What's wrong with you?

159
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,833
[KAIRI] What's up, Sae?

160
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,333
So how have you been?

161
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,625
Pretty good.

162
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,041
Except when I'm home
and my parents are there.

163
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,333
Oh, right...

164
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,333
You've had a lot of
crazy stuff happen to you.

165
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,541
[SAE] Gross!

166
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,875
Wh-What's your problem?

167
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,083
Why are you acting like this?

168
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,291
[KAIRI] Leave me alone.

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,958
I'm just a no good,
useless, dead battery.

170
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,041
Huh? What do you mean?

171
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,500
[SAE] A dead battery, huh?

172
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,625
I didn't know Momo
could be so harsh.

173
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,791
And you're giving up on her

174
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,958
because you guys
had one measly fight?

175
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,250
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

176
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,375
She won't believe a word I say.

177
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,458
Listen, you big baby!

178
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,083
A dead battery can be recharged

179
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,666
and brought back to life,
just like new!

180
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,166
So don't try to use that
as your lame-o excuse!

181
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
You never ever
take a girl seriously

182
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,833
when she's emotional,
especially when it comes to

183
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,541
someone as stubborn as Momo!

184
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,916
You're an idiot if you give up

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,708
because she probably didn't
even mean what she said!

186
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,750
Dumbass!

187
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,750
Thank you, Sae.

188
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,083
I never thought
being verbally abused

189
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,291
would ever cheer me up.

190
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,541
No problem.

191
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,000
[MOMO] There. I'm all packed up.

192
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,041
[MOMO'S MOTHER] Momo!

193
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,625
Your friend is here
to pick you up!

194
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,541
Hey Momo!

195
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,125
You ready to have
the best weekend ever?!

196
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,333
You don't really think
you're going with us, do you?

197
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,708
Oh, stop.

198
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,625
I just thought I'd give you
an alibi with your mom.

199
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,333
Plus, I wanted to
give you a farewell gift.

200
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,875
Farewell gift?

201
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,500
So tell me, Momo...

202
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,750
Are you happy now?

203
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,416
[MOMO] Yes, of course I am.

204
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,875
Oh really...?

205
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,041
I think you regret
kicking aside Kairi

206
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,833
'cause deep down you know
you made a mistake.

207
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,000
How dare you!

208
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,000
Come on, Momo,
you can be honest with me.

209
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,791
I bet it freaked you out when
Kairi told you he loved you.

210
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,833
But then you had Toji

211
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,458
and you couldn't
just toss him aside.

212
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,375
If you had, it would have made
you look like an evil witch.

213
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,750
You know, with Toji
going out of his way

214
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,083
to protect you and all.

215
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,041
So even if you wanted
to be with Kairi,

216
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,375
you'd still look like a jerk.

217
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,541
For the last time,
I don't want to be with Kairi!

218
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,041
I'm in love with Toji, okay?

219
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
And I'm happy.

220
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,375
So stop trying to ruin a good
thing and leave us alone!

221
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,833
Poor Kairi.
Going all the way to Shiranami

222
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,041
in the middle of a
typhoon just to see you.

223
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,500
He risked everything
and look where it got him.

224
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,541
[MOMO] Huh?

225
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,000
[MOMO] What did you just say?

226
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,041
[SAE] You and Kairi
were supposed to go

227
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,666
on a little beach
vacation together, right?

228
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,208
You see, after you left,

229
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,291
Kairi followed you and Toji
all the way to Shiranami beach.

230
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,375
[MOMO] How?

231
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,500
How do you know all this?

232
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,666
Because I was with him
to help him look for you.

233
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,166
Which, by the way,
was no easy task.

234
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,916
We went as far
as we could on train,

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,166
but because of the
typhoon we had to stop.

236
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,541
At that point Kairi took a taxi
by himself towards Shiranami.

237
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,958
On the way there,

238
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,750
the road was blocked by
some boulders that had fallen,

239
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,125
so he got out and walked
the rest of the way,

240
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,416
which must have been
at least twenty miles.

241
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,916
He knew he could have given up,

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,833
but he didn't because he thought
you were alone and crying,

243
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,500
and he wanted to comfort you
and be by your side.

244
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,166
But then, turns out
you weren't alone.

245
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,375
You were with Toji.

246
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,375
Kairi said he saw you.

247
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,375
You were standing
there with Toji,

248
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,708
waiting for the train at
the station the next day.

249
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,291
[MOMO] That can't be...

250
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,333
Kairi was there?

251
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,291
I don't know why
you were with Toji,

252
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,000
but I think it was
quite a blow to Kairi

253
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,666
to see you two together.

254
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,791
After all,
when you walk twenty miles

255
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,375
through mountains in a typhoon,

256
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,291
the last thing you want to see
is your girl with another guy.

257
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,125
Look, Momo,
I'm not trying to force you

258
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
to get back together
with Kairi or anything.

259
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,166
It's your life
and I respect that.

260
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,416
But I thought you'd want to know
the truth about what happened.

261
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,791
Even though you
never actually saw him,

262
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,541
he really went out of his way
to be there for you.

263
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,833
Oh! Gotta go!

264
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,208
Have fun on your trip.

265
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,166
[MOMO] No... That can't be true.

266
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,791
He acted like
nothing had happened,

267
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,833
even after I came back
from the beach.

268
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,083
[KAIRI] Morning!

269
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,791
Sorry I missed you
the other day.

270
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,833
I heard that you and
Toji got back together.

271
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,041
Congratulations.

272
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,625
[MOMO] He knew what
had happened, and yet...

273
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,458
...he didn't want me
to feel bad about it.

274
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,666
[KAIRI] I'm sorry.
I'm just emotional.

275
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,708
Sorry.

276
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,166
Come on... Why not?

277
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
I... I love you
so much, Momo.

278
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,166
So much it actually hurts!

279
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,333
[quiet sobbing]

280
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,250
[MOMO] What have I done?

281
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,333
[MISAO'S MOTHER] Oh, Misao.

282
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,458
You look so gorgeous, honey.

283
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,625
I'm just meeting him.
Nothing more, right?

284
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Please, you're gonna love him.

285
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
We're about a half hour early.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,708
You wanna sit down
and have some tea?

287
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,416
Kill me.

288
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
Is that Momo?

289
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
Really?

290
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,416
Yes, really.

291
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,541
They're going on a
quick trip together.

292
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,000
Just the two of them.

293
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,916
And you'll never believe
the weather forecast.

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
Another typhoon is
expected to hit the coast

295
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,708
right where they're
staying again.

296
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,583
They may be stuck there tonight!

297
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,875
[SAE] Aren't you
gonna go save the day?

298
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,333
[KAIRI] That's impossible.

299
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,041
It's too late to do anything.

300
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,250
That's disappointing to hear

301
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,833
after I went to the
trouble of telling Momo

302
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,500
the truth about last time.

303
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,041
When?!

304
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,208
Just now.

305
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,541
You should have seen
the look on her face

306
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,291
when I told her you saw
them at the train station.

307
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,500
She may even get cold feet

308
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,208
and decide not to go
on this trip with Toji.

309
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,041
Where do you get off
telling her that?!

310
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,916
[SAE] From you, idiot!
You told me to tell her!

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,208
[KAIRI] I'm dead.

312
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,083
Misao...

313
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,375
I honestly had no idea Kairi
had followed me there.

314
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,125
I feel so awful.

315
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,791
I can't imagine how he
must have felt, seeing us...

316
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,583
I broke his heart and
I didn't even mean to.

317
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,458
So that's how it happened, huh?

318
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,125
What I don't understand is...

319
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,250
...why Kairi neglected
to tell you the reason

320
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,291
why he was late
meeting you that day.

321
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you
talking about? Misao?

322
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,791
We were in the park
where you two were meeting

323
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,291
when Ryo was attacked.

324
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,750
He wasn't badly hurt,
but he left in an ambulance.

325
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,208
I was crying and hysterical
and a total mess.

326
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,250
So Kairi decided to go
with me to the hospital.

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,666
That's why he was late
meeting you for your trip.

328
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,416
Oh no...

329
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
[MOMO] What's wrong with him?

330
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,833
If he would have
just told me the truth,

331
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,833
I would have waited for him.

332
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,125
How was I supposed to know
if he didn't tell me?

333
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,166
Maybe he was hesitant
to tell you the truth

334
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,291
because he didn't want you
to take it the wrong way

335
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,125
and assume something worse...

336
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,166
He never even got a
chance to give you the rose.

337
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,958
Huh? What rose?

338
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,666
Earlier that day,

339
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,833
I ran into him at the
flower shop near the park.

340
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,916
He was there to buy you a rose,

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,333
and when I told him
that a red rose

342
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,333
symbolizes true love
and passion, he said...

343
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,958
[KAIRI]
When I give this rose to Momo,

344
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,291
she'll know how I
truly feel about her.

345
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,041
Then she can be confident that
she's the only one in my life

346
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,833
and number one on my list.

347
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,875
[MOMO]
I've done a... horrible thing.

348
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,083
Oh no...
I'm meeting with Toji soon.

349
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,750
[MOMO] But I can't see him
when I feel like this.

350
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,875
I know you're probably
feeling a lot of guilt right now

351
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,291
when it comes to Kairi,

352
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,166
but it's important for you
to focus on how you feel.

353
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,458
We've only been talking
about Kairi up to now,

354
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,458
but don't forget that Toji
has been very loyal to you.

355
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,083
He's a strong, patient person

356
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,875
who has really
looked out for you.

357
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,625
That's why you're
seeing him, right?

358
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,583
Both Kairi and Toji
love you very much, Momo,

359
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,083
and I think what they
want more than anything

360
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,958
is to see you happy.

361
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,250
Right now you need to
look deep into your heart,

362
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,000
and even deeper into your soul,

363
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,291
and find out what is
most important to you.

364
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,583
There's Toji, who's a smart,
mature, good-looking guy.

365
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,625
Then there's Kairi, who's
a bit more juvenile, but fun.

366
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,291
This is probably
the toughest decision

367
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,000
you've ever had to make, Momo,
but you're incredibly lucky.

368
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,250
You have two amazing guys
to choose from.

369
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,625
I wish I had that opportunity.

370
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,500
Don't be afraid.

371
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
As long as you stay true
to your heart, you'll be fine.

372
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,666
It's so hard.

373
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,791
[MISAO'S MOTHER] Misao.
We should get going soon.

374
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,625
[MISAO] Okay.

375
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,708
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,208
I didn't mean to
take up all your time.

377
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,416
Are you and your mom
going to a wedding today?

378
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,375
[MISAO]
Actually, it's a meeting...

379
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,583
For an... arranged marriage.

380
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,583
My parents set it up
without asking me first,

381
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,083
so I told them I'd go to
be nice and not rock the boat.

382
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,250
I just hope to get
a good meal out of it.

383
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,833
What about...
Kairi's brother Ryo?

384
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,916
Oh, him.

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,458
I came to a conclusion.

386
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,750
I can't be with someone who
lacks a soul as much as he does.

387
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,250
So I said goodbye.

388
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,625
He's still adorable, though.

389
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,666
[laughs]

390
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:16,083
[MISAO, MOMO laughing]

391
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,250
Ryo, what are you doing
looking at that?

392
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,000
[RYO] They're from a
parenting website I found.

393
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,625
[RYO] In a way,
parenting is almost like

394
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,666
the ultimate video game.

395
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,083
If you do poorly,
you end up with a bad child,

396
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,708
and you can't reset your game.

397
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,625
But, you could end up
with something very special.

398
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,041
[RYO]
I think I was wrong.

399
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,166
Maybe I do want to be a dad.

400
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,541
[SAE] Looks like Momo
isn't here yet.

401
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,583
[KAIRI] And when did she say?

402
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,583
Ten o'clock.

403
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,083
I hope she didn't
change her mind.

404
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,208
[giggles]

405
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,958
Maybe I shook her up
a little bit, huh?

406
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,041
You lucky stud!

407
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,541
You may still have
a chance with her!

408
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,458
Oh come on!

409
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,416
You can at least
try to be happy.

410
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,583
[MOMO gasps]

411
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,750
Oh no!
I'm over a half-hour late!

412
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,625
Toji's waiting for me
at the park.

413
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,333
[MISAO] Huh?

414
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,166
[MOMO] I'm sorry, Misao.

415
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,916
I have to go.

416
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,166
[MISAO] Well good luck!

417
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,875
Geez...

418
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,958
She must be having some déjà vu.

419
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,791
[MOMO] What am I going to do?!

420
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
By the time I get there,

421
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,791
Toji will have been waiting
over an hour for me!

422
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
How inconsiderate of me!

423
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,708
I, of all people,
should know what's it like

424
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,541
to be left waiting.

425
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm so sorry, Toji.

426
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,958
Just hold on.

427
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,791
She's an hour late...

428
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,083
Maybe she did get cold feet.

429
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,000
Kairi!

430
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
Wow... Toji left.

431
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,958
I thought he would've waited
around much longer than that.

432
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,541
Maybe with all the crap
you've put him through

433
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,708
having to fight for Momo
drove him to leave.

434
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,750
I know!

435
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,125
I should call up Momo
and tell her

436
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,333
that Toji just walked
away in a big huff!

437
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,791
--Give that back!
--That's enough already!

438
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,000
What good would it do
to call her at this point?

439
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,541
You're only gonna
make things worse.

440
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,750
[SAE] Get real!

441
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,666
I'm helping you out
more than you deserve!

442
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,166
Stop acting so righteous
and give me my phone!

443
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,875
Now!

444
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,083
No way!

445
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,541
[SAE] Don't make me
hurt you, 'cause I will!

446
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,375
It's Momo!

447
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,666
[sobbing quietly]

448
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,708
[TOJI] Momo!

449
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,250
Haha, hey there!
Right on time.

450
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,000
Uh... yeah.

451
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,333
I'm just kidding.

452
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,500
You know this is exactly
how I imagined you'd look

453
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:37,083
when I knew you were
running late. Here.

454
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,583
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,583
[TOJI] Don't worry.

456
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,333
I knew you wouldn't
just bail on me.

457
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,875
You're not that type of person.

458
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,500
[MISAO] Right now you need
to look deep into your heart,

459
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,958
and even deeper into your soul,

460
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,250
and find out what is
most important to you.

461
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,791
This is probably
the toughest decision

462
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,375
you've ever had to make, Momo.

463
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,791
Don't be afraid.

464
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,291
As long as you stay true
to your heart, you'll be fine.

465
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,250
[MOMO] Thank you.

466
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,166
[TOJI] Let's have some fun.

467
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:08,833
[MOMO] Kairi...

468
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,875
Was I just running
away from you,

469
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,500
or was I afraid
of losing you again?

470
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,041
Either way, I'm done running.

471
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,791
This time I'll face you, Kairi,
no matter how it turns out.

472
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,291
Next time on Peach Girl,
it's the final episode.

473
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,791
The Last Typhoon!
