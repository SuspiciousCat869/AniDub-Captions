experience with CPR,

158
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,083
I finally fought him off me

159
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,083
and told him I wasn't
that type of girl.

160
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,041
It really kind of
scared me, Momo.

161
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,208
Hold on!

162
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,625
This jerk is moving
way too fast...

163
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,500
He's trying to take
advantage of you.

164

You really think so?

165
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,541
You've only been
seeing him for a week

166
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,541
and he's already trying
to get in your pants.

167
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,958
Who is this guy anyway?

168

He's someone you know
quite well, actually.

dumped you once

and now you're back
together with him?

he's trying to do to you!

you talking about?

No. Not him.

So what do you think I
should do about this, Momo?

180
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,791
I'm afraid if he tries
to kiss me again,

181
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
he'll just overpower me.

[MOMO] Toji together
with Sae? That's impossible.

185
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,958
It's all a lie. It has to be.
I refuse to believe this!

186

Hey. Over here.

187

He's as gorgeous as ever.

Mm-mm.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,916
There's no way
Toji could act so calm

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,416
if he was seeing another
girl behind my back.

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,250
Besides, that's just
not like him.

193
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,708
I should know by now
not to believe Sae.

194
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,583
It wouldn't be the first time
she's lied for her own benefit.

Use this to pay
for us. I'll be back.

Wait a minute.

That's the same one Sae
was wearing in class yesterday.

199
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,000

[TOJI gasps]

[MOMO] The last thing
I want to do is believe Sae...

208
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,875
but the fact that Toji
had this in his wallet

209
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,583
means that she did go
over to his house.

210
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,000
Yesterday, he invites me over
to his house, I-I get there,

211
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,500
and no one else's home,
so I get suspicious.

212
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,458
And, sure enough, he tries
to lay a big kiss on me.

You and Momo have
a fight or something?

[MOMO]
Why did it have to come to this?

219
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,791
I can't even look
him in the eye.

Yo!

Where the heck
did you come from?

So how's the boyfriend?
You two make out yet?

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'd be extra careful
though, if I were you...

Guys like Toji may seem
cool on the outside

turn out to be sex maniacs.

So Momo told you that
we're together now?

233
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,708
Because I thought we
were keeping it quiet.

Yeah, and if you need to
talk about any of this,

I'm here for you.

O-Okay...
I'm totally confused.

I just can't figure out why Momo
was acting so strange yesterday.

238
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,208
[SAE] Well, it's obvious
that something upset her.

239
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,000
You saw her giving
mouth to mouth to Kairi

240
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,375
the other day, right?

241
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,375
She may think that
she hurt your feelings.

242
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,458
Plus by having her lips
on another man,

243
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,750
it kinda puts her in
a bad light, you know?

244
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,750
But... That doesn't
make any sense.

245
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,458
If Momo hadn't given him CPR,
he could've died.

246
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,000
It didn't bother me at all.

247

I have go talk to her before
she heads home for the day.

248
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,958
I-I wouldn't do that.
She'll take it the wrong way.

249
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,375
Look... Telling someone
it doesn't bother you

250
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,458
is the same as telling them that
it does bother you. Got that?

251
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,291
Then... What should I do?

You're gonna love this plan.

253
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,041
Say nothing about what happened
before and just kiss her.

fly out the window.

kissed a girl before!

How's that possible?!

263
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,625
In junior high, all I
thought about was baseball,

264
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,208
so I never had a girlfriend.

feeling okay, Momo?

Toji actually did
me a huge favor.

you're his girl,

then sucking face with
Sae behind your back.

herself on him.

but she wouldn't let go of him.

It may have even been
a surprise attack.

just telling yourself

Does she really think
I won't say anything?

And doesn't Toji feel the least

You're starting to scare me.

Toji and I are in love

into each other lately...

Just earlier today, he
kissed me for like a minute

in the school's garden.

But from what I saw,

it looked more like you
forced yourself on him.

I guess Toji really
wanted to find out

00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,458
what it was like to
kiss someone like you.

375
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,500
Although, I did
find it a bit weird

376
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,250
that recently he'd been
paying more attention

377

to you than normal.

378

You told Kairi the other day

379
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,458
that you'd been in love with
Toji since junior high.

Well, sorry to break
the news to ya,

but Toji and I were
making out at the time.

that he's in love with you

the very next day is crazy!

He must have assumed that
getting a kiss from you

385
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,916
would be easy.

you were doing,

on the swim team,
