You better stop
dogging it out there.

Oh, sorry.

really starting to piss me off.

Sorry, boys.

What are you
apologizing for, Sae?

I think Momo hates that
you guys are on my side.

00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,833
So by losing all her races
it's her way of getting revenge.

Isn't that terrible?

She even went so far as to

me against my will!

But the truth is...
I actually feel relieved.

70
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,208
For once, someone seemed to

being by my side.

00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,833
Being seen with you
isn't helping my image.

158
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,875
Fine. And in return,
you might wanna try

159
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,541
being a little nicer to Momo
from now on, okay?

160
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,250
Later!

161
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,958
[KAIRI chuckles]

162
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,166
Hmm.

163
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,250
Toji.

164
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,375
That was a perfect
introduction to the real Sae.

165
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,666
[KAIRI]
Shocking, huh?

166
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,916
While we're on the
subject of kissing people,

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,166
why don't you go ahead and
explain to me what was going on

168
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,583
between you two in the garden?

169
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,000
Where did you get the idea
that its okay to go around

170
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,041
kissing other girls to practice
kissing the girl you like?!

171
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,875
I didn't think it was humanly
possible to be that stupid!

172
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,583
You're a stupid,
stupid boy, Toji.

173
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,250
[crying]

174
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,875
[TOJI]
Momo.

175
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:15,958
[SAE humming]

176
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,000
[SAE]
Hm?

177
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
What's going on?
No, let me guess.

178
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,625
We lost another race?

179
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,208
Ha... Guess again.

180
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,750
[ANNOUNCER] And coming in first
from Class Three is Momo Adachi!

181
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Uh?

182
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,958
[TORU] She's won
three races in a row.

183
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,791
[ANNOUNCER]
And there's the start

184
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,375
of the women's
100-meter freestyle.

185
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,041
Breaking out to an
early lead is Momo Adachi.

186
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,458
She's already two full lengths

187
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,958
ahead of her nearest competitor
before the first turn!

188
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,583
[YUJI]
What happened to Momo?

189
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,333
I can't believe how fast she is.

190
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,041
[SAE]
Damn her.

191
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,333
[MALE STUDENT F]
She's amazing!

192
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,708
--[YUJI] Unbelievable!
--[SAE growls]

193
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,291
[TORU] I take back what
I said about her!

194
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,083
[OKADA] Who was it again
that was saying Momo was

195
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,625
losing on purpose? They need to
get their head checked out!

196
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,083
[OKADA yelps]

197
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,791
Woah, Okada! You okay, man?!

198
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,000
[HIRO]
He's out cold. Who threw that?

199
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,416
[SAE growls]

200
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,875
[TOMIKO]
This isn't fair.

201
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,791
Class Three has a swim team
member in all their races.

202
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,541
Look, isn't that the girl
we saw in the locker room?

203
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,958
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,166
[REN]
We saw her hugging a boy

205
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,666
and the only thing she
had on was a towel.

206
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,000
[CHO]
No way.

207
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,791
[EIKO] Did you get a good
look on who the guy was?

208
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,666
Of course. It was Kairi
from Class Four.

209
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,125
[TOMIKO] Get out! So I
guess it's true then, huh?

210
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,666
[CHO]
You mean about them going out?

211
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,750
[REN] Well, it's pretty
obvious now, don't ya think?

212
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,333
[SAE chuckles]

213
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,291
[MALE STUDENT J]
Man, I'm starving!

214
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,000
[MALE STUDENT K]
Momo! Nail that next race.

215
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,875
[MALE STUDENT L]
What's up, All Star?!

216
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,000
[YUJIO]
Keep it up, Momo.

217
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,250
[MALE STUDENT M]
I'm betting on Momo!

218
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,666
[MOMO]
This is strange.

219
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,291
I've gone from being
the least popular

220
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,083
to the most popular girl
in under an hour.

221
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,958
It probably won't last though.

222
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,291
[SAE] Sounds like your
stock sure has risen.

223
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,333
[SAE]
Hm.

224
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,458
You know I heard about you
throwing yourself at Kairi

225
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,250
in the locker room
with nothing but a towel on.

226
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,208
I would have loved
to have seen that!

227
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Oh, Momo.

228
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,125
Here you are, barely
broken up with Toji,

229
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,750
and already you're getting
it on with some other guy.

230
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,500
I have to question
your taste on this one.

231
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,458
Kairi's famous in this school
for being a sex-crazed pervert

232
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,375
who will sleep with
anything that moves.

233
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,125
[MOMO grunts]

234
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,291
[SAE]
Everyone knows

235
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
that Kairi's never had a
real relationship.

236
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,333
He'll just have his fun with you
then toss you in the gutter

237
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,958
like he would with any girl
he picks up in the hallway.

238
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,416
I mean, just look at him.

239
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,083
He's the poster child
for a shallow,

240
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
good for nothing,
all around loser.

241
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,291
Granted he is kind of cute,

242
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,208
but that's all he's got
going for him.

243
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,875
Marginal looks with
a void inbetween the ears.

244
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,708
Or maybe you like that.

245
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,416
You don't know.

246
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,708
You don't know anything
about Kairi so shut up.

247
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,875
[SAE gasps]

248
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,541
[KAIRI] So I take it you've
never been involved with someone

249
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,500
as conniving and manipulative
as Sae before, huh?

250
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,958
You're too naïve man.

251
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,000
That's why she could take
advantage of you so easily.

252
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,666
You must come from a
good, honorable family.

253
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,083
[KAIRI]
You all right?

254
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,958
[TOJI] Hold on. I don't think
I can show my face to her.

255
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,375
Oh, come on.

256
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,833
[SAE crying]

257
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,500
Why?

258
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,250
What's wrong?

00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,750
Are you okay?

260
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,125
[SAE] I was minding my own
business! I didn't do anything!

261
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,000
And then Momo, she...

262
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,041
Stop it!

263
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,125
Okay, he may not
be the perfect guy,

264
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,958
but Kairi does have a lotta good
things going for him!

265
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,583
And at least he's honest.

266
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,041
But, Momo!

267
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,833
I thought we were friends!

Geez, Momo. I don't know
what just happened here,

00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,208
but there was no reason
for you to hit her.

No kidding. Everyone in class
is digusted with the way

272
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,833
you've been trying to disrupt
Toji and Sae's relationship,

273
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,500
but since you've been
swimming so well today,

274
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,333
we were willing to root for you
and give you another chance.

And now you've gone ahead and
flushed that down the toilet.

No way. If there's anyone who
should be apologizing, it's Sae.

281
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,708
Are you delusional? You just hit
her in the face for no reason!

282
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,125
[YUJI] Poor thing. Her
cheek is starting to swell.

Oh no... This is not good...

284

It's just like the lion
and the gazelle.

Who cares about that?
We have to help her.

286

Hold on.

287
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,000
I've got the perfect plan.

Where are we going?

If we don't hurry back and stop
them, they'll eat Momo alive.

There it is.

and expect to save the day
and get the girl?

Sorry, bro, but this is my big
chance and I'm not giving it up.

298
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,291
Momo knows that I've been
on her side the entire time.

299
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,625
And she's gonna be so impressed

when I save her from those
bloodthirsty wolves.

fall in love with me!

I'm gonna beat...

This is payback for
making Momo cry.

you really feel.

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,916
Okay.

468
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,958
I'm so sorry.

469
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,958
I was such a jerk
to you for so long

470
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,125
and I didn't even
realize it until today.

471
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,708
I'm... I'm sorry
for what I said

472
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,291
when you were in the hospital.

473
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,166
Then let's start over.
Right now.

474
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,666
Yeah.

475
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,791
[MOMO] Toji, how about if we
make a secret hand signal

476
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,708
for just the two of us. See?

477
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,333
We'll make the shape of
an L with our fingers

478
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,958
and that will mean I love you.

479
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,791
Oh, come on!

480
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,083
Next time on Peach Girl

481
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,833
"A Brief Love Sign."
