Toji!

[KAIRI]
Mm. Oh Momo.

00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:10,500
[MOMO] All I ever wanted
was to find happiness.

5
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,666
It's okay for me to
be happy, isn't it?

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,000
I spent the whole
month at the beach.

Huh?!

00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:30,958

Did you hear what happened?

00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,166
[SHOJI, TORU, NOZOMI]
Huh?!

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,000
[NOZOMI] What are those
two doing together?

11
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,375
[TORU]
I thought they broke up.

00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,833
[KAKO]
Momo! Come here.

17
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,416
What's going on?
Why are you walking with Toji?

18
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,791
Everyone saw you guys together

19
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,208
and now there's
rumor's flying around.

20
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,708
Oh. Yeah.

21
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,958
We understand if you like him,

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,625
but try not to be
so obvious about it.

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
You know how this school is.

24
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,958
We were all thinking you
and Kairi were a done deal.

[MOMO]
Uh...

26
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,000
[RITSUKO] So he never met
up with you the other day?

27
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,375
[KAKO]
That guy is such an idiot.

28
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,083
I can't believe he
blew you off like that.

29
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,458
He doesn't deserve you.

30
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,916
How do you know all this?

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,666
Because he was frantically
trying to find you

32
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,750
all day yesterday. He called
each of us at least once.

33
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,625
[MOMO gasps]

34
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,166
[KAKO] We were starting
to get worried, too.

35
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
I must have tried calling
your cell two dozen times

36
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,541
in the last day, but I kept
getting your voicemail.

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,791
Sorry. I turned it off.

38
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,416
[KAKO laughs]
That's what I figured.

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,125
[RITSUKO] So, what'd you
end up doing yesterday?

40
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,208
[NAMI] You know,
yesterday I had to meet someone

41
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,458
at the train station
here in town.

42
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,208
I saw you walk
out of the station.

43
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,750
[KAKO, MOMO]
Uh?

44
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,208
I noticed you were with Toji.

45
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,125
I thought you'd just
bumped into each other.

46
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,041
Be honest, Momo. Did you
go on the trip with Toji?

47
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,250
[MOMO]
Huh?!

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,666
Basically, Kairi didn't show up

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,250
so you went and found
the nearest backup.

50
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,666
I can't believe you did that.

[NAMI]
Be honest, Momo.

00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,291
Did you go on
the trip with Toji?

55

show up so you went

I can't believe you did that.

00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,791
[MOMO]
What am I going to do?

58
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,125
I wonder how Kairi will
react when he hears this.

59
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,166
Should I say something
when I see him?

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,416

you the other day.

Shut up!

00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,208
[MOMO] What the heck?
He looks so happy.

68
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,416
He's acting like
nothing happened.

69
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,708
[MOMO]
I'm so stupid.

70
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,375
He clearly had no intentions

71
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,916
on ever showing up
that day at the park.

72

I'm done with him, and I'm not
gonna let him bring me down!

Mm.

[MOMO]
What about Ritsuko and Nami?

80
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,166
[KAKO] They went to
save us some seats.

81
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,958
So I don't mean to pry Momo, but
what's going on with you lately?

82
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,833
Are you and Toji seeing
each other again?

83
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:42,833
Yeah.

84
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,583
Oh, that's cool.
I'm happy for you.

85
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,041
Sorry if I acted weird,
but it all happened so suddenly,

86
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,458
you know? Can I ask
you something else?

Sure.

88
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,333
What was it exactly that
made you go back to Toji?

89
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,458
Because through all the
crap I've dealt with,

90
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,916
he was always there.

91

of a long story.

What happened between
you and Momo?

00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,541
She showed up this morning
hand in hand with Toji!

Are you okay with that?

same place together all summer.

flirting with each other.

00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,916
Look, I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

Hey, Misao. What's goin' on?

109
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,416
I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but I saw your friend Momo

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,291
show up at school
this morning with Toji.

111
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,125
[KAIRI]
Uh.

112
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,916
You're only the twentieth
person to tell me that.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,125
Did you ever meet her after
you left the hospital?

114
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,750
I missed her.

115
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,041
Well, did you at least
tell her why you were late?

116
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,250
Uh-uh.

117
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,875
Damnit, Kairi,
what's the matter with you?

118
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,041
I'll tell her myself,
if that's what it takes.

119
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,875
[KAIRI] No wait,
please don't! It's okay.

120
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,791
What's okay?
You made your choice.

121
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,166
You decided she was the one.

122
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,708
That's why you have
to tell her the truth!

123
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,500
She'll understand!

124
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,708
Huh?!

125
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,541
I think it's too late for that.

126
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,083
You're not acting like yourself.

127
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,500
I've never seen you give up
on anything this easily before.

128
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,541
Uh?

129
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,833
Woah. What happened
to your face?

130
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,916
Oh. It's nothing.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,750
I just fell down
some stairs, that's all.

132
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,125
Do you expect me to
believe that? Let me see.

133
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:34,583
[KAKO] Oh. I see. It's all
starting to make sense now.

134
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,375
I had no idea that
was happening.

135
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,666
You did a good job hiding it.

136
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,375
Well, we better get going.

137
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:45,291
You're so secretive, Momo.
You never tell us anything.

138
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:45,875
Yeah.

139
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,208
Don't worry.

140
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,916
It's not like it's an
easy thing to talk about.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,666
It is pretty cool though.

142
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,125
Now I know why Toji
started dating Sae.

143
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,458
Everyone assumed that he was
just chauvinistic jerk,

144
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,416
but the fact that he did it to
protect you is so romantic!

145
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,791
Most guys wouldn't go
that far for someone.

146
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,916
To be honest, I don't think
he coulda done anything else

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,875
in that situation. After all,

148
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,958
you two have been crazy
about each other for years.

149
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,916
[KAKAO] Oh.
[MOMO] Uh?

150
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,541
[MOMO]
Let's go.

151
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:26,083
[MOMO] So, even now, Kairi
still has feelings for Misao.

152
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,166
[PRINCIPAL]
I want you all to buckle down,

153
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,333
and really work
hard this semester.

154
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,875

Uh...

00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,791
Great. Now they all hate me.

158
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,958
No, it's not like that Momo.
Just a few weeks ago,

159
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,958
Nami had an ugly break up
with her boyfriend.

160
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,541
[MOMO]
Huh?

161
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,000
A few days went by where she
couldn't reach him on the phone

162
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,125
and the next thing she knew,
he dumped her. Just like that.

163
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,875
Now he's got some new girlfriend
he's traipsing around with.

164
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,458
Oh.

165
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,125
None of that has anything to do
with you, but I think the whole

166
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,833
Toji thing is a reminder
her of her own situation.

167
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:09,208
Don't take it personally.
She's just a bit on edge.

168
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,791
[NAMI]
I don't believe this!

169
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,375
Uh. She plans a trip with
Kairi and takes Toji instead!

170
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,583
Nami, keep your voice down.
Look, I don't think Momo's

171
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,916
the type of girl to jump so
quickly from one guy to the--

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,333
Oh yeah, don't be so sure!

173
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,458
I didn't mention this earlier,

174
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,000
but when I saw her
with Toji yesterday,

175
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,500
they were in each others arms!

176
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,750
What?

177
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,666
[NAMI] And the one who
made the move was Momo!

178
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,250
She did it right there on
street in front of everyone.

179
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,208
I have totally
misjudged that girl.

180
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,958
[MOMO] I wonder if I should
tell Kairi about Toji.

181
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,500
I'd rather have him
hear it from me

182
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,666
than from someone else in class.

183
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,666
But first, I have to be sure
I'm making the right decision.

184
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,083
Am I doing the right thing
by going with Toji?

185
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,708
[MOMO] Sae! Are you
just now getting here?

186
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,125
You missed the opening ceremony.

187
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,375
[SAE]
I started to feel sick

188
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,291
while I was walking
here this morning.

189
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,333
Are you okay?

190
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,791
You're as white as a ghost.

191
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,708
[SAE groans]

192
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,500
[MOMO] Let me help you
to the nurse's office.

193
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
Misao should be able
to do something.

194
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,041
No way! I don't need that stupid
bitch to take care of me!

195
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,916
[MOMO] Sae? Have you been
eating well lately?

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,291
You look a little too thin.

197
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,291
[KAKO] Starving yourself
is no way to lose weight.

198
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,625
It's unhealthy.

199
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,041
[SAE]
I'm going home.

200
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,125
All that's left today
is homeroom, then we're done.

201
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,541
If you can find
somewhere to lie down,

202
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,333
I can take you home after that.

203
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,166
No thanks. I can
manage on my own.

204
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,333
But. Uh.

205
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,583
Sae. What happened?

206
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,500
[SAE]
Huh? Nothing.

207
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,958
[MOMO]
Are you sure?

208
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,583
[ALL gasp]

209
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,750
Let's go.
It stinks in here.

210
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,125
[KAKO]
Nami, wait!

211
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[foot steps]

212
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,166
[KAKO]
You need to cool off.

213
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,916
You've been acting
like a jerk all day.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,916
Everyone knows you're going
through a tough breakup,

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,833
but don't bring Momo
down with you!

216
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,625
Sorry. I know I've been rude,
but as for Momo,

217
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,875
I just can't forgive her.

218
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,375
It's like she wanted
insurance on her boyfriend.

219
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,791
Like if things didn't
work out with Kairi,

220
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,208
she could rebound back to Toji
without missing a breath.

221
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,875
I think it's just
plain disgusting!

222
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,916
Couldn't you at
least wait a week?

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,500
[KAKO]
Nami, listen!

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,791
She did what she did because of
things you know nothing about!

225
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,875
I don't care what
happened to you, Momo!

226
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,916
All I know is that you're
shallow enough to take Toji

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,333
on a trip that you had
already promised to Kairi!

228
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,291
It's like you didn't care
which one of 'em went!

229
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:31,000
[KAKO]
Nami! That's enough!

230
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,416
[MOMO] Even if Kairi
had shown up that day,

231
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,541
I still don't think I
would've gone with him.

232
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,083
[KAKO, NAMI, RITSUKO]
Huh?

233
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,291
[MOMO] He knew that I would
only wait five minutes for him.

234
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,791
But why?

235
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,875
If you really loved him, you
would wait longer than that.

236
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,791
[MOMO] It was because I loved
him that I couldn't wait.

237
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,250
Those five minutes meant
the entire world to me.

238
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,041
What? Hold on.

239
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,208
You love him so much
that you can't wait for him?

240
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,125
I don't get it.

241
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:55,666
[KAIRI]
Nami.

242
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,083
[NAMI]
Uh?

243
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,708
You should give Momo
the benefit of the doubt.

244
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,708
--[NAMI] Uh?!
--[MOMO gasps]

245
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,833
[MOMO]
Kairi! He heard all that?

246
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,666
Help me make some sense of this.

247
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,500
You had a reason
for being late, right?

248
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,750
But she wrote you off without
giving you a chance to explain.

249
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,083
I made the mistake of putting
someone else first.

250
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,000
[MOMO]
Uh?!

251
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,458
Someone else? Wait,
are you saying you're in love

252
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,875
with someone
else besides Momo?

253
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,541
I heard that you and Toji got
back together. Congratulations.

254
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,708
I'm sure you two will
be happy together.

255
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,250
Sorry if I let ya down, Momo.

256
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,500
I never meant for
that to happen.

257
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,250
[SAE]
Uh...

258
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,000
[GIRL C]
Did you hear?

259
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,125
Kairi's got another girl he's
in love with besides Momo!

260
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,541
[GIRL D]
No way!

261
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,750
[GIRL E] So Kairi was cheating
on Momo the whole time?

262
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,250
[GIRL F]
Get out!

263
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,250
[GIRL G] He got tired of her,
so he found someone else.

264
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,583
[GIRL H] I never thought
Kairi would be so scheming.

265
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,458
[GIRL I]
What a disappointment.

266
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,333
[GIRL J]
I'd still go out with him,

267
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,875
I don't care about his past.

268

[GIRL I]
You're terrible!

[GIRLS giggle]

270
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,500
[GIRL K] So that's why
those two got back together!

271
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,750
[GIRL L]
Momo and Toji, right?

272
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,791
[GIRL K]
It's so typical.

273
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,083
She couldn't make it
work with Kairi,

274
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,250
so she ran back to
her old boyfriend.

275
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,083
I know people like to spread
rumors, but this is ridiculous.

276
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,041
Look, if someone's talking
trash, just let me know.

277
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,458
They're not.

278
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,125
Most everyone has been pretty
sympathetic towards me.

279
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,750
[TOJI] Well I'm sure people will
be talking for quite a while,

280
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,583
but as long as the two of us
hang in there, we'll be fine.

281
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,750
And if anyone says
something, just tell me.

He's always looking out for me.

I just feel so relaxed
when I'm with him.

00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,541
I think if I had been alone
after what happened with Kairi,

286
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,875
I wouldn't have
recovered so quickly.

287
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,541
I'm so lucky to have
him here with me.

288
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,958
And this time, for sure, I'm
going to take good care of him.

about us, babe!

Oops, I missed that.
Do it again.

303

I've heard terrible
rumors about you today.

304
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,750
Flirting with all those girls
isn't helping your reputation.

305
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,083
But ya have to admit,

306
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,125
now that I'm a free man
I've become quite popular.

307
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,541
Are you sure you
wanna let this thing

308
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,625
with Momo fall apart like this?

309
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,750
Misao. If you really
wanna know the truth,

310
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,291
I feel like the marathon runner
that trips at the finish line

311
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,583
and comes in second.

312

[MISAO]
Huh?

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,791
[KAIRI] It was a race
I could have won easily

314
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,041
had I not looked away
in the final stretch.

315
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,958
After the fact,
it does no good to say

316
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
that race was mine,
I should have won.

317
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,666
It's too late now for regret.

318
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,250
All I can do is try to
move on with my life.

319

[KAIRI]
I have learned some things.

320
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,041
Like having a relationship
with someone requires

321
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,208
that you always pay attention.

322
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh man. I can't
believe I let her go.

Yeah?

Uh...

Have you brother
meet you somewhere!

00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,916
What? Why should I?

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,541
Because if you call him
then he'll listen to you!

335

He keeps hanging up
on me for some reason.

You're crazy. Do it yourself.

337
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,041
I told you already.
He keeps hanging up on me!

338
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,375
Sounds like someone's moved on.

339

Never mind!
Just call him you jerk!

340
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,458
Tell you what.
I'll call my brother,

341
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,875
but only if you agree to
do me a favor in return.

342
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,458
What favor?

343
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,250
Sae, did you ever say anything
to Momo about how I went looking

344
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,583
for her in the middle of that
typhoon the other day?

345
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,125
I haven't said a word.

346
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,500
Good answer. That's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

347
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,666
[SAE]
Huh?

348
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,083
It's just that I put
myself in harms way

349
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,625
to get to the beach that
night without getting killed.

350
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,208
Only to find that Momo and Toji

351
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,541
had been together
the whole time.

352
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,791
I wanna break
those two up,

353
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,125
and I think you're just
the person to do that.

354
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,541
Tell Momo how much effort
I put in to finding her.

355
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,625
After all, you are the only
one who really knows

356
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,791
what happened to me that day.
So, what do you say?

357
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,875
Well. I guess I could
give it a shot.

358
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,458
[KAIRI]
I'll believe it when I see it.

Ryo? It's your brother.

Oh, hey bro. What's goin' on?

363

[KAIRI] If you have an hour
free in the next day or two,

would you mind gettin'
together to talk?

--Yeah, that sounds perfect.

You'll have to wait to find out.

368
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,750
Otherwise, what's the point of
meeting?

369
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,666
What's wrong with me wantin' to
see my brother? Look, I'll send

370
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,750
you an email later with the
address as a reminder. Bye.

--[KAIRI] Uh!

So, where are we gonna meet him?
Tell me everything!

373
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,500
We? Sorry, Sae,
but you're on your own there.

374
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,166
Oh, I don't think so.
You'll be going with me.

375
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,250
What? Why do
I have to go?

376
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,666
[SAE] Because if I go by myself,
then Ryo will leave!

377
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,916
[KAIRI]
I wouldn't blame him.

378

Give me one good reason
why I should do this.

379
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,500
That's easy. If you don't go,

380
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,625
then you can forget about me
breaking up Momo and Toji.

381
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,791
But you promised!

anything to do with you!

00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,500
[MASAKUZA] I'm totally gonna
put those up in my locker.

468
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,166
[GORO] Hey, what are
we doing in gym today?

469
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,416
[YUKIO]
Basketball, I think.

470
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,125
[BOYS chatting]

471
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,375
[MOMO] I know that thing's
around here somewhere.

472
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,458
--Here it is!
--[pop]

473
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,916
Uh?

474
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:20,125
Whose is this?

475
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,333
Uh?!

476
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,666
[MOMO] Gross!
Who's taking pictures of me?

477
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,125
Probably some pervert!

478
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,166
Uh.

479
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,166
But why?

480
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,375
[SAE] Why did you choose her
over me, Ryo? Why?

481
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,708
I know you have better taste

482
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,750
than to fall in love with
a freaking school nurse!

483
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,416
I have to have
you for myself!

484
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,041
Please! I'll do anything
you want! Anything!

485
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,125
