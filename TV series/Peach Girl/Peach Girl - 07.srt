1
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,916
[MOMO] This summer was
the first of my life

2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,791
that I had a boyfriend.

3
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,083
[MOMO]
But the summer flew past us

4
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,375
because we were
having so much fun.

5
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,541
[TOJI]
Momo.

6
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,666
Is it necessary to touch
my head every time you see me?

7
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,458
Aww, I can't help it.
It feels so good.

8
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,000
So, what are the chances
you'll shave it again?

9
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,250
I really loved the way
it felt right after.

10
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,833
I have to admit
that I was shocked

11
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,666
when he first shaved his head
at the beginning of the summer.

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,000
This is just my way of
turning over a new leaf.

13
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,708
Since I already messed up
our relationship once.

14
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,583
I want a fresh start this time.

15
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,458
Uhh...

16
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,875
[MOMO]
So, what do ya say?

17
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,291
How about we run to the barber
and shave it right now.

18
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,875
[TOJI]
I don't think so.

19
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,666
[MOMO]
A new semester starts today.

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,166
We went through a lot last year,
but now we're deeply in love.

21
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,625
[KAKO] So how far
did you and Toji go?

22
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,166
[KAKO, NAMI, RITSUKO]
What? Not even first base?!

23
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,291
Well, remember how he was
in the hospital last year?

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
He had to spend most
of the summer making up

25
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,000
for his classes he missed,
so I would usually spend time

26
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,166
with him at the library after
class and do homework with him.

27
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,541
Sometimes on the weekends

28
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,916
we would go the movies
and arcade together though.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,791
And that's all you did?

30
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,375
Oh, and I almost forgot.
We went to the fireworks show.

31
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,208
You didn't even
go on vacation?

32
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,083
What? Of course we didn't!

33
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,291
[KAKO, NAMI, RITSUKO laugh]

34
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,541
[KAKO]
I thought you of all people

35
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,916
would have done everything.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,041
[RITSUKO] I guess Momo's
reputation was exaggerated!

37
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,958
[MOMO] Who cares what
they think. I'm in no hurry.

38
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,458
Toji and I took quite a detour
to get to where we are now,

39
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,250
so I want to make sure
it works out this time.

40
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,291
The only thing that
worries me though is...

41
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,791
[KAKO]
Hey, look who just showed up.

42
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,000
[RITSUKO]
She barely exists!

43
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:51,958
[BOYS chatter]

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,833
[MOMO]
Maybe her ego

45
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,416
is too damaged for her
to counterattack.

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,375
[STUDENTS chatter, gasp]

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,833
Who knows where we can
find Momo Adachi?

48
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:18,833
[indistinct chatter]

49
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,583
Word on the street is that you
used to be on the swim team.

50
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,166
And you won the swim
competition for your class.

51
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,791
You won nearly every
race you swam in.

52
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,875
And not even professionals
swim in every single event.

53
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:36,083
[indistinct chatter]

54
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,875
[MOMO gasps]

55
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,125
Please help us, Momo!

56
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,208
We're in desperate need
of talent this year!

57
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,833
Me?

58
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,958
[TOJI]
Swim team, huh?

59
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,541
[MOMO] Yeah. Apparently
most of the team

60
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,416
were seniors last year
and have graduated,

61
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,791
so if they don't
fill out the roster

62
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,208
they'll have to
forfeit the season.

63
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,666
They spent a good hour
trying to convince me to join.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,458
[TOJI] What are you
waiting for? You should join.

65
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,041
[MOMO] If I spend another year
in the pool, I'll be even darker

66
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,541
than I already am.
It's hard enough as it is.

67
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,708
[TOJI] But you really love
to swim, don't you?

68
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,750
[MOMO]
Yeah. That's true.

69
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,041
[TOJI] And you know that
I don't care how dark you get.

70
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,750
I actually kinda like it.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,750
All right. Well if you're cool
with it, then I guess I'll join.

72
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,166
It'll be fun to do
something competitive again.

73
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,458
[MOMO squeaks]

74
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,083
Eh. What's up? Are you okay?

75
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,583
Uh. Uh... That was weird.

76
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,583
It's okay. It's nothing.
Forget about it.

77
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,625
[MOMO chuckles]

78

[sighs]

79
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,750
[MOMO]
Why did I just think of Kairi?

80
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,833
I wonder what happened. I
thought for sure I'd see him...

81
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:38,666
...at least a dozen times
by now. But I guess not.

82
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,708
Huh...

83
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,916
[SANGO]
All right, Kairi,

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,791
so when are we going
to the beach together?

85
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:48,208
[MOMO] That's gotta be what
it is. Kairi is avoiding me.

86
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,708
[MOMO]
It's one of Sae's victims.

87
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,791
What's up?

88
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,791
[SUMIRE]
So how's Sae doing these days?

89
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,750
Great. She hasn't
bugged me once.

90
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,250
In fact, she's about as
quiet as I've ever seen her.

91
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,875
[SUMIRE] Looks like our plan
to expose her really worked.

92
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,791
Yeah. You know I always
found it weird

93
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,333
that all of Sae's victims were
there that day to confront her.

94
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
What a coincidence, huh?

95
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,916
What?!

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,541
Are you saying that
you didn't know?!

97
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,041
I don't know how
he found out about it,

98
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,333
but Kairi called me the night

99
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,916
before the big end
of the year swim meet.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,458
Hey, Sumire, it's Kairi.

101
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,250
I understand that Sae's been
pretty mean to you in the past.

102
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,541
What do you say we
get some sweet revenge?

103
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,500
[SUMIRE] But the thing is,
Sae was mean to me

104
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,541
back when I was
in seventh grade.

105
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,833
So why should I try to
get revenge on her now?

106
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,291
Not to mention
it was the first time

107
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,333
Kairi had ever talked to me.

108
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,250
But when I saw what
was happening that day

109
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,583
I knew that Kairi organized
this not to ridicule Sae,

110
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,250
but to save you.

111
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,791
[MOMO] Why would he
go through all that trouble

112
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,166
just to help me?

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
What an idiot.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,000
But now that I think about it,

115
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,250
Kairi wasn't acting like
his usual self that day.

116
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,625
He was saying goodbye.

117

[KAIRI]
So what's going on?

122
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,583
You look like you have
something serious on your mind.

123
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,083
[MOMO]
I know. I'm sorry.

124
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,125
It's just that... I heard
something this morning.

125
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,125
Sumire. She told
me everything.

[KAIRI laughs]

127
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,791
So you found out.
Well, you got me.

128
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,583
I was planning on making
you indebted to me

129
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,291
so I could make my move once
Toji was out of the picture.

130
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,708
But damn him for breaking free
just in the nick of time

[MOMO]
That's what Kairi does,

133
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,750
he jokes around
to put me at ease.

134
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,125
And even though he pretends
it's by coincidence,

135
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,583
he's always there for me.

136
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,958
[KAIRI] Well, I'm glad to see
that you two are working out.

137
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,458
I think that's great.

138
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,833
You know something, Momo.

139
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,291
I think Toji will do a
good job taking care of you,

140
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,708
considering all the drama
you guys went through.

141
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,083
[MOMO]
Thanks, Kairi.

142
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,833
[MOMO] If you hadn't been there
for me, I probably would have

143
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,458
ended up quitting school
and running away.

144
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,916
Arguing with you
actually helped.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
I would forget about the pain.

146
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,833
And, if I'd met you
before I met Toji,

147
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,208
we probably would have
ended up together.

See ya around.

[KAIRI]
Oh, one more thing.

159
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,833
If you ever get bored with Toji
and you're lookin' for a change,

160
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
you know where to find me.

161

I'm sorry, Kairi.

[MOMO]
Thank you for loving me.

167

[MOMO] Why am I crying? It's not
like I'll never see him again.

[TOJI] You okay? You've been
staring off into space.

171

Oh, I'm fine. I'm
just daydreaming.

172

Sorry, I'm making you help
me with my homework.

[TOJI]
I don't mind.

175

But let's hurry up and finish so
we can grab a bite. I'm hungry.

Why did you do that?

185
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,375
Oh no. He must have
gotten his feelings hurt.

186
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,958
It's one thing to do it
to him once, but twice?

187
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,416
Why in the world would you not
want your boyfriend kissing you?

188
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,291
[MOMO] One second I'm looking
out the window, and then

189
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,916
the next thing I know his face
is like right up against mine

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,458
with no warning or anything.
I need plenty of time

191
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,291
to prepare myself for something
as huge as that, ya know?

Sure, you say that now

193

after going out with him
for three months.

194
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,208
So tell us what happened
after you pushed him away.

195
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,500
It was just as you would
expect. Things got awkward.

196
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,375
He barely even spoke
to me on the way home.

197
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,125
What do you guys think
I should do about this?

[SUZU,YOKO giggle]

199
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,500
There's only one thing
you can do at this point.

200
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,916
You need to make
the move yourself.

[MOMO screaming]

[MOMO] I don't think
I can go through with this!

205
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,041
I wonder if Toji was
this nervous, too.

206
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,541
Of course he was, and
look what I did to him.

207
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,208
[MOMO] Why did I push
him away like that?

208
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,750
I wanted to kiss him, too.
More than anything.

209
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,500
[MOMO]
I need to kiss him.

210
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm finished!

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,291
Cool. Looks good.

212
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,291
Is that for Toji?

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,583
Of course.

214
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,583
I'll use this
to initiate the kiss.

[MOMO sighs]

216
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,875
[MOMO] Actually this will be
more of an "I'm sorry" gift.

217
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,250
Then we'll kiss.

to rip on her.

now's their chance for payback.

All right. I'm ready for Toji.

for you in home ec.

You still like chocolate covered
cherries, right?

Yeah! I love those!

[MOMO] Good. Look,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

It was all so sudden
and caught me off guard.

232

It's not like I didn't want to,
I just wasn't ready for it.

to show him that I love him?

Uh, Toji.

00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,041
Let's make a secret sign
for just the two of us.

A sign?

[MOMO] What if we made the shape
of an L with our fingers

239
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,583
as a way to say "I love you"?

Were you embarrassed?

No. In fact, once I did it,
it wasn't a big deal at all.
