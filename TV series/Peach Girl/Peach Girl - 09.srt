[TOJI] Momo, don't you think
you'd have a better birthday

You didn't hear her.
She sounded so upset.

[SAE] Without Jigoro, I just
don't think I can go on living.

181

You're the only one I can count
on, Momo. Will you please hurry?

182
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,458
All I really need
right now is a friend.

183

I know we've been
through a lot lately,

184
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,291
but she seems to
be trying to change.

185
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,541
And she doesn't have
anyone else to turn to.

186
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,333
Maybe I should go
with you, Momo.

[MOMO]
Mm...

188

It's girl stuff. She'd probably
clam up if you were there.

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,916
Okay.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,750
I'm sorry. I'll come back as
soon as we're done talking.

I'll give you a call, I promise.

I'm sorry I called you
out here so late.

It's okay. But where's Jigoro?

He's not here.

But when I called him and told
him that you were on your way,

199
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,541
he said that he'd come back

200
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,166
and talk about
everything that's happened.

201

Please, Momo, if you don't talk
to him for me, I'll lose him.

to take you out?

[MOMO yelps]

00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,541
Momo, I... Uh.

322
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,250
[JIGORO]
Hey, are you all right?

323
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,458
[JIGARO]
Momo!

324
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,541
[KAIRI]
And you seriously thought

325
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,291
you could get away with this?

326
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,833
What are you
talking about, Kairi?

327
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,208
I really don't know
what's going on here.

328
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,916
This is something
Jigoro's doing on his own.

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,166
Then why are you dressed
exactly like Momo?

330
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,916
I guess I should explain that.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
I was thinking Toji might
be lonely after being dumped

332
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,291
and that this would
cheer him up.

333
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,333
I was just trying to make you
feel better, sweetie, I promise.

334
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,083
You are so full of crap.

335
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,875
Now take off that stupid wig
before I rip it off.

336
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,791
Okay, fine... jerk.

337
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,083
Anyway, Jigoro's car
seemed to be heading towards

338
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,583
the waterfront so we should
probably look there first.

339
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,166
I just hope Momo's okay
when we find her.

340
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,208
[TOJI]
Yeah.

341
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,625
[SAE]
Smart move. There's no one here.

342
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,208
Well, crap.

343
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,625
I could swear they were going in
this direction when I saw them.

344
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,166
They're not here. Maybe they
to went back to his place,

345
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,708
you know where he
lives, don't you, Sae?

346
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,458
Yeah.

347
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,208
[TOJI]
Then let's go.

348
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,333
[SAE]
Hmph.

349
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,833
[SAE]
I know this is the building,

350
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,416
but I can't remember the number.

351
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,666
[TOJI]
Dammit, Sae!

352
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,083
[SAE] Now hold on, maybe
I can say I'm his sister

353
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,583
and ask the manager
which apartment is his.

354
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,416
[KAIRI] Spoken like
a true pathological liar.

355
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,541
[SAE]
Hmph.

356
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,625
[MOMO]
Where am I?

357
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,208
Jigoro, why am I
undressed in this bed?

358
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,000
What did you do to me?!

359
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,875
Nothing. Calm down.

360

[MOMO crying]

363
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,583
What perfect timing.

364
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,666
Well, I just talked
to the manager

365
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,708
and he said that
Momo's in Jigoro's room.

366
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,958
He saw them in the elevator
a little while ago.

What're you doing, Toji?!

382
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,750
You can't punch a model
in the face like that,

383
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,750
it's just not right!

384
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,833
I think he just did.

this happening?

[SAE]
Uhh...

391
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,125
You did it. Why don't
you tell me, Jigoro?!

I can't believe you would do
this to my friend, you monster!

Did you plan this whole thing?

You're insane.

402
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,625
Is that true, Sae? Tell me.

403
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,958
What? No... Of course it isn't.

404
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,541
It was you.

405
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,916
I can see in your eyes
that you're lying to me.

You're my friend, Momo.
I would never do that.

But, Momo, I'm here
to rescue you,

411
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,666
why are you getting so upset?

412
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,000
Maybe what you saw in my eyes

413
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,875
was the fact that
Toji kissed me.

I'm sorry, Toji.

I have no right to mad at you...
after what I did with Jigoro.

[TOJI]
I'm sorry, Momo.

425
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,458
If only I had gone with you,

426
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,041
none of this
would've ever happened.

No, it isn't! Don't say that!

anything wrong, okay?

None of this is your
fault. Believe me.
