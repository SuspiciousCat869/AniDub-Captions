[crying]

2
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,958
What are you lookin' at?

3
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,916
Did you plan this whole thing?

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
You're insane.

5
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,208
It was you. I can see in your
eyes that you're lying to me.

6
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,125
Momo...

7
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,583
I ruined everything.
It's all over.

8
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,291
No it isn't, don't say that!

9
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,583
But... what about Jigoro?

10
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,458
You know what, Sae?
You're gonna get it!

11
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,125
Movie?

12
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,458
Cool, huh?

13
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,875
One of my older brother's
friends is a director.

14
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,583
And he's having
a really hard time

15
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,958
finding the right
leading lady for his film.

16
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,083
I thought you'd be
interested in meeting him.

17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,250
Maybe. But why're you asking me?

18
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,625
Well, mostly because you happen

19
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,333
to fit the description
he gave perfectly.

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,916
Plus, he helped me out once
and I owe him a favor.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,916
He's looking for a sweet,
kind-hearted girl

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,208
who makes men feel
protective of her.

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,958
But she also has to be
smart and beautiful.

24
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,625
Wow! That does
sound like me.

25
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,333
I guess I should give him a
call, but only to help you.

26
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,833
If it sucks, I'm gone.

27
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,875
Thank you.

28
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,916
And no one's here because...?

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,041
I'll see what's up.
My phone works better outside.

[BARNEY]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

32
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,875
Uh.

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
Are you the director?

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,125
[BARNEY] Welcome to the set
of "The Fly Man Strikes Back."

35
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,416
Uhh...

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,875
[BARNEY grunts]

37
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
Help me!

38
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,333
Naughty Firefly Scene, take one!

00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,666
--I'm your motivation!
--[SAE screams]

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,708
Why is Kairi so late?
This was all his idea.

41
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,208
Momo, can we talk about Sae?

42
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,250
I only kissed her
because she tricked me.

43
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,333
She had put together
this costume.

44
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,708
And she looked exactly like you.
Same clothes, same hair.

45
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,083
Even the perfume I gave
you for your birthday.

46
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,375
So you thought that she was me.

47
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,791
[MOMO]
What's wrong with her?

48
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,458
Why won't she just
mind her own business

49
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,541
and leave Toji and me alone?!

50
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,666
[KAIRI]
Yo, lovebirds!

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,666
Uhh.

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,833
What's goin' on here?

53
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,625
Nothing. We're just talking.

54
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,125
Well, it's time to cheer up

55
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,708
because I'm teaching Sae a
lesson she's never gonna forget.

56
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,750
[BOTH gasp]

57
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,250
What's that s'posed to mean?

58
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,000
It means that right now Sae
is experiencing a little bit

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,333
of what you went through
the other day with Jigoro.

60

[BARNEY laughs]

Please stop! Don't touch me.

Get away from me, you fat creep!

[SAE screams]

00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,958
What a naughty little
firefly you are

65
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,625
to use such dirty, dirty
language. Time for a swatting!

[MOMO]
Uhh...

70
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,958
So right now Sae could be dead?

71
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,875
Nah, she's just getting
a little scare that's all.

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,333
She should be just fine.

73
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,916
[MOMO]
But--

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,958
Trust me, Momo, this is nothing
compared to what she did to you.

75
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,000
There's really no other
way to teach her.

76
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,458
How do you know this guy

77
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,291
isn't going to do anything
more than scare her, Kairi?

78
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,375
Did you ever think about
what might happen?

79
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,791
It'll be all right. Unless Sae
starts running her mouth,

80
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,583
then I can't imagine anyone
not wanting to harm her.

81
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,166
What's wrong?

82
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,666
[MOMO]
I can't believe you, Kairi!

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,166
Huh?

[TOJI gasps]

85
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,583
I have to go find Sae before
something awful happens.

86
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,166
What for?

87
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,916
If this was happening to you,
Sae wouldn't even lift a finger

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,833
Well, it did happen to me
and I wanted to die.

89
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,500
Besides, it doesn't
matter what she's done,

90
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,416
no woman deserves this.

of you planned this to happen?

Nothing that happened today

made you think of the

Kairi thought that
if you experienced

your own hateful pranks, you
might actually want to stop

doing these things to people.

overestimated you.

You are incapable of caring
about anyone but yourself.

I'll ever do for you, Sae.

why you did it in
the first place.

I mean, seeing Toji and
Momo so happy together

159
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,708
does make me a bit jealous.

And you think the
only way you will be

164
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,375
is if you have Toji to yourself.
Well, Sae, you know what?

165
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,916
Here's the truth.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,583
Even if you were somehow able
to break the two of them up,

167

you're not her.

What is it that makes you think
she's so much better than me?!

I'm only saying that you two
are very different people.

170
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,958
So you wouldn't have the
same kind of relationship.

171

I mean, think about it,

172

they've overcome a lot of
obstacles thrown their way.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,375
That does tends to create
a pretty strong bond.

What's ironic is that
this kind of publicity

will be good for Jigoro.
