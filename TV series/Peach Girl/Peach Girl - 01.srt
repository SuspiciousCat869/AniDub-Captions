Wow, Momo.

from the chlorine,

I'm so sick of her copying me!

is that she looks better
with it than I do.

Not to mention she's
got a small frame

316
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,416
Look I'm the one asking
the questions here.

317
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,416
And I'm the one
not answering them.

318
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,625
[TOJI sighs]

319
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,000
If you're doing
your same old thing

320
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,708
and just messing with her...
then I want you to stay away.

321
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,916
She might look the part,

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,416
but she's not a mindless slut,
you got me?

323
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,166
[KAIRI chuckles]

324
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,208
[KAIRI grunts]

325
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,333
What if I like her?

326
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,875
Wait, what are you saying?

327
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,375
[KAIRI] If I do, then I'm not
pulling my "same old thing."

328
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,916
I guess.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,833
Girls like Momo have always been
the way I roll. She's hot...

330
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,916
You know, I think I could
even be her boyfriend, too,

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,125
if she'd like it...

332
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,125
I'm curious to see if
that tan skin spans

333
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,000
even the parts of her body
that don't see the sun.

334
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,125
Tell me you wouldn't
like to see what's hiding

335
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,083
underneath that
unflattering school uniform.

336
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,375
[TOJI grunts]

337
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,125
You stay away from Momo...

338
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,500
Or I won't miss next time.

339
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
[KAIRI chuckles]

340
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,291
Hi, Tojigamori. I figured
you'd be home by now.

341
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,625
[TOJI]
Uh?

342
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,916
So, is it cool if I call
you Toji, like Momo does?

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Uh, yeah.

344
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,875
Oh, that's great.

345
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,208
[MOMO]
Just leave me alone!

346
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,625
I'm sick of you following
me around like a puppy.

347
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,708
[KAIRI]
But this is what you do

348
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,833
when you're going
out with a girl.

349
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,958
I already warned that... jerk.

350
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,166
Get away from me...

351
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,500
I already have
somebody I like, okay?

352
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,666
[TOJI gasps]

353
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,541
Yeah, I know...
It's that guy Toji, right?

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
That's right...

355
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,125
I've liked Toji ever since we
were in junior high together.

356
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,500
[TOJI gasps]

357
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
[KAIRI] Have you ever
told this guy how you feel?

358
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,458
[MOMO]
No. But I'm gonna.

359
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,583
Okay, when? If you
keep it to yourself,

360
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,875
you might miss your chance.

361
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,666
I'm not an idiot... It's just...

362
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,000
It's just what?

363
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,583
A friend told me something once.

364
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,833
I'm sorry, Momo,
but Toji told me that

365
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:33,000
he's never liked girls
who have tan skin.

366
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,750
It bothered me... But I
couldn't just give up on

367
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,833
my dream that easily... I
figured if I worked hard enough

368
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,500
to get rid of my tan then I
might actually have a chance

369
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,833
to become Toji's
girlfriend someday.

370
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,916
So that's why you
skipped swimming today.

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,291
[MOMO]
Yes!

372
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,250
I have to keep the sun
off me as much as possible,

373
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,083
so I slap sunscreen on every
hour, walk in the shade,

374
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,833
and wear long sleeves
when I can.

375
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,541
Wow, Momo, that's a lot
of effort to put in.

376
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,708
So now you can see why
I have no interest in you.

377
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,291
Now, I'm even more enamored with
you. Your dedication is amazing!

378
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,833
I don't care!
Just leave me alone!

379
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,083
[KAIRI grunts]

380
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,833
She told me that she likes Kairi

381
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,041
but she just told him
that she likes you...

382
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,625
Toji, if I were you I'd be
careful around a girl like...

383
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,666
[SAE gasps]

384
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,166
[KAIRI]
She's so late. What the hell?

385
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,083
She asked me to be here.

386
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,041
[MOMO] What could that idiot
possibly want from me this time?

387
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,541
[KAIRI whimpering]

388
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791

[KAIRI yelping]

390
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,500
If he doesn't get
the point soon

391
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,916
I'll have to tattoo
"I don't like you" on my face.

392
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,541
[MOMO gasps]

00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,333
Kairi!

394
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,958
Stop screwing around

395
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,291
and get your butt over here
to the side of the pool!

396
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,291
Uh... No...

397
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,708

401
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,958
Kairi, wake up!

[MOMO gasps]

403

He's not breathing...

404
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,541
Oh, no...

405
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,875
[LIFEGUARD] The human brain
needs a constant flow of oxygen.

406
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,916
If its supply is cut of
for over four minutes,

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,625
then there's little
hope for revival.

408
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,208
That's why CPR has to be
performed as soon as possible.

409
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,125
I promise, Toji, they're at
the pool together and alone...

410
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,250
Go check it out.

Oh, I can't watch this!

I found him in the pool...!

Kairi!

He'll be just fine.

423
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,333
But it was a good call on your
part bringing him here, Momo.

424
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,125
We'll keep him here for
a little while longer.

00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,041
You guys can head
on home now, okay.

00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,750
Oh, would you keep your
mouth shut and get some rest?!

431
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,041
Misao, that's no way to treat
a guy who almost drowned today.

432

[MISAO] Ugh. Anyone who
can't swim and gets that close

433
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,000
to the water, probably needs
some sense knocked into him.

434
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,458
Now lay down.

435

[MOMO chuckles]

00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,083
I can't say thanks enough, Momo.

I'll see you tomorrow!

438
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,458
[TOJI] Kairi's lucky
you were there for him.

439
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,708
[MOMO]
Yeah, you're right. He is.

440
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,916
Uh... I mean if I didn't
save him, he'd be dead,

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,125
and I couldn't live with
that on my conscience.

442
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,958
[MOMO] No! Toji saw me
giving Kairi CPR!

443
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,500
What am I gonna do?!
He'll never want me now!

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,916
I overheard the conversation
you had with Kairi yesterday.

446
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
You did?

447
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,458
I've liked Toji ever since
we were in junior high together.

[MOMO]
Uh?! He actually heard that?!

00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,500
You know...

450
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,291
I don't hate girls
who have dark tans...

[MOMO gasps]

452
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,541
In fact, I think
I like you, too.

[MOMO gasps]

454

[MOMO]
I can't believe it!

455
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,041
The only thing I've ever
wanted to do is kiss Toji,

456
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,583
and Sae makes it happen
in the worst way possible.

457
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,916
She really gets under
my skin sometimes!
