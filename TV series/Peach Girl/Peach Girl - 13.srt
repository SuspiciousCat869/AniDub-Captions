1
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:52,208
I understand if you're
still in love with Toji.

2
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,625
I'm just glad I'm with you.

3
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:59,541
[MOMO] Thank you, Kairi,
but isn't it weird

4
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,333
that we planted a peach seed
and got a quince flower?

5
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:02,875
Huh?

6
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,291
Quince flower.

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,166
This looks absolutely nothing
like a peach blossom.

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,291
Uh?! Ah!

9
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:12,875
What?! That man lied to me!
He said it was a peach blossom!

10
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,125
[KAIRI yelps]

11
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,708
[MOMO] Peach Blossom, huh?
I don't think so!

12
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,125
[MOMO laughs]

13
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,208
[KAIRI] I don't need to
plant a peach blossom.

14
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,208
I've got one right here.

15
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:30,958
Did you know that peach blossoms
have a very special meaning?

16
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:36,208
They mean "I am your captive."

17
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:40,208
[MOMO]
I am your captive.

18
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,583
[NORI] Look at those two.
They're never apart.

19
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,375
You think they're dating now?

20
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,083
[AKI] Last time I talked to Momo
she said they were just friends.

21
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,875
[SANGO]
Ah, but guess what I heard?

22
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,416
Someone saw them
kissing the other day.

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,583
[NORI]
No way!

24
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,083
[AKI, SANGO, NORI growl]

25
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,583
[MOMO]
Uh!

26
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
Stay away from Kairi.

27
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,583
[MOMO] Whatever's going
on between me and Kairi

28
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,416
is none of your business.

29
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,833
Everyone at school knows you're
still in love with Toji.

30
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,416
So until you get that out of
your system, leave Kairi alone.

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,708
Yeah, he's much
too good of a guy

32
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,333
to be a rebound for
someone like you.

33
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,125
I'm sure anyone would
be good enough for you,

34
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,041
as long as they're
cute and popular.

35
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,500
You better do as we say. Never
talk to Kairi again. You got it?

36
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,791
You poor things.

37
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,708
Kairi would never go out with
someone as shallow as you.

38
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,458
How dare you!

39
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,500
[MOMO gasps]

40
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,541
You have no idea what you're
talking about, you slut!

41
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,791
You don't even love Kairi,

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,625
and yet you keep
stringing him along!

43
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,375
Shut up!

44
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,000
[NORI, AKI]
Uh!

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,958
Do you honestly believe
that I would kiss someone

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,708
I didn't like? Of course
I'm in love with Kairi!

47
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,875
[NORI growls]
You bitch!

48
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,250
[MOMO gasps]

49
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,208
[KAIRI]
All right, that's enough!

50
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
[NORI gasps]

51
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,583
You weren't actually gonna
hit my girl were you?

52
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Kairi!

53
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
[MOMO sighs]

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,583
Just because you're not
getting the attention you want,

55
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,666
you treat her like this?

56
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,500
We were just trying to
help you out, I swear.

57
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,500
Go on and get out of here. I'm
disgusted with all three of you.

58
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,958
[SANGO, NORI, AKI whimper]

[SANGO, NORI, AKI cry]

60
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't understand
why girls do that.

61
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,083
They smell blood in
the water and attack.

62
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,625
I knew this would happen.

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,750
It was just a matter of time
before they started something.

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,041
You saved me.

65
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,666
Everything's okay! I'm here!

66
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,916
[KAIRI groans]

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,625
[splash]

68
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,875
[MOMO laughs]

69
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,250
[MOMO]
It feels so good!

70
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,666
You should come over
and join me, Kairi.

71
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,250
Not gonna happen.

72
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,916
[MOMO]
Aw come on!

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,666
You won't even get
your feet wet?

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,625
Are you really that
scared of the water?

75
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,750
[KAIRI]
Yup.

76
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,875
That's cool. I guess
that makes sense,

77
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,916
since you almost drowned
in the ocean, right?

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
[KAIRI]
I don't really remember it,

79
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,916
but from what people have told
me it was a really close call.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,583
[MOMO]
It sure was.

81
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,333
Everyone thought you were
dead when I pulled you out.

82
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,208
I know we've been
over this before,

83
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,541
but are you positive you weren't
the one to give me CPR?

84
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,416
Yes, I'm positive.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,750
But I'm curious, how did you
find out that I'm the one

86
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
that pulled you
out of the water?

87
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,916
Right after I started going to
school here, I heard your name

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
mentioned in the hallway,
and it sounded familiar.

89
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,500
I remembered that the girl who
saved me had a name like yours,

90
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,833
and since you're the only girl
I've ever known named Momo,

91
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,625
it just made sense
that it was you.

92
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,875
Well if that's the case,

93
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,333
then how come you never
approached me back then?

94
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,541
You'll probably have a hard
time believing this,

95
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,166
but I'm actually
a very shy person

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,500
when it comes to
approaching cute girls.

97
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,541
You are such a liar.

98
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,875
It is strange though,
if you think about it.

99
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,500
If you hadn't almost
drowned that day,

100
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,333
we wouldn't be sitting
here right now.

101
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,541
In fact, we probably wouldn't
even know each other.

102
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,916
[KAIRI]
It's pretty weird.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,083
[MOMO] So before you
developed this fear of water,

104
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,041
would you have called
yourself a strong swimmer?

105
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,625
Not by a long shot.

106
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,458
Then what in the world
were you thinking,

107
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,750
swimming so far away
from the shore, Kairi?

108
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,541
It was just a couple of
days after the typhoon.

109
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,000
The water was
still pretty rough.

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,791
I was trying to kill myself.

111
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,875
[MOMO gasps]

112
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,875
Ha! I totally got you! I was
kidding! I wasn't suicidal!

113
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,541
It was a joke!

114
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:05,208
[MOMO] A joke? That was
way too serious for a joke.

115
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,541
Maybe this is another side
to Kairi I haven't seen yet.

116
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,291
I mean, it is possible since

117
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,708
I'm always blabbing
about myself to him.

118
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,958
In fact, the more
I think about it,

119
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,750
I barely know anything
intimate about him.

120
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,416
--[KAIRI]  You ready?
--[MOMO] Uh?

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,208
--[crash]
--[MOMO, KAIRI] Uh?

122
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:29,791
Ah! Oh thank God!
It still works!

123
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,958
[MOMO] Whoa, Looks like it's
time to get a new case, huh?

124
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,958
I'm a little short on cash right
now, but it's cool though,

125
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,750
I'll just put some tape on it,
and it'll be as good as new.

126
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,458
[MOMO]
That's perfect!

127
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,750
[MOMO]
Crap! I have to start over!

128
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,333
What's wrong with me? Even my
little cousin can knit straight!

129
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:53,583
I'm gonna run out of yarn soon.
I can't wait to see his face

130
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,625
light up when I
give this to him.

131
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,291
[MOMO]
No! Not again!

132
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,416
[MOMO] I can't believe I
worked on that all night.

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,750
I'm so tired.

134
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,250
Is anyone in here?

135
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,833
Nurse Misao won't mind if I
take a quick nap before class.

137

[MOMO]
Mm? Mm. What time is it?

138
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,666
[MISAO groans]
Sixty-three kilos.

139

[MOMO] Oh no! Whatever
you do, don't laugh!

140
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,875
Damn it! I might as well be
pregnant with this belly!

141
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,791
[MOMO giggles]

142
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,208
[MISAO gasps]

143
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,791
Hi. I didn't know
you were here, Momo.

144
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:56,000
[MOMO] Uh! I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to laugh at you.

145
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,958
[MOMO]
Uh?

146
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,416
Here's some tea.

147
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,291
Just promise you won't utter
a word of this to anyone.

148
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,875
[MOMO]
That's nice of her.

149
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,375
If I were in her shoes and heard
some kid laughing at my weight,

150
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,666
I'd probably end up
punching their lights out.

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,708
Hey Momo! Heard you cut class!

152
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,375
No I was just napping in here.

153
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,833
I didn't get much
sleep last night.

154
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,583
What are you drinking?
It looks good.

155
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,833
Come on, give me a sip. Please!

156

Quit it!

157

Don't you have a class
to go to or something?

158
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,083
[KAIRI]
This is way more important.

159
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,333
I'm spending quality
time with my girl.

160

[MISAO]
Oh yeah?

161

[MISAO]
Get back here!

Before I give you a valid reason
to be at the nurses' office!

Momo, help!

00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,291
Uh. I can't believe
you're still wearing that.

167

[MISAO gasps]

168
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,541
[KAIRI] Especially after
what he did to you.

169
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,625
[MOMO]
Uh...

170
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,666
[MOMO]
Kairi!

171
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,958
Kairi, tell me what
happened with Nurse Misao.

172
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,250
Whatever you said back there

173
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,875
seemed to really
hurt her feelings.

174
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you know something about
her that no one else does?

175
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,208
Kairi, wait!

176
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,791
My brother, Ryo,
broke her heart. Okay?

177
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,125
Wait a second. Nurse Misao used
to go out with your brother?

178
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,500
When was this?

179
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
They went out together
while they were in college.

180
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,416
I needed some help with school,

181
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,333
so she became my tutor
in junior high.

182
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,666
[MOMO gasps]

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,541
[MOMO]
Your brother and the nurse?

184
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,375
Why didn't you ever tell me?

185
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,208
It never came up.

186
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,625
[MOMO] Then why keep
it a secret from me?

187
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,125
It wasn't like I was
keeping it from you.

188
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,541
It's just that when we talk,
it's usually all about you.

189
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,833
See ya around.

190
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,750
[MISAO] He always acts like that
when it comes to his brother.

191
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,916
I think he has a complex.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,666
You should've seen
him when I first met him.

193
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,208
He's an angel now compared
to how he used to be.

194
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,458
Maybe it was his way

195
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,750
of rebelling against an
over-achieving brother.

196
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,291
He ran away from
home a few times,

197
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,958
and would skip class constantly.

198
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,666
I think his brother grew
concerned about him

199
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,000
as time went on,

200
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,083
so that's when he asked
me to start tutoring him.

201
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,833
[MOMO]
Tell me about his brother.

202
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,583
You know, what's he like?

203
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,750
He was wonderful.

204
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,416
He has an amazing spirit, and
being with him makes you ask

205
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,833
how anyone could
be born so blessed.

the face with the softball!

go. I'll talk to you later.

211
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,875
[MOMO]
I guess I was right.

212
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,916
I barely know anything
personal about him.

213
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,791
[MOMO]
That's Kairi's.

214
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,208
[MOMO]
He looks so happy.

215
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,291
Who's this girl next to him?

216
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,875
The picture's so faded,
I can't tell how old it is.

at the photo inside.

I need to ask you.

Are you seeing someone that
you haven't told me about?

it away right now.

me back to Momo.

time in years and you already

want out of my sight.

somewhere to be right now?

would end up like this,

broken up with you.

I've been thinking
about us a lot lately,

and how you used to
be so sweet to me.

269

I know it's been a long time
since we broke up,

270

but of all the guys I've
been with since then,

none of them have
been a nice as you.

It makes me wonder why
I even broke up with you

273

in the first place.

274

It's nice hearin'
you say all this,

but what are you doing still
wearing that necklace?

I am so sorry about that, Momo.

Was that her? From the picture?

you're into that whole blonde
haired bimbo look too, huh?

289
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,875
You must be feeling pretty
good about yourself right now.

290
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,416
Seeing how happy
she was to see you

291
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,125
it's clear that
she's missed you.

292
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,833
Maybe you two could even
get back together again.

293
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,916
No, Momo.

294
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,875
Sorry. That was
really uncalled for.

295
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:28,666
Momo. You're the only one.

296
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
And if it makes
any difference,

297
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,500
Morika and I were never
really that close, anyway.

298
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,875
It's just that she and I
had a really ugly breakup,

299
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,291
and I still have some
baggage left over from it.

300
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,916
An ugly breakup?

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,666
Yeah, my brother
stole her from me.

302
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,250
But after seeing her
today, I realized that...

303
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,916
The baggage isn't really
about feeling like a loser

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,250
because she dumped me.

305
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,208
It's just the resentment I
have towards my brother.

306
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,500
So there's no
need to worry

307
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,791
about me running off
with my ex, okay?

[KAIRI chuckles]

312
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:13,708
[MOMO] When did I start
loving Kairi so much?

313
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:20,375
I don't mind. Kairi won't
hurt me. He never has.

314
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,625
I'm going to trust
him unconditionally.

315
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,208
I'm the one he's with now.

316
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,833
[KAKO]
Wow! That looks great!

317
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,625
I love the color you went with.

318
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,625
So when are you
gonna give it to him?

319
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,375
Probably tomorrow.
He has no idea he's getting it.

320
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,541
It's so cute. Great job Momo!

321
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,541
You could make a fortune
selling those at school,

322
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,750
if you wanted to.

327
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,458
We need Kairi!

328
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,458
I think he went to
the teacher's office.

329
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,875
That's right! He's the
school monitor today!

Oh, no! Right when
Momo's in trouble!

331

[RITSUKO]
Let's hurry!

332
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,958
So, is that your
natural skin color?

333
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,750
No I'm on the swim team.

334
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,916
Really? That's pretty cool. You
don't know how lucky you are.

335
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,375
Every time I try to get a tan,

336
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,291
I just end up looking
like a lobster,

337
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,333
I guess that's the just
price I have to pay

338
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,333
for having such
delicate skin.

339
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,833
It's okay though, I hear
that if you tan too much,

340
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,541
you'll look like a catchers
mitt by the time you're forty.

341
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,291
Speaking of, you might
wanna consider

342
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,375
rolling up your window
before your face starts to burn.

[MOMO]
Gimme a break.

344
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,916

better insults from Sae.

345

[MORIKA]
Hey. You know that scar

346
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,541
near Kairi's belly button
that looks like a pumpkin?

347
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,541
Yeah that was me
who gave it to him.

348
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,416
I accidentally used his
stomach as an ashtray.

349
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,208
We must have laughed
about that for hours.

Kairi has a scar?

No way! Don't tell me that
pervert hasn't shown you

352
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,583
his scar yet!
I can't believe it!

Come on girl.

354
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,375
How long have you two
been going out anyway?

355
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,000
About two months.

00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,208
[MOMO]
That jerk.

357
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,041
I can't believe he said
they weren't close.

358
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,250
He obviously slept with this
bimbo! Oh, he's gonna get it.

359
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,083
[MORIKA gasps] You guys have
been going out for two months,

360
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,333
and he hasn't even taken his
shirt off in front of you?

361
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,208
No way!

362
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,458
[MOMO]
So what?

363
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,333
If I wanna look at his
belly button then I can

364
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,291
do that whenever I want.
'Cause he's my boyfriend.

365
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,916
Which means that he and I
have no secrets between us.

Morika! What are you doing here?

367
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,250
I'm actually looking for you. We
never finished our conversation.

368
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,833
As far as I'm concerned, we have
nothing else to talk about.

Don't worry about it.

He actually just
stepped out.

stupid Kairi's been lately.

really nice on the phone.
