It's just wrong.

I would never kiss him in
the same spot he kissed her.

I can't believe Toji
would do such a thing!

00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,083
Forcing me into the garden...

...without even bothering
to ask how I felt about it.

I'm some slut.

that this idea that
you're a slut is wrong.

Yeah, but...

then be clear with him
and tell him how you feel.

00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,125
And if he decides to leave
you for something that trivial,

00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,166
then he wasn't worth
your time anyway.

filled with such insight.

me quite a bit.

been there for me today,

maybe you have more fun

No way.

best friend's boyfriend?

474
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,000
It's Toji, duh!

475
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,041
Uh?!

476
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,666
Momo and Kairi?

477
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,166
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,750
I know I said
I wasn't coming back...

479
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,000
...but this is just too
shocking not tell you.

480
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,500
How could she do this to you

481
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,666
while you're sick
in the hospital?

482
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,916
[TOJI] Momo and Kairi
were holding each other?

483
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,750
[TOJI]
I don't believe it.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,958
Momo! Wait for me!

485
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,708
Stay away from me!

486
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,333
You and I have nothing
to talk about,

487
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,541
so leave me alone before
I do something you'll regret.

488
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,583
[KAIRI] Toji's in the hospital
with appendicitis.

489
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,625
[MOMO gasps]

490
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,291
I think Sae's tried to
keep it a secret from you.

491
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,958
[KAIRI] Apparently she
spread word around

492
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,000
that no one tell you
about Toji's illness.

493
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,750
I guess she told them
to not tell me either

494
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,416
because I'm just now
hearing about it.

495
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,750
I'm pretty sure she just wanted

496
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,750
to visit him in
the hospital by herself.

497
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,208
Why would she do that?

498
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,791
Momo, I think it's obvious

499
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,083
that Sae is not only trying to
trash you and your reputation,

500
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,666
but she's also trying to
make Toji her own boyfriend.

501
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,708
[KAIRI gasps]

502
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,458
[MOMO]
I'm... gonna... kill her!

503
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,916
Woah... Chill out,
Momo... Settle down.

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,958
[MOMO]
Sae!

505
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,333
[MOMO]
Toji, you have it all wrong!

506
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,250
Sae's been feeding you
false information!

507
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,750
How can you believe a word she
says? Why don't you believe me?

508
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,833
That's it, Toji!

509
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,541
You and I are finished!

510
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,875
Next time on Peach Girl:

511
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,583
"The Catastrophe."
