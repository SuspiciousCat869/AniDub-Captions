All you must do is turn
on the electricity

332
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
that powers the prison elevator.

333

the mechanism’s

She was quite gifted

to manipulate

In my opinion, hers was
an effective method

340
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,416
of leading people
to repent their sin

She had a tendency
to be a bit of a spendthrift,

00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,708
but one might say
that was just part of her charm.

00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,208
Now that Cathy’s
no longer with us,

345
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,041
it stands to reason
that a few “lost souls”

346

may be wandering this floor.
