Sorry, Doctor. I had to.

Oh wait. The doctor used
to go outside somehow.

The exit must be on one
of the other floors.

What? That doesn't
make sense.

on the next floor down.

Anytime someone came here
from outside, they rode

134
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,090
the elevator up, which means
that they had to have been

Right, I know how to get there.

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,757
You behave as though I'm going
to bite you, silly girl.

160
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,678
What do you want now?

161
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,390
[GRAY] All I wish is to
ask you a question.

162
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,227
In the end, Zack wasn't your
God after all, was he?

163
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,980
That's right. I finally
figured it out.

164
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,357
[GRAY]
So it would appear.

165
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,359
And now that you've
reached that conclusion,

166
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,029
I hope you have an understanding
of the implications.

167
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,198
We made a promise to each other.

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,702
Just us. It had nothing
to do with God.

169
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,370
[GRAY]
By renouncing him as your God,

170
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,875
you've stripped him of his
standing as an ultimate being.

171
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,043
You've transformed
young Isaac Foster

172
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,380
into something that is
neither God nor angel.

173
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,757
And since you made your
vow with a mere mortal,

174
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,468
the same as you are,
there's no guarantee that

175
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,721
you can trust him to
grant your request.

176
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,473
He may end up betraying you.

177
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,226
If you still believe that
your pact is absolute and

178
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,521
will certainly be fulfilled,
then what disqualifies

179
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,608
him from being God,
in your mind?

180
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,156
[RACHEL] I'm not necessarily
sure he'll keep his promise.

181
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,867
I do trust Zack, yes.

182
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,703
But trusting and promising
were choices that he and I

183
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,163
made on our own.

184
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,999
According to what we
felt in our own hearts.

185
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:53,171
Which means, that even if he
chooses to betray his word,

186
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,090
it was still my
choice to trust him.

187
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,974
I'm responsible for what I do.
I can accept that he's not God.

188
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,517
I'm stronger now.

189
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,896
And in light of
these revelations,

190
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,773
you still desire death?

191
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,399
Yes.

192
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,112
But why? There's been such a
clear shift in your thinking.

193
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,491
Yet, even so, your wish
remains the same?

194
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,829
That's right. It's not like I've
turned into a different person.

195
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,040
I just accept who I am.

196
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,001
I know myself now.
And as a result,

197
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,004
I no longer have any desire
to be forgiven for anything

198
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,006
I may have done
in the past.

199
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,510
Because there's no one left
who would forgive me.

200
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,138
That's why I still
want to be killed.

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
I can't keep living.

202
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,561
I see. You seem quite
assured in your decision.

203
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,730
[RACHEL]
Yes. Also...

204
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,065
[GRAY]
Hm?

205
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,445
No, the rest is a secret.

206
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,613
Good heavens.

207
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,075
So you really have turned your
back on the Lord completely.

208
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,203
One last question.

209
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,832
Answer me truthfully.

210
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,793
Ms. Gardner, just who are you?

211
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,255
Well, I'm me, sir.

212
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,174
Nothing more than
that and nothing less.

213
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,218
Ah, yes, I understand.

214
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,096
The way you're speaking seems
to suggest that you consider

215
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,517
yourself and Zack to be equals.
Is that how you feel?

216
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,021
Then again, I suppose it might
not be far from the truth.

217
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,897
You're a failure as an angel,

218
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,276
but you have proven not
to be a witch. How curious.

219
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,780
Are you entirely positive that
you are Rachel Gardner?

220
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,240
Are we done here?

221
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,867
We are.

222
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,995
In that case, I need to
turn on the elevator now.

223
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,496
Be my guest.

224
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,748
You won't stop me?

225
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,916
Is that not what I implied?

226
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,252
I've no intention
of interfering.

227
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,426
I'm leaving now.

228
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,428
As you wish, my child.

229
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,683
Oh, and Reverend?
Where's the exit?

230
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,894
Do you expect me to answer?

231
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,646
I've been answering your
questions this whole time.

232
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,233
I think you can at least
respond to one of mine.

233
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,402
Is it on the next floor down?

234
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,448
[GRAY chuckles] I suggest you
take a look at the stained glass

235
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,866
in the cathedral.

236
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,409
I'll do that.

237
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,084
[RACHEL] After this,
there's no coming back.

238
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,935
Bye forever, and I'm sorry.

239
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,203
[gasps]

240
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,540
[RACHEL]
I just turned on the elevator.

241
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,000
Sure took you
long enough, didn't it?

242
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,669
You didn't run into
the priest, right?

243
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,379
He's still kickin' around?!

244
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,881
Uh‐huh, but for
some weird reason,

245
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,466
he didn't do anything.

246
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,511
Man, I cannot get
a read on that guy.

247
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,720
[RACHEL]
Oh yeah, the gun.

248
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,139
[ZACK grunts]

249
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,140
[RACHEL]
It's in the living room.

250
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,559
Well then, grab it so we can go!

251
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,733
[gasps]

252
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,237
[RACHEL]
The Doctor.

253
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,531
[ZACK] Jeez, how many times
do we have to kill him?

254
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,534
Just die! I'm thinkin'
he's the monster here!

255
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,618
[RACHEL gasps]

256
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,996
[RACHEL gasps]

257
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,795
Welp, that thing's no
good anymore. Let's go.

258
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
What's wrong?

259
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,801
This is what's
left of my parents.

260
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,054
[RACHEL]
I should say something.

261
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,308
[ZACK] Just say "bye‐bye"
like normal kids do.

262
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,728
Bye‐bye, Mom and Dad.

263
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,154
[ZACK grunts] Where's that
psycho doctor at?!

264
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,780
[RACHEL]
Hiding, maybe?

265
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,909
[ZACK] I say we hunt him
down and finish him off!

266
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,119
[RACHEL]
That's easier said than done.

267
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,246
He seems to know his
way around this building

268
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,998
better than
anybody else does.

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,625
We need to play it safe.

270
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,252
Ugh. You're no fun, Ray.

271
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,757
That's weird.

272
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,633
What?

273
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,760
The elevator is coming up.

274
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,220
Ain't it supposed to?

275
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,764
It should've been
stopped on this floor.

276
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,475
Which means somebody must
have ridden it down.

277
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
[ZACK]
Oh... That's not good.

278
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,562
‐‐[elevator dings]
‐‐[ZACK] Look out!

279
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:08,277
[ZACK] Hm? What the hell?
I don't see anybody.

280
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,123
[ZACK] Uh, you wanted to go say
goodbye to that room, right?

281
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,625
So, did you get to?

282
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,085
It was simple, but yeah.

283
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,629
Heh. That place looked
like a total pigsty,

284
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,882
maybe you shoulda cleaned it!

285
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:34,679
[ZACK grunts, sighs]
There's lotsa stuff in there.

286
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,847
Was that yours, or what?

287
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,266
Those are the things
I was given‐‐

288
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,977
Oh, so it wasn't
really yours, then.

289
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,522
I don't know. I sewed them
up and patched them.

290
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,607
I figured that would
mean they were mine.

291
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,944
But it's not like toys
and dolls can respond,

292
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,405
so I couldn't really
be sure either way.

293
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,492
But still...
I treasured all of them.

294
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,953
So I told them goodbye.

295
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,291
[gasps] I've always had
that music box, though.

296
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,086
I got it as a gift when
I was a little girl.

297
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,381
The music it made was so pretty.

298
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,259
You shoulda grabbed it
and brought it with you.

299
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,428
It's fine. I...

300
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,181
I'll remember the sound and all
the happiness it brought me.

301
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,602
As long as I have that,
I don't really need it anymore,

302
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,103
you know?

303
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,615
[ZACK grunts]
Now where do we go?

304
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,824
When I talked to the priest,

305
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,201
he said to take a look
at the stained glass.

306
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,871
You got a real answer
outta that guy?

307
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,082
He owed me one for
all my answers.

308
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,459
[ZACK gasps]

309
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,132
[ZACK] Alright, Specs,
where are you hiding?

310
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,972
I think this is our way out.

311
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,435
[ZACK] Sure, sure. I'll just
move this over real quick.

312
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,148
[ZACK grunts]

313
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,317
Damn, this is heavy.

314
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,110
Hey, kid!

315
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,070
What's up?

316
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,281
[ZACK] What do you think?
Come help me push!

317
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:25,373
[ZACK, RACHEL grunting]

318
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,552
[ZACK sighs]
Holy shit, my arms are numb!

319
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,263
Did I make myself useful?

320
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:46,560
Heh...Yeah, a little bit.

321
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,896
Anyway, call me crazy,

322
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,148
but are you sure there's
an exit behind that?

323
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,776
[RACHEL] Not at all, but I
don't think it's very likely

324
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:57,029
that the priest
was lying, either.

325
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:57,905
[gasps]

326
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,281
Huh?

327
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,243
Any ideas?

328
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,204
Just one, and I bet it's
the same one you had.

329
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:09,500
[ZACK chuckles]
You can leave it to me!

330
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:14,004
[yells]

331
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,767
[ZACK gasps]

332
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,316
So, are these stairs supposed
to lead us to freedom?

333
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,401
I think so.

334
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,278
Be better if you knew so.

335
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,406
Well, he didn't tell me what to
do after we got to the window.

336
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh well. Not much choice.

337
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
[ZACK]
Yeah, you got that right.

338
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,210
Jesus, how many stairs
can there be?

339
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:53,961
[RACHEL gasps]

340
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,421
[ZACK]
What now?

341
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,965
I remember.

342
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,216
[ZACK]
Huh?

343
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,427
[RACHEL] When I was
first brought here,

344
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,096
I was blindfolded
on the way inside.

345
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,056
How's that help us?

346
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,893
I know that I was taken
down a long staircase.

347
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,144
That's somethin'!

348
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,688
If we keep going,
we should make it out.

349
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,273
[ZACK]
Hell yeah!

350
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,987
[RACHEL gasps]

351
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,492
[ZACK] I feel like we've been
walkin' up this thing for days!

352
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,368
[RACHEL gasps]

353
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,164
[ZACK gasps] It's always
somethin' with you.

354
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,499
You okay?

355
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,460
[RACHEL]
Yeah. I'm fine.

356
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,421
Ya know...

357
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:42,968
...you seem more real now.
Let's go, try not to fall down.

358
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,013
[RACHEL]
What's wrong?

359
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,934
Take my knife.

360
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,229
[RACHEL gasps]
You're letting me borrow it?

361
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,563
No, it's for you.

362
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,564
[RACHEL gasps]

363
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,649
[ZACK]
It's pretty banged up,

364
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,568
so it probably won't
do you any good now.

365
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,154
But hey, it's better
than nothin', right?

366
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,829
[RACHEL]
Thank you.

367
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,541
[BOTH gasp]

368
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,543
[ANNOUNCER]
Emergency protocol activated.

369
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,712
Initiating building
detonation sequence.

370
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,799
