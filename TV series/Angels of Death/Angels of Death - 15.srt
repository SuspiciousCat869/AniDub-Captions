to kill me, aren't you, Zack?

[RACHEL] I'm sorry. I just need
to know this is what you want.

[RACHEL] I still wish to die
more than anything, of course.

But if... you're gonna kill me,
then it's better if you want to.

The thought of dying
makes me happy,

but when I imagine being
all alone when it happens,

100
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,021
it kind of makes me sad.

101
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,901
So I think if you kill me
because it'll bring you joy,

102
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,487
maybe I'll feel
better about it.

after you gave me this‐‐

I gave you that?

ever given anything to anybody.

You know me. I don't do anything
I don't wanna do. Not ever.

Do you mean that?

you a thousand times.

way too much time together.

[ZACK] Anyway, make a
good face for me.

So brave, and so stupid!

I hate to tell you this, but it
looks like it's too late for you

You're not getting any
options this time!

And you definitely
can't kill Rachel.

Tell me how it feels, Zack.

145
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,419
Having your one dream
ripped away from you!

Come on, Ray, keep it together.

If you die now,
you'll make a liar outta me.

150
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,143
Please. Don't make me turn
into the thing I hate the most.

151
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,646
Ah, a monster without his fangs.
What could be more entertaining?

He's not a monster.

He's not God, either.

Zack is..

...a human being.
No more and no less.

157

So, there's no reason he has
to give me everything I want.

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,302
[ZACK]
Ray...

160
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,679
[DANNY] You're satisfied with
him giving you nothing?

161
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,766
Rachel! I've always
given you everything!

162
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,268
All the food, and toys and
clothes you could want!

163
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,728
And I gave you your floor!

164
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,396
Did that mean nothing to you?!

165
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,107
As far as I know, he only
ever gave you a knife.

166
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,485
That thing belongs
in the damn trash!

167
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,652
[DANNY]
Oh, wait.

168
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,405
I suppose he did give you
that silly death promise.

169
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,159
Of course! What a
nice gift that was!

170
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,122
After everything that I've done.

171
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,541
I've worked so hard to keep
you alive up until now

172
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,168
and this is the thanks I get!

173
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:45,551
[RACHEL] But, Doctor...?
I never asked to live that way.

174
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:52,433
I just hoped someone would want
me alive, even for a moment.

175
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,478
And that I'd also be...

176
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,522
...wanted in death.

177
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,944
After I made that vow with Zack,

178
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,448
and we started
trying to get out.

179
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,204
I understood that...
that would be enough for me.

180
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,000
[DANNY]
If that's true,

181
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,045
then shouldn't you feel
even more despair?

182
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,004
After all,

183
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,966
I've just taken the possibility
of having that away from you.

184
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,883
[ZACK]
That's enough.

185
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,635
[DANNY]
Shut up and let me speak!

186
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,595
Yeah? Make me!

187
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,058
[RACHEL]
You didn't take it away.

188
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,351
[ZACK gasps]

189
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,019
[RACHEL grunts]

190
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:43,025
No matter what, I know that
a vow cannot be stolen.

191
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:48,030
Even if it turns out that it
can't be fulfilled, it's okay.

192
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:55,288
It's still ours. It's something
we share, and it always will be.

193
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,129
[RACHEL]
Zack.

194
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:08,259
I've decided I'm going to carry
our promise with me forever.

195
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,512
And that means you
won't be a liar.

196
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:16,517
So it's okay if you don't
get a chance to kill me.

197
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:23,191
[DANNY whimpers]

198
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,961
[ZACK gasps]

199
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,964
Ray no. You can't.

200
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,427
Ah, poor Rachel.
Never looked to anyone else.

201
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,179
Never trusted a soul.

202
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,098
If your eyes had
remained doubtful,

203
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,101
if you had spent the
rest of your life lonely,

204
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,563
I can honestly say I
wouldn't have minded dying.

205
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,148
But now this.

206
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,359
What have you done, Rachel?

207
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,905
Why have you strayed so
far from your loneliness?

208
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,533
You have destroyed everything.

209
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,872
[DANNY]
Either way, it's all over now.

210
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,125
I'll kill your wish
along with Zack's.

211
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:28,422
And finally, my own.
All with this single shot.

212
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:38,724
I never knew what a truly
selfish man you could be, Danny.

213
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,396
Reverend... It's you. Why?

214
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,609
[DANNY groans]
Not yet!

215
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,572
Goodbye, Zack. You've eluded
me for the last time!

216
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:59,912
[GRAY] Now, son. Are you
still able to move? Well?

217
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:04,834
Listen, preacher. I ain't got
time for your games. Save it.

218
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,336
[GRAY] If you have any
strength left to gather,

219
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,214
then you should use it to
carry the girl to safety.

220
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,427
What for? See all that blood?
No one lives through that!

221
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,013
What's the point in tryin'
to save somebody who's dead?

222
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,599
[GRAY]
Rachel Gardner is still alive.

223
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,725
[gasps]

224
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,394
[GRAY] If you leave at once,
then her life will be saved.

225
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,354
[ZACK]
What are you sayin'?

226
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:30,026
Make haste, and you will see,
but you must go immediately!

227
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,820
You'll understand in due time!

228
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,875
[chuckles]

229
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,672
The moon is so
pretty and blue.

230
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,509
But, it almost looks like
it's not real or something.

231
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,063
[ZACK] Big mistake.
'Cause I really hate liars.
