00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,333
I'm sorry, sir.

331
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,125
But if she won't answer me,
I don't know what else to--

332
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,583
It's clear that the witch
has tainted your heart, Edward,

333
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,625
so the court has no
further use for your testimony.

334
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,416
No, wait. I'm not done.

335
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,916
I can see your fear
of the defendant,

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,458
is struggling to coexist

337
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,916
with your unwavering
affection for her.

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,375
Rachel.

339
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,375
Let me hear your voice.

340
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,041
Please, I'm begging you.

341
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,375
The next witness to testify
will be Dr. Daniel Dickens.

342
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,625
It's the moment
I've been waiting for.

343
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,291
Doctor.

344
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,708
Is there any more medicine?

345
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,958
You seem so relaxed, Rachel.

346
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,541
Aren't you happy
to see that I'm alive?

347
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,083
[GRAY]
Danny.

348
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,458
Are you planning to testify,
or just waste our time?

349
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,916
Of course I'm going
to testify, sir.

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,833
After all, I'm the only one
in the room

351
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,083
who knows the defendant
for who she truly is inside.

352
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,916
If I don't speak,
how will everyone know

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,416
what a charming young lady
she can be?

354
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,916
Though, if you ask me,

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,791
I think it's silly that I have
to explain something

356
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,416
that anyone with eyes can see.

357
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,583
All of you have been blind
to what makes her so special.

358
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,416
It all began
in the counseling room

359
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,166
where she and I met
for the first time.

360
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,791
A day I won't forget.

361
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,791
All my life I've been searching
for the perfect pair of peepers.

362
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,291
The kind that are dead,
but forever alive.

363
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,333
And that was when
I first saw her.

364
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,833
Thinking back on it now fills
my heart with happiness.

365
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,583
No other eyes in the world
have ever been so enchanting.

366
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,166
Like peaceful oases
in a dark void.

367
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,458
Their brilliant
yet muted blueness

368
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,583
absolutely stole my heart.

369
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,916
I knew as soon as I saw them.

370
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,375
Those peepers of hers,
living and lifeless at once,

371
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,166
were exactly
the priceless treasures

372
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,833
I'd searched for all along!

373
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,625
Anybody with a pair of eyes
like those has to be abnormal.

374
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,291
I'll agree with you on that.

375
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,166
Her soul is damned
beyond salvation!

376
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,625
We've heard
quite enough, Doctor.

377
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,958
Her soul is damned
beyond salvation!

378
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,125
Settle down!

379
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,208
Her soul is damned
beyond salvation!

380
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,083
[GRAY]
Danny!

381
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,416
And I'll tell you why,

382
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,166
it's because the soul
of Rachel Gardner--

383
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,375
[RACHEL]
Stop it.

384
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,125
Her soul can never be redeemed.

385
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,375
After all,

386
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,875
Rachel consumes
everything she sees.

387
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,166
She's merciless,

388
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,208
endlessly taking
from the people around her

389
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,875
in hopes of satisfying
her own emptiness.

390
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,375
All her soul can do is take.

391
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
Ah, those blue eyes.

392
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,125
Let me look into them.

393
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,833
Strikingly lovely.

394
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, this is the real you.

395
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,958
Spend your days with me, Rachel.

396
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,625
I'll keep you safe.

397
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,666
I swear.

398
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,625
You're out of order, Danny.

399
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,458
[DANNY]
Sorry.

400
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,416
Have you completed
your testimony?

401
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,708
Well, if you're still curious
about her charms,

402
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,416
I would be happy to explain them
to you in deeper detail.

403
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,750
Hold your tongue.

404
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,166
I've heard everything
that I need to hear.

405
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,083
This witness is
hereby dismissed.

406
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,208
[DANNY]
Hmm.

407
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,083
Don't worry, Rachel.

408
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,875
Just remember what I said.

409
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,041
The true nature of your soul
is to steal from others,

410
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,583
not to be stolen away.

411
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,875
[shudders]

412
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,000
[GRAY] This concludes
the witness statements.

413
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,875
Now then, Rachel Gardner,

414
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,875
I have determined your fate.

415
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,875
The testimonies we've heard
have been most informative.

416
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,250
Dr. Danny's
was especially revealing.

417
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,666
And I suppose he has known you
longer than the other two.

418
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,166
He spoke nothing but the truth

419
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,833
and didn't refute
a single thing you said.

420
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,916
The man is desperately
infatuated with you.

421
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,458
Maybe, but that's not my fault.

422
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,791
He was the one who decided to--

423
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,416
Are you denying
that you were the one

424
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,708
who acted selfishly in all this?

425
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,666
Eddie's statement
illustrated it perfectly.

426
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,125
He claims you live according
to your own desires,

427
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,000
without any regard for others.

428
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,125
That's a lie.

429
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,125
Not to mention Catherine.

430
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,541
You got her to surrender
to your spell,

431
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,416
like the foul witch you are.

432
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,208
What a shame to see such
a proud woman reduced to that.

433
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,125
Stop it.

434
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,208
And now for the verdict.

435
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,916
Rachel Gardner is
found guilty of sorcery.

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,083
I sentence her
to be burned alive.

437
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,125
You're wrong!
