would turn out this way?

00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:56,635
[DANNY gasps]
Reverend Gray. Why?

16
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,305
I admit, I was self‐serving.

17
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,600
And I know I was supposed
to do as you told me.

18
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,646
But still, none of the things
that I did were wrong!

19
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,440
Even if it was for myself,
I helped you!

20
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,026
My efforts to thwart Rachel and
Zack were protecting the rules

21
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,946
of this building from being
broken, so it was your gain!

22
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,116
It's fair to say your endeavors
allowed me to see something

23
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
of profound interest
to my study.

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,745
At the start, I was
convinced Isaac Foster

25
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,790
was a being that possessed
invisible wings.

26
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,750
But now, after all
that's happened,

27
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,545
those wings are entirely
imperceptible to me.

28
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,296
[DANNY]
Invisible wings?

29
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,884
Did you actually believe Zack
was some kind of angel?

30
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,053
Yes, for a while, I did.

31
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,097
Because he thought
only of killing.

32
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,016
To me, that made
him seem so pure.

33
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,645
But recently. Isaac learned to
wield his blade for the benefit

34
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,772
of someone besides himself.

35
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,400
As a result, his weapon
was destroyed,

36
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,611
and he fell from heaven's
ranks to become human.

37
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,241
No. Perhaps I should say
he was human all along.

38
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,786
What's more, the one who opened
my eyes to that reality

39
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,496
was Rachel Gardner,

40
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,291
the young girl whom I had
denounced as a witch.

41
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,420
Her transformation was as
striking as it was confusing.

42
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,297
How could one so self‐serving

43
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:20,260
and rife with contradiction
change so much?

44
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,803
But looking back,

45
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,056
it was I who tried to stamp
out Isaac's humanity.

46
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,516
The blame is all mine.

47
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,853
[DANNY] If that's how you feel,
then why did you shoot me?

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,815
I suppose, it was
my vain attempt

49
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,443
to atone for what I've done.

50
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,363
Now, my observation and
experiments are complete.

51
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,993
As is my responsibility
to stand in place of God.

52
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,496
After all this, it ends here?

53
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,374
And Danny, you are the one
who brought me Rachel.

54
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,877
But although you were
meant to steal her soul,

55
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,088
your true intention was
helping her gain one.

56
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,050
Admit it, everything you did
for her was part of your attempt

57
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,885
to become her God, was it not?

58
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,011
[DANNY gasps]

59
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,389
[GRAY] But it was no use,
because you are not God.

60
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,767
Doctor, you must have
been aware of that, so‐‐

61
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,977
[DANNY] Without becoming
God in Rachel's eyes,

62
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,771
I'd have had nothing!

63
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,778
When I first gazed into
those perfect works of art,

64
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,447
I knew they belonged to
someone who'd lost all hope

65
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,992
and would never
love another soul.

66
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,330
So I wanted to give them
my love for eternity.

67
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,290
I thought my life was over.

68
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,001
Then, those peepers gave me
a reason to keep living!

69
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,838
I felt like I could
do anything at all!

70
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,550
B‐But. I can't love
them any longer.

71
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,512
If Rachel isn't alone anymore,

72
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,558
There's no one left who'll
accept the ugly thing that I am.

73
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,479
[GRAY] Then, you mean, that by
offering your devotion to her,

74
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,148
you were hoping you could
eventually earn her love

75
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,902
in return, is that correct?

76
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,946
Danny, despite everything,

77
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,282
you and I are nothing
but human beings.

78
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,618
[DANNY gasps]
That's all? No more?

[GRAY] No one who ever
set foot in this building

80
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,373
was anything but human.

81
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,877
Humans are the ones who
create God, and angels,

82
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,755
and the differences between.
In fact, Rachel Gardner

83
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,300
may have been the
greatest example of all.

The only entity who ever
damned anyone wasn't God...

What was it that you
saw in all of them?

00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,398
[GRAY] Sadly, what I
observed was no different

89
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,818
than what I'd always
seen in humans.

90
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,281
They were all so ugly.
So selfish. So lost.

91

Yet so beautiful.
Such simple truths.

00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,789
Of course, as one
of my "angels",

93

the same thing is true of you.

But somehow, even though
you were here longer

than any of the rest,
I didn't see it 'til now.

124
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,306
[FEMALE REPORTER A] As for the
young girl found at the scene,

125
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,351
investigators have identified
her as Rachel Gardner.

126
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,061
Who, after her parents' death,

127

had recently been
reported missing.

128

One of the suspects in the
explosion case is Isaac Foster.

129

In fact, reports say
he's already connected

to several crimes.

He's not the one responsible
for the explosion.

133

Actually, he denies kidnapping
Rachel Gardner, and he says

that he has no connection to
the murder of her parents.

One more question.

Have you found out how he's
connected to the girl?

We keep asking
him about her,

but all he tells
us is, "I dunno."

As a matter of fact, when it
came to Rachel Gardner,

he started asking
us some questions.

He wanted to know if she
was still alive or not.

But then, for some reason,
when we told him she was,

of Rachel Gardner?

157
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,181
She seemed to be a sweet,
beautiful little girl,

158
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,643
but she had such a
hopeless look on her face.

159
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,686
I guess I can't blame
her for that, though.

160
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,938
[FEMALE REPORTER A]
I see.

161
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,899
And has she told you anything
pertaining to this case?

162
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,110
Not yet. She keeps saying
she doesn't know any details.

163
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,362
[FEMALE REPORTER A]
What sort of counseling

164
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,155
are you giving her, then?

165
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,366
I want to restore
her peace of mind.

166
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,409
That's the main goal here.

167
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,329
However, she doesn't
give many facial cues,

168
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,039
and she seems to have
a difficult time

169
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,375
expressing her feelings.

170
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,417
It's very strange.

171
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,587
All she wants to do is find
out more about that murderer.

172
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,756
You're right, perhaps it
could be that she can't get

173
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,216
the murderer out of her mind?

174
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,636
[DOC] That's my theory, yes.
So, in light of all that,

175
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,138
I've made a serious effort
to shield her from updates

176
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,515
regarding the case.

177
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,350
She's obviously
frightened of him,

178
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,768
so it's been good for her.

179
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,686
[FEMALE REPORTER A]
Well, Doctor,

180
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,188
I hope she'll make
a speedy recovery.

181
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,233
I'll keep doing my best to help
her heal from this trauma.

182
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,137
Good morning, Rachel.
Are you awake yet?

183
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,060
[DOC]
Did you sleep alright?

184
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,315
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,443
[DOC] We'll do your counseling
session in the evening today.

186
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,905
[DOC]
It's so nice out.

187
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,659
[DOC]
After your breakfast,

188
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,994
what do you say you and
I go for a little walk?

189
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,669
[RACHEL]
Okay.

190
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,225
[DOC sighs]
Quiet places like this

191
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,103
are always so relaxing,
don't you agree?

192
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,480
Uh‐huh.

193
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,194
[DOC] Actually, could you wait
here for a moment, please?

194
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,179
[MALE REPORTER A] The suspect in
these serial murders and the man

195
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,099
found at the scene was Isaac
Foster, who's since been take‐‐

196
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,947
[DOC] Has anything been
making you feel uneasy lately?

197
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,074
I don't think so.

198
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,452
[DOC] Would you say that
you've been sleeping well?

199
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,163
Yes.

200
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,833
[DOC] Good. Maybe we should
stop here for the day, then.

201
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,630
I hope that's okay. My last
session ran a bit too long.

202
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,216
So, sorry for the late start.

203
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,760
I'll walk you to your room.

204
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,386
I can go by myself.

205
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,722
You're supposed to be
supervised at all times.

206
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,683
I do apologize.

207
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,770
My, look how pretty the sky is.

208
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,107
[DOC]
It's a beautiful night.

209
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,401
[RACHEL]
A beautiful night?

210
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,487
[DOC] Yes, and the
best way to enjoy it

211
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,531
is by going to bed early.

212
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,908
I'm sure you'll have
sweet dreams.

213
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,501
[DOC]
Shall we, then?

214
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,006
Rachel, dear.
You're not afraid, are you?

215
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:34,387
[DOC] Your condition's improved
a lot since you first got here.

216
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,098
It's like you're a completely
different girl than the one

217
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,519
who always used to ask about
that killer they found you with.

218
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,063
Which is why... I'm going
to tell you something

219
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,315
that you really aren't
supposed to know about.

220
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,569
Perhaps it'll ease your mind.

221
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,696
You see, the murderer...

222
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,577
They sentenced him to death.

223
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,290
[RACHEL]
Oh... really?

224
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,667
[DOC]
Yes. I'm sure it's a shock,

225
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,962
but hopefully now you'll
be able to sleep soundly.

226
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,672
[RACHEL]
Right.

00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,257

Let's get you to bed.

228
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,932
[DOC]
Go straight to sleep, okay?

229
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,642
You need rest.

230
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,774
[RACHEL] The truth was, I hadn't
slept well the entire time.

231
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,028
[RACHEL]
I couldn't calm down.

00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,780
And I knew that night
was no different.

00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,660
[RACHEL] But still, there was
nothing left for me to do

234
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,662
but close my eyes.

After all that,

you're still wearin' that
boring ol' face o' yours.

How? What do you mean how?

Aren't you...
supposed to be in prison?

Yeah, well obviously I
decided to change my plans!

[RACHEL gasps]
But, Zack.

245

When I last saw you, I said
that I would... carry our vow!

Yeah, that doesn't
quite cut it for me.

Besides. Isn't a promise
made between two people?

Wait... I'm not sure I get it.

Are you still gonna
kill me or not?

[ZACK] What do you think?
You know me.

251
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,812
When I want somethin', I make
damn sure that I get it.

252
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,817
We gotta hurry, though. I don't
have a lotta time here.

And you better not have
forgotten your end o' the deal.

[RACHEL sighs] Of course not,
Zack. I didn't forget.

255
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,244
I could never forget!

256
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:10,042
We promised, didn't we?
You and me, right?

No matter what gets in our way!

Hell yeah! So, are you ready?

[RACHEL]
Yes!

It's time now.
So if you would...
