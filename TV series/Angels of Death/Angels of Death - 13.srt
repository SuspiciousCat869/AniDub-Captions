00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,601
[MALE REPORTER A] Once there,
police found a disturbing scene.

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,603
The two had knife
and bullet wounds,

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,147
suggesting it
was a murder.

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,233
It appears the two
died a week ago,

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,943
but perhaps the
most striking detail

7
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,488
was that they'd been
crudely sewn together.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,783
Hang on. They were
sewn together?

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,702
Standing near them was
their child, Rachel Gardner.

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,247
The girl was seemingly unharmed.

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,831
She was escorted
to safety,

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,376
but her behavior suggests
a state of confusion

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,545
that would indicate the child
may have been present

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,630

That asshole!

18
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,596
I think during today's session,
I'd like to go into more detail.

19
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,558
There's nothing for you
to be scared of, okay?

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,852
Oh, you're making eye contact!

21
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:10,607
You really do have some
beautiful peepers!

22
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,652
One of my eyes
is artificial, you see.

23
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,238
I was born with an empty socket.

24
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,783
My mother was deeply
troubled by it. In fact,

25
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,830
it disturbed her so much,
that her own eyes went dark.

26
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,834
In the end, I couldn't
even see myself in them.

27
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,088
But despite that, I still
loved my mother very much.

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,341
Her eyes were so precious to me.

29
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,470
Tell me, did you hate
your parents, Rachel?

30
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,722
No, sir.

31
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,598
[DANNY]
But if that's true,

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,017
how could you possibly
have done that to them?

33
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,894
What do you mean?

34
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,982
[DANNY] You cut them up
and sewed them together.

35
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:57,738
Oh, right. Because...
I wanted to have a family.

36
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,574
[DANNY] Was there something
that pushed you to do it?

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,162
[RACHEL] I found a puppy in
the alley near our house.

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,082
[RACHEL]
It was so tiny and helpless.

39
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,920
I wanted to take it home
with me and keep it forever.

40
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,840
But I decided I should probably
try to get permission from

41
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:21,178
my mom and dad.
But when I came in...

You may be a cop,

but you're still
a useless drunk.

45
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,779
I have no respect for you.

I went back to see the puppy.

But this time, its little
body was trembling.

Stupid. No one needs you.

158
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,649
[RACHEL'S DAD] You're not
good for anything, Rachel.

159
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,068
[clicking]

160
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,404
Where'd you get that thing?

161
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,408
I'm your father,
you better tell the truth!

162
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,034
It belonged to Mom.

163
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:05,039
Huh? Oh really? That bitch
was hiding a gun from me?

164
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,833
[RACHEL]
Hey, Dad?

165
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,750
Yeah, what?

166
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,921
I want us... to become
a perfect family.

167
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:29,898
It's okay... I know how I
can make everything right.

168
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,361
[RACHEL] And that was when I
decided to sew my Mom and Dad's

169
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,572
bodies together.

170
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,490
Since Dad's arm was no good,

171
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,285
I just replaced it
with a stuffed one.

172
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,205
And my Mom looked sad,
so I stitched up her mouth

173
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,499
to make it seem like
she was smiling.

174
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,211
I made myself the
perfect set of parents.

175
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,754
[DANNY]
Ah, I see.

176
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,005
It was nice.

177
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,258
The three of us played with
our new puppy together.

178
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,887
But then, when the policemen
came to take them away from me,

179
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,680
It upset me.

180
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,516
You were sad. I understand that.

181
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,810
More than you know.

182
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,481
Could I ask you...
one more question?

183
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,983
While you were staying
at that orphanage,

184
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,110
another small animal died.

185
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,614
Can you tell me
what happened to it?

186
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,950
Were you the one who killed it?

187
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,702
I heard you were in charge
of taking care of it.

188
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,920
Um... Yes. It really
meant a lot to me.

189
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,172
But it was still no use.

190
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,966
What was no use?

191
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,927
[RACHEL]
Well, I wanted to keep it.

192
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,472
I wanted to be able
to call it mine.

193
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,518
But for some reason,
nothing worked.

194
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,395
I couldn't have it.

195
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,358
[DANNY]
That's very interesting.

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,402
Let's think about that, Rachel.

197
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:02,448
Do you wish you had more things
that you could call your own?

198
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,453
My mother, she took her life,
all because of me.

199
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,958
My eye killed her. It's the
whole reason she's gone.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,293
And your eyes,

201
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,879
they look just like hers
did the last time I saw her.

202
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,050
Endlessly dark and silent,
and so beautiful, too!

203
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,511
Oh, how I adore those peepers.

204
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,014
Lifeless and brilliant
at the same time!

205
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,724
They'll forever be‐‐

206
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,648
So by watchin' this tape,
does that mean I know everything

207
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,235
about Ray? What's the point
of showin' me all that crap?

208
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,949
Man, I can't wait to
get my hands on that

209
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,951
eyeball‐crazy sicko!

[ZACK]
Open up, already!

There's no need to be so rough.

00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,127
Come in, it's unlocked.

00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,092
Hey, Zack.

215
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,014
Okay, look. First off,
tell me something.

216
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,058
Do you kill everyone
who comes to this floor

217
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,352
like all the other clowns here?

218
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,567
Jeez, Ray. Answer already!
Do ya or don't ya?

219
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
[gunshot]

220
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,867
Please be respectful
of my patient,

221
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,411
she's been through a lot.

222
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,704
You little‐‐

223
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,335
Well, well. You know
the whole story now.

224
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,838
[ZACK] That was some pretty
sick shit you made me watch.

225
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,384
I do apologize. Counseling can
be upsetting work.

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,844
[ZACK] I didn't come to
hear you complain.

227
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,304
[DANNY]
Huh?

228
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,391
I still want Ray to
answer my question.

229
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll ask you again.

230
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,937
Do you kill everyone who
comes to this floor, or not?

231
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,318
And if so, does that mean
you're gonna kill me, too?

232
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,946
‐‐No, Zack. I just‐‐
‐‐[DANNY] Ah‐ah‐ahh!

233
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,989
It isn't nice to lie.

234
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,118
I think it's much better if
you tell him the truth now!

235
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,828
Okay?

236
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,415
Or maybe I should tell him.

237
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,959
Yes, Zack. Everything
is exactly as you‐‐

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
Please, stop it!

239
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,924
Too bad. Might as well move on.

240
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,969
He saw it all.
You can't change that.

241
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,096
When she got here,
Reverend Gray made

242
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,474
Rachel the resident angel
of this floor at my request.

243
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:37,228
However, she underwent a
serious mental breakdown,

244
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,565
and all because of
that Bible over there.

245
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,151
You were always so
calm and reserved.

246
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,821
Why did that cause
you to lose your mind?

247
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,617
I wanted to reach perfection,
like it says to.

248
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,495
That's the way it had to be.

249
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,373
But the Bible says
something else, too.

250
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,917
That the kind of person I am,

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,004
is the kind that can
never be forgiven.

252
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,798
Precisely. That's why
you were trying so hard

253
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,592
to get Zack to
kill you, right?

254
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,928
Rachel. I think you may
already know this, but,

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,014
no matter how much
you study the Bible

256
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,516
or recognize your shortcomings,

257
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,978
That feeling in the pit of your
stomach won't go away.

258
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,191
[DANNY] Oh, this is so
wonderfully awful!

259
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,027
What do you think, Zach?
Do you understand now?

260
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,945
It's time for you to choose.

261
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,531
You can do nothing
and die right here,

262
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,533
or you can give up
on being her God

263
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,453
and leave this
building alone.

264
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,705
So, what's your call?

265
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,671
Is this guy tellin' the truth
about your past or not?

266
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,091
I told you, she's been
deceiving you this entire time!

267
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:54,055
I asked her. Have you been
keepin' all this from me?

268
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,973
Don't go, Zack.

269
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,102
I need you to keep on
being my God, alright?

270
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,979
Makin' my own decisions
is hard enough,

271
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,273
don't ask me to make yours too.

272
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,489
Sorry, kid. I'm not your God,
and I'm never gonna be.

273
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,366
[RACHEL gasps]

274
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,869
You're absolutely right, you're
just a worthless human scumbag!

275
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,038
Which means you can go
back to being your old self,

276
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,708
isn't that nice? And I'll
happily grant any wish you have.

277
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,669
I've done terrible things,

278
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,090
so I'm unclean,
and that hasn't changed.

279
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,261
But knowing that I've sinned,
doesn't make it go away.

280
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm not sure what
else I should do,

281
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,600
now that it's already happened.

282
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:45,815
So, Zack, you... you're really
going to stop being my God?

283
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,900
That's right.

284
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,403

isn't loaded, Ray.

00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,145
This isn't funny!

313
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,784
You can run around all you want,
but it won't fix anything.

314
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,287
[ZACK]
Go on, shoot.

315
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,456
[RACHEL]
You're about to die, Zack.

316
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,667
[ZACK]
If you plan to kill me...

317
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,714
...then I'll just have to beat
you to the punch, won't I?

318
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,050
That isn't enough, not now.

319
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,262
I still believe it's
right for me to die.

320
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,265
That someone needs
to take my life.

321
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,519
But since I'm unclean, God
doesn't even want me anymore.

322
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,646
He has no use for me.

323
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,817
[RACHEL]
No one needs me.

324
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,196
Even so, you're the one who
said you were going to kill me.

325
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,531
You swore to.

326
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,868
And then, when I found
out there was no God,

327
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,205
you gave me purpose by
becoming my replacement.

328
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:53,586
Ray, look, I told you.
I'm no God.

329
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,297
Yeah. I know that.

330
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,972
When my lie was exposed...

331
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:14,607
[RACHEL] ...the new God that
I had set up, also died.

332
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,115
[ZACK grunts]

333
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,329
[ZACK]
You're never gonna listen to me.

334
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,540
You just hear whatever you
want and block the rest out.

335
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,755
All you ever do is
run away, isn't it?

336
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,592
You owe me an answer!

337
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,512
[DANNY] It would appear that she
has nothing more to say to you.

338
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,138
[ZACK gasps]

339
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,223
Your guard is down,

340
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,892
that is quite out of
character for you, Zack.

341
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:50,768
Watch it.

342
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,438
I'm the one holding
the gun. And Rachel?

343
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,233
Usually you keep things a
bit more simple than this.

344
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,318
Why don't we wrap it up?

345
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:06,158
Of course, we are dealing with a
monster, so we can't be sloppy.

346
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,701
But don't worry, dear.

347
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,870
If you shoot him in
the head from here,

348
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,705
there's no hope of survival.

349
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,916
‐‐Go ahead.
‐‐You're a friggin' nutcase.
