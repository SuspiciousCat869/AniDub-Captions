1
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,333
Boop boop be doo...

2
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,708
Boop boop be doo...

3
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,083
Wow!

4
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,208
Hey...

5
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,708
 Is this Ayumu speaking?

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,750
How are things going?

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,583
Honestly, since
we lost Mystletainn,

8
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,625
things are going nowhere fast...

9
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,166
And that's me
being optimistic.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,666
I'm between a rock
and hard place here.

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,416
I've got something
that'll brighten your day.

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,625
I'll be back!

13
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,416
Whoa!

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,083
That's really him!

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,083
Killer news, Haruna!...!

16
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,041
It looks like we're actually
gonna get Mystletainn

17
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,250
really soon!

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,166
That's awesome!

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,750
Hot damn!

20
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,166
I can go to the festival

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,375
and not be expected to be
some gender bending icon!

22
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,958
Is it a pride festival?

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,875
Ayumu Aikawa was beginning
to get comfortable in the silky,

24
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,625
lacy trappings
of a cross dresser.

25
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,791
Hiding his manhood
had become second nature.

26
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,625
But time moves on, and the
budding fruits of youth ripen,

27
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,458
bursting with sweet,
sticky vitality.

28
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,875
What test will Gaia
place in his lap this time?

29
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,791
Festival...!

30
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,166
Festival...!

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,291
Fe-fe-fe-fe-festival!

32
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,833
The menu will be
fried eggs only!

33
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,375
Excuse me.

34
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,750
You, with the hair!

35
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,250
Are we really gonna do
actual SWAT team exercises?

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,500
You bet your tight
little tookis we will...!

37
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,791
We're gonna
be shootin' paintballs

38
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,083
outta real live AK-47s!

39
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,250
Trust me, I know Haruna
has no business in front of

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,666
a classroom like this...

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,375
I mean, "think of
the children."...

42
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,541
But Tomonori thought
she could share her wisdom

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,166
as the egg-slayer.

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,625
This girl can show you how to
fry your way into a man's heart.

45
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,375
OMG teach me...

46
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,708
please!

47
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,916
Preying on human weakness,
Haruna also put Orito

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,708
to work on her social campaign

49
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,083
Because of everything that she
did for the Summer festival,

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,750
even I almost got some!

51
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,500
No way!

52
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,541
Now where are we supposed
to get these assault rifles?

53
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,958
Hey, "Miss genius"!

54
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,500
This plan of yours
isn't gonna work.

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,500
Are you kiddin',
it's a great idea!

56
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,416
So Ayumu...

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,083
Do you have a better idea?

58
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,208
Uhhh...

59
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:05,875
Ooh ooh!

60
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,791
A "bottomless" café!

61
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,416
Shut up!

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,083
I dunno...

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,833
 Hey...

64
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,250
We could go spooky...!

65
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,208
Sound cool?

66
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:13,875
I know...

67
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,250
That was lame...

68
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
just forget about it.

69
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,041
Love it!

70
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,541
Yeah...

71
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,541
A spooky café...

72
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,833
I'm in!

73
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,708
Me, too!

74
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,416
Pretty cool...

75
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I think that sounds hot.

76
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
Okay, but no lame
twinkly vampires.

77
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,250
Alright everyone...

78
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,833
all in favor of Ayumu's
spooky café, gimme an "aye!"

79
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,333
Aye!

80
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,250
Then let's get this
party started!

81
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,541
We'll serve fried eggs of doom!

82
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,291
Now that the theme
has been chosen,

83
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,791
we cut to the day
before the big day.

84
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,333
Festival eve.

85
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,708
I'm outta here.

86
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,041
I'll be coming
before too long ...

87
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,375
I just gotta finish
packin' my little box.

88
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,958
You're gonna
be there again today?

89
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,166
Well, I can't expect to leave
everything up to you losers!

90
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,041
You know what they say,
the more the merrier...

91
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,666
You don't wanna be mean
and play with yourself.

92
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,375
Yeah, okay you won me over...

93
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,208
Well...

94
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,458
Guess I'll see ya up there.

95
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,833
Yupper...!

96
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,708
You should really check out
the school sometime...

97
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,416
They have a a buttload
of cool tools there.

98
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,416
And some decent brains to pick
for advice on making stuff.

99
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,041
I'm out too, don't wait up!

100
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,125
Festival...

101
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,083
Festival...

102
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,500
Great, now Haruna's
rubbin' off on me.

103
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,166
Oh my god- are you okay, sir?

104
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,250
Yeah...

105
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,666
Nice weather
we're having, eh?

106
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Damn it!

107
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,875
My doctor says I shouldn't try
to break the ice with smalltalk.

108
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,666
I think he needs
a second opinion.

109
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,416
Here...

110
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,833
Take this, kid.

111
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,291
Uh, sure...

112
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,083
but... why?

113
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,208
In time...

114
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,041
You will know the
value of that ring.

115
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,250
Say what?

116
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,416
Damn it!

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,583
My doctor says I need
to stop trying to sound like

118
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,750
an action movie mentor.

119
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,833
So do you think that this
cape will work for Dracula?

120
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,583
You're such a creeper.

121
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,250
Um, Ayumu...

122
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,208
Hey, what's up?

123
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,000
I got a couple of hanging things
if you think you can use them.

124
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,625
Sure, that sounds great.

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,583
Cool, I can get
more if you want.

126
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,125
Yeah, that would be awesome...

127
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,000
And if you wanna
grab a handful of...

128
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,583
Do you mind...?

129
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,458
You're being way too loud!

130
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,166
The hell is that?

131
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
Something I don't have time
to explain to you , dumbass!

132
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,125
Hey Ayumu...

133
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,375
Looks like we're gonna

134
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,375
have to make a run to go
get some more material.

135
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,416
Cool.

136
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,458
Get your hands off,
you molester!

137
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,458
Hey, you're askin for it
by goin' commando.

138
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,375
This is a bra top,
you asshole!

139
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,875
What sorcery be this?

140
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,458
The top has cups built in,
so it's just like wearing a bra.

141
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,166
Oh man!

142
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,208
You are such a tease!

143
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,708
You're a future
syphilis carrier!

144
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,000
You know you love me!

145
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,958
Weird when you
think about it...

146
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,208
But these past few weeks,

147
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,083
things feel like
they're falling into place...

148
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,625
Like I'm starting to get
my groove back, you know?

149
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,791
Prob'ly sounds
stupid coming from me.

150
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,833
I know there's nothing
lamer than a guy who peaks

151
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,000
in high school and
never gets over it...

152
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,166
But being a teenager...

153
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,541
It feels pretty cool right now.

154
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,875
It makes me giggle
like a schoolgirl...

155
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,833
The way all of us kids
are coming together

156
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,041
for something larger
than ourselves...

157
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,625
I feel ya.

158
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,125
When you are raised up high in
victory by comrades who share

159
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,708
the same goal as you...

160
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,458
It is far superior to the depths
of despair you're thrown into

161
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,708
when you've been crushed under
the heel of your mortal enemy.

162
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,083
It carves a trench into your
heart that will never be filled.

163
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,500
No matter how many
centuries you might live.

164
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,458
Are you sure you're
not over-medicating there?

165
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,083
 Whoo...!

166
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,541
That's the shiz-nit!

167
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,375
Goodnight.

168
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,916
And I'll just take that
as my cue to leave...

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,791
Maybe you should save a little
for some hair of the dog.

170
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,208
Good boy...

171
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,125
fetch.

172
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,083
Get momma some more fishy.

173
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:48,958
Okay...

174
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:49,875
now...

175
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,250
where was I?

176
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh, hey there.

177
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,083
I hated knowing that you
were up here trying to work

178
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,916
this out all by yourself...

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,666
So I came to try
and lend a hand.

180
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,791
Oh yeah?

181
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,916
If you want...

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,125
I don't mind...

183
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,958
I mean unless...

184
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,000
You'd rather be
alone or something.

185
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,166
No I'm glad you came...

186
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,500
I could really use
a handy person like you.

187
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,458
You mean it...?

188
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,583
That's sweet of you.

189
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, of course I mean it...

190
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,125
You're doing me a
humongous favor right now...

191
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,916
So let's knock this sucker out.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,333
Sure!

193
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,416
Do you think we should
slide this guy in right here?

194
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,458
It's like he was
made for that spot!

195
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,333
What if I put
my thing in like this?

196
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,291
Oh yeah!

197
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,916
Well I'm satisfied.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,125
Me too.

199
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,666
I think it looks pretty
pro-fesh, don't you?

200
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,958
Yeah, Definitely...

201
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,166
except for that part.

202
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,666
Uh...

203
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,833
what is it?

204
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,125
Hey, what are you two
still doing here?

205
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,333
Didn't know you were
still here, Mr. Kurisu.

206
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,666
Time to wrap it up
and head home, kids.

207
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,791
Right.

208
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,833
Shall we go?

209
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,916
Mm-hmm...

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,250
Ya know...

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,625
There's something
different about you lately...

212
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:30,333
I can't quite put my finger
on what it is exactly...

213
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,625
But people seem
to wanna follow you.

214
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,333
Ah, you're just sayin' that...

215
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,708
But I appreciate it.

216
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,541
No I mean every word of it...

217
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,583
And...

218
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,041
I think tomorrow
is gonna be awesome.

219
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,958
Yeah...

220
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,875
me too...

221
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,166
It'll be fun.

222
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,916
This is what
I've wanted all along...

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,666
To be young, full of "life" and
looking forward to another day

224
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Oh my, kids these days
sure are bold.

225
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,541
Especially that one,
he's that transvestite, ya know?

226
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,583
He is?

227
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,958
Is that a boy
he's with or a girl?

228
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,416
They're so wild and freaky.

229
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,416
I'm home.

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,625
Wipe that stupid frown
off your face!

231
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,875
We got our friend
Mystletain back!

232
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,291
I said hasta la vista baby...!

233
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,291
But I also said...

234
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,916
I'll be back...!

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,875
I'll be back!

236
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,916
Yippee ki yay !!!

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,166
Do ya feel lucky, punk?!

238
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,541
Well do ya?

239
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,083
I don't believe it...!

240
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,500
You finally came back!

241
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,083
That's right baby.

242
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,666
I'm back!

243
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm so unbelieveably happy
to see you right now!

244
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,333
Good for him ...

245
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,166
he'll be stepping up from
a rotten piece of feces

246
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,208
to one of the flies
that buzzes around it.

247
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,583
Mmmm-hmmmm.

248
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,583
It's time for me to put
on my big girl panties,

249
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,666
rise up and be the man
who can live without shame...!

250
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,916
Gaia has forgiven me!

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,875
I can go to that stupid
cultural festival

252
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,375
with my head held high...!

253
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,083
As a brand new man!

254
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:23,875
Nomobuyo, oshi, hashitawa,
dokeda, gunmiicha, deh ribura!

255
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,416
Behold Gaia...!

256
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,708
Feast your eyes
upon me, world...!

257
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,750
This is who I am!

258
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,291
My name is...

259
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
Ayumu Aikawa!

260
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,333
Congratulations
on your restoration!

261
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,208
Thank you very much!

262
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,791
Hey...!

263
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,500
Good morning!

264
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,166
All-right ladies, there are
gona be a lot of people

265
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,666
looking at us today,
so remember to smile

266
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,000
with your mouths and your eyes!

267
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,083
Big smizes all around!

268
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,333
Let's knock 'em dead!

269
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,041
Once again I'm able
to get a fresh start,

270
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,833
shed the skin
of the boy I used to be...

271
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,041
And become
the man I really am.

272
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,875
That is gonna rule, dude!

273
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,083
Once again I spoke too soon...

274
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,458
 This is so not me.

275
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,000
I hope you're ready for
the wedding night, sweetie...

276
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,708
I hear the groom's
a real monster!

277
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,875
I never pegged you
as anybody's bride before,

278
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,250
but that Dracula
sure is a lucky guy.

279
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:42,875
Thanks.

280
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,916
I'm honored.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,208
Though now that I'm seeing it,

282
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,958
but I'm getting a weird
Déjà vu thing going on.

283
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,000
You are such an amazing
cross-dresser I can hardly

284
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,375
believe it's your first time
to put on a dress!

285
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,791
She's right...

286
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,583
And it really brings out
some of your natural beauty...

287
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,041
I'm so jealous...

288
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,750
I would kill to
have legs like those.

289
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,291
You got a tight
little body, sir.

290
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,125
You know I can't
un-hear this stuff.

291
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,958
This is the best
you have ever looked.

292
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,041
You're not even looking at me.

293
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,666
Alright, princess, let's roll.

294
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,708
Where are you taking me?

295
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,958
To my booth, moron!

296
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,083
Huh?

297
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,541
Hold it, ladies!

298
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,458
You can only leave if you're
gonna advertise the goods.

299
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,041
If I really got to choose what
my life would revolve around,

300
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,291
"shame and ridicule" would
not be a recurring theme.

301
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,125
Hey Yucky!

302
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,375
Oh it's you...

303
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,583
We blowin' up or what?

304
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,875
We haven't sold
a single copy yet.

305
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,708
Damn illegal
downloaders, I bet.

306
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,291
Ayumu...

307
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,958
What's going on here?

308
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,333
And why are you
dressed like that?

309
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,833
You guys have a CD?!

310
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,458
These should be
selling like omeletes!

311
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,125

312

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,041

Time to unleash my
amazing marketing skills

325
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,916
on this crowd...

326
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,875
But I'm gonna need some
assistance from you, leaf lady.

327
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,875
Okay.

328
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,541
And from you too,
neckwear-mancer.

329
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,208
Should I be getting scared?

330
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,041
No, but you're bad
for our image, so disappear.

331
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,458
With pleasure.

332
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,666
Now let's sell
this pile of crap!

333
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,125
And how will we do that?

334
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,666
Hey, hold on a second...

335
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,875
I uh...

336
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,500
 I kinda need to talk to you.

337
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,791
"I'll be waiting under the tree
behind the school building."

338
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,708
Hmmm...

339
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,375
 But no one's here.

340
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,416
And there's no name on it.

341
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,333
So you don't know
who it might be?

342
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,458
No clue...

343
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,791
Thanks a lot for taking
the time to walk with me

344
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,083
and wait for whoever
sent this to show up...

345
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,416
I'd be a nervous
wreck by myself...

346
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,041
That's like practically
the whole reason

347
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
I asked you come with me.

348
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,041
Whadda ya mean practically?

349
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,583
Well I mean...

350
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,583
There's another thing that I
wanted to talk to ya about...

351
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,333
If there was some other guy
who had feelings for me...

352
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,916
it wouldn't change the way
I feel about you...

353
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,916
For real...

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
Listen...

355
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,666
I'm still your wife, and
there ain't no man on earth

356
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,375
that's gonna come
between us, okay?

357
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,583
What the...

358
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,333
Where's this coming
from all of a sudden...?

359
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,916
Wait a second...

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,750
this is the spot on campus where
people are supposed to reveal

361
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,541
their romantic
feelings for someone.

362
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,208
Right where we're standing?

363
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,458
That's right...

364
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,375
It's one of those stupid
things that girls say...

365
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,791
If you declare your love
for someone here,

366
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,458
you prob'ly
won't get shot down.

367
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,958
Oh...?

368
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,000
Well then doncha think it's
kind of a weird coincidence

369
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,250
that it's the two of us standing
smack dab in the middle

370
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
of the place where people
are supposed to get all mushy

371
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,416
and romantic
and stuff like that?

372
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,333
Oh my gosh is that
what this is about?

373
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,333
I can't believe you really
thought you had to bring me here

374
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,000
just to tell me what your
true feelings are again

375
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,666
when I already know
how you feel about me!

376
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,166
I--!

377
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,708
I didn't--!

378
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,416
I don't--!

379
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,375
I don't understand--!

380
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:04,791
Gah!

381
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,375
I--!

382
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,250
I didn't--!

383
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,208
Tomonori...?

384
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,625
Hey, are you alright?

385
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:12,875
Fine okay!

386
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,000
Whatever , I get it...!

387
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,250
You don't have to...

388
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,083
Holy crap!

389
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,333
And that about does it!

390
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,458
I got a surprise for ya'.

391
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,833
Irregularity
detected in matrix.

392
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,500
Self-destruction will
commence in thirty seconds.

393
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,041
I wouldn't not tell you
how to stop that!

394
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,958
Who the hell is this?
Show yourselves!

395
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,458
Oh man, you again?

396
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,125
Eww...

397
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,583
So gross!

398
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,750
My doctor says that I need

399
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,666
to stop trying
to phrase things ironically.

400
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,833
Look...

401
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,416
don't blame yourself
over this kid ...

402
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,916
It's just the
rotten hand I was dealt.

403
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,875
Goddamnit...

404
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,416
My doctor says I should stop
using cliched hero lines, too.

405
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,583
Final countdown commencing...

406
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,250
No...!

407
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,666
Please don't do it!

408
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
Use the damn ring!

409
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,208
The ring?

410
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,208
Okay, it's on!

411
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:32,833
Not on you!

412
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,541
On her!

413
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,750
Geez, you should've
told me that before!

414
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,666
You just got rung!

415
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,083
Hey Tomonori...!
C'mon talk to me.

416
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,333
That ring holds
a great magic...

417
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,250
It's the only item that can
suppress the awesome power

418
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,333
hidden deep inside her...

419
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,750
With this ring,
she will be controlled.

420
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,041
Everything's okay,
I'm right here.

421
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,000
Hey...

422
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,416
Ayumu...

423
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,416
What happened?

424
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,458
Where did this
ring come from...?

425
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,916
I've never seen it before.

426
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,125
Just don't ever
take it off, okay...?

427
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,583
I have no idea why...

428
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,458
But for some reason if you
keep wearing that ring, you-

429
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:26,125
Oh my freaking god, you actually
got me a real wedding ring!

430
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,375
So this was some
elaborate setup, huh...?

431
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,833
You were the one who sent me
that letter, weren't ya...?

432
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,583
It explains why
we're here at this spot,

433
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,583
but not quite why
you're wearing the dress.

434
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,625
About that...

435
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,500
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

436
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,041
Oh wow...

437
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,333
To think, even though I was
already technically your wife...

438
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,125
You went the extra step
to give me this

439
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,708
to make it more official?

440
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,958
I just don't know what to say,
I'm so overwhelmed right now.

441
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,625
Take it outta gear
for a sec, I...

442
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,833
Don't say another word

443
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,625
I swear I'm about to die
from embarrassment!

444
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,166
Wait...

445
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,916
Slow down...

446
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,791
Look...

447
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,458
Get a hold of yourself, please!

448
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,875
It's happening too fast!...!

449
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,125
If you're wanting
to seal our wedding vows,

450
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,458
I'm just not ready...!

451
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
It needs to be special!

452
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,083
You got it all wrong,
ya dingbat!

453
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,250
Hey dumbass!

454
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,333
Now what??!

455
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,875
We got a Megalo on our hands!

456
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,875
Damn girl,
what you workin' with?

457
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,291
Come on baby doll,

458
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,291
I just wanna know how big
them sweater kittens are.

459
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,250
Oh, monkey likey.

460
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,625
Let's rock a double stuff!

461
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,083
Are you sure you're up for it?

462
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,833
I made this magic siphoner
thingy to refill my power

463
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,416
from the neckwear-mancer.

464
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,666
Whoa, where did you learn
how to make that thing?

465
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,083
I got mad skills
and a magic pink chainsaw...

466
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,875
Get with the program!

467
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,250
Okay, let's roll!

468
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:54,500
Nomobuyo, oshi, hashitawa,
dokeda, gunmiicha, deh ribura!

469
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,750
You ain't gotta be embarrassed.

470
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,583
They're huge...

471
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,833
That's no secret!

472
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,625
Yeah smush 'em together.

473
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,541
Hey!

474
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,625
Let me feel
them coconuts, momma.

475
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,708
Over here creep...!

476
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,458
Yeah, I'm talkin to you...!

477
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,375
Watch out!

478
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,708
No boobies mean no mercy.

479
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,625
Stupid stumpy baby fingers.

480
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,250
You gotta be kidding me.

481
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,000
It's time to make
a coonskin cap!

482
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,250
You with me, Ayumu?!

483
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,166
It's on!

484
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,750
Double Mystletainn Kick!!

485
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,291
What a killer panty shot!

486
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,166
That's not a kick!

487
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:17,250
Oohh Monkey likey!

488
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,250
We got 'em...!

489
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,208
Yeah we did!

490
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,541
That's the genius

491
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,291
Magical Demon Baron
Garment Girl Haruna for ya!

492
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,125
And what the hell
is a Demon Baron again?

493
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,333
This is not good...

494
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,416
Seems the Megalos
are making a comeback.

495
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,833
Wonder why...

496
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,208
Perhaps it was Ayumu and
Haruna's combined magical power

497
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,416
that drew them out
of hiding to come here.

498
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,291
Perhaps...

499
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,291
But I'll bet it's someone else.

500
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,125
Try not to lose focus.

501
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:46,916
Oh...

502
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,625
I didn't!

503
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,166
I'm payin' attention.

504
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,041
Holy crap that really hurts!

505
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,750
It feels like a damn jackhammer
busting through my skull!

506
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,416
What's happening!

507
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:55,916
Hey!

508
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,791
Haruna!

509
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,375
"Roo-roo-roo-roo-ree-roo-
ree-roo-roo-roo-roon-roon!"

510
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,083
I don't think that
will be long enough.

511
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,541
Let's add "poon-poon-pooi-pooi-
poo-roo-roon skin" to the end!

512
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,875
Ready...

513
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,041
"Roo-roo-roo-roo-ree-roo-
ree-roo-roo-roon-roon!

514
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,291
Poon-poon-pooi-pooi-poo-
roo-roon skin!" 

515
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,500
That's so much better.

516
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,458
I think it could use
more "poon" though.

517
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,333
Hey, real Eu!

518
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,791
What do you think?

519
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,541
You should transform...

520
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,041
But we're too sickeningly cute!
