1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,958
Some of the best I've ever had.

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:26,041
Brains. Brains.
What wrong with my brains?

3
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,875
If I don't pass
this test, I'm screwed.

4
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,208
If you don't watch your
grades, you're gonna end up

5
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,333
in summer school with
the rest of the dummies.

6
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,708
I may not be the smartest
zombie, but I know that

7
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,208
the only thing
worse than having to

8
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,416
drag my ass to school everyday
in the heat of the summer

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,791
is frying up like a piece
of bacon on the way there.

10
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,750
Quit daydreaming! Now a
spiral galaxy spins around

11
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,583
and around, exactly
like a top. Picture it.

12
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,916
That top spinning around
just like this, but to get

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,208
this thing going you're
gonna need a humongous string!

14
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,125
That's the whole idea
behind "string theory".

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,625
Wait. Oh yeah.
Since we're on the subject,

16
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,000
lemme tell you some more
about universal string theory.

17
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,708
A long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away

18
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,791
this lesson
stopped being useful.

19
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,416
I just asked for
some help on a math problem.

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,458
Haruna, you know
what this one is?

21
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,208
Root of three minus root of two.

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,625
So genius. How'd you find that?

23
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,041
What?

24
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,875
The answer. Why does this
equal what you just said?

25
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,416
What's one plus one?

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,333
It's two.

27
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,833
And why is that?

28
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,750
Because it just is. That's why.

29
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,166
That's right!

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,458
Okay. But I have
to show all the steps

31
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,750
I take to get
there on this test.

32
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't just say
"it is because it is."

33
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,250
It won't be easy,
but get ready to learn!

34
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,708
And for some reason

35
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,791
to get to the solution
of this math problem,

36
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,458
we have to start back at
the beginning of the universe.

37
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,041
It's a long journey
and way more boring

38
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,333
than I could
have ever dreamed.

39
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,208
Hey! Don't fall asleep on me!

40
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,958
See these. Besides just
being cute, I put these animals

41
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,791
on the board for a reason.
Although it's very complicated

42
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,583
and will probably take the
rest of the night to explain,

43
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
so I hope you're ready.

44
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,750
You look like you could use a
hand, if you know what I mean!

45
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,208
Oh, you have absolutely no idea
how happy that would make me.

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:20,708
Whoa! Awesome! The whole
thing's completely done already!

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,916
Let me do it, so you'll
be able to understand.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Eu already wrote
everything down for me, so...

49
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Yeah, but this is gonna
make a whole lot more sense.

50
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,791
So, you get it now, or what?

51
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,541
Oh yeah. Clear as gravy.

52
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,375
Geez. You're so stupid.
Take a look at this one here.

53
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,458
It moves like a snake
and chases the bunny rabbit

54
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,250
in the rocket...

55
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,750
Yep, I am totally screwed.

56
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,250
I don't know how it happened,
but I think Haruna somehow

57
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,583
taught me something about math.

58
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,625
Maybe there's a reason
she calls herself a genius.

59
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,333
She's actually pretty
talented in a lot of ways.

60
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,125
I mean, she can cook up
a mean rolled omelette

61
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,458
and it looks
like she can cling

62
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,500
to the window
without too much trouble.

63
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,541
Ayumu! We got a Megalo
sighting, so let's go!

64
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,291
Okay! You don't have to yell!

65
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,416
Whoops. Just got a
little too into it I guess.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,500
That's great so how am I
supposed to find this thing?

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,166
I feel your pain.

68
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,666
Yes, what is it?

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,583
Sera? Are you able to
sense Megalos, like Haruna?

70
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,958
I don't have that ability.
But hold on just a moment.

71
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,500
Perhaps Lady Hellscythe
can help you.

72
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,875
Cool, I'm sure she can.

73
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,000
There's a block of
condos on 3rd street.

74
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,375
Haruna and the megalo are
in the alley behind them.

75
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,666
Great, thanks.

76
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,541
Wait. I have a message
from Lady Hellscythe.

77
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,166
She says "hurry".

78
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,500
Got it.

79
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,166
Hey, this is Ayumu?

80
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,625
I know, ma'am, you called me.

81
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,250
That's right!
I'm calling because

82
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,541
I need you to do
me a wittle bitty favor.

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,041
Tell me what you
need and I am on it!

84
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,708
Aw, you're just
like a little puppy,

85
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,416
always just so eager to please.

86
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,958
Anyway I hate to bother you,
but there's something

87
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,250
that I'd really love
for you to hold for me.

88
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,791
It won't be long,
I just need for you

89
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,583
to keep a finger on
it until I come, okay?

90
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,125
What exactly are
we talking about here?

91
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,250
I could try and explain it,
but I think that would be

92
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,708
a waste of time.
It's very sensitive,

93
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,125
so promise me you'll handle
it as delicately as possible.

94
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,375
Oh-kay.

95
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,125
Thank you so much!
It'll be coming

96
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,375
in two shakes of a lamb's tail!

97
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,375
And it's our little secret,
so don't tell Haruna! Bye bye!

98
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,500
About one hundred
meters in direct sunlight.

99
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,666
It's fly or fry time.

100
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,375
Oh crap that's hot!
Hot hot hot!

101
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,750
Come on, just a
little bit farther!

102
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,041
Shade! Shade!

103
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,083
I can't do it!

104
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:30,750
It's killing me
for good! Bansai!

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,625
Man, that hurts!

106
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,375
Aw, come on, don't be mad.

107
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,291
Whoops! Nuh-uh! Missed me!

108
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,125
Choke on it!

109
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,250
So rank.

110
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,333
I love it when they go down!

111
00:07:56,416 --> 00:08:00,083
Ohhhhh yeah! That's it!

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,041
There they are!

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,750
Ayumu!

114
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,166
What the hell! Let go a me!

115
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,291
What do you think you're
doing out here all by yourself?

116
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,708
Well I was just... You
shoulda been here way sooner!

117
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,625
It's okay, I got
here just in time!

118
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,708
Take this, you
damn fly! Now buzz off!

119
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,333
That did the trick!

120
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,166
Hurry up and transform
for cryin' out loud!

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,875
That thing is a
class double-A megalo!

122
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,166
He's the super scary
horse beast, Wanderlei Siuma!

123
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,791
No more horsin' around!

124
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,708
So, I guess I gotta do this.

125
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,958
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

126
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:06,791
Dokeda. Gunmiicha. Deh Ribura.

127
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:12,458
Oh yeah. That's it! Oh my God!

128
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,291
Alright! Now I feel
like a man again!

129
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,333
You want some?

130
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,833
Yes! Yes! I'm gonna
make you squeal!

131
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,458
Look out! Behind you!

132
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,750
Yeah! More, baby! More!

133
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:30,125
Hey listen! I'm really not
kidding here! Look out!

134
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,125
I told you!

135
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,500
I like to call
this move "the shocker".

136
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,750
Calm down.
Let me see. Where is it?

137
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,250
Ooh, just a little tickle.

138
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,583
Oohh yuck yuck!
Not what I wanted.

139
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
Bad touch! Bad touch!

140
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,458
Now that's more like it!
Give me some sugar!

141
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Hey! Get your
slimy paws offa me!

142
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,333
Let go of her!

143
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,958
Yeah. That's it.
Don't be stingy!

144
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,833
Please! Somebody!

145
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,250
I don't care who! Help!

146
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,500
What the? Who are you?

148
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,791
Here ya go.

149
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,583
Did that? No way?

150
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,083
OWEE! Noooo!

151
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,791
I don't believe it.
He's killing those megalos.

152
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,000
With bowls of ramen?!

153
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,833
Oh! What a world!
What a world!

154
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,375
No! Please don't!

155
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,875
Holy crap, that must
be some really bad ramen.

156
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,916
They can't take it at all.

157
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,541
You forgot about me!

158
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,458
Seraphim! It's great
to see you again!

159
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,583
It's been so lo--

160
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,583
Do not approach me
as if we are friends.

161
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,958
Ow. Seraphim,
that hurts! Let go!

162
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,125
Please! You're gonna
break my arm!

163
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,833
Sera. You know this dude?

164
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,916
This is an
acquaintance of mine, yes.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,041
Well, he saved our asses,

166
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,500
so the least you
could do is let him go.

167
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,750
Who is it, by the way?

168
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,625
They go by the name, Mael Strom.

169
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,125
A Vampire Ninja,
aligned with a reformist faction

170
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,541
I do not care for one iota.

171
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,250
Geez, Seraphim.
What in the hell?

172
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,791
Were you tryin' ta
break my arm for real?

173
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,166
He's right. You went kinda nuts.

174
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,208
Hey, are you alright?

175
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,041
Don't touch me!

176
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,458
Leave 'em alone.

177
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,041
The megalos are gone,
so we should just go back home.

178
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:37,875
Let me take a look at your arm.

179
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,000
Is it really broken?

180
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,875
I said don't touch me!

181
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,166
I'd kick your ass if
you weren't a middle schooler!

182
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,625
What the hell
are you talking about?!

183
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
I'm a high schooler,
ya little brat!

184
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,083
No way! I'm a high schooler!

185
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,666
You're way too
little to be in my class!

186
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,958
Hey! Listen to me!

187
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm talkin'
over here, you dumbass!

188
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,500
What is this world coming to?

189
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,458
Oh baby,
I think I'm coming, too!

190
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:25,250
My first kiss,
and it's a dude? Uhh.

191
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,291
You're a cross-dressing
rapist pervert!

192
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,583
You little maggot!

193
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,041
How dare you make me
witness something so foul!

194
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,750
If you're gonna go
around tongue-raping people

195
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,958
out of the blue like that,

196
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,125
have the decency to
brush your teeth first!

197
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,958
Right. Please
forgive me, ma'am.

198
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,041
Our secret base
is behind these doors.

199
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,666
Inside this factory?

200
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
Well, yeah.
You said you wanted to see

201
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,375
where we make our soup,
so I brought you here.

202
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,958
You got some
kinda problem with that?

203
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,583
Uh. No, 'course not.

204
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,833
So good!

205
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,375
Ain't it, though?

206
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,625
I would've never thought a bowl
of ramen could be this good!

207
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,375
I love your pork!

208
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,708
Take it.

209
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,416
Thanks. Not big on pork?

210
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,125
Pork rules.

211
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,916
So why did you give it to me?

212
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,666
Just shut up and
put it in your mouth, okay?

213
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,416
Okay. But if you
love it so much.

214
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,083
Listen, just eat it, will ya?

215
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:59,833
You bet. But, hey,
it's your loss. Thanks!

216
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,333
Mmm-mmmmm!
This is so freakin' good!

217
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,416
It's like a party in my mouth.

218
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,291
Okay.

219
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,791
There's like, a ton
more if you want it.

220
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
Oh you don't mind? That's cool.

221
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,416
Well in that case.
Go ahead and pork me! Uh...

222
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,083
Isn't the whole reason
we came here so you could

223
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,666
explain how you used this
stuff to beat those megalos?

224
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,208
Yeah, I forgot.
Wanna know? It's so cool.

225
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,916
We tried every single ramen
cart, stand and restaurant

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,708
we could find.
We ate bowl after bowl

227
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,666
and developed a
complex rating system.

228
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,375
We would mark the shops with
stars. Three being the highest.

229
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,541
We then went back to all the
three star places,

230
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,833
stole the recipes, and then
through countless hours

231
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,583
of experimentation came
up with the ultimate recipe!

232
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,000
That doesn't really
explain anything.

233
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,000
What I wanna know is how come
when you threw it on those

234
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,541
megalos, it made them
disappear? Why does that work?

235
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,791
You sure are curious.
It's a long story,

236
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,125
but I'll have to
start at the beginning.

237
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,375
Is it? Great.
Another long story.

238
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:07,166
Ya get it now?
Cause if not. Don't ask me.

239
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,291
I ain't gotta clue about how
any of this stuff really works.

240
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,875
Yeah. That's pretty
obvious to me now.

241
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
I don't know nothin'
about noodle theory

242
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,708
or any of that kinda crap,
either. But if ya want,

243
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,916
I might could find someone
around here that does.

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,291
No, it's cool.

245
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,875
Oh yeah!
Don't worry about a swarm

246
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,500
of megalos invading the town,
'cause we got this bad boy here

247
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,583
to make it rain soup on 'em.

248
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,500
Pretty cool, huh?

249
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,916
Oh man! Really?

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,333
Then we'd all be living in
the capital of yummy land!

251
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,375
That's it! I have to go before
I lose any more brain cells.

252
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,750
Wait. Seraphim.

253
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,833
There's somethin'
I need to ask you first.

254
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,291
Yes. What is it?

255
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,416
I'm not sure it's true but
there's a rumor going around

256
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,875
that somebody wants to destroy
this machine. Know who it is?

257
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,166
No, I don't.

258
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,000
You swear?

259
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,333
I do.

260
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,375
Lemme ask ya something else.

261
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,250
You think you'd ever
wanna join our side?

262
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,083
Definitely not. Excuse me.

263
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,750
Hey, wait up.

264
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,916
Hold on. You're goin' too?

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,291
Yeah. I mean, I guess I am.

266
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,333
Okay. Fine then leave!

267
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,875
That machine was
pretty impressive, I guess.

268
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,750
But I'm not so sure it's
all that great of an idea.

269
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,458
It's not. Its use would surely
cause an environmental disaster.

270
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,083
It would?
Sounds pretty bad to me.

271
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,208
My superiors have been trying
to develop a containment plan.

272
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,625
Oh, yeah?
Guess all's well then.

273
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,125
That's where you're wrong.

274
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,500
What do you mean?

275
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,291
Listen carefully.
You kissed Mael Strom

276
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,625
and for a vampire ninja,
a kiss signifies a sacred bond.

277
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,291
It does not matter
when or how it happens.

278
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,833
Therefore as a result of
your foolish mistake earlier,

279
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,125
the two of you are married now.

280
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:49,208
Huh? But that was an
accident! We didn't mean to.

281
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,208
You're just
screwing with me, right?

282
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,291
No, I'm not. You should
be careful around those

283
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,041
you know nothing about.

284
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,833
Ah! So that's why you never
wanted to suck my blood?

285
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,791
That's part of it, yes.
But honestly the mere thought

286
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,958
of you in my mouth
makes me violently ill.

287
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,791
Well, if it was you
instead of her back there,

288
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,083
could you have prevented it?

289
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,500
I'd rather die.

290
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,708
Geez, sorry for asking.

291
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,750
Anyway.

292
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,916
Changing your mind?

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,541
I'm almost certain
Mael doesn't feel

294
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,208
that was a real
wedding ceremony.

295
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,708
Although it doesn't matter.

296
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,166
We vampire ninjas place the
law above our own feelings.

297
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,541
Let me get this straight.
If I just up and kissed you

298
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,583
right now without
you expecting it,

299
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,458
the two of us
would be married?

300
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,916
We would. I would
pledge my love to you alone.

301
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,875
That's assuming you were
able to survive your attempt.

302
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,333
Yeah, I'm dead enough, thanks.

303
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,041
Oh great, now what?

304
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,458
Hey look,
it's Lester the molester.

305
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,125
I'm just gonna
pretend I didn't hear you

306
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,833
and ask, "what is that?"

307
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
Geez, could you
be anymore clueless?

308
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,750
It's from your stupid culture.

309
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,916
Our very own Christmaween tree!

310
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,291
Furiously riding
down the river of stars.

311
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:11,208
A big fat man drives a sleigh
led by two huge creatures.

312
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,666
Covered head to
toe in blood and guts,

313
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,625
he flies like a bat
outta hell through the night

314
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,666
in search of unsuspecting prey.

315
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,416
He carries a bag big enough
for a grown man with him,

316
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,041
and under the cover of darkness.

317
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
He sneaks in through
the windows of houses marked

318
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,250
with fancy-looking bamboo
trees in their front yards.

319
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,375
And even though
he's actually a demon,

320
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,250
Thunder Claws grants wishes.

321
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:35,000
But only to those people who
wear their hair in ponytails.

322
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,375
Ya see? I swear.
You can be so stupid.

323
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,291
I'm not so stupid
that I'd believe a word

324
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,333
of the crap I just heard.

325
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,916
Don't worry, you don't
look any worse with that.

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,458
How would you know?
You're not even lookin' at me.

327
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,166
No reply, of course.

328
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,416
Now let's see
what everybody wrote.

329
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,333
Hey, what the?
Stop peeking at 'em!

330
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,958
It doesn't work if you
read them, you stupid butthole!

331
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,500
That another rule
you just made up?

332
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,250
You shouldn't worry
about mine anyway!

333
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,458
Hurry up and write
your own dumb wish!

334
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,833
We're all sick
of waiting on you!

335
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,166
I told you the ponytail
doesn't change how you look.

336
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,541
Look at me and tell me again!

337
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,708
Come on. I know
what you really want.

338
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,333
And I want it, too,
so let me give it to you.

339
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,250
Oh, you'd like
that wouldn't you?

340
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,458
Okay! Since we're
all done writing,

341
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,208
we should go to Ayumu's
room to get ready for tonight!

342
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,541
We'll come down and grab
you when we're done, okay?

343
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,041
So get crackin!

344
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,625
Are they freakin' serious about
all the bull crap they wrote?

345
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,583
This is so dumb.

346
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,166
Okay, we're ready!

347
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,541
Let's go trick or caroling!

348
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,125
Yeah, I'm definitely
done playing along.

349
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,166
You're Ayumu Aikawa?

350
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,041
Yep, that would be me.

351
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,125
You've been briefed, yes?

352
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,208
Here is the item.
I leave it in your care.

353
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,625
Item? Oh, for the Head Teacher?

354
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,708
Yes, it's me.
I see. And what of it?

355
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,291
Stop asking stupid questions
and think for yourself!

356
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,791
Are we clear?

357
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,125
Hey. Wait a sec, I,,,

358
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,208
Eyeglasses? What's so
special about them?

359
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,125
Uh. Ayumu it's me!

360
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,666
Oh. Hey, uh. What're you
doing here in my class?

361
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,833
I-I just came
to bring you this!

362
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,958
I mean I'm your wife now, so I
should at least make you lunch.

363
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,750
It's the pork you like.

364
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,875
So you believe all that?

365
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,916
What happened between
us... It means that...

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,916
Yeah, yeah, Sera
told me everything.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,125
But I'm not
gonna hold you to--

368
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,666
Stop! We can't get
outta this so easy!

369
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,250
It doesn't matter why it
happened, just that it happened!

370
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,875
There's no going back,
we're in this together,

371
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,708
you and me, understand?

372
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm yours now, okay? There's
nothing that'll change it!

373
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,000
But it's just not right!

374
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,083
It's just how it is.
You're still my husband now,

375
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,000
whether you like it or not!

376
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,500
I can't believe it,

377
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,125
but you're actually serious
about all this, aren't you?

378
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,041
Of course I am!
My people have lived like this

379
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,333
for centuries and
I honor their traditions!

380
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,666
That's why I'll be your wife.

381
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,708
No matter how hard you
wanna pretend that I ain't!

382
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,250
I mean I gotta get
married to someone eventually

383
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,625
or die alone in
a house full of cats.

384
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,166
Well, I appreciate
you really spelling out

385
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,541
the alternatives
to me here like that.

386
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,333
What's up, Tomonori?

387
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,125
That ain't my name, ya creep!

388
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,291
Hey, man. You know this girl?

389
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,083
Oh yeah,
this is Tomonori Yoshida,

390
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,291
from the class next door.

391
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,250
I told ya, Four Eyes,
that ain't my name!

392
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,458
Whaddaya mean, that's always
been your name you crazy freak!

393
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,625
For the last time, stop
calling me that, you hear me?

394
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,916
My name is Yuki! So get
that through your thick skull!

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,625
Say my name! Yuki! Yuki!

396
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,000
Hey, guys? Do either of you
feel like clueing me in here?

397
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,541
You see?
"Tomonori" clear as day.

398
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,041
If you say so.

399
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,208
Are you blind? Put on your
glasses and tell me what ya see!

400
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,416
Watch it!

401
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,250
X-ray specs? Hell, yeah!

402
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,791
You know, I'm not feeling
the love connection here.

403
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,708
Yeah, I think of you as
more of a friend, I guess.

404
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,958
Definitely one without benefits,
though if you know what I mean.

405
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,250
Oh.

406
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,291
Speaking of friends,
that Orito is super slimy.

407
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,750
I think he uses
too much hand lotion.
