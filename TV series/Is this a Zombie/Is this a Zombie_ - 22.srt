1
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,791
Yello?

2
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,625
This is some kind
of joke, right?

3
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,333
What?

4
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,666
Seriously?

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,291
Ticklish under the ribs?

6
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm sorry?

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,625
That's Chris'
Achilles Heel...?

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,875
Please tell me
Kyoko's pulling my leg.

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,833
Oh wow...

10
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,541
That takes me back.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,000
When we were little,

12
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,208
Chris was guaranteed to pee
herself if you kept at it

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,291
long enough.

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,833
Good times.

15
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,625
Okay, explain something: If
she's so easy to incapacitate,

16
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,750
why is this such
a royal pain in the ass?!

17
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:52,833
No idea...

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,000
I mean, she's
unbelievably powerful,

19
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,291
but the gal has had
her share of losses.

20
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,791
Wait, what?

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,083
The Queen of Villiers

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,916
got the best of her
in a little one-on-one...

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,916
The aforementioned King of the
Night took her down a peg not

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
so long ago...

25
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,083
Wow, him too?

26
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,083
Matter of fact, an
Underworlder relatively famous

27
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,666
for giving Chris the biz
just happens to live

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,250
in your neck of the woods.

29
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,458
Believe you me, by the time the
dust settled on that fight it

30
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,500
was the stuff of legend.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,541
To wrestle Haruna's
pilfered magical powers away

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,250
from the clutches
of a pink-haired imp,

33
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,333
our hero must find a way to
defeat an enemy whose reputation

34
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,416
for havoc is as enormous
as her stature is adorable.

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,750
From whom can he enlist aid
in this, Gaia's latest trial?

36
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,041
All right...

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,791
So...

38
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,958
There's yet another powerful
under-worlder that's slumming

39
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,833
it up in our neck
of the woods, huh?

40
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,875
That's right...

41
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,666
What's the story
on this one anyway?

42
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,500
Wait, what...?

43
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,875
You mean they actually exist?!

44
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,500
Is S-class really
that big of deal?

45
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,208
Bigger deal
than your stupid head!

46
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,333
It takes a whole group of
Magical Garment Girls to deal

47
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,291
with Triple A-Class Megalos,
and they're a rung below

48
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,458
the S-Classers: you can
run a whole army of us

49
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,166
at those guys and they
wouldn't even flinch!

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,583
Okay, but if that's the case...

51
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,166
Maybe you should get off
your magic ass and do something?

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,958
Hey.

53
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,541
Stockpiling awesome here.

54
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,333
This was back before Villiers
invaded the Underworld;

55
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,875
when I still had a voice,
and a good deal of magic

56
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,750
at my disposal...

57
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,291
Why tarry you here
so often, milady?

58
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,458
I love the view.

59
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,083
Yea, it is breathtaking

60
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,166
though the highest poetry would
fail to capture its essence.

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,208
'Tis something beyond words.

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,291
This kingdom...

63
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,375
All its vistas...

64
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,375
I gladly lay down
my life to inure.

65
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,833
A brigade of stout-hearted
warriors congregated voluntarily

66
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,666
to defend the Underworld
against Villiers.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,833
They were called
the Seventh Abyss.

68
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,375
Thus it begins...

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,666
The dark.

70
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,625
The poison of war.

71
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,625
I will meet them.

72
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,125
Naegleria, wait...

73
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,583
I pledged to defend this world
even if it means my life,

74
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,791
Your Majesty.

75
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,583
And so the mightiest
Underworlder struck flint

76
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,916
against the mightiest
Garment Girl.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,166
Mind you, this was well
before the Megalos served us;

78
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,291
she fended off Villiers
almost single-handedly.

79
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,958
"Her strength and
bravery endure in legend."

80
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,541
Guess I forget how much
bad blood there is

81
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,250
between the two kingdoms.

82
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
Shocking.

83
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,000
How tragic is it to have the
attention span of a ferret?

84
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,583
How can you stand
to live under the same roof

85
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,500
if your people
are sworn enemies?

86
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,250
Just 'cause the brass
declares war doesn't mean

87
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,708
I make it my beef...

88
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm trying to live
in the moment, you know?

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,375
Can we establish that this
warrior is as trustworthy

90
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,000
as she is strong?

91
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,541
"She personally fashioned
the gauntlets that kept

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,583
my powers from running amok, so
I'd say she's a safe bet." Okay.

93
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,166
Good point.

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,458
So should I just knock on her
door and ask for help or what?

95
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,000
No way...!

96
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,416
Are you out of your mind?!

97
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,750
Huh?

98
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,916
You have no clue what
you're up against, do you?

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,166
Apparently not...

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,541
Ugh...

101
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,791
The cost in lives
could be catastrophic...

102
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,708
Whatever happens,
my friend -don't call me.

103
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,125
What the hell, man?!

104
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,750
I'll send you an email.

105
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,291
Best of luck.

106
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,041
Shimomura being scared
gives me the bends.

107
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,250
There you are.
How's that ass?

108
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,291
Knock it off.

109
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,458
Surely you mean
"knock it off, Kirara." ...

110
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,833
Knock it off Lovely Kirara
if this were a concert...

111
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,458
Speaking of which, love...

112
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,458
In two days I'll be giving
the performance of a lifetime.

113
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,125
Your attendance is expected.

114
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,375
Ah...

115
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,541
Way to take the guerilla
approach to marketing...

116
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,625
Fine.

117
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,708
These better not
be nosebleeds, though.

118
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,666
What is that?

119
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,458
This?

120
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,125
Milk coffee.

121
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,166
Perfect...

122
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,625
That's legal tender
for the ticket.

123
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,041
Yeah...

124
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,666
It's kinda creepy that
you want to drink after me...

125
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,833
I'm afraid it's the milk coffee
or nothing, my darling...

126
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,750
Give it to momma.

127
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,750
Umm...

128
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,833
Look...

129
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,666
I'll stop by the concert
if there's time.

130
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,708
What does that mean?

131
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,708
Don't get upset!

132
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll come, I promise.

133
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,000
You promise...?

134
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,458
Stand where I can see you...?

135
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,708
Right up front?

136
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,291
Sure...

137
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,291
I can do that...

138
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,750
Just look for me
near the speakers.

139
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,750
I can get to like this whole
"I promise" thing from you.

140
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,291
And not just because of...

141
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,250
 that sweet ass!

142
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,125
So she can act like
a normal girl.

143
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,166
... that sweet ass!

144
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,916
Aw, seriously?!

145
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,541
Not home, maybe...?

146
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,166
Excuse me?

147
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,791
Hello?

148
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,958
My name's Ayumu...

149
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,375
Um, hello...?

150
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,791
Oh my god oh my god
oh my god oh my god

151
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm chin deep
in milk bladders!

152
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,916
Don't get a boner,
don't get a boner...!

153
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,791
Uh, please don't
be dead or anything...

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,416
Yes...

155
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you.

156
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,708
I was wondering if there's any
chance I can get another day?

157
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,500
Oh.

158
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,708
There's an overage fee...

159
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,625
Ah.

160
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,250
Well I guess if
that's your policy...

161
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,666
Insanely spank-worthy bod...

162
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,291
No, no -I'll have it by tonight.

163
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,583
Sorry about that...

164
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,208
I have quite a bit on my plate.

165
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,208
So...

166
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,833
You draw stuff
like this, huh...?

167
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,750
Nice work, Miss Naegleria.

168
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,916
Don't say "Miss"
it makes me feel old...

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,666
Matter of fact call me Nene...

170
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,791
No point standing on ceremony.

171
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,125
Sure thing, Nene...

172
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,666
And if I may get
right to the point...

173
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh come on...!

174
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,958
I'm not a fanboy!

175
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,458
Damn it, I'm here on
very important business!

176
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,333
Can you please
try to stay awake?!

177
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,875
Hey, hey...

178
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,916
I was just resting my...

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,791
Hope has left us!

180
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,166
Okay, I'm awake...

181
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,958
Look, your Eucliwood's
friend, right...?

182
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,625
So, yeah...

183
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,166
You've changed your hair.

184
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,000
No offense, but how
would you know...?

185
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,208
Anyway, about this Magical
Garment Girl Chris debacle...

186
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,041
Ah...

187
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,416
Oh, yeah...

188
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,875
I guess it will take someone
of my caliber to take

189
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,500
that little minx down, huh?

190
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,458
Does that mean we can
count on you to help us?

191
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,000
What...?

192
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,083
Oh honey, no...

193
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,666
You don't know
what you're asking...

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,916
If Chris and I scrape shields
there'll be an all out war

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,958
between Villiers and the
Underworld right here

196
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,958
in our own backyard--

197
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,083
But why?

198
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,708
It's simple politics...

199
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,250
She and I are the strongest
of our respective people...

200
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,291
Whatever, look, I'm not
bowing out, per se...

201
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,750
But I am gonna need something
in the way of quid pro quo.

202
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,250
And that would be what...?

203
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,333
Give me a hand with
my manuscript...

204
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,583
Sound good?

205
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,166
How in the world does she think
one person's help is gonna

206
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,375
push her through to
tomorrow's deadline?

207
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,041
Just a gazillion more to go!

208
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,916
I'll totally have to
skip out on the concert now.

209
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,000
Yell-o!

210
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,333
Haruna's Mortuary
-you stab 'em we slab 'em.

211
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,750
How can I help you?

212
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,166
Oh good, it's you.

213
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,583
Listen, I'm up to my eyeballs
in this thing right now

214
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,000
and nothing less than
the help of genius will do.

215
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,500
Ha...!

216
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
Well, go on!

217
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,125
I've got a map up in my room...

218
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:39,958
Yep-yep!

219
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,750
All over it!

220
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,166
They were all out of
the diet kind...

221
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,375
Oh man...

222
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,166
This can't be good for me.

223
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,750
It just can't.

224
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,125
Ah, you're back...!

225
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,375
Thanks for the grub run.

226
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,583
You're a doll.

227
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,333
Dear god, I can totally
feel them touching my back!

228
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,916
Ugh...!

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,458
Wake up!

230
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,125
If someone saw us like this
I'd never hear the end of it!

231
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,250
Aaaand...

232
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,666
I just jinxed myself...

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,166
Come on!

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,541
Please...?

235
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,375
There's already enough crap
about me going around!

236
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh...

237
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,000
sorry.

238
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:19,750
It's okay.

239
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,875
Getting up now.

240
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,500
Yes, I'm coming.

241
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,500
Alrighty...

242
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,958
Must've gone away.

243
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,958
That's a relief...

244
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,041
No harm, no foul -right?

245
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,083
I see nothing...

246
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,666
Absolutely nothing...!

247
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:48,916
Hello--

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,625
Damn it, Haruna!

249
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,583
You're late!

250
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,208
Um.

251
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,750
I beg your pardon?

252
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh, sorry.

253
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,041
I thought -never mind.

254
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,125
What's up?

255
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,791
You're still coming, yes?

256
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,708
Tomorrow night?

257
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,375
You bet.

258
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,750
I haven't forgotten.

259
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,208
As I thought.

260
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,250
I just wanted to make sure
you still have your ticket.

261
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,500
You do, right?

262
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,708
It's on me right now.

263
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,875
No worries.

264
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,666
So you're really gonna
try and make it...

265
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Well, yeah.

266
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,791
I said I would.

267
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,083
Relax.

268
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,416
Very well, then...

269
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
I shall be waiting.

270
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,000
Sure took you long enough...

271
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,083
What the...?

272
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,125
Ugh!

273
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,541
I get so lonely when you're
not around-I couldn't stand

274
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,125
not being near you
for another moment!

275
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,166
Step aside!

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,333
Take a wild guess why
we've come here, maggot farm.

277
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,833
You wanted to help me out of
the goodness of your heart...

278
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm so disgusted with you
right now, I have half a mind

279
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,583
to dispense with
talk altogether!

280
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,833
Don't kill him, Leaf Lady
-it's not worth it!

281
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,208
This paragon of innocence left
the house a little while ago

282
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,250
to lend you a hand...

283
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,000
All I could make out between
her torrential sobs was

284
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,000
"Ayumu has become
a Sexual Harassment Overlord!"

285
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,666
That's an exaggeration...!

286
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,500
I don't sob!

287
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,625
What do you take me for?!

288
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,125
Gah!

289
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:30,916
You can guilt-trip the pervert
without having to make up

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,416
lies about me, damn it!

291
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,791
Look, she just
misunderstood...!

292
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,375
I...

293
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,666
Gaaah!

294
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,333
Wow!

295
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,166
Did this place
become Grand Central

296
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,875
when I was sleeping or what?

297
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,791
Did you cut your hair?

298
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,041
Ah.

299
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,333
Of course...

300
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,041
Who am I talking to
-you're the same as ever.

301
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,125
Hey!

302
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,458
Don't be fraternizing
with the bimbo

303
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,208
who tempted Ayumu with
her giggly-flop bazongas!

304
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,083
Stop!

305
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,083
It wasn't what it looked like!

306
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,541
I'll put it to you politely...

307
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,916
Was there or was there not

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
any untoward behavior
between you and this tramp?

309
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,458
C'mon...

310
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,916
Even if there was,
what are you gonna do?

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,791
Boys have no control
over themselves.

312
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,750
No!

313
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm not ready for puberty!

314
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,500
You shameless maggot!

315
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,250
Well, as long as you're here,
you might as well help us out.

316
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,583
Here Eucliwood, you can
color in all of these bits

317
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,916
that are X-ed out.

318
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,541
And you- Haruna, yeah?

319
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,833
You think you got a couple
of castle scenes in ya?

320
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,208
It's okay.

321
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,375
She's saying she needs

322
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,958
a genius's help on
the background stuff.

323
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,125
Ah, yes of course...!

324
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, if you insist.

325
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm more than happy to be
the gofer, if you would like.

326
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,125
Perfect!

327
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,583
You can start by cleaning up!

328
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,625
You know, I really
don't care for your tone...

329
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,250
But this place is a mess...

330
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,583
What's the matter?

331
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,083
You're darn right it is.

332
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
Heh.

333
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,833
What better medium for
telling Your Majesty's story?

334
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,875
I get it...

335
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,750
These are the soldiers
from the Seventh Abyss.

336
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,000
Sort of.

337
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
It's pure fantasy...

338
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,583
I pretend that the King of the
Night never did what he did...

339
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,083
That Eucliwood never
actually lost her voice...

340
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,791
Basically that we all
lived happily ever after.

341
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,416
Hey, when life hands you lemons

342
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,916
you use what you've got
to work with, right?

343
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:53,875
Yeah...

344
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,333
It'd be nice, huh?

345
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,958
We might get in under
the wire at this rate.

346
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,833
Alpha males...

347
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,875
Kitty cat tails...

348
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,875
Oh no...

349
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,916
Please tell me
she's dying yarn.

350
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,416
I'm frightened, my lover; please
don't let whatever's in the pot

351
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,916
crawl out and eat me
while I'm sleeping...

352
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,583
Creme l'diabolique.

353
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,375
I don't speak French,
but it sounds bad.

354
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
It gets it's name from
being so good as to blow

355
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,583
the lid off of hell.

356
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,375
Yeah, sure...!

357
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,708
Or send us there!

358
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,166
Boo-ya!

359
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,333
What are you doing?

360
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,541
That's a background?!

361
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,541
No.

362
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,125
That's what I call
a castle scene.

363
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,958
It's stealing focus!

364
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,000
Hot hot hot hot
hot hot hot!!!!

365
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,708
Nice going, fire marshal!

366
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,666
You idiot!!!

367
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,500
I'm awake.

368
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,875
Definitely awake...

369
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,208
Bit close for comfort...

370
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,833
Another second and
I'd have been out...

371
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,000
Not good.

372
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,708
Uh...

373
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,750
How goes it, gang?

374
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,416
Um...

375
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,250
Actually...

376
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,041
Not so hot.

377
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,875
Looks like you used it
as a coffee filter!

378
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,166
I, can't tell you
how sorry we all are...

379
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh, it's hardly the end
of the world you guys...

380
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,458
Besides, I can draw
manga whenever I want.

381
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,041
Nene...

382
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,041
 what if...

383
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,875
Uh, I mean
there's still time...

384
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,291
We can fix this!

385
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,000
Please allow us to.

386
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,000
Well...

387
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,625
If you're that broken up,
I guess you should.

388
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,500
Right...

389
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,250
We won't let you down, promise!

390
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,458
You should get some rest...

391
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,625
Here.

392
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,375
So...

393
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,041
If anyone wants to sleep--

394
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,583
♪  Shining just like a ray
of light Can't help but look ♪

396
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,916

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,875
Who's ready to put their
necks on the chopping block?!

398
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,083
♪ Your eyes may
give me what I need ♪

399
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,000

'Cause I live in your fantasy
Time when somebody passes by me

00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,791

402
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,583

404
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,833
You got a hot date
or something, kiddo?

405
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,083
You seem to be
obsessed with my clock...

406
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,875
Either it looks like something
or you need to be somewhere.

407
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,541
Oh, uh...

408
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,958
You can go if you need to...

409
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,291
I think we'll be good
on our own with the rest.

410
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,041
No way...

411
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,791
You and me had a deal.

412
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,250
And you've held up your end.

413
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,125
You all have.

414
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,291
Thanks, hon...

415
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,416
Eucliwood will be very pleased
with the way it turned out.

416
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,291
Now get outta here.

417
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,416
Done.

418
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,375
I'm pathetic.

419
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,708
I can't beat Chris.

420
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,500
I can't help Haruna.

421
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,583
Look at me.

422
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,916
I can't even keep
a simple promise.

423
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,125
The hell I can't!

424
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,625
He actually made it.

425
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,958
Who's ready for
the grand finale?!

426
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,875
If you're feelin' suicidal,
show me your neck!

427
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,958
Sorry I'm late.

428
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,625
Knock it off with
the groveling...

429
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,916
It's silly, you haven't
done anything wrong.

430
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,125
Sure I have.

431
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:16,916
I mean--

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,208
You're a man of your word.

433
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:18,833
Sure...

434
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,833
I can do that...

435
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,458
Just look for me
near the speakers.

436
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,125
Okay, so you weren't
near the speakers,

437
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,625
but that's a small thing...

438
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,291
You said you'd come
to the concert and you did.

439
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,958
Don't think I don't
know how busy you are.

440
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,041
I wish I could've seen more.

441
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,583
Look, that you came at all
is more than adequate, love...

442
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,666
It was childish of me
to force a promise on you

443
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,916
in the first place...

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,041
I'll try not to be so
disproportionately needy

445
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:40,958
in future...

446
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,375
Don't say that.

447
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,375
You're perfect
the way you are...

448
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,125
Seriously.

449
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,041
So I told Saras
what she wanted to hear.

450
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,750
What else was I gonna do?

451
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,333
Thank you, my dirty darling.

452
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,541
I don't suppose we can
find a different nickname?

453
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,875
Well...

454
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,000
We could, but it wouldn't
have the umph of the one

455
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,791
already lodged in my psyche.

456
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,541
That's a lame excuse.

457
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,541
I'm not one-hundred
percent about this...

458
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,125
Feels like we have an
obligation to be fighty.

459
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,625
Lighten up, huh...?

460
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,708
No reason we can't enjoy a
little girl time off the clock.

461
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,708
Aw, that's the stuff!

462
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,291
That Ayumu kid came over
to my place today.

463
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:40,958
Oh yeah?

464
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:41,958
What'd you think?

465
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,625
I think he's...

466
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,791
unique.

467
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,875
I gotta tell ya,
I'm tempted to adopt him

468
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,791
as my special little helper.

469
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,750
Kid must've really brought his
A-game to make you say that...

470
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,791
Guess the Underworld's
primo badass has a soft side.

471
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,125
Yeah, well...

472
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,125
My soft side
can still roll you.

473
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,708
Oh, I'm sure it could...

474
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,541
Heh.

475
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,583
Alright, Mister...

476
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,791
Bring on the fried tofu!

477
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,208
Coming right up, ladies.

478
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,583
Careful now, it's hot.

479
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:48,583
Crap...

480
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:48,958
Crap...

481
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:49,541
Crap...

482
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,666
Crap.

483
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,833
Why you gotta be so harsh?!

484
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:52,750
Manga's hard!

485
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's see you do it!

486
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,500
Yeah!

487
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,416
Fine then.

488
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,583
Look, Actual Eu wrote a Yaoi?!

489
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,708
OMG that's hot!

490
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,875
The cover's making me
lightheaded -ah!

491
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,958
So pretty...

492
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,083
What is it about
two cute guys in love?

493
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,083
Show us more, Eu!

494
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,208
Show us more!
