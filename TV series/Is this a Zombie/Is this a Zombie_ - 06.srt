1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,333
This time, you're gonna burn
and there'll be no coming back!

2
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,083
So, you've finally
come, have you?

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,916
I've been expecting you.
Welcome to the party.

4
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,625
Eu!

5
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:53,375
Wow, I can feel your
power from here. What a rush!

6
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,000
You're even stronger
than I thought!

7
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,958
But even the strong
can be brought down.

8
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,541
So let's see how
you fare against this.

9
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,125
No, don't?

10
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,333
Whoa, she's using Mystletainn?

11
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,291
Lady Hellscythe.

12
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,500
It's finally
starting to make sense.

13
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,125
This must be why I was
able to absorb Haruna's powers.

14
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,666
Hey, stop gawking
at me, you pervert,

15
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,375
and give me back
my powers immediately!

16
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,166
This instant!

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,500
And not just that.

18
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,250
I came here
because I was drawn by

19
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
the power of a
Magical Garment Girl.

20
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,875
But also why Megalos
are being drawn to me.

21
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,166
It's because the greatest vortex
of magical power in the world.

22
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,041
The center of everything.

23
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,708
Is her, that's why.
It's all because of her.

24
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,791
So, Eucliwood Hellscythe,
necromancer of Hades,

25
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,791
why does someone of your power
choose to stay in this world

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,875
when you could be reigning
over your own realm instead?

27
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,083
You've grown attached to that
undead pervert, haven't you?

28
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,000
Wasting magic of your
magnitude is a shame.

29
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,666
Very well, since you don't
seem to have any use for it,

30
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,125
then I think it's only fitting
that I take it all from you!

31
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh yeah. I'm gonna love having
that kind of magic inside me!

32
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,958
No!

33
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,750
Neckwear-mancer!

34
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,083
Eu.

35
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,666
How touching.

36
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,541
You're trying to protect
your pitiful little friends.

37
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,958
How human! Oh, and
speaking of which.

38
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,166
Did you know that human beings
have a limit on the percent

39
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,333
of strength their
bodies can use?

40
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,666
But for someone like me,
who has a stock of lives,

41
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,166
I can use all I want!
One hundred percent!

42
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,291
One hundred and fifty percent!
Two hundred percent!

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,125
Three hundred percent!

44
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,208
Four hundred! Five hundred!

45
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,666
She's strong.

46
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes. But what makes Lady
Hellscythe truly powerful?

47
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,916
Would you please
just fall over already?

48
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,625
No! Not yet!

49
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,625
It's neither her
armor, nor her magic...

50
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,708
but the power of
her words instead.

51
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,833
To fell an opponent,
Lady Hellscythe has only to

52
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,625
utter a single word.

53
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,000
Just one word from her,
and someone'll die?

54
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,583
Then drop dead!

55
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,583
Yeah, of course.

56
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,625
That why she's
sealed away her powers.

57
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,916
If she didn't restrain herself,
she could kill someone.

58
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,125
Based on what she
told me, she feels pain

59
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:52,500
when she uses her powers,
so she must be in agony.

60
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,583
This is horrible.

61
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,666
She feels the pain of
others when they die,

62
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,416
and she's feeling it
with Kyoko right now.

63
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,541
To protect us.

64
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,166
Your words can't affect me
if I can't hear any of them.

65
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,583
Just as I expected,
you're incredibly powerful.

66
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,291
But not nearly
enough to stop me.

67
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,333
Get out of there!

68
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,083
Total magic power, release!

69
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,958
Eu!

70
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,625
How ironic. Over and over
she kept saying "die"

71
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,750
but it looks like she's
the one who's life has ended.

72
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:36,083
No coming back now or ever.

73
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,041
Ya know, usually
when I see someone

74
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,541
getting beat up like this,

75
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,833
I think it's kinda funny.
But something's weird this time.

76
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,791
Seeing what that girl is
doing to the neckwear-mancer.

77
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,708
It's making me get
really freakin' angry.

78
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,916
And the only thing I wanna do
is kick that blonde chick's ass!

79
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,083
Good, because I think that's
exactly what we're gonna have

80
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,125
to do if we want Eu to
make it outta this in one piece.

81
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,166
You're right.
So let's do it then.

82
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,416
Ayumu. I just thought
up a new technique

83
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,833
that may prove to
be our finishing blow.

84
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,416
When we get back
to the house later,

85
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,375
perhaps you can help
me think up a name for it.

86
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,291
Eu put her life
on the line for us,

87
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,500
so we've gotta
do the same for her.

88
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,208
Let's go.

89
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,083
New strike.

90
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,250
Name to be decided!

91
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,166
Eat this, blondie!

92
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,250
Haruna!

93
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,291
You have to get back up
before she can strike again!

94
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,458
What the? Is she nuts?

95
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,083
Ah! That feels better.

96
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,750
Those ruptured eardrums were
screwing up my equilibrium,

97
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,500
but to regenerate them,
all I had to do was kill myself.

98
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,750
Eww yuck!

99
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,125
Geez, you're even
more zombie-like than me.

100
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,125
I don't stay dead, do I?

101
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,125
But I've lost many
of the lives today

102
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,458
that I've worked
so hard to collect.

103
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
So I'm going to
have to replace them,

104
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,500
and I'll do that by
taking all of yours.

105
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,458
Alright.
Even though the sight of you

106
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,458
in that outfit disgusts me.

107
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,791
Yeah.

108
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,000
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

109
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,250
Dokeda. Gunmiicha! Deh Ribura!

110
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,958
Your killing. It ends tonight.

111
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,958
You look adorable in that!

112
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,458
Well, since you're the
first person to step up,

113
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,083
and because I've always
liked you, I'll kill you first!

114
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,416
Don't just stand there!

115
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,458
Yeah, at least try to dodge her!

116
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,916
No. I won't fall
like all the others.

117
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I refuse to give this
psychopath the pleasure.

118
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:12,583
After all the pain she's
caused, it's payback time.

119
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,416
I'll make sure that
she won't ever kill again.

120
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,291
Oh, well, in that case,
it'll be your funeral, Tranny.

121
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,708
Die! Die! Die!

122
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,875
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but I can't.

123
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,750
Eu. When we get home,
let's have dinner.

124
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:41,000
So! You want dinner,
huh? Then feast on this!

125
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,875
I can't die.

126
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:56,166
You see. I'm a zombie.
And a Magical Garment Girl.

127
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,541
And a moron!

128
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,250
I was. But death cured
me of that. I was so stupid.

129
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,500
Stay back!

130
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,000
I used to take life for granted.

131
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,125
But ironically, once I died,

132
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,708
I could finally appreciate
what it means to live.

133
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,083
Thank you. You see,
you actually changed my life

134
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,666
for the better by taking it.

135
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,708
And now.

136
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,708
I'm gonna do the same for you.

137
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,791
Like hell you are,
you cross-dressing creep,

138
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,541
I've got multiple lives!

139
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, well that may be so,
but that just means

140
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,250
I gotta kill you
over and over again.

141
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,041
Until all your
stolen lives are used up!

142
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,625
No, you let go
of me right now! Die!

143
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,750
No. This isn't happening!

144
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,291
How dare you!

145
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,625
From the way you're acting,
that must have been

146
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,666
your last stolen life.

147
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
Please! Stay back!

148
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,291
No. You've taken the lives

149
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,000
of too many
innocent people for that.

150
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,041
It's time to pay up.

151
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,666
But, I don't wanna die.

152
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,708
Neither did any of
your victims. Including me.

153
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,458
No!

154
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,833
This ends here and now!

155
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,625
You're okay.

156
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,291
For now at least.

157
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,250
Not what I was expecting,
but I'll take it.

158
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,333
You're right, I did.

159
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,166
I'll start dinner as
soon as we get home, okay?

160
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,291
You're hungry!

161
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,625
Impressive work.

162
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,625
But to be honest,
I was worried that you might

163
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,333
have killed my student.

164
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,250
Who are you?

165
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,125
Good thing you didn't,
because I would've killed you.

166
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,250
I won't let anyone
lay a finger on my students.

167
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,458
Hold on a minute.
"Your students?"

168
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,625
Uh? Head Teacher?

169
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,333
Wait! You mean that's her?

170
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,750
Poor dear. I wonder how
a Magical Garment Girl

171
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,541
could have strayed so
far from our school's path.

172
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,250
Since you're her teacher,
maybe you should've

173
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,791
given her some better direction!

174
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,416
I have hundreds of millions of
students back home in Villiers,

175
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,333
so it's hard to keep up with
them all, but I do try my best.

176
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,958
You should try harder then!

177
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you need to learn
what can happen when you say

178
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,458
such things in the
heat of the moment.

179
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,208
Yowch! That burns!

180
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,250
Head Teacher, please. Stop it.

181
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,625
Don't worry, I'm done because
burning zombie smells awful.

182
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,458
And fighting
won't solve a thing.

183
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,416
Anyway, it certainly
appears that I'm going to

184
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,083
have to re-educate this one.

185
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,625
So I'll be taking her
back to Villiers with me.

186
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,958
If that's what
you came here for,

187
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,958
why didn't you do it sooner?

188
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,416
You're mistaken.
I didn't come here for her,

189
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,750
but for that delicious
Kyo-tofu that you promised me.

190
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,208
Uh.

191
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,375
I'm sorry ma'am!
I hope it's still okay.

192
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,333
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure
I can make something out of it.

193
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,208
I hope, 'cause I don't
wanna get fried again!

194
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,791
It looks like our
wayward student is waking up.

195
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,041
Come, dear, you'll be
going home with me to--

196
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,625
What an
entertaining little show.

197
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,541
What's going on?

198
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,333
Well, if it isn't
Eucliwood Hellscythe.

199
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,541
I'm so glad to see you're well.

200
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,833
Don't look at me like that.

201
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,375
I'm not planning
on doing anything.

202
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,166
Well, at least not yet, that is.

203
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
The King of the Night.

204
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,875
So you're the one
who's possessed my student?

205
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
But of course.

206
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,583
I've heard about you.
You're a Megalo?

207
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,125
Not quite.
I'm much like yourself.

208
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,083
And I'll see all of you again.
You can count on it.

209
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,833
Stop right there!

210
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,666
Give me back my
student this instant!

211
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,666
I'll see you
real soon, Eucliwood.

212
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,041
I can't just sit
here and let that monster

213
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,250
run off with one of my pupils.

214
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,916
So, what'll you do.

215
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,125
Well, I'm afraid I have no
choice but to go after him.

216
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,041
Now you keep up
with your studies

217
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,916
and apply yourself, you hear me?

218
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,583
Yes, ma'am!

219
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
Bye now!

220
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,041
Eu, what was all that?

221
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,916
Most people live their
lives without ever knowing it,

222
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,416
but the world is
full of weird stuff,

223
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,333
like magic and
supernatural serial killers.

224
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Sure, we put a stop
to Kyoko, but knowing that

225
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,666
King of the Night
guy's out there

226
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,041
doesn't help me
rest that much easier.

227
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,833
Still, things have
settled down enough

228
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,250
that I can kick
back just a little.

229
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,083
Despite what you've
heard about zombies,

230
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,708
we don't go around
looking to munch on brains.

231
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,208
My favorite snack is still
these cheap little rice balls.

232
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,625
Awww, why'd my
pudding turn out so crappy?

233
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,291
Well, if I were to guess,

234
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,375
I would say you
did something wrong.

235
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:40,041
What! Don't come in here acting
like you could do a better job!

236
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,375
At least my pudding isn't gonna
melt down the entire house,

237
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
you bloodsucking freak.

238
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:44,708
Vampire.

239
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,458
Well, bite my ass!

240
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,416
Oh, hey.

241
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,333
I don't know why,
but these balls taste so yummy!

242
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,791
But then everything
tastes better with you, tiger!

243
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,875
It makes me purr! Meow!

244
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,958
Whoa, nice tail.

245
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,458
Can I ask you something?

246
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,291
Are there other
zombies besides me?

247
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,208
Like this "King" guy?

248
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,500
Sorry to pry, but he
wasn't your boyfriend was he?

249
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:50,166
Um. Look, you don't
need to worry.

250
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,166
I'll always be here for you.

251
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,375
Y'know, 'cause I'm immortal now.

252
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,250
Of course, that's all
thanks to your power.

253
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,958
I know the girls have
your back, too. We all do.

254
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,083
Wait. Did she just smile?

255
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,125
Bam! Dessert is served!

256
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,125
I made one of my famous
rolled omelettes! So dig in!

257
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,625
Not to complain, but I
thought you were making pudding.

258
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,541
You are complaining,
but since you must know,

259
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,875
I had a little
problem making it!

260
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,583
Look, I do appreciate this and
all, but I wanted some pudding.

261
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,333
So you're a pervert
and an ingrate, too.

262
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,541
Well no one's forcing you
to eat it, you whiny maggot.

263
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,708
Wait. Bring it back,
I'll eat it.

264
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,875
Hey, I worked hard on that,

265
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,166
so if you toss it,
I'm gonna toss you!

266
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,166
Sorry, the cross-dresser
doesn't want it, so it's trash!

267
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,458
What's the use?

268
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,583
Well, things are still crazy.

269
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,000
But I guess it's our
home now. Whaddaya think?

270
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,958
Reactor 1's reached critical!

271
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,541
Release the safety
valve, but carefully!

272
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,000
Thermal levels holding!

273
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,208
Magical output 1 gigaton!

274
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,375
Ready!

275
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,458
Red Two, Blue One,
commence infusion!

276
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,333
Wanna make beautiful
music with me, Taeko?

277
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,333
I dunno, I mean,
we're not even dating!

278
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,583
I meant karaoke.

279
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,458
Oh.

280
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,958
I can't win.

281
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,833
I'm sorry. It's just everyone's
been saying you've gotten

282
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,416
more perverted and weird lately,

283
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,166
so I thought you
were being gross.
