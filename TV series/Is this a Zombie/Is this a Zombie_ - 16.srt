1
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,250
I fail to see what charm
the maggot can possibly

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,666
hold for you.

3
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,958
Is it his looks?
Or something more, elusive?

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,125
The boy's looks
do nothing for me.

5
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,250
His personality
is no less repugnant.

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,625
Then why do you
obsess over him?

7
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,916
It's his butt. 

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,291
I'm sorry? 

9
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:51,458
You heard me perfectly!
His rear. His luscious rump.

10
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,708
His ass. 'Kay?

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,375
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,208
My brain refuses to register
it as something you'd say.

13
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,208
One of your many
limitations, Seraphim.

14
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,625
Excuse me? 

15
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,833
You know, when he saw
Emperor Napoleon on horseback,

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,666
the philosopher Hegel
was nearly moved to tears.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,416
"Lo! There sits the
World Soul," he said.

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,958
Wait, what?

19
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,125
Ethics. Tradition. Morality.

20
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,458
All of them folded
in their common dust.

21
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,291
Perished. Dispersed in the
wake of History's momentum.

22
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:27,416
And now there is no going back.
I'm stricken by a perfect ass!

23
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,125
All this waiting around for
my life to go back to normal

24
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,416
is making me crazy.

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,250
Fresh miso soup
hot off the stove.

26
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,083
Poor fellah's
seen better days, huh?

27
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,291
So, uh, how long til he's
up to snuff again, you think?

28
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,625
You can't rush a delicate
operation like this.

29
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,708
He's part of a genius's
arsenal, after all;

30
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,708
it's not like changing
a stupid flat tire.

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,333
I didn't figure it was. 

32
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,666
Things are
different in Villiers.

33
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
We like to take our time
with old things!

34
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,166
Rub-a-dub-dub,
thanks for the grub.

35
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,375
I only brought it up
'cause I don't know

36
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250
how much longer I can
take the notoriety.

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,666
It's not without
a few perks, though, right?

38
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
The internet crowd can't get
enough of those exquisite legs,

39
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,041
my darling.

40
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,125
What the hell is it
that people are downloading?

41
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,666
Just your
personal information.

42
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,041
My what?

43
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,083
The world needed to know
the real you. I couldn't just

44
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,375
stand on the sidelines and
let the rumor mill grind you

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,000
to pulp. Don't worry, my blog
is very fair and balanced.

46
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,000
Aw, that's so sweet of you.

47
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,583
Wait, I mean knock it off!
Stop feeding the sharks

48
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,041
my information!

49
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,583
What's with you?

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,791
You're staring at me
like I've grown a tail.

51
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,333
Mind your own business,
perv. I'm preoccupied.

52
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,500
Wow. A very reasonable response.

53
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,416
Look, all I'm sayin' is the
sooner everyone forgets

54
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,083
what they saw, the better.

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,250
Um, hello? Head Teacher?
It's Ayumu.

56
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,791
Morning, sweet pea.
How're you?

57
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,875
You busy, or is this
a good time to talk?

58
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,333
Ah. I am all ears. 

59
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,041
I was hoping for an ETA
on Mystletainn's repairs.

60
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,708
Well, as of right now,
I think--let's see.

61
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,458
Yes, according to my records,
the repairs-request form

62
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,250
has pushed through
to Window 1241.

63
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,958
There's a window 1241?

64
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,250
Quite so. At this rate,
he'll be a third of the way

65
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,875
through the process in no time.

66
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,125
Kinda seems like a whole
lotta red tape to me!

67
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,416
We like dotting the i's and
crossing the t's in Villiers.

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,458
So Haruna likes
to keep telling me.

69
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,458
All good things come to those
who wait, my turtledove.

70
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,916
Alright, that does it. 

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,875
Time for the one person in this
house with chutzpah to step up

72
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,875
and take charge
of the situation!

73
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Okay.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,666
Mystletainn counts as
collateral damage! The brass

75
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,708
isn't going to be sympathetic
to a predicament like his!

76
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,541
Huh? 

77
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,375
I'll fix him! After I eat! 

78
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,666
Stop looking. 

79
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,166
Okay, then.
I'm headed off to school.

80
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,583
First off, let's get you
out of these tight clothes.

81
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,458
Please, no! I'm begging you
not to do this.

82
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,291
Don't distract me, worm bait.

83
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,458
I'm commencing with
a very delicate operation!

84
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,500
Fight it all you want,
I'm seein' your insides.

85
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,000
Ugh! My dignity!

86
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,208
Don't look! I feel so dirty! 

87
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,583
Don't be afraid.
It'll only hurt at first.

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,541
Promise.

89
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,333
What a bedside manner!

90
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,291
Hmm. What to pop out first? 

91
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,625
Wow. So many pretty
lil' bits to choose from

92
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,583
I hardly know where to start!

93
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,083
You're a psychopath!

94
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,666
Quit squirming!
You'll only make it worse!

95
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,208
I'm just gonna think about
what I want to fix for dinner.

96
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,125
Hey, I'm home.

97
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,708
Oh, hello there, little guy.

98
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,250
Subject is
sufficiently prepped.

99
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,583
Drill me. 

100
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,458
Well done. Build up
enough centrifugal force

101
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,125
around the bill area. And I can
bore through the exoskeleton

102
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,500
as if with a diamond bit! Nice!

103
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,916
Ugh! Damn it, this is
surgery, not bath time!

104
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,208
Perfect; just what our patient
needs to feel more comfortable.

105
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,583
Perhaps we'll improvise a song:
"tinkle tinkle, little--

106
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,625
we're not trying to teach him
how to drop a friggin' deuce!

107
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,083
I'll have dinner ready
in about half an hour.

108
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,250
That's a light machine gun!

109
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,208
Where are you pulling
this stuff out of?

110
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,208
You gonna eat? You don't
want it to get cold.

111
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,125
Dinner can get bent! I can't
walk away from this right now!

112
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,541
Whatever. No worries;
I've got you covered.

113
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,416
I'll whip up something
you can eat later.

114
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,333
I think the primary issue

115
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,375
is that the conductive sheath
protecting his magic circuits

116
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,375
got overheated during the fight
and made the shaft hemorrhage.

117
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,666
Naturally that's gonna overload
the super-dimensional inductors.

118
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,875
So, if I bypass the
fuselage here, I should.

119
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,750
Ah-ha! Exactly! Makes perfect
sense! Now I've gotcha!

120
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,000
The unflappable Haruna
and her stupendous brain

121
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,625
are on the case!

122
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,916
The hyper-causality engine's
exhaust controls malfunctioned

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,916
and caused a build-up of sparkly
in the combustion chamber.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
The Fessenden field
imploded like a sinkhole.

125
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,625
That caused the breakers
to fail, which screwed up

126
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,208
the antiphase valve torque.

127
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,708
Somebody's been working hard.

128
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,250
Just look at that moon. 

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,583
I take it the old man's
up and running?

130
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,166
Oh, hey. 

131
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,416
I'm sure you've been waiting for
this moment with baited breath.

132
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,625
Like a kid for Christmas. Any
longer and a four page spread

133
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,291
of me in full regalia would've
wound up in the yearbook.

134
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,041
I'm ready for this mess to end.

135
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,625
Then by all means,
get on with it.

136
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,291
Stand back. 

137
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,375
Nomobuyo.

138
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:32,333
Oshi hashitawa dokeda
gunmiicha deh ribura.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,500
How 'bout that? You're going
with the classic look tonight.

140
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,833
Poor Haruna worked herself to
the bone for my sake, I owe her.

141
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,291
Alright memories. Here I come. 

142
00:09:55,041 --> 00:10:01,375
Emashite resuwa moka
monina momeyu moia!

143
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,333
You disgusting little vermin!
This whole charade was just...

144
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,625
It's about the capacitors.
Heh. One point twenty- one.

145
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,875
I can do better.

146
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,625
When I see it for myself,
I'll believe it.

147
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,041
I'm sorry, really. 

148
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,916
You got yourself into this,
girl. We Vampire Ninjas

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,375
don't have it easy.

150
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,000
Mark my words,
ladies and gentlemen!

151
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,166
Mystletainn will be back!

152
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,333
Someone's taken Mystletainn! 

153
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,375
Way to go streaker;
now we have to wait

154
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,083
for the bureaucrats to fix 'em.

155
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
I'm so done. Just kill me. 

156
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,416
Something stuck
in your craw, Mr. Aikawa?

157
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,833
Stuck in my--? 

158
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,791
Nevermind. I just wanted
to let you know as a courtesy

159
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,166
that I'm gonna need
more time to sort things out.

160
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,500
Huh? 

161
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,000
I wasn't prepared for the
revelation you sprung on

162
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,916
all of us the other day.

163
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,083
It made me realize the person
I thought I knew was a fiction;

164
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,000
takes some getting used to.
To paraphrase Walt Whitman:

165
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,875
you contradict yourself
because you contain multitudes.

166
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,541
How's a straight-shooter like
me s'posed to deal with that?

167
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,958
Damn it. The thing is.

168
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,875
I can get my head
around what you are,

169
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,958
but it will be a long time
before I can trust my heart.

170
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,375
Uh, yeah.
You're losin' me, dude.

171
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,583
Truth is a harsh
mistress to some people.

172
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,125
And that means? 

173
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:58,375
His mind has been forced to
adapt to a new kind of reality.

174
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,666
All the stereotypes he's
fed on up till now have been

175
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,750
reduced to shadows
in the wake of seeing

176
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,125
his best friend in drag.

177
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,625
What?

178
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,791
Don't worry, he's fighting
for you; the friendship means

179
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,750
too much for him to let the
negative stereotypes win out.

180
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,916
Like a soul struggling to be
born anew. He fights to be real.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,833
Orito crouches poised
to burst from his cocoon.

182
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,750
A butterfly merely
waiting to emerge.

183
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,333
Hear me, Higher Self. I know
you're in there somewhere

184
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,166
and rest assured that
one day I swear I'm gonna

185
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,166
turn the reigns over!

186
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,500
Okay, Gaia.
I don't mean to complain,

187
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,083
but if this is
your idea of a new age.

188
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,833
It's kind of ridiculous.

189
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,125
All I wanted was something
a little closer to a normal,

190
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,500
you know?
Now that's shot to hell.

191
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,875
We don't want it
too warm, now.

192
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,166
Seriously. Is it really so much
to ask for a little obscurity?

193
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,791
The limelight sucks. 

194
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,291
Oh yeah. This brand rocks.
You need to try a sip, Tea Pot.

195
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,958
Once this stuff gets a
toehold in your system

196
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,333
we can switch to vodka.

197
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,125
Oh, potato vodka! That'd
put some curl in your pubes!

198
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,833
Look, kid. Some days are shit.

199
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
That's when a good friend pours
you a drink and the pair of ya

200
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,458
toast to tomorrow.
Then you pour a few more

201
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,166
till things get weird. Then of
course you keep knockin' 'em

202
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,291
back out of a sense of
obligation and forget about

203
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,541
the lonely vodka. And ask
why as you blow chunks.

204
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,208
Works, too. S'how
D-list celebrities deal

205
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,416
with their pain.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,625
Yeah. 

207
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,583
Get this, kid.
Anyone can splurge on vodka,

208
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,125
but it takes guts
to be a D-lister.

209
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,875
Holy crap! I've been a total
wuss about this whole thing,

210
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,375
haven't I?

211
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,625
You're amazing! Seriously!
I've been wallowing in self-pity

212
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,916
when what I really
need is some balls!

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,250
Bring on the potato vodka! 

214
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,916
Idiot. If he'd have
just left him alone

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,583
the grafts would've taken.

216
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,416
Big, stupid Ayumu. 

217
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,041
I can't breathe! The hell? 

218
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,458
Knock it off with the dance
curse, you stupid idiot!

219
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,458
My lungs are
exploding into my--

220
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,791
Okay. Let me get this straight;

221
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,333
so you had no idea that
was a dance curse?

222
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,500
Of course not! I could never
do something like that!

223
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:23,125
It's just that Sarasvati is
performing another concert and

224
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,958
I sorta got talked into being
one of her backup dancers.

225
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,833
One, two, three, four!
Five, six, seven, eight!

226
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:35,125
Now turn it around and strike
a pose. Then twist that thang.

227
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,208
Now back it up
like a diesel truck.

228
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,833
Bam! 

229
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,625
Tell me that
wasn't secret recipe!

230
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,875
I've seen decapitated chickens
with better moves than you,

231
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,250
Mael Strom.

232
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,958
I so fail at life. 

233
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,625
Like hell you do!
What kind of talk is that?

234
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,708
It's not every day you meet
a gal who can fell everything

235
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,500
in a three mile radius
by shakin' her money maker.

236
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,916
That's not the kind of
dancing I want to be good at!

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,875
In that case,
maybe give it up.

238
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,500
Screw that! If Sarasvati can
make a thousand shrieking

239
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,208
fanboys foam at the mouth,
there's no reason

240
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,000
I can't do it, too!

241
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,708
If you worms want to die,
come to me now!

242
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,291
Vampire ninjas never give up;

243
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,791
we toil in the shadows
until the job is finished.

244
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,166
So what are you whining about? 

245
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,250
Because the moves are
too hard for me to memorize!

246
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,000
Alright, that does it! 

247
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,750
When I'm done with you,
your moves will be the stuff

248
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,833
of legend! Get to know me,
girl; I'm a genius.

249
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,666
What the hell? 

250
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,416
And you throw your hands in the
air like you just don't care!

251
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,000
Knock it off with
the dance curse!

252
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,583
My lungs are exploding into my--

253
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,500
Uh-oh. 

254
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,791
Why you always interrupting
me when I'm knee-deep

255
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,375
in something important?

256
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,583
You guys are killing everything
in earshot, dumbass! Look up!

257
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,541
Oh wow! When we dance together,
the curse gets amplified!

258
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,875
That's awesome!

259
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,708
Alrighty, look.
Whatever you're doing,

260
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,708
put the kibosh on it right now.

261
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,583
But we're just dancing. 

262
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,416
Cursing? 

263
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
Stuff it, jackass! 

264
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,916
Sarasvati's doing a concert,
and I wanted--

265
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,208
Ah, yeah! Check it out! 

266
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,166
Read 'em and weep,
these moves are sweet;

267
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,166
If dance were a city
I'd be main street!

268
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,250
And scissor lift,
and spinin' some gold,

269
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,208
Then spring and summer
gonna play it bold!

270
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,791
Now one last trick
fo' the ladies, and boom!

271
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,166
Whoa! That was sweet! 

272
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,208
Point is. That's how you
dance without killing stuff.

273
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,541
Big deal. 

274
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,166
I'm never gonna be able
to dance like that either.

275
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,583
Pathetic beyond words.

276
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,250
Sarasvati? How did
you know we were here?

277
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,250
I simply followed
He of the Fine Ass

278
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,375
on his way home from school.

279
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,583
Fair warning, Mael Strom.
You have twenty four hours

280
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,583
to become a
passable backup dancer,

281
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,291
otherwise I'm shipping
you back to the village.

282
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,208
Seriously?

283
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,666
What the hell's
wrong with you?

284
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,083
The girl made an oath.
If she can't fulfill it,

285
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,791
she is subject to our laws,
no one else's.

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,833
Hang in, Yuki! 

287
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,416
I think I'm getting it, sensei!

288
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,708
So Yuki thinks she can become
a backup dancer for Sarasvati?

289
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,541
Yeah. Pretty much. 

290
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,500
She trying to kill
everyone at the concert?

291
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,875
'Cause they do know
that's what will happen, right?

292
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,208
We're gonna try to
avoid that, if possible.

293
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,458
Here's the deal. I've got till
tomorrow to turn this gal into

294
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,083
a dancer. If I fail, she gets
shunted back to her home town.

295
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,958
Which, frankly, would suck. 

296
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,125
That's harassment. 

297
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,500
The prospect only bothers you

298
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,125
because she's easier
prey for you here.

299
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,458
But surely I'm the only one

300
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,916
you want to do naughty
things with, right?

301
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,583
Forget this perv, Yuki.
Stick to my program

302
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,541
and we'll have you rockin' like
a hurricane well before sun-up!

303
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,208
Sounds like a plan to me! 

304
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,916
Hear that, world?
I'm gonna be a hurricane!

305
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,458
Come on! I don't care
how much it hurts,

306
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,291
you keep on keepin' on!
We're breakin' through the wall!

307
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,916
I'm in it to win it! 

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,375
This is a tragedy. 

309
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,916
That's the word for it.
Exactly how long can two people

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,291
do what they're doing
and call it dance?

311
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,375
It's go-time, ladies.

312
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,791
Now we get serious.
You with me?

313
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,083
One, two! One, two!
Don't forget the break!

314
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,583
Watch it! Gotta keep
those legs straight!

315
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:54,000
One more time! One, two!
One, two! Step, step!

316
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,041
Spread those arms and turn!

317
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,958
You gotta let go, Tomonori!
Forget the choreography!

318
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,208
Become one with the beat and
allow pure animal instinct

319
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,666
to take over! Shut out every
thought but your desire

320
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,875
to be the best!

321
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,708
The light is yours!
Reach up and grab it!

322
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,625
It's been long enough.
I'm ready.

323
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,625
For what? 

324
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,791
I've clawed my way through

325
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,166
the seven circles
of Hell for you, dude.

326
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,875
Seriously?

327
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,458
I'm sorry. There's not
a less dramatic way

328
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,458
to describe the
process. It was hell.

329
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,750
But I now know the
role I have to play,

330
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,250
I don't need a cross-dressing
head case in my life.

331
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,958
But you need a normal
one in yours. Me.

332
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,208
Butterfly of the status quo! 

333
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,791
Stop and take five.
Towel yourself off.

334
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,833
Uh, thanks? 

335
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,458
Don't worry.
The show'll kick ass.

336
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,583
Um. Awkward. 

337
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,125
Yeah. 

338
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,875
Show me those pretty necks! 

339
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,333
Who wants to be first
on the chopping block?

340
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,041
I wanna have your babies!
Or however that works!

341
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,500
It's okay, I'm here for you. 

342
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,541
You pushed yourself to
the limit in rehearsal.

343
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
Show all these people
what you're made of.

344
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,500
Now get out there
and knock 'em dead.

345
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,125
You got it! 

346
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,875
Let's rock their socks off! 

347
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,333
Yes, sensei!

348
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,000
Break a leg, you two. 

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Damn it, that's not what
we practiced! Son of a--!

350
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,000
Like the choreography
was that hard!

351
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,666
Not like that! Cmon, we just
did it five minutes ago!

352
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,833
What the hell? Why is my body
suddenly ignoring my brain?

353
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
Hey! What are you guys doing? 

354
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,250
Somebody do something;

355
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,208
the curse is sapping
my ability to resist!

356
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,083
I can't breathe. 

357
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,041
This is a thing of beauty!
With Ayumu in step,

358
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,708
the curse is like a
gazillion times stronger!

359
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,000
Stop dancing!

360
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,625
Dear god. It's perfect. 

361
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,166
Someone I know? 

362
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,666
I have reason to
believe so, yes.

363
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,875
Or am I wrong to presume

364
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,625
you met the man who
used you face to face?

365
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,583
Oh, you mean him. 

366
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,875
Mind if I ask a few questions
about the King of the Night?

367
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,416
You can ask.
But I know nothing.

368
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,875
I'm expecting too much.
Well, if you think of anything,

369
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,583
do let me know.

370
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,708
Oh Ayumu, soon we will
be reunited my dear.

371
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,916
I hope you've
been thinking of me.

372
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,208
Hello, I'm Fantasy Eu A! 

373
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,208
Fantasy Eu B! 

374
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,500
I'm the C version! 

375
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,791
And together we form, 

376
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:36,625
Fantasy Eu Triple Threat
Cirque du Pervert!

377
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,125
It's been a long time,
girlfriends.

378
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,541
Too long! 

379
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,791
I can't remember the last
time we all got together!

380
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,041
No kidding! How've you
two been in the meantime?

381
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,250
Oh, pretty good! 

382
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,583
Oh, pretty good!
Ayumu's feverish imagination

383
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,416
is so active, I've been
doing all sorts of things

384
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,333
just to keep him happy.

385
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,958
His naughty side has definitely
been in overdrive lately, huh?

386
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,500
I feel like such a tramp! 

387
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,500
I think he's ruining us
for other guys so he can

388
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,083
have us all to himself!

389
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:05,500
Of course! We're gonna make
Ayumu a very happy man someday!

390
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,000
In his dreams.
