1
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,666
Yeah, okay...

2
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't speak crazy, so...

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,625
Think ritual...

4
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,291
Action versus reaction...

5
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,541
Magic's effectiveness
comes at a price...

6
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,541
Particularly when you
try to mix string theory

7
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,125
with quantum mechanics...

8
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,791
You have to exploit
loopholes inherent to both...

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,583
It's a tricky process.

10
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,041
Alright, look...

11
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,583
Thirty minutes ago
I asked what I thought

12
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,416
was a pretty straightforward
question about why your powers

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,291
are back online and Haruna
is suddenly giving me

14
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,583
the silent treatment...

15
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,666
We know...

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,208
And that's what
we're trying to explain.

17
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,041
She essentially
tapped my powers

18
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,000
with a magically
designed siphon...

19
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,250
Sounds dirty,
I know -but grow up.

20
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,875
Power absorption in progress!

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,625
There were side effects
she wasn't counting on...

22
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,833
Like intense, searing pain
lashing through her body

23
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,958
whenever she tries to speak
-exactly as I'd been

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,875
experiencing for
the past several months.

25
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,333
It's not rocket science--!!!

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,541
Oft times, Gaia's chosen
are compelled to hide

27
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,291
their true natures behind
the veil of false piety;

28
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,916
a wolf in sheep's clothing...

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,958
Hearken, world!

30
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,958
The day of tooth
and claw is upon us!

31
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,208
Heed yon baying
of wandering fang!

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
It's not much of a fashion
statement, but that getup really

33
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,166
is the best way to keep your
power from going haywire.

34
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,541
So, uh, clearly this whole mess
is what came of building

35
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,666
your device-but remind me
again why you had to sneak

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,375
into Ayumu's school?

37
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,125
Wait, seriously?

38
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,041
Don't look at me on this one.

39
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
Who're you talking about?

40
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, way to be vague
on a question that's

41
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,458
bound to come back up.

42
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,250
You should be heading out,
don't you think?

43
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:55,875
Right.

44
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,125
Guess I'd better.

45
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,875
Come back safely.

46
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,875
Um...

47
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,291
Sure.

48
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,125
Day one was awesome sauce...!

49
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,708
But the battle's
just begun...!

50
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,166
Let me hear you vow
to make day two balls-out!

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,916
Yeah!

52
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,291
Hey, Ayamu!

53
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,333
What's up...?

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,708
Your dress at the
dry cleaners' or something"

55
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,791
I'm strictly behind
the scenes today...

56
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,541
What about you?

57
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,083
Swimsuit bust a hem?

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,250
No -I only wore it yesterday!

59
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,416
Oh,well that's a shame.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,041
I thought it looked
really cute on you.

61
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,250
Well, if you like it so much...

62
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,083
And we were alone
somewhere together...

63
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,916
What...?

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Didn't catch that last part.

65
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,541
Don't be a jerk...!

66
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,583
It was hard enough workin' up
the courage to say it once!

67
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,291
Look at that.

68
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,125
You've got your ring on.

69
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,916
Somebody likes a little bling.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,291
You think I'd
leave it at home...?

71
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,791
When a man
gives his wife the Big R,

72
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,791
she'd sooner forget to put on
a clean pair of underwear!

73
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,791
It's not that
big a deal, really.

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,083
Yeah, well...

75
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,916
You made me so happy.

76
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,958
Wait, you're not...

77
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,250
like, trying to...?

78
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,916
Note to self: Never
tell her you got the ring

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,875
from a tubercular
nut job roaming the park.

80
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
That might kinda
bring her down a bit.

81
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,083
Yuki!

82
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,625
We could really use a hand.

83
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,791
'kay, then: that's my cue...

84
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,458
So I'll, see you later.

85
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,791
Nice one.

86
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,500
You know we take
rings very seriously...

87
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,291
Hey!

88
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,875
It's not what you think;

89
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,708
there's less than zero romantic
significance to that thing...!

90
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,583
'Course, in hindsight I can see
how a girl might read into it...

91
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,708
So it does have
some significance.

92
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,416
How do I get myself
into this kinda crap?!

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,833
If it helps...

94
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,041
You can fantasize me saying
something inappropriate.

95
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,500
Wha...

96
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,333
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,083
C'mon, I'm not stupid.

98
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,291
Well...

99
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,333
Since you're givin' me carte
blanche, it'd be rude not to.

100
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,916
Oh, my darling.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,416
Let me hang on your arm
at the festival and I'll be

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,916
the happiest maiden alive!

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,333
At first I was all "whatever,"

104
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,625
but when she said destined
to be, I was totally sold!

105
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,833
You know, they say that
couples who declare their love

106
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,041
for each other under this
tree during the festival

107
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,791
will last till
the stars burn out.

108
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,000
Wouldn't it be great
if it were true...?

109
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,750
Wanna find out?

110
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,000
What was that for?!

111
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,166
She says if you even begin to
think of her naked, though,

112
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,333
she'll chain you to a
diamond drill-tipped missile

113
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,333
on a course for the
Mohorovicic Discontinuity.

114
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,125
Your sphincter's
the kill switch.

115
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,250
Okay...

116
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,958
Back to the theatre of mind...

117
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,333
Matinee run.

118
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,500
OMG, how much fun
would it be if the two of us

119
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,125
went to the festival
thingie together?!

120
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:56,708
That's right!

121
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,916
Suck it, people!

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,291
Momma hit the jackpot!

123
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,541
Woo-hoo!

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,166
You want green?

125
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,583
You got it!

126
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,833
The scratch I make from
the timber off this bad boy

127
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,583
is gonna line my pockets
like the ozone layer!

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,416
No good.

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,375
Sorry.

130
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,625
Well try harder!

131
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,500
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

132
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,958
We'll just have a quick look
around and come right back.

133
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,333
Alright...

134
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,416
Just do what you can
to keep Haruna out of trouble.

135
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,625
No problem...

136
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
Keeping her in line
is kind of what I do.

137
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,333
Party of five,
right this way!

138
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,791
Thanks for waiting.

139
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
Come back and see us!

140
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,625
♪  Don't worry, I'm not
some kind of monster...  ♪

141
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't fight it;
if you want one just say.

142
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,583
Or point to the one you'd like.

143
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,250
You're absolutely sure?

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,333
Hi there, guys.

145
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,625
Would madam like a crepe?

146
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,166
Strawberry-ogura,
if you'd be so kind.

147
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,625
And a choco-banana one for my
tongue-tied friend, please.

148
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,208
Scream yourselves hoarse,
you tick-infested vermin!

149
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,500
You've noticed, yes?

150
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,750
I have.

151
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,958
I guess it was only
a matter of time.

152
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,791
You know what to do.

153
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,708
I shall keep my eyes peeled.

154
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,291
Good.

155
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,833
One thing...

156
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,416
Reassure me the presence so
alarmed you there was no time

157
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,000
to change out of your pj's.

158
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,875
Wha...?!

159
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,333
I thought this was cute!

160
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,083
Enough!

161
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,291
Stay vigilant!

162
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,875
In a forest, one tree
scarcely stands out.

163
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,000
In this world,
so too with a person!

164
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,416
Remember your ninja
training and honor it!

165
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,416
Well done.

166
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,125
I...

167
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,625
feel like a choir girl.

168
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,291
A choir angel...!

169
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,875
One on the wrong
side of The Fall...!

170
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,250
This is the stuff nocturnal
emissions are made of!

171
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,083
If you don't stop breathing
on me, I'm going to rip

172
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,083
your lungs out
and hand them to your mother.

173
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,666
Hi, hon...!

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,291
Look who's on a dinner break so
she and the hubby can hang out?

175
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,458
When did you
start wearing jewelry?

176
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,750
This?

177
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,333
Ayamu gave it to me.

178
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,625
Don't say it like that.

179
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,166
Well well well...

180
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,333
Congratulations.

181
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,416
Thanks!

182
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,125
No...

183
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,208
Uh-uh.

184
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,458
What the hell
is going on with you?

185
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,666
Unless she's got
a bun in the oven,

186
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,958
you best slow your roll...!

187
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,958
Stop throwin'
me curve balls, dude!

188
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,166
Settle down, people.

189
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,625
Whatever it is, you can
use your inside voices.

190
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,791
We feeling a bit above
the dress code tonight?

191
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,250
What...?

192
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,750
Oh, no...

193
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,041
You know very well bling isn't
allowed on school grounds.

194
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,958
I'm not going to pawn it,
don't have a hissy...

195
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,333
It'll be waiting for you
in the faculty lounge.

196
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,500
Pick it up on your way home.

197
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,166
I'm a bad wife.

198
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,500
Don't start with
the anime face.

199
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,833
It's true, though:
I fail at life!

200
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,166
Hey, Goth chick--

201
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,708
Hello?

202
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,875
You there?

203
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,583
Just wanted someone
to know how happy I am...

204
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,916
A toast...

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,666
To spitting in the
wrinkly face of adversity...

206
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,333
Screw that Whore!

207
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,375
Ya get knocked down into
somersaults seven times...

208
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,791
but ya get up like
eight times at least!

209
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,625
Anyone can splurge on vodka, but
it takes guts to be d-lister.

210
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,875
You bet your ass...!

211
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,000
And don't go bein'
a stranger, okay!

212
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,250
Thank you.

213
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,541
For everything.

214
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,583
Adversity's got nothing on me.

215
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,000
Or my ass.

216
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,208
Bonfire.

217
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,000
Folk dancing.

218
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,125
Time was, I would've
put this stuff on par

219
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,125
with glittery vampires.

220
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,625
Now, though -I dunno.

221
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,833
It just does something for me.

222
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,000
This is life...

223
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,791
This is what it's all about.

224
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,500
Can I appeal to your better
nature and ask that you

225
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,958
not shriek in my ear?

226
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,625
Sorry, I was just kinda
thrown off seeing you

227
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,208
standing in the girl's line.

228
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,958
What are you gonna do...?
There weren't enough ladies.

229
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,291
Not to sound mean...

230
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,250
But I thought the hand
I would wind up holding

231
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,041
might belong to a female.

232
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,541
Don't be so dramatic...

233
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,083
Get over yourself and you might
find something you like.

234
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,208
Hasn't anyone ever told you not
to judge a book by its cover?

235
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,000
You of all people
should know better.

236
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,875
You're one of Gaia's elect.

237
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,041
Which, by the way, with
four girls waiting on you

238
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,000
hand and foot, seems
like a really sweet gig.

239
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,625
One to cook for you,
one to clean,

240
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,833
one to dispense tough-love
wisdom when you need it,

241
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,666
and another to frolic
in your head all day.

242
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,583
That's sick!

243
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,625
You chauvinist pig!

244
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,291
No!

245
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,250
It's not like that!

246
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,333
You can't...

247
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,666
I mean, there's no way
you could know!

248
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,708
Nomobuyo...

249
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,333
Oshi...

250
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,541
hashitawa...

251
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,708
dokeda...

252
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,791
gunmiicha...

253
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,708
deh...

254
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,375
ribura.

255
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,791
Oh good, you're still around!

256
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,500
You rang?

257
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,958
You rang?

258
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,541
You rang?

259
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,208
Oh good, you're still around!

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,541
Can I just say how
refreshing it is to be back

261
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,125
in this form fully sober?

262
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,708
Question: How's one
go from a middle-aged

263
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,166
homeroom teacher to you?

264
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,500
Good news Ayumu...!

265
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,500
I have the ability
to talk again for some reason!

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,041
Did you lose
the ability to stand?

267
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,500
I don't get it...

268
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,041
Why now all of a sudden?

269
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,166
Why are you so gobsmacked
by a power exchange...?

270
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,541
Silly boy.

271
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,708
Haruna's magic
power-siphon thingy?

272
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
I chucked that out a window!

273
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,500
For which, I thank you.

274
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,583
Couldn't have stolen
your mojo without it.

275
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,500
How is that Mr. Kurisu?

276
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,791
I wanna know how
he fits in there.

277
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,833
Wait, what?

278
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,958
I'm not the only one
who can see her?

279
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,666
You're not
s'posed to be real!

280
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,958
I bore my soul to a
flesh-and-blood person?!

281
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,333
Boop-boop-be-doo- wah!

282
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,583
Uh-oh.

283
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,000
You're kidding me, right?

284
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,208
She goes by Chris.

285
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,208
She's the
Head Teacher's teacher!

286
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,541
You must be pretty damn
important, whoever you are...

287
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,958
Haruna bothered
to remember your name.

288
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,375
Funny story...

289
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,041
I ran afoul of the Villiers
queen once upon a binge

290
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,375
and got cursed to mope through
the world as a midlife crisis

291
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,458
poster child.

292
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,833
Which sucks...

293
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,791
That's the understatement
of the century.

294
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,291
How horrible.

295
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,208
I'd have bitten off my tongue
and let myself bleed out.

296
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,041
This better not change the
status of my friggin' ring!

297
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,666
Queenie had
a sense of humor, though.

298
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,083
I could revert back to
my true form when tanked.

299
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,500
Oh, the eternal waiting
through bleary-eyed sobriety

300
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,875
for the day when
I could be myself

301
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,583
permanently again, you know...?

302
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,791
Almost worth it.

303
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,291
Of course I say that
on the brink of putting

304
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,125
this whole episode behind me.

305
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,291
Everything's in place finally:
a crazy-powerful entity,

306
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,250
a scrappy little genius
able to knock together

307
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,833
a device to tap her.

308
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,500
And a ring that's a perfect
damper for the after effects.

309
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,708
And it's not even my birthday!

310
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,333
Now I'm free to be
my fabulous self

311
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,500
without fretting over
the consequences.

312
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,000
You were the person Haruna
was being so coy about,

313
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,125
who knew magic...

314
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,458
Give that man a sticker!

315
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,625
And yesterday, when those
Megalo attacked us...?

316
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,375
You're welcome!

317
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,708
And you're the reason
the girl's couldn't sell

318
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,458
their stupid cursed CD's!

319
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,791
Guilty as charged.

320
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,166
What about the conspicuous
toilet paper shortage

321
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,208
this morning?

322
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,416
'fraid so.

323
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,625
And the sun?!

324
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeppers!

325
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,958
So it's ...

326
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,291
Your fault...

327
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,791
my life sucks?

328
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,041
Bingo...

329
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,750
It's what I do.

330
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,833
Impossible...!

331
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,375
This can't be happening...

332
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,291
I've got nothing.

333
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,416
Absolutely nothing.

334
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,916
Get the damn knot
out of your bra...!

335
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,250
She's pullin' your leg!

336
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,333
Say what?!

337
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,208
What?

338
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,083
Oh, like I'm not
gonna still drink.

339
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,625
♪  How much is that maggot
in the window...  ♪

340
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,208
Whoa...

341
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,416
What's this?

342
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,541
Anyhoo, this is my big
coming back out party!

343
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,875
We should be getting ca-razy!

344
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:31,750
Rakattena...

345
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,041
nichitaha...

346
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,250
hakesaona...

347
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,250
ruremano...

348
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,250
moden...

349
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,833
nohakesa...!

350
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,166
This is some serious wrong.

351
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,791
I'm...

352
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,916
stuck to the desk!

353
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,208
Bear with me, Hightower-is
it fair to say you were

354
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,333
so bummed out by the
festival winding down that

355
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,375
you made a play
for teach, or no?

356
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,583
The name's Aikawa.

357
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,958
Whatever.

358
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,500
Point is, beneath that pasty
façade was the beautiful

359
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,000
little that girl you've been
slowly falling in love with...

360
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,541
Seriously...? Why don't you
just buy a magazine next time?

361
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,708
Oh my god.

362
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,541
I didn't want him
to change into a Lolita

363
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,833
when I grabbed his
hand...! wait, I mean!

364
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,166
Tsk tsk; what'd I say
earlier about judging a book

365
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,416
by its cover, huh?

366
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,041
When the title page
says Middle Aged Guy

367
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,041
you expect to find
slightly different content!

368
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,416
Stop right there!

369
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
You're still judging people
by their appearance...!

370
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,500
I've laid eyes on the
business end of that demon

371
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,000
more than my fair share.

372
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,000
Shame on you!

373
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,458
Granted, no one's going to see
you from across a crowded room

374
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,541
and go "wow, nice
personality," sure.

375
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,125
I get that.

376
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,416
But still...

377
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,083
Who are you
to judge anyone...?

378
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,375
Least of all him?

379
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,791
Thanks for backin' me up.

380
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,500
Ha!

381
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,958
Hypocrite number one!

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,875
Okay...

383
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,291
Unexpected.

384
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,291
What have you done
to my friend?!

385
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,416
So...

386
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,833
The kid brought up
a marvelous point...

387
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,500
Question time Miss Yoshida!

388
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,500
What do you call someone
who looks like an older man,

389
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,166
but is really a girl?

390
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,541
Um, I dunno...

391
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,083
Uh...

392
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:00,791
Maybe...

393
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,916
A secret hermaphrodite?

394
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,125
Sorry, no...!

395
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,791
The answer was
Magical Garment Girl Chris.

396
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,833
Whatever...!

397
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,541
I better be
gettin' my ring back!

398
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a hard-knocks life,
let me tell ya.

399
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,875
Your cholesterol
goes through the roof;

400
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,208
your prostate swells...

401
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,833
Salespeople give you the
stink-eye when you ask

402
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,375
for tampons...

403
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,125
For the record I don't wanna
know anything you're telling me!

404
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,416
I got winded just
bending over to tie my shoes;

405
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,041
I'd walk into a room and
completely blank on why.

406
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,833
Don't get me
started on sciatica.

407
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,875
I'd get Charlie horses if
I didn't watch my potassium...

408
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,083
But the worst was looking into
the mirror every day and seeing,

409
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,666
not a vivacious pink-haired
party girl, but a fleshy-faced

410
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,958
mook pushing the
wrong side of fifty.

411
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,666
Explain to me why
I should have to go through

412
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,291
something so horrible.

413
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,750
Sure.

414
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,291
You Sympathize now...

415
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,000
But what if I looked like the
geezer you see scratchin' on

416
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,500
the chalkboard, eh?

417
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,458
Not a damn thing.

418
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,000
Gross out.

419
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,250
Dear god!

420
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,458
I can't look...

421
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,083
 Sorry.

422
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,208
Yeah...

423
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,666
I hate to piss on
fair anointed youth,

424
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,416
but the future's got
similar designs on you.

425
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,458
No way!

426
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm saving up
for plastic surgery!

427
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,125
My boobs are gonna look
like fried eggs on a nail!

428
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,375
Kanami!

429
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:15,666
Stop it!

430
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,541
This is madness!

431
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,500
Cut it out!

432
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,625
Ah, lighten up...

433
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,041
What do you care?

434
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,833
It's nothin' a little
nip o' the spirits can't fix!

435
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,166
I'm just gonna say it:

436
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,541
why is she talking to you
like there's a history--

437
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,916
Taeko, no!

438
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,833
See, I've rigged all
the desks to catch air

439
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,541
whenever the heart of the person
sittin' at 'em gets crushed...

440
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,166
Heh.

441
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,333
How you holding up...?

442
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,125
 You good?

443
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,291
Damn straight...

444
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,166
My heart was mined
out of a marble quarry.

445
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,416
Oh...

446
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,458
Well in that case
I have a prezzie for you.

447
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,875
Meow!

448
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,541
What in the world
just happened...?!

449
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,166
Why...

450
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,666
Why can't I move?!

451
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,125
Let's see if we can make the
veins in that marble bulge.

452
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,458
What is this?

453
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,625
I've lost control of my body?

454
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
Take your eyes
off of me, pervert!

455
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,125
This isn't fair!!!

456
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,208
I can see my house from here!

457
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,625
Oh, I should've also mentioned
the seats are rigged to take off

458
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,125
when you get too excited.

459
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
I've had enough of this crap...

460
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,916
Cut it out right now!

461
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,625
I'm not playin' around:

462
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,791
give Haruna back her power and
bring everyone else back down!

463
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,083
You're not the boss of me!

464
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,708
And if you think I'm
gonna embrace middle-age,

465
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,916
you're bonkers.

466
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,500
Damn it, Haruna needs her magic!

467
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,875
Without it--

468
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,125
Hey, you don't have to talk
about me like a toddler!

469
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,708
Even without my magic...

470
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,000
I will have you know

471
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,750
that I'm at least
twelve kinds of kick-ass...!

472
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,458
Megalos everywhere
tremble at my name!

473
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,083
Haruna...

474
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,875
No, you're in total denial...!

475
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:58,958
Enough of this...!

476
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,458
Give her back
her powers, right now!

477
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,500
Sorry, hon...

478
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,750
I won't be reasoned
with about it,

479
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,500
but you can
fight me if you want.

480
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,166
Whoa...

481
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,791
She's lifted the spell...!

482
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,000
If that's the way
you want it, then fine!

483
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,083
200...

484
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:13,958
300...

485
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,708
400...

486
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,750
You're gonna
regret letting me go...

487
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,250
I can promise you that.

488
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,375
Not gonna lie.

489
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,291
When things were simpler
'tween us, I thought:

490
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,750
"here's a kid who,
when he grows up,

491
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,500
will make a
first-class bar buddy."

492
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,166
Why would she think
that about you?!

493
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,958
If you've been letting this
trollop get you drunk,

494
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,958
you're a bona fide
alky in the making.

495
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,416
All I had was water...!

496
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,833
Sheesh!

497
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,375
And I'm not gonna be your
"buddy" after this stunt?!

498
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,333
Yeah, yeah...

499
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,791
I know...

500
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,833
I'm an awful person...

501
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,500
Not always, though.

502
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,708
Maybe I just need a nice guy to
help keep me in line, you know?

503
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,500
This is what you get
for puttin' the moves on

504
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,166
an underage Goth-chick.

505
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,125
What?!

506
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,791
I didn't put the
moves on anyone!

507
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,500
Our fears of an
immeasurably powerful

508
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,875
entity have at last
become manifest.

509
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,250
Stop projecting
your own twisted thoughts!

510
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,291
I'm a victim here !

511
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,000
Me oh my.

512
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,375
What's to be done...?

513
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,500
The notion of Chris
recovering her full strength

514
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,750
is a far from comforting one.

515
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,000
Miss Ariel...

516
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,166
Yes?

517
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,833
I can be useful...

518
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,833
I know...

519
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,625
her Achilles Heel.

520
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,166
Boo...!

521
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,333
Why was I barely
in this episode?!

522
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,833
'Cause it's against the rules

523
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,958
for the real Eu
to be objectified.

524
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,541
Which I think is just sexist!

525
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,916
Well, I'm gonna gab it up
in here, like it our not!

526
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,916
Let's talk about girl stuff!

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,708
Not till I make a couple
demands of lover boy Ayumu!

528
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,125
You tell him, Eu!

529
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,250
Think of me so
it pads my line count!

530
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,666
Hooray fantasies!

531
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,958
Hey, at least I got
to speak today, right?

532
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:58,625
Gah...!

533
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,166
It's the actual Eu!

534
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,500
Darn it...!

535
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,541
If you keep appearing
like this you're going to

536
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,791
confuse the audience!

537
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,708
They don't like to think!

538
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,875
Shut up and make me a crepe.
