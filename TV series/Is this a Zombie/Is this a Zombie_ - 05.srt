1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,791
Don't worry. There's no
reason for you to be afraid.

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,125
But. I can't. Please,
I'm not ready for this.

3
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,333
It's gonna be all right, relax
and leave everything to me.

4
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,916
I promise. I'll be gentle.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,750
Yeah, I know this
is creepy, but I'm a zombie

6
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,166
who wears a magic dress, so...

7
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,541
What are you doing?

8
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,041
Once again you show
us your true colors

9
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,458
as a self-gratifying,
peeping Tom, maggot, scumbag.

10
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,625
And it looks like today I've
been given a brand new title.

11
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,958
Lucky me, huh?

12
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,750
That weird old
lady in room 305.

13
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,333
She's always mumbling
something to herself, isn't she?

14
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,083
She's just lonely.

15
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,875
She's been here almost
a year now. Poor thing.

16
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,458
Yes. It won't be long now,
I'll be on my way soon.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,333
Thank you very much young lady.
We hope you'll come again!

18
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,083
So, if you don't
drink blood, you'll die?

19
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,125
That's right.
I need a continuous supply

20
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,333
of blood to survive.
It keeps me strong and healthy.

21
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,583
Well, if you were
gonna suck her blood,

22
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,666
then how come you
were making out with her?

23
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,958
Not that there's
anything wrong with that,

24
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,375
but you're not
into girls, are you?

25
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,041
Keep talking and
I'll pull your legs off,

26
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,083
stuff them down your
throat and eat you for lunch.

27
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,333
The kiss works as an anesthetic.

28
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,208
You don't say?

29
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,375
Hey, Sera. Maybe you'd like
to suck my blood sometime?

30
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,916
No, thank you.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,625
I have my reasons for
not sucking the blood

32
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,791
of a boy who spends his time
touching himself in his closet.

33
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,958
And what might those be?

34
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,291
That's my business,
not yours, maggot.

35
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,458
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

36
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,833
Dokeda. Gunmiicha! Deh Ribura!

37
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:49,291
Haruna! Dinner's just
about ready! You there?

38
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,875
Don't barge in like
you own the place!

39
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,125
I think you're forgetting,
I DO! Now open up!

40
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,958
Stop! Keep out!
Leave me alone, pervert!

41
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,166
No way I'm letting you in here!

42
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,166
I told you not to
open the door, jerk!

43
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,000
You're nothing but a big
ole pervbag, you know that!

44
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,208
It not like
there's much to see.

45
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh, shut up!

46
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,250
Creep!

47
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,125
Aww, man, that hurt.

48
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,458
If you're that shy,
try wearing some clothes, okay?

49
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,083
Mind your own business!

50
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,250
Ehh. All right then,
fine, suit yourself.

51
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,458
When you decide you're ready,

52
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,083
everybody'll be
waiting for you downstairs.

53
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,458
So, how about that big
blue whale the other day?

54
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,375
Hold on. So you actually
take your bath in that?

55
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,250
People were scared!

56
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,750
Boy, were they ever.
So scared they were "wailin."

57
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,916
The water's so cold!

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,625
Well, maybe this
will warm you up!

59
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,166
Take that! And that!

60
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,166
Stop it!

61
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,708
Man, if I could
be a fly on the wall.

62
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,125
You think so?

63
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,541
Does a whale crap in the--

64
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,791
Yeah, hello?

65
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,500
This is strange. You don't
sound anything like Haruna.

66
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,833
Haruna?

67
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,625
Wait a sec, you're not
the Head Teacher, are you?

68
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,916
Yes, I am. And you are?

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,541
Oh, my name's Ayumu.

70
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,916
I've taken Haruna's place
as a Magical Garment Girl.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,458
But that doesn't make any sense,
you're not a girl, are you?

72
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,500
I've learned it's
best to just go with it,

73
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,333
no matter how ridiculous
the premise might sound.

74
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,958
Do you want
to talk to her?

75
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,166
Actually, I think she's a
bit preoccupied at the moment.

76
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
If you'd like, I'd be
happy to take a message.

77
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,083
Uh. Yeah, sure,
that would be just fine.

78
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,583
Tell her I no longer
need the Kyo-Tofu.

79
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,333
Kyo-tofu?

80
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,625
Yes. That's the original
errand I sent her on.

81
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,541
Apparently, she's not
having any luck finding it.

82
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,083
But that's okay. I've decided
to go ahead and give up on it.

83
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,166
I know this probably
isn't any of my business,

84
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,583
but is this tofu the item Haruna
was referring to by chance?

85
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,750
Yep. That's the one.

86
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,416
Well, isn't that typical?
It's "tofu", not "toe jam".

87
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,958
She mixed them up.

88
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:51,083
I just love the tofu from Kyoto.
It's the best I've ever had!

89
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,583
Well, in that case, I might
be able to find some for you.

90
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,916
Aww. Thank you so much!

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,250
No problem, I know a few people
who can help out with that.

92
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,833
But why would she come to Tokyo

93
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,791
if you wanted tofu from Kyoto?

94
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,916
Wait, what are
you talking about?

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,166
Are you saying that
you're not in Kyoto?

96
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,708
I specifically ordered Haruna

97
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,166
to go to Kyoto
to buy me some tofu.

98
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,958
So. You told her to
go to Kyoto to get tofu,

99
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,958
but she ended
up in Tokyo instead?

100
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,041
Yes! They really know
how to make it in Kyoto.

101
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,166
I guess they don't sell
Kyoto style Kyo-tofu in Tokyo?

102
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,416
Well no, cause if it were Tokyo
tofu it would be called to-tofu.

103
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,083
That's pretty confusing, huh?

104
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,333
I got an idea. If you can
get through to my cell phone,

105
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,250
maybe you could contact a
delivery service directly

106
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,458
and place an order.

107
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,250
That's a great idea.
But there's a problem.

108
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,291
See, the thing is,
I've already maxed out

109
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,333
my credit cards
buying Kyo-tofu,

110
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,250
so my order
probably won't process.

111
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,791
Wow, so this is who's in
charge of Haruna's school?

112
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,166
No wonder she's lost.

113
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,416
Unbelievable.

114
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,166
How could she get
Tokyo and Kyoto confused?

115
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,166
Hard to believe for someone
who claims to be a genius.

116
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,208
Oh when it comes
to magic, she is.

117
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,500
But there is one thing
that's holding her back.

118
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah, what's that?

119
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,041
She has a hard time remembering
the names of things and people.

120
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,375
Sounds about right.

121
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,166
That's never
been her strong suit.

122
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,875
She can be a
little self centered,

123
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,291
if you know what I mean.

124
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,541
So she doesn't put forth
the effort in that way.

125
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,916
Oh! Although recently,
something unexpected happened.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,916
She remembered the
name of one person,

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,041
which was very surprising.

128
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,291
Hey, Ayumu!

129
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,458
Hang up and break
out the ice cream!

130
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Haruna! I thought we
talked about this earlier!

131
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,583
Put on some clothes right now.

132
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,375
Your Head Teacher's
on the phone.

133
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,666
Oh. Uh. I'm busy!

134
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,166
What should I
tell her you're doing?

135
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,666
Geez, just tell her I'm
not available, you dumbass!

136
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,791
Well, you must
have a very special type

137
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,791
of magic, Mr. Aikawa.

138
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,041
Very special indeed.

139
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,166
Haruna!

140
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,833
Hey!

141
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,250
Uh ma'am. Can she call you back?

142
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,583
She's kinda busy.
Hello? What the?

143
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,833
Hi. Ayumu, here.

144
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
Hey! It's Kyoko.

145
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,583
Hey there. Wow, talk about
crazy perfect timing,

146
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,916
I was actually just
about to give you a call.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,375
Are you serious?

148
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,541
I just called to hear the
sound of your voice.

149
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,333
Oh, you don't mean that!

150
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,750
Why were you gonna call me?

151
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,958
Did you need something?

152
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,958
Well, it's something you said.

153
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,750
You mentioned your grandfather
lives in Kyoto, right?

154
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,250
I might need a little favor.

155
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,041
Wait, you've been
discharged? That's amazing!

156
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,583
Okay. It's a date.
If you wanna meet up tomorrow

157
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,416
at that place
I was talking about,

158
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,166
I'll be there with bells on!

159
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,625
While the sun is up, a zombie's
mental and physical strength

160
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,125
is about the same
as a three year old's,

161
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,750
which can make the school
day pretty unbearable for me.

162
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,125
Miserable as I was,
melting in the oppressive sun,

163
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,083
just thinking about
getting to see Kyoko

164
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,916
helped me to get
through the day.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,750
It's strange to think that a
single thought of one person

166
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,166
can give you the
strength to go on.

167
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,333
Kyoko's a good sport.
Not every girl would say yes

168
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,500
to hanging out
in a place like this.

169
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,833
Eu sure didn't seem
happy to see me go.

170
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,666
Great dinner!

171
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,750
Just leave everything
in the kitchen for me.

172
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,583
I'll wash it all later.

173
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,083
Please don't go,
you can wash me now!

174
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,208
I promise you,
I'll be home soon.

175
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,625
Please, I need my
big strong stud. Don't go!

176
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,958
Aww, you won't
even know I'm gone.

177
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,083
Hey, Haruna.

178
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,666
I'm gonna go out
and pick up the Kyo-tofu

179
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,166
your Head Teacher asked for.

180
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,958
You feel like
tagging along with me?

181
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,041
I'm not your tagalong.

182
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,958
I thought you were staying home.

183
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,208
Looks like somebody
changed their mind, huh?

184
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,125
I'm not coming with you.

185
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,958
I'm just going to the corner
store so mind your own business!

186
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,750
I swear, I'll never
understand these girls.

187
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,875
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

188
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,791
That Haruna, she's a
stubborn one all right.

189
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,750
Who are you talking to?

190
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,666
Oh, here! It's the
tofu you asked me for.

191
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,041
Thanks a lot.

192
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,333
Sorry to ask you to
meet me in a place like this.

193
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,791
You're not scared, are you?

194
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,583
I'm not scared at all.

195
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:38,208
Well, as long as you're
here with me, I feel safe.

196
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,083
Wait! How much money
do I owe you, anyway?

197
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,083
I'm sure this
tofu wasn't cheap.

198
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,291
Please, it's my treat, I insist.

199
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,625
That's so nice, but you
don't have to do that.

200
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,500
It's fine. I'm just so
glad that out of everyone

201
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,166
you could've asked,
you decided to call me.

202
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,416
Geez, I'm super jealous of

203
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
whoever your girlfriend is,
she's a lucky lady.

204
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,291
I don't have one. Yet.

205
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,583
Well, in that case. Is it
okay if I nominate myself?

206
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,791
Ayumu? You know how I said

207
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,333
you didn't have
to pay for the tofu?

208
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,458
There is one way you can pay
me back, if you don't mind.

209
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,791
There's only one thing
I really ever wanted from you.

210
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,541
Oh yeah? What's that?

211
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
One little thing.

212
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,000
Tell me.

213
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,666
I want you to die!

214
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,041
No. But, why?

215
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,833
Oh, yeah. Killing you
tonight may be even more

216
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,833
of a rush than the last time!
I wonder how many times

217
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,875
I'll have to stab
you before you die?

218
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,583
Kyoko? Just who
in the hell are you?

219
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,625
You already know
the answer to that.

220
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,291
I'm one of Orito's
childhood friends, remember?

221
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,375
Bullshit! I know
that's not true!

222
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,541
Ha! No, it's not!

223
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,625
So when you said you were a
victim of the serial killer,

224
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,916
that was just a lie!
This whole thing is one big lie.

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,291
You were the one
doing the killing

226
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,791
this entire time weren't you?

227
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,125
Yes, it's true.
In my line of work,

228
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,250
little white lies are required.

229
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,541
I don't believe it.
You killed your family.

230
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,791
How could you do that?

231
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,708
They weren't my family,
they were strangers.

232
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,625
I just manipulated
their memories

233
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,208
so I could get
close to them, that's all.

234
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,916
Like your friend Orito.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No. No way.

236
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,958
The only kinda person who could
do something like that is...

237
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,666
You're getting awfully close
to the answer, aren't you?

238
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,666
Nomobuyo.

239
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,833
My god. She is.

240
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:47,833
Oshi. Hashitawa. Dokeda.

241
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,958
Gunmiicha. De Ribura!

242
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,791
You finally
understand, don't you?

243
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,625
It's just as I thought.
You're one, too!

244
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,791
Apparently, memory manipulation
doesn't work on you.

245
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,750
Now why could that be?

246
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,791
But then, it doesn't
matter, does it?

247
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,958
Because one way or another,
you are going to die, Ayumu.

248
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,541
Eliminating you
will solve everything.

249
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,000
Time to meet your end!

250
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,750
What is wrong with you?
I've killed you twice,

251
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,208
so why won't you
just give up and die!

252
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,708
I can't have you snooping
around making trouble!

253
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,083
Man, she's good!

254
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
I was collecting
souls so efficiently

255
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,750
before you showed up.

256
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,833
Not to mention that dog Megalo
throwing a wrench in my plan!

257
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,375
You're the one who killed
Kerberos too? You psycho!

258
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,458
Don't you understand?
I'm behind everything!

259
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,791
Can't. Move.

260
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,125
I've got you right
where I want you now.

261
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,041
It's nothing short
of laughable that you'd try

262
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,375
to fight me with your
puny magical abilities.

263
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,875
Come on, quit draggin'
your undead ass Ayumu.

264
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,000
Did you go and get
the toe jam or what?

265
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,125
Forget about the tofu!

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,250
I can only assume you
acted like a pervert again

267
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,500
and now this innocent
young girl wants payback.

268
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,500
Right maggot?

269
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,791
I'm so glad to see you that

270
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,375
I don't even
mind being called that!

271
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,416
Well, aren't you gonna
say something back?

272
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,333
What the heck are you doing
out here, playing freeze tag?

273
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,000
You're such an idiot!

274
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,875
Oh, a magic barrier.
In that case, here!

275
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,166
I can move again.

276
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,000
How could you let this happen?

277
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,541
You're a Magical
Garment Girl, aren't you?

278
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,083
Now I understand.

279
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
Well, that explains why the
memory manipulation technique

280
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,000
didn't work on him.

281
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,458
Who the hell is this chick?

282
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,375
Kyoko, the Magical
Garment Girl who killed me.

283
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,833
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

284
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,583
In that case,
let's kick her ass!

285
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,458
It's been long time, Haruna.

286
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,458
I don't know you, you skank!

287
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,958
I'm surprised you finally
learned to dispel barriers,

288
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,875
considering you were held back!

289
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,125
If you understand the
theory behind raising barriers,

290
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,416
it applies to the theory
of cancelling them, too.

291
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,833
I'm a genius, you know?

292
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,541
I think you're nothing
more than a pain in the ass.

293
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,791
Lady Hellscythe
had a feeling that

294
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,333
you may be in over your head.

295
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,375
Our enemy is a human. Right?

296
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,750
She's no human.

297
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,208
She's just a monster in
human clothing, that's all.

298
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,791
Oh, is that so?
That's very unlucky for her.

299
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,000
It appears there are even
more assassins in this city

300
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,708
than there are in
the village I come from.

301
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,375
Wow, look at those eyes.

302
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,208
Apparently, the two
of us aren't so different!

303
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,791
Does that mean she's like you?

304
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,208
No. She isn't a vampire ninja.

305
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,750
But I do sense
another power in her.

306
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,458
Three against one, huh?

307
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,833
That doesn't seem
very fair, now does it?

308
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,041
You stabbed me in the back,
you think that was very fair?

309
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,166
Now!

310
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,583
Swallow-Return Strike!

311
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,125
Oh, that's not really all you've
got, is it?

312
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,750
Now that you've shown
me yours, let me show you mine!

313
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,291
Sera!

314
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,583
Take this!

315
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,208
Just because you're a Zombie

316
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,625
doesn't mean
you're flame retarded!

317
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,750
I have much more than
fire at my command.

318
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,375
What's wrong?

319
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,791
My magic. It's gone.
Man this sucks!

320
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,416
I don't get it. Her power
is as strong as a Megalo's!

321
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,666
It looks like the odds
are a little more even now.

322
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,500
Oh? I wouldn't count on that.

323
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,583
Sera? You sure you're okay?

324
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,166
Yes. But I think it's time for
you to transform, don't you?

325
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,833
The way things are now,
we don't stand a chance.

326
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,875
Aww, man. Do I have to?

327
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
There's no time to argue,
now put on your girl clothes.

328
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,000
Hurry, you little worm!

329
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
I'm sorry I called
you a little worm.

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,666
I meant to call
you a lowly maggot.

331
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,000
Was that
clarification necessary?

332
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,166
Go!

333
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,333
I was really hoping
when I avenged my own death

334
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,666
I wouldn't have to
dress like a little girl.

335
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,916
But I guess I have no choice!

336
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,125
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

337
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:31,375
Dokeda. Gunmiicha. De Ribura!

338
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,208
Each time I see you like that,
a piece of my soul dies.

339
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,416
Yep. You look like a pervert.

340
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,333
There is nothing in
this world more revolting

341
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,708
than a zombie
transvestite! You freak!

342
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,208
I've learned this much:

343
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,291
at times, words can
cut as deep as blades.

344
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,791
Oh, you think so?

345
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,833
Well then, how about I put
your little theory to the test!

346
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,625
Before this is over, there's
something I have to know.

347
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,166
Why did you decide
to kill all those people?

348
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,916
Just answer me this, Ayumu.

349
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,541
If you found out
you'd gain eternal life

350
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,500
by killing other people,
you'd do it too, wouldn't you?

351
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,958
Don't be ridiculous!

352
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,750
If you think I'd want that,
you don't know me at all!

353
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,333
Now, to finish you off.

354
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,333
Would you rather I slice
you up into a million pieces

355
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,375
or burn you to death?
Take your pick.

356
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,208
Or would you prefer I
grind your body into dust

357
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,541
so you can never come back?

358
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,583
I choose none of the above!

359
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,708
Let go!

360
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,916
No way. Not gonna happen!

361
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,083
Whoa, look at that.
Ayumu's glowing.

362
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,416
He's really glowing!

363
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,291
Get your hands off me
right now you pervert!

364
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,708
Well this pervert's got
something long and hard for ya!

365
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,500
Swallow-Return Strike!

366
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,125
I'd say the odds were
stacked against you all along.

367
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,500
Looks like it's finally over.

368
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,833
Yeah.

369
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,250
You know, for a big
ol' pervert, I gotta admit,

370
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,375
you look surprisingly
good in that dress.

371
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,500
That's a compliment,
right? What the?

372
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,833
Did you really
believe that you were

373
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,333
the only immortal
one around here?

374
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,291
Oh crap, you're a zombie too?

375
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,708
Oh no, I'm not a zombie.

376
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,958
But I have ten lives left
before I'll actually die.

377
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,166
This time, you're gonna burn
and there'll be no coming back!

378
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,125
So, you've finally
come, have you?

379
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,500
I've been expecting you.
Welcome to the party.

380
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,916
Oh, Ayumu.

381
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I really can't thank you enough
for taking care of Haruna.

382
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:57,875
Can you take her back?

383
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,083
She's way too much of a handful!

384
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,208
No I'd say she's
less than a handful.

385
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,458
Anyway, about that tofu.

386
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,875
I'm in over my
head here, lady!

387
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,250
We've never had a Magical
Garment Girl boy before.

388
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,875
You're quite the trailblazer!
