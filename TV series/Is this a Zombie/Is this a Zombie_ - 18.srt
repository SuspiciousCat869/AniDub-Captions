1
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm counting on you to keep
things relatively decent

2
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,125
around here while I'm gone to
the village, is that understood?

3
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,208
And by decent you mean?

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,500
Just keep an eye on the maggot

5
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,500
so he doesn't try
to violate Lady Hellscythe.

6
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,833
You think you're up for that?

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:47,708
Say no more!

8
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,166
I've got this one.

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,041
Don't worry: if he so much
as looks at her wrong,

10
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,750
I'll clobber him!

11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,916
Spoken like
a protective big sister.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,375
Big sister?

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,666
Oh, I like the sound of that!

14
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,291
Underworld necromancer
Eucliwood Hellsythe

15
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,708
experiences a mysterious
reversal of fortune.

16
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,666
Will the peace and tranquility
of Ayumu's impromptu family

17
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,583
be forever shattered?

18
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,708
I was supposed to work
a double shift today.

19
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,625
Why they gotta call us back
for costume measurements?

20
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,916
I mean, is something
goin' down?

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm sure the village elders know
exactly what they're doing,

22
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,791
whatever it is.

23
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,500
Probably ties in to all the
"incidents" popping up lately.

24
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,958
Sounds mysterious.

25
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,333
Will you please hold still?

26
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,416
Wha-- Ow!

27
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,333
I'm not squirmin'
around that much!

28
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,583
One of the most crucial
aspects of a vampire ninja's

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
battle prowess is
freedom of movement.

30
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:29,500
To anyone here who's
gone up a dress size lately,

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,958
know that fat is the enemy!

32
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,375
Ma'am!

33
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,541
And now to
the business at hand.

34
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,166
Okay, this sucks.

35
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:47,125
How can things be this much
more chaotic with Sera gone?

36
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,916
It's like the sun's
moved closer to the earth;

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
I can't even go out
for groceries.

38
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,541
We've gotta have some kinda
food squirreled away.

39
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,166
Yo, Haruna.

40
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,500
Can you hit up the--

41
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:06,958
Sorry.

42
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:07,666
Busy.

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
Better luck next time.

44
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,250
Yeah, don't work
too hard or anything.

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,583
I've never seen someone peel
a tangerine so thoroughly.

46
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,041
Don't mind if I do.

47
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,125
Thank you.

48
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,583
That's really good.

49
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,666
I peeled these for you.

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,458
My lover shall eat no rind.

51
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,291
Only fruity sweetness!

52
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,875
Enjoy!

53
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,250
You want every single bite to be
an explosion of citrusy goodness

54
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,333
in my mouth, don't you?

55
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,583
Sorry what?

56
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,291
Fret not, sweet prince.

57
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,041
I'm fine.

58
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,416
'Tis nothing at all.

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,125
I love it when you talk
all fantasy damsel-like.

60
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,375
Uh, Eu?

61
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,416
Hallway's spotless.

62
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,791
You're welcome.

63
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,166
Hey.

64
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,833
Let me check out your
forehead for a sec--Oh crap!

65
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't you touch her!

66
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,208
She's totally burning up!

67
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,083
Haruna!

68
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,500
Bring me some ice!

69
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,791
You got it!

70
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,125
And maybe try not
to kill yourself?

71
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,916
Shut your ugly face!

72
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,708
I've got to get her
out of this outfit

73
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,791
before the sweat
makes her worse.

74
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,500
Easy, tiger.

75
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,708
You're about to casually
break a major taboo here.

76
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,083
Oh my darling.

77
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,291
I'm so vulnerable.

78
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,666
Pull it together, dude.

79
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,958
This is driven by necessity;

80
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,916
there's no reason
to get uptight.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,041
If you don't do something,

82
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,708
the sweat's going
to give her a chill.

83
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,541
And you can't wait
on Haruna to get back.

84
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
There's no other option;

85
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,166
you're just gonna have
to be a man and do this.

86
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,000
And by "be a man,"
I don't mean "be a man,"

87
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,250
so don't even go there, okay?

88
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,083
This is strictly clinical!

89
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,375
I will see no evil.

90
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,208
I will touch no evil.

91
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,416
We've made contact!

92
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
Calm down, perv.

93
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,041
It's not about her-- 

94
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,750
To enter the valley of wisdom,

95
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,083
I must first come over the
mountains-- What am I saying?

96
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,000
'Kay, it can't be good
that this is wobbly!

97
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,541
Uh.

98
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,458
This is awkward.

99
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,708
Be gentle with me, love.

100
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,375
I'm delicate.

101
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm so sorry!

102
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,666
I didn't mean to hurt you!

103
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,750
What?

104
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,916
How did you?

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,166
You're over there?

106
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,125
Okay.

107
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,750
Think I'm at the shoulders.

108
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,375
Least I hope
that's what they are.

109
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,750
Weird.

110
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,916
Shouldn't I be in the
neighborhood of a pilot wire

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,166
or whatever those
things are called?

112
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:20,875
Oh god!

113
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,166
She's not wearing a bra!

114
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,583
Please darling,
I'm so terribly cold.

115
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:30,000
Won't you kindly warm me
with your strong, manly touch?

116
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,708
Step aside!

117
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,500
High IQ to the rescue!

118
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,458
You dirty pervert!

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,666
Only you would try to
take advantage of a sick girl!

120
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,625
I was trying to be good.

121
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,041
Think you can
stomach some porridge?

122
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,083
Well then, let me just whip
some up for you, patient zero.

123
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,083
I hope you like it
made with eggs!

124
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,750
Try to relax.

125
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,166
You know Haruna.

126
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,500
She'll have it ready and down
your gullet in no time.

127
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,041
Yeah, no kidding, right?

128
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,458
I'm a little bit
jealous of you right now.

129
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,625
Spoken like a
protective big sister.

130
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,166
I'm starting to think maybe
we should call a doctor.

131
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,875
Well, except she's
an underworlder.

132
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,541
I'm not too sure what
a doctor would make of that.

133
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,791
Wait, that's it.

134
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,375
An underworlder!

135
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,791
Of course!

136
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,958
Shimomura?

137
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,041
Yeah, it's me.

138
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,625
Do you have a minute?

139
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,416
Absolutely.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,458
What can I do for you?

141
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,916
Well, Eu's got a fever.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Really?

143
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,291
Do you think it's okay if I take
her to, like, a regular doctor?

144
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,833
I'm not sure how this works.

145
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,166
I doubt a "regular doctor"

146
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,416
would have the first clue
about what to look for.

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,541
Underworlder
pathology is unique.

148
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,541
Scratch that, then.

149
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,458
Still, is there anything
we can do for her?

150
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,083
'Cause I got to tell you, man.

151
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,416
She's not lookin' so good.

152
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,125
Exactly how far
are you prepared to go?

153
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,750
You willing to
swallow your pride?

154
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,708
Hell yeah!

155
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,625
Whatever it takes, I'm there!

156
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,250
All right.

157
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
The last time I got sick, the
only thing that broke my fever

158
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,875
was a friend's yodeling.

159
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,041
Do what?

160
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,958
Deep breath; you'll need it.

161
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,791
Good.

162
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,208
Now do some sidewinders and
strip down to your undies.

163
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,583
How's me being
half naked gonna help her?

164
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,500
Come on, man!

165
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,583
Step up the intensity!

166
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,958
Forget you're inhibitions!

167
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
How am I doin', Eu?

168
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
You feeling any better yet?

169
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,958
Please say yes.

170
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,833
Dude, I'm giving all I've got
and she's still looks like hell!

171
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,708
What gives?

172
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,291
You're doing fine; keep at it.

173
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,416
Now get on all fours and blow
on her while shaking your butt.

174
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,541
Are you serious?

175
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,958
As a heart attack, my friend.

176
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,083
Do it!

177
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,916
Egg porridge on the--

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,333
You--

179
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,875
You, boney-assed bacon wrapped
hedgehog molestallion!

180
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,166
For the record,
I'm worried about her, too,

181
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,416
and you don't see me ripping my
clothes off and trying to shove

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,875
my tongue down her throat!

183
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,708
I should've made
the porridge out of you!

184
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,041
But he told me that it was
the only way to help her.

185
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,375
Sorry.

186
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,958
He was acting so valiant I had
to see how far I could take it.

187
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,375
You sneaky son of a--

188
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,291
Relax.

189
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,791
It helped more than you know.

190
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,291
Think about it.

191
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
In her shoes, how awesome
would it be to know your friend

192
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,541
is willing to make himself
look like a complete jackass

193
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,791
on the off chance
it'd break your fever?

194
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,458
That's strong medicine,
believe me.

195
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,750
I guess you're right.

196
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,625
A little R &amp; R will
take care of the rest.

197
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,083
Tomorrow morning
she'll be good as new.

198
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,041
Got it.

199
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,166
Thanks.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,666
Here.

201
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,208
Have some grub.

202
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,833
Sleeping like a baby.

203
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,125
Good.

204
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,166
I'm glad she's on the mend.

205
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,916
Makes me feel better.

206
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,375
Huh?

207
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,916
What the--?

208
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,583
What are you doing?

209
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,625
Doctor's orders
are to stay in bed!

210
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,041
Not gonna lie.

211
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,500
This is, um, uncomfortable.

212
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,000
How is it she's lived under the
same roof with me for so long

213
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,500
and this is the closest
we've ever been?

214
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:38,500
Oh man, the sound of her
breathing is so-- I dunno, hot?

215
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,125
Settle down.

216
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,083
She's sick.

217
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,416
Girl needs rest.

218
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,791
Hey, perv?

219
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,500
Damn it!

220
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,416
I mean, hey!

221
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,083
How's it goin'?

222
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,625
What do you need?

223
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,125
Unless you know where she is,
Neckwear-mancer's gone MIA.

224
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,541
And after all the trouble I went
through getting it for her.

225
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,416
Uh.

226
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,791
Trouble getting what, exactly?

227
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,750
You have no idea what a pain
in the ass these things

228
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,916
are to come by.

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,833
Don't fight it, pipsqueak!

230
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,500
So, is that s'posed to help?

231
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,875
I mean, good for you.

232
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,458
It just looks like he could
use a little tenderness.

233
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,833
Yeah.

234
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,625
It is standard practice
to let them get comfortable.

235
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,708
It's a nice thought.

236
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,916
But Eu is an Underworlder,
you know.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,750
Duh.

238
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,083
That's why I got her these.

239
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,125
You know, so her hands
don't get all frostbitten,

240
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:24,833
or whatever.

241
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,458
So considerate.

242
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,333
Wow.

243
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,500
Kinda out of character for you.

244
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,958
Who'd have guessed
you'd go so far to nurse

245
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,625
a rival back to health?

246
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,416
Please!

247
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,791
As if I'm such a hard-ass.

248
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm the surrogate big sister,

249
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,041
so it's my job
to nurse her back to health!

250
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,583
'Sides, I'm following
Sera's orders,

251
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,041
so don't get the wrong idea.

252
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,875
This isn't a lesbian thing!

253
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,916
There may just be hope
for you yet, Madam Curie.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,666
Just shut up you!

255
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,833
Look, just give the mittens

256
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,583
or whatever they are
to me for right now.

257
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,541
Please don't eviscerate me!

258
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,916
Oh good.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,500
I was kinda starting
to get worried.

260
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,875
You're not pissed?

261
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,958
Special circumstances.

262
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,250
At the moment, she needs
you more than I do.

263
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,041
Now.

264
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,291
Try any funny stuff on her

265
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,666
and I wrench your brain
out through your nose.

266
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,083
I'm not gonna try anything!

267
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,250
Why do you have to treat me

268
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,541
like I keep rufi's
in my dresser drawer?

269
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,958
Because you're a rubber duckie
floating in a tub of temptation!

270
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,083
Here!

271
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,666
Stay with her
till she gets better.

272
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,750
Only till she gets better.

273
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,583
It's cool.

274
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,250
I got this.

275
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
Sleep tight, Eu.

276
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,166
'Kay, freezing my ass off!

277
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,625
FYI, I don't even
feel bad that that's hot.

278
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,125
Ah.

279
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,083
Morning, nurse.

280
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,583
Is there a reason you're here?

281
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,958
I just stopped by
to check on Eucliwood.

282
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,916
Oh right.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,458
So where-- 

284
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,458
There you are.

285
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,125
You okay?

286
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,791
Never better, my darling,

287
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,375
and I owe it all to last night's
tender loving kindness.

288
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,583
I'm a little concerned

289
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,916
she's not quite back up
to par this morning.

290
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,500
I need to reconsider
my diagnosis.

291
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,500
Pardon me for a moment,
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,125
That's decidedly not good.

293
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:33,666
What is it?

294
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,916
What's wrong?

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,916
Orange welts,
arranged in a floral pattern.

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,125
Oh no.

297
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,416
Has Eucliwood been
force-fed tangerine peels?

298
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,791
I don't treat her
like a garbage disposal!

299
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,500
Relax.

300
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,833
I'm messing with you.

301
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,833
Just tell me you've
been peeling them well.

302
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,500
Even the smallest amount of
tangerine pith is poisonous

303
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,041
to an underworlder.

304
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,041
Uh.

305
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,666
Now that you mention it.

306
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,291
Nah.

307
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,875
She picked the
stuff off like a bird.

308
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,250
Perhaps, but there was bound to
have been a piece here or there

309
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,583
that she missed.

310
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,208
Chances are she ate
some without knowing it.

311
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,000
That's the culprit.

312
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,166
We haven't had anything else
to eat for days.

313
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,750
Oh yeah.

314
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,625
When an Underworlder eats fruit
that they're not supposed to,

315
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,625
they break out in a fever, an
icky rash, the whole nine yards.

316
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,875
Yep.

317
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,125
See, just about every
fruit is questionable.

318
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,916
Think Adam and Eve
in the Garden of Eden.

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,250
Okay, so tangerine pith is bad.

320
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,083
How do we knock
this crap out of her?

321
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,833
No idea.

322
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,791
What?

323
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Fear not.

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,750
I'm not above firing
in the dark here.

325
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,916
Me neither.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,250
Let's avail ourselves
of Occam's Razor.

327
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:41,958
Ah!

328
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,583
Process of elimination!

329
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,833
Not happening, guys.

330
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,291
You can't use her
like a guinea pig.

331
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,083
But.

332
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,416
I'd like, if I may,

333
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,958
to pick up the conversation
where we left off.

334
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,875
About the, uh, well, thing.

335
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,375
Yeah.

336
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,750
Not even I can anticipate the
shape of its choosing when

337
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,916
the beast becomes manifest.

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,833
What it wants is unknown.

339
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,500
We have to stay sharp.

340
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,666
Keep the worm
under close scrutiny.

341
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,416
I will stay vigilant.

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,666
This stuff feels
like a milk bath!

343
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,875
Actually, it's
forbidden to swim here.

344
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,375
Huh?

345
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,583
I need to teach you how to
loosen up a little, Seraphim.

346
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,125
What is she doing?

347
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,041
How 'bout this?

348
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,541
Drinking tea while turning
the cup counterclockwise.

349
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,458
Dude, seriously, that
wouldn't cure indigestion.

350
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,791
That's not right.

351
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,333
If you don't do it while patting
your stomach with your leg

352
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,375
in the air and a crown of
seaweed cocked to one side,

353
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,875
you might as well be
chugging vegetable oil.

354
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,083
Are you out of your mind?

355
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,375
That's the most random
assortment of wrong

356
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,916
I've ever heard!

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,458
Wait, I think she may be on
to something with the seaweed.

358
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,583
Fine!

359
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,125
You freaks do
whatever you want!

360
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,666
Don't come crying to me when
they make you snort cinnamon!

361
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,333
Oh god.

362
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,333
What have I done?

363
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,541
Condition unchanged.

364
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,291
Didn't there used to
be something about bathing

365
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,416
in warm soymilk with
bamboo in your mouth?

366
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Yes, yes!

367
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,666
And a jar of kosher salt
on your head!

368
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,458
And can't the toxins be flushed
out by putting old CDs wrapped

369
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,708
in spinach under your armpits?

370
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:29,750
Yeah.

371
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,333
That could work.

372
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,166
Damn it!

373
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,875
There are too many options!

374
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,875
Ah-ha!

375
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,250
I can't believe you're actually
starting to feel better.

376
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,375
So, what brand of mumbo-jumbo
you think finally did the trick?

377
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,208
Hey, as long as it worked
I couldn't care less which one.

378
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,000
Sera's gonna punch me into next
week when she sees this mess.

379
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,583
I'm gonna have to clean.

380
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,666
You contemplating how
crazy-fabulous it is to have

381
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,541
a genius around the house?

382
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,791
Uh-oh.

383
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,750
Looks like your cheeks
might be a little flush.

384
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,541
Huh?

385
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,416
What're you talking about?

386
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,458
Gimme you forehead for a sec.

387
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,875
She's burning up.

388
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,541
Was Eu's stuff contagious?

389
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,458
It's a disease specific
to Underworlders, I'm afraid.

390
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,041
So, uh-- 

391
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,083
Think you're
coming down with the flu.

392
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,333
The flu does not
dare attack geniuses!

393
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,791
Well, if there's fine line
between genius and madness,

394
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,833
why not illness?

395
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,125
What the hell does that mean?

396
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,375
Tell me that
I'm gonna make it.

397
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,125
For the record,
I'm worried about her, too!

398
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,083
It's okay.

399
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,583
You'll be fine.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,625
Ugh!

401
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,708
Don't you even, start!

402
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,791
I am nobody's big sister!

403
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm going to lay out
the futon, okay?

404
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,708
You don't have to treat me
like I've got polio!

405
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,541
Look, you're independent.

406
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,291
I get it.

407
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,583
Give it a rest.

408
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,583
Stay with her
till she gets better.

409
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,291
Only till she gets better.

410
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,416
You cuddled up next
to her because

411
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,125
you needed to feel secure.

412
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,625
I'm not blind.

413
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,041
I just didn't
see it at the time.

414
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,375
What can I say?

415
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,541
People surprise me
every now and then.

416
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,125
I can take my own clothes off,
thank you very much!

417
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,958
Thing is, I get not wanting
to be a burden on people.

418
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,791
But friends want
to be friends, you know?

419
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,500
Please.

420
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,916
This is so ridiculous.

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,125
Look, if you wear that
you're gonna sweat like a pig

422
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,791
and freeze your butt off.

423
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,625
I'm back, people.

424
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,083
Take 'em off!

425
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,541
C'mon!

426
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:03,875
You repulsive swag-bellied
tentacle-monster discharge!

427
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,041
Homeward-bound.

428
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,791
Mama Bird's Return
Strike Pervert Kick!

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,041
You're lucky I don't
grind your grapes to dust!

430
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,416
It's good to have you back.

431
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,958
Glad you're home safe, Sera.

432
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,958
Hey, Ayumu!

433
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,125
Step it up, bitch boy!

434
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,250
My porridge isn't going
to prepare itself!

435
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,166
If it's porridge you want,
allow me to make it.

436
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,375
With my special ingredient.

437
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,875
Wrinkly homunculus!

438
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,375
Those are very
hard to come by.

439
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,250
Well done.

440
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,958
A classic Villiers cure-all.

441
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,750
However, he has
to be sterilized.

442
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,708
Stand back!

443
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,375
I feel for you, pal.

444
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,750
I really do.

445
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,500
I've made a special batch of
porridge for my dashing prince!

446
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,750
Don't forget to let it
cool a little bit first.

447
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,791
Oo, I wanna help get it cool!

448
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,541
And blow!

449
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,791
Huh.

450
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,833
This is taking
a lot longer than I thought.

451
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,458
Hey.

452
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,625
It's Actual Eu!

453
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,125
You need me, too?

454
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,208
We're almost there!

455
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,958
Just a little more;
I can feel it!

456
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,791
This porridge will be like
banana pudding when we're done!
