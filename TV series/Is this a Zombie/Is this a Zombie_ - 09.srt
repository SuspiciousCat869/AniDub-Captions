1
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,750
So tell me?

2
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,125
Have you missed me as
much as I've missed you?

3
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,958
Guess that's a "no." My,
you're worked up, aren't you?

4
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,208
From the look in your eyes,

5
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,916
I presume that you're
wondering why I'm here.

6
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,375
I saw how much you were
enjoying yourself today.

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,625
Good times with all your
little friends left you

8
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:12,875
feeling so happy and content
and like "one of the gang."

9
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,583
That's exactly why
I appeared when I did.

10
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,708
In the midst of all
that sweetness, I show up,

11
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,541
the person you
least want to see.

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,875
Now we've finally been
reunited, let's get caught up.

13
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,125
There's so much to say.

14
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,208
I hope I'm mistaken.
But my superiors may have

15
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,000
grown weary with my lack of
progress with Lady Hellscythe.

16
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,458
What do you mean?

17
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,833
I'm under orders to kill her,
but I've thus far failed

18
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,291
to carry out that command.

19
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,791
The hell? What are
you talking about?!

20
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,083
You said you came here to
take her back to your village!

21
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,750
Why the hell would
they order you to kill her?

22
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,041
It doesn't make sense!

23
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,666
Have you just been
lying to us the whole time

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,833
we've been living under
the same roof? Answer me!

25
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
Why, yes I do.
I put my trust in you

26
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,125
but then look what happened to
me. You can make it up, however,

27
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,583
by simply agreeing to grant
the fondest wish that I have.

28
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,291
You're still angry.

29
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,625
I imagine the fact that

30
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,166
I killed the Seventh Abyss
would be a sore spot.

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,458
Because when you
found out, you said, "begone."

32
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,500
A hurtful, and in
your case, powerful word.

33
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,250
I did disappear at the time.

34
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,750
But of course,
I wasn't exterminated.

35
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,791
Oh, no. I will remain in this
world until my wish is granted.

36
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:18,708
I'll tell you, but first...
I have to admit I'm amazed.

37
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,041
Seeing you living in
a world such as this one

38
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
is an enormous surprise.

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,041
But even more stunning
is that you've made friends.

40
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,458
And I'm going to use them to get
the wish that I want fulfilled.

41
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
My superiors believe
that megalos are attracted

42
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,958
to Lady Hellscythe's
magical powers,

43
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,750
therefore, the recent
increase in attacks

44
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,083
and the order to
assassinate her.

45
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,250
No way. They really
want you to kill her?

46
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,541
What is wrong with you! How
could you be so cold-blooded?

47
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,166
It isn't as simple as you think!

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,250
You're really going to kill her?

49
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,791
Knowing how duty-bound
I am, do you have to ask?

50
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,958
Then it is as simple as I think!

51
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,583
I am a ninja, after all!

52
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,625
So what if you are?

53
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,583
This is pointless.

54
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,958
I'll simply search for
Lady Hellscythe on my own.

55
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,791
No, wait a second! Why do
you vampire ninjas always have

56
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,416
to be so damned
inflexible all the time?

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,083
This is wrong. Don't do it!

58
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,833
You don't
understand the importance

59
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,625
of a ninja's duty, maggot.

60
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,708
We always gotta
follow the rules!

61
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,583
That's the whole reason
we're married now, remember?

62
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,166
So you're saying her life
is less important than that?

63
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,583
It's not fair to put it
that way! To a vampire ninja...

64
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,791
Don't even try to
give me that crap!

65
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,958
All I wanna know is if
you really plan on killing her!

66
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,875
You know my dedication, so you
shouldn't have to ask me that!

67
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,875
No, that's not what
I wanna hear from you!

68
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,208
I wanna know if you're really
okay with killing your friend,

69
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,666
but I don't wanna hear
it from some vampire ninja.

70
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,458
I wanna hear it from you!

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,375
No, of course I'm
not okay with it!

72
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
So now what?

73
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,791
Hey, that's enough,
knock it off!

74
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,333
Instead of you two chuckleheads
wasting our time fighting,

75
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,708
shouldn't we be searching for
the neckwear-mancer instead?

76
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,916
Yeah, you're right.

77
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,541
Good, then let's go!

78
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,833
Yeah!

79
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,333
Sorry I called
you a liar earlier.

80
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,458
Save your weak apology.
Don't waste your breath.

81
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,583
Gee. Thanks a lot.

82
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,166
However. I now see
due to your counsel,

83
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,666
there are some duties
that are worth dismissing.

84
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,166
Glad to help.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,583
Now what say we
go find her, okay?

86
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,500
Hey, wait up, would ya?
We need to stick together!

87
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,666
How sweet.
They're searching for you.

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,625
I'm sure you'd
grant their wishes.

89
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,708
So why won't you grant mine?

90
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,125
Come here and take
a look at something.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,083
My treat, of course.

92
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,041
Please, let me show you the
friends who mean so much to you.

93
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,666
Come over here.

94
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,208
Now.

95
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,250
I'll give you a little
preview of what can happen

96
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,000
if you continue to deny my wish.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,166
What the!

98
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,958
Ayumu!

99
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,000
Say something!

100
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,833
How did this thing happen to
fall apart right here and now?

101
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,333
Was it just a coincidence?

102
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,875
Hey, are you alright?

103
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,041
Yeah.

104
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,291
But, your face,
it looks injured. Wait...

105
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,000
That's how it always looks.

106
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,250
They might have gotten lucky
that time, but before too long

107
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,125
something far more
serious will befall them.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,833
Losing control of your emotions?

109
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:28,916
Holy crap!

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,083
Is that a Megalo?

111
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,625
I don't know.

112
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,583
I thought those things wore
school uniforms for some reason!

113
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,916
It looks like the
neckwear-mancer's doll!

114
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,750
We gotta get outta here!

115
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,541
Haruna, no!

116
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,625
Why the hell are you
petting me? This is degrading!

117
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,250
Listen you overgrown jackass,
get your paws or whatever

118
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,500
and your big, fat,
yellow ass offa me right now

119
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,416
or I swear
you're gonna be sorry!

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,041
Here, take my hand.
I'll try to yank you out.

121
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,958
Move, let me try!

122
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
Hurry up, maggot!

123
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,708
It's crushing her!

124
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,458
We'll get you outta there,
I swear! Just hang on!

125
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,750
This isn't my doing.

126
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,208
You're the one who summoned
that thing, aren't you?

127
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,208
It's as clear as day,
isn't it, Eucliwood?

128
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,333
Whenever your heart stirs
with emotion, disaster follows.

129
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,333
That's why you swore
to speak no words

130
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,958
and keep your feelings buried
deep inside yourself, isn't it?

131
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,875
Of course it is.

132
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,416
'Cause after all,
you are someone with

133
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
the power to summon death.

134
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,958
I'm terribly sorry to
interrupt you while you're busy.

135
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,458
However...

136
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,916
Well, well, if it
isn't you again.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,625
You're that teacher
from the Matelly.

138
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,833
The Magic School
in Villiers, right?

139
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,750
Oh, my! You didn't mention
it the last time we met,

140
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
but you know who I am?

141
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes. Believe it or not,
stories about you

142
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,333
have even reached the
depths of the underworld.

143
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:22,833
Goodness gracious me!
What kinds of stories exactly?

144
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,541
That your powers are quite vast.

145
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh stop. You're
starting to embarrass me!

146
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,416
To what do I owe the
pleasure of your visit?

147
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,750
I won't let any of
my students come to harm,

148
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,708
and seeing that one
of them's in danger,

149
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm here to lend a helping hand.

150
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,958
Swallow-Return Strike!

151
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,500
Dammit!

152
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,916
My turn.

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,875
I'll give it three
hundred percent power!

154
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,583
Four hundred!
Five hundred! Six hundred!

155
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,583
Seven hundred percent!

156
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,375
Oh, crap!

157
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,333
Please stay with us, Haruna!

158
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,041
I've got an idea!

159
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,625
Huh? Wait.
What are you doing?

160
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,750
Draggin' this thing
off before it kills her!

161
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,875
Haruna!

162
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,666
Get off of her, you freak!

163
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,583
Guys! One of
you pull Haruna out

164
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,791
while the other one
pushes this thing back!

165
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,125
It's no use! It's not budging!

166
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,041
Don't give up!

167
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,083
Come on! Move! Move!

168
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,625
Get off of her now!

169
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,833
What the?

170
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,208
From that impressive
little demonstration,

171
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,791
I can see your
reputation is well-deserved.

172
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,958
That's very kind. But I
assure you I'm nothing special.

173
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,125
Oh, no. Tomonori! Are you okay?

174
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,750
Say something! Please!

175
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,958
Come on Mael Strom,
please get up!

176
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,625
Ya need some of my blood?

177
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,000
Irregularity detected in matrix.
Operation restrictions lifted.

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,791
What the hell just happened!

179
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,375
Rise and follow my command.

180
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,833
First incantation confirmed.
Operations released.

181
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,541
Tomonori, what are
you talking about?

182
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,708
I shall walk the path of life.

183
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,541
While thou shalt
walk the path of death.

184
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,625
Second incantation confirmed.

185
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,583
Chew them to bits, Manticore.

186
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,250
Final incantation confirmed.

187
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,875
That caused the blast?

188
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,583
That thing breathes fire?
I don't wanna get roasted!

189
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,666
Oh, dear me.

190
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,000
I guess Haruna
didn't have a reason

191
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,041
to bring it with her tonight.

192
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,791
Mystic weapon of saw and chain,

193
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,000
come here quickly
and bring the pain!

194
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,375
Mystletainn?

195
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,666
Huh? But how?

196
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,416
Who cares, just
hurry up and transform!

197
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,375
Swallow-Return Strike!
I bought you a chance!

198
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,666
Thank you, Sera!

199
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,041
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

200
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,250
Dokeda. Gunmiicha! Deh Ribura!

201
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,291
Unleash my hellish
heart upon the world.

202
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,000
First incantation confirmed.
Operations released.

203
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,583
May its flame turn
even the breath of gods

204
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,791
into a raging firestorm.

205
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,041
Second incantation confirmed.

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,291
Burn them all.
Absolute. Destruction.

207
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,250
Final incantation confirmed.

208
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,416
Oh, dear me, I think
it's gone out of control.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,458
You don't say?

210
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,500
Would that happen to be
your ultimate magic weapon

211
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
I learned about
by possessing Kyoko?

212
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,875
Why, yes, you are correct.
That is indeed it.

213
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,125
And I was hoping for
Ayumu to take control of it

214
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,416
because he's strong
enough to shut it off.

215
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
But it appears to
have taken control

216
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,833
of the vampire
ninja girl instead.

217
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't
have a power switch.

218
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,208
You see,

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,166
it's designed to normally
turn itself off automatically,

220
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,166
but if it happens to go
out of control like this,

221
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,791
there's a good chance
it'll blow itself up.

222
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,833
But I wouldn't
worry too much, dear.

223
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,791
And why is that?

224
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,250
Because Ayumu
is incredibly strong,

225
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,791
and I'm sure that he'll
come up with something.

226
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,458
He also has one of my
students down there with him.

227
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,166
Haruna's stronger than she
looks and claims to be a genius.

228
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,500
What's going on here?
Why is she like that?

229
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,208
Come on think! There's
gotta be a way we can stop her

230
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,291
before she turns
us into barbeque, right?

231
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,458
We'll have to take her down.

232
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,916
Sera, no!

233
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,833
Why are you stopping me, maggot?

234
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,583
We have to do something.

235
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,083
But we can't risk
hurting her in the process!

236
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,625
We just spent a
great day with her,

237
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,250
and now you think
we should attack her?

238
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,458
She's our friend, remember!

239
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,750
Yes, but even so vampire
ninjas do not hesitate

240
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,125
to fight at any time.

241
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,125
It's one of our sworn duties.

242
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,791
I had a feeling you
were gonna say that.

243
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,208
Just let me handle
this my way, okay?

244
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,625
Very well then, maggot.
But if your way fails,

245
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,083
I'll be the first one
to say, "I told you so."

246
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,791
Sounds like a deal to me!

247
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,375
What the hell, Ayumu!

248
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,958
Did the heat melt
your brain or something?

249
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,208
Tomonori. What are you doing?

250
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,708
We're your friends.
Don't you recognize us?

251
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,791
It's alright. I can
take it 'cause I'm a zombie.

252
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,250
Like I said,
we're friends, so talk to me.

253
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,875
Tell me.

254
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,125
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

255
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:31,125
I really don't know.
But would you please help me?

256
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,750
Of course.
That's what friends do.

257
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,375
Irregularity detected in matrix.

258
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,583
Self-destruction will
commence in thirty seconds.

259
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,250
Oh, no, that's not good!

260
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,125
Get out of there, Tomonori!

261
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,708
Huh? Ayumu? Wait.

262
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,416
What's happening to me?

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,333
What is this?
What's going on here?

264
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,833
No! Get back!
Don't come any closer!

265
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,500
I can't do that! I'm not
gonna leave you here to die!

266
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,291
Ayumu.

267
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,583
Please stop.
Just get out of here.

268
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,083
No.

269
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,208
I don't want you
to worry about me okay?

270
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,958
Just go on. I don't
want you to get hurt too.

271
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,250
Ten. Nine.

272
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,708
Uh-uh, no way!
I'm not gonna leave you!

273
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,583
Let go of me.
Go on, get out of here!

274
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,541
Didn't you hear
what I said, Ayumu?

275
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm about to get blown
to bits any second now!

276
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,000
It's too late for me!
Let me go and save yourself.

277
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,666
Don't throw your
life away for me!

278
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,291
Didn't you hear me?

279
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,458
I'm staying with you! Yuki!

280
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm glad that's over.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,958
Ayumu.

282
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:25,333
Aw man. Good to
have you back, Tomonori.

283
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,875
Call me Yuki!

284
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,291
I told you he'd
come up with something.

285
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,291
That Ayumu really is
quite impressive, isn't he?

286
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,791
Why yes, he is.

287
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,666
However, I have the
suspicion he might not

288
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,083
look so
impressive after this.

289
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,083
Do I make myself clear?

290
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,708
Your friends can
expect more of the same

291
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,500
until you grant my wish.

292
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,458
So perhaps now
you'll reconsider?

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,250
Not again! Come back here!

294
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,625
You still have to answer to
me for messing with my students!

295
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,125
Feel this?

296
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
He smells worse than usual.

297
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,458
Like a fried diaper.

298
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,125
Lady Hellscythe!

299
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,583
Hey, where have you been?

300
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,791
We've been looking
all over for you!

301
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,166
It doesn't matter now.
Let's go home, okay?

302
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,708
Hey guys.

303
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,083
My place is over this way.

304
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:40,625
Oh, right. We'll be seein'
ya later then. And be careful.

305
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,791
Ayumu. Um. Thank you.

306
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,916
For what you did today.

307
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,416
It's okay, don't mention it.

308
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,875
See ya!

309
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,708
Hey, if you're gonna get
a snack, I can come with you.

310
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,333
Okay. Just try to hurry home.

311
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,833
We're all really stinky, so I'm
gonna get a bath started for us!

312
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,166
Ah, it's nice to be home.

313
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,708
Well it was pretty fun today,
except for that last part.

314
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,791
"Farewell."

315
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,375
"This was all my fault."
"I'm sorry.

316
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,500
If I hadn't been around, none of
this would have happened today."

317
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,750
"Ayumu, Haruna, and Sera.

318
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,583
You've all been so
incredibly kind to me.

319
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,958
You made me feel so happy."

320
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,916
"Far more than
you'll ever know."

321
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,750
"But I can no
longer be with you.

322
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,291
I'm to blame for everything."

323
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,208
"I'm sorry for what
I've put you through."

324
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:28,416
"If I continue to stay with you.
You'll all remain in danger."

325
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,958
"Bad things will
happen because of me.

326
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,666
All of you would
get hurt, or even worse."

327
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,500
"Because after all,
I can summon death."

328
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,000
"So, my friends. Farewell."

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,416
"Please give me snow."

330
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Lots of it, understand? Enough
that everyone here can see it!

331
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
"May my cooking
skills be doubled."

332
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:07,041
And may my food be tastier
and far less dangerous to eat.

333
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,791
"I pray thee."

334
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,083
"May I forever be together with
Ayumu and all of the others."

335
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,500
Why this one?

336
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:42,458
Why? Did my wish have to be
the only one that came true?

337
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,875
And why did I
have to write something

338
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,625
so stupid like this down?

339
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,666
Eu. Eu. I'm so sorr--!

340
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,166
Get it together and
stop being a crybaby!

341
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,916
She's correct, maggot.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,083
This doesn't have
to be a final farewell.

343
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,875
Yeah, think positive! Like they
say, "Never give up on dope!"

344
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:16,666
You're right, I really needed
to hear that right now. Thanks.

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
Um, but the saying is actually
"never give up on hope,"

346
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,000
and I won't.

347
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,250
Have you heard of
political correctness?

348
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,500
Is that a band?

349
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,750
No, it's about treating
both sexes as equals.

350
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,416
Oh, like how men can
be flight attendants, too?

351
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes, and the same is
true for vampire ninjas.

352
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,291
Really?

353
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,416
Men, not maggots,
so don't get your hopes up.
