1
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,083
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

2
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,250
Dokeda. Gunmicha. De Ribura!

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,000
You wanna piece
of me, buddy? Come get some!

4
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,833
Mystletainn Kick!

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,458
No fair!

6
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,000
That is so not a kick!

7
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:03,708
After kicking monster
ass I always wanna eat.

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,208
Seriously, a pudding megalo?

9
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:18,041
And that's my favorite snack!
Great news for me.

10
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,583
There's more of you to eat!

11
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,916
Good thing I'm hungry!

12
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,791
Come on! Please! Just die!

13
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,625
Die already. Die.

14
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:43,500
Please. Die.
Die so I can eat you!

15
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,166
I'm starving.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,541
And you're so yummy.

17
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,333
I hope your morning is going
better than hers, my Lady.

18
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,000
Personally, I'm not the
biggest fan of this weather

19
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,458
we've been having lately.
Blue skies and bright,

20
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,208
warm sunshine are pretty
freaking overrated in my book.

21
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,166
And I'm not just being emo.

22
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,166
I'm a zombie and
as crazy as it sounds,

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,041
that's the simplest
part of my life right now.

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,291
Came out kinda
hard this morning.

25
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,791
Pervert. Make me picture
that part of you again;

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,208
I'll cut it off.

27
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,791
I'm talking about the
eggs being a little overdone.

28
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,083
Then perhaps you
should say what you mean.

29
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,791
You'll live longer.

30
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,875
Um. That last part
doesn't make much sense

31
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,458
when you're talking to me.

32
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,125
There are a lot of things
here that don't make sense.

33
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,416
Yeah, my folks are always
sending back weird crap

34
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,583
they find while they're
out traveling the world.

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,458
Probably a guilty
conscience thing.

36
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,875
Cause they've left
their dear son behind.

37
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,750
I see. The reason
you've learned how to be

38
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,458
so resourceful on
your own is because

39
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,166
not even your parents
could stand to be around you.

40
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,875
So you're a master of the sword
and the backhanded compliment?

41
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,916
This just keeps getting better.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Last one! Jackpot!

43
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,125
After that horrible
nightmare I was having,

44
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,750
this is like poetic justi--

45
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,166
Swallow-Return Strike.

46
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,208
Is there some kinda
reason you're playing, too?

47
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,083
I do whatever I must
to serve Lady Hellscythe.

48
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,041
Fine by me! Beating both
of you will be twice as sweet.

49
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,708
Of course, half of my victory
will belong to Lady Hellscythe.

50
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,583
Ya know, if you really want
some pudding of your own,

51
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,791
they sell it at the store.

52
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,958
It's not my fault Ayumu
didn't buy enough for all of us.

53
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,208
Speaking of that maggot.

54
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,333
The skies are clear and sunny.

55
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,208
Are you sure he
survived the walk to school?

56
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Yeah. He has his umbrella,
so he should be fine.

57
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,458
What an idiot. Doesn't he
realize how foolish it is

58
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,250
for a zombie to walk around
in broad daylight? He could die.

59
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,541
He's weird.
I don't think he can die.

60
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,500
First time I met him,
I totally cut him in half,

61
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,166
and he's still around today.

62
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,375
Crazy, huh?

63
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,083
Oh. So he's more like
a flatworm than a human.

64
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,541
But still a maggot.

65
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you okay? You look sick.

66
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,750
No, I'm alright.
It's just the heat.

67
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,958
I think I probably
should've been born an Eskimo.

68
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,916
Looky here!

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,416
I've got something in my pocket
that might interest you!

70
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,708
Yeah, I'm kinda
busy right now. So, uh.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,791
Oh my god! You won't
believe what I won yesterday!

72
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,541
You're right.
I probably wouldn't.

73
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,791
Hey girl, I've got
two tickets to paradise.

74
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,958
You're so creepy.

75
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,791
Damnit. That was
one of my best lines.

76
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,708
Bowling, huh?

77
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,583
Yep, you and me could
be "pin-pals," get it?

78
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,958
Couldn't get a date, so I
get invited to the pity party.

79
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,083
It'll be fun.
Besides I'm getting tired

80
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,541
of being with
girls all the time.

81
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
I mean,

82
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,166
chicks are cool for some things,
ya know what I'm talkin' about,

83
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
but I'm in
the mood for a bro job.

84
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,083
Oh crap! It's not
what it sounds like, girls!

85
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,458
Please, don't listen to him!

86
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,083
We can't let these
tickets just go to waste!

87
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
Okay, okay!
I'll go, as long as

88
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,666
you don't say
anything else about it.

89
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,125
And one more
should do the trick.

90
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,458
At this point,
I believe there are

91
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,000
no more blocks
that can be removed.

92
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,458
Then I guess that
means you're giving up!

93
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,791
Too bad for you
I never do! Watch this!

94
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,416
Well, it would appear
that I stand corrected.

95
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,541
That makes me the winner right?

96
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,750
As I understand it,
this game can only have a loser.

97
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,500
Aw man, this sucks!
I gotta win something!

98
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,375
Check!

99
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,666
In your dreams! Ha!

100
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,625
Interesting.

101
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,083
I have no idea
what just happened.

102
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,166
Right foot blue.

103
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,458
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

104
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,541
How is it that you came to find
yourself living with the maggot?

105
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
Uhh. The only
reason I'm staying here

106
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,458
is because that jerk
stole my magic power.

107
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,375
That doesn't make sense.

108
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,416
Surely a lowly zombie like him

109
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,833
wouldn't be
capable of such a thing.

110
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,583
Nothing about that
guy makes sense to me.

111
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,708
Yes. He is quite
perverse isn't he?

112
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,000
Lady Hellscythe,
would you like to play?

113
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,833
Perhaps we should
start thinking about lunch.

114
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,666
Oh, let's get
somethin' delivered!

115
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,375
I'm feeling like sushi.
It will be the maggot's treat.

116
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,250
That is so lame! You seriously
ordered a mask-y meal?

117
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,208
What are you like, ten?

118
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,375
You want this, doncha punk?!

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,791
The guys at the
counter were so pushy,

120
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,250
I didn't really have a choice.

121
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,833
But it looks like I'm not
the only one that caved in.

122
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,958
What am I gonna do with you,

123
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,291
you're practically the poster
boy for the phrase "lost cause."

124
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
Whaddaya mean by that?

125
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,666
I mean, acting like a little kid

126
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,666
all of the time is
total chick repellant.

127
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,000
Think about a
guy like me, right?

128
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,458
While I do have my boyish
charm...

129
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,458
the girls can tell
I'm all man. You follow me?

130
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,208
Ahh. It's so nice being around
some real women for a change.

131
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,541
A real upgrade in scenery

132
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,333
from all those
schoolgirls in uniforms.

133
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,416
Ya know?

134
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,458
I don't think I can
take it anymore. Please God.

135
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,625
I know it's too late for me,
but if you're listening

136
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,625
just put him out of his misery.

137
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,708
Whoa!

138
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,458
Man, I think I'm in heaven!

139
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:18,375
Yeah, baby! That's how
it's done! Did you see that?

140
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,166
Those are some
seriously top-shelf babes.

141
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,250
What the hell
are they doing here?

142
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,500
Gut-ter! Gut-ter!

143
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,708
That's a great question!

144
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,791
What the hell
are they doing here?

145
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,291
Gut-ter! Gut-ter!

146
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,708
Man, that girl is fit! Look at
her hair, it's super long,

147
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,500
but she takes great care of it.

148
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,625
I'd bet you anything
she's a model or something.

149
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,333
Yeah? Ya think so?

150
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,958
Oh yeah, total white panty girl.

151
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,791
What?

152
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,333
White panties.

153
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,166
That wild exterior hides an
innocent side, no way I'm wrong.

154
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,083
The lively one
there wears stripes.

155
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,791
And how do you
know that, Sherlock?

156
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,916
It's like I can see them.

157
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,625
I've never gotten this feeling
from the girls in our class.

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,083
What a fox!

159
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,958
She can set my
pin any way she wants.

160
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,250
And her. What's the story
on the armor, little girl?

161
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,125
Judging from the outfit,
she's into the freaky stuff.

162
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,083
A little roleplaying, maybe?

163
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,125
And under that elaborate
armor a simple black thong.

164
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,166
Up for some jousting,
my fair lady?

165
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,041
Can you actually
hear yourself, you horndog?

166
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,041
Oh crap! If he finds out
they're all living with me,

167
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,625
things are gonna get a
whole lot more complicated!

168
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,875
What kind of creepy stuff
are they doing in there!

169
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458
Well, whatever
that weirdo's up to,

170
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sure it's against the law!

171
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,375
Who does he think he is, the
star of some cheesy harem anime?

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,625
There's no way he could take it.

173
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,833
We'd have to throw
him in the looney bin.

174
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,916
I gotta hit the can.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,583
What the hell? You just went!
Like, for a while.

176
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,833
Come on, you're up
anyway, pal. Let's bowl!

177
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,916
Fine.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,333
You sick?

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,416
Listen I gave you
my extra ticket,

180
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,583
so the least you
could do is roll the ball.

181
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,458
And since it's your turn,
now would be the perfect time!

182
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,666
Uh, yeah. It's cool.
Let me just...

183
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,375
We don't have all freakin'
day, ya know. Get movin'!

184
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you doing here?
I know you can hear me.

185
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,666
Whoa! Ho-ly.
That chick is waving at me!

186
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,916
No, she's not! I swear!

187
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,750
O-oh. You just
can't help it, can you?

188
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,750
You tried and tried but
resistance to me is futile.

189
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,625
Hey!

190
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,916
See what I mean?

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,291
Have you gone deaf
and blind or something?

192
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,750
Oh my God, dude!
Here she comes! Yes!

193
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,333
Hey there. You looking
for some doubles partners?

194
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,083
When I call out to you,
you'd better answer!

195
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,625
You hear me, Ayumu?

196
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,541
Ayumu? What the? Hey man.

197
00:12:53,625 --> 00:13:02,458
Uh. No. Ummm. I'm.
I am The Masked Ayumu!

198
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,750
I'm. I am The Masked Ayumu!

199
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500
The Masked. What?

200
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,291
I'm such an idiot!
Why the hell did I say my name?

201
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,333
I gotta think of a lie quick!

202
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,875
Aw, but Haruna's a lot
sharper than she looks.

203
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,208
What should I do?

204
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,125
That mask might spare
us from seeing your face,

205
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,208
maggot, but you're
still repugnant.

206
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,125
It's over now.
I am so screwed.

207
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,875
No freaking way.

208
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,041
Ayumu, are you telling me that

209
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,666
these girls are
actually friends of yours?

210
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,375
Did I ever tell you that
they were friends of mine?

211
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,541
I'm asking the questions
around here, buddy! Are they?

212
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,041
If you're trying to be polite,
keep the mask on, please.

213
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,458
As creepy as it is,
it's still an improvement.

214
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,666
You were holding out
on me this entire time?

216
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
But I don't understand
how a guy like you

217
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,708
would even know
girls like these!

218
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,666
Because we're all
living at his house.

219
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,208
What are you doing?!

220
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,958
Alright man. Tell me everything.

221
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,791
Yeah. Lemme think.
It's a little hard to explain.

222
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,458
Everything's just
happened so fast

223
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,791
it's kinda like a
big blur to me now.

224
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,125
Don't give me that crap!

225
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,916
What? It's the truth.

226
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,041
I want details!

227
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,416
Geez, ya don't have
to blow your stack.

228
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,000
I guess I'm just in
shock over the whole thing.

229
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,833
I just can't believe
that you'd keep something

230
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,750
this big a secret from me.

231
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,458
I never thought of it that way,
and I understand how he feels.

232
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,250
But my life is
so complicated now,

233
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,541
I didn't wanna
drag anyone else into it.

234
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,958
Especially him.

235
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,000
Sorry, man.

236
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,375
It's cool. Don't sweat it, bro.

237
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,875
Thanks, buddy.

238
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,833
So tell me. How far
have you gotten with them?

239
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,666
Past first base, I hope.

240
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh my word. I was getting
so hot, I had to cool down.

241
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
You are so bad.

242
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,666
You know you're
never gonna win a game

243
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,500
if you don't even
touch the controller.

244
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,625
I'm pretty sure I'm having a
lot more fun just touching you.

245
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,458
You bad boy.

246
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,666
Oooohhh.
Should I make you dinner?

247
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,208
Or draw a bath for you?
I'll join you if you want me to.

248
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,458
Sound good?

249
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,000
That bastard! I'd kill
to be in his position.

250
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,500
Just tell me who!

251
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,958
Obviously, he's gone insane.

252
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,458
Why does God hate me so much?!

253
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,458
Why is it you and not me?
Why are you so lucky?

254
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,958
Hey. You got
the wrong idea. Look,

255
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,416
if I ever tried anything on
these girls I would get turned

256
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,958
into a punching bag so
quick it'd make your head spin.

257
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,125
Holy crap, you mean
they're into the rough stuff?

258
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,000
Calm down.
Let me explain myself.

259
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,875
I'm not saying that
the girls would treat me

260
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,333
like a punching bag.

261
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,875
I'm saying I'd literally
look like one after they were

262
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,041
done tearing off
my arms and legs.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,208
So, ya still jealous?

264
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,791
Oh yeah. I would kill
for that kind of attention.

265
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,375
That is pitiful.

266
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
Alright pal! It's on!

267
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,750
Oh yeah?

268
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,375
And if I win, then starting
today, I'm moving in with you!

269
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,791
No way that'll happen.

270
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,708
Prepare to get boned, buddy!

271
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,458
You're the winner! Hahaha!

272
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,875
Who knew? You're one
hell of a bowler.

273
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,083
Never underestimate a zombie.

274
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,583
I'm not crying by the way,
I have allergies.

275
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,833
That is the most
pitiful boy I've seen.

276
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,291
Well, he is Ayumu's
best friend after all.

277
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Aren't you
coming today? I'm bored.

278
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,958
Hey!

279
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,208
Sounds like a girl.

280
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,166
Well I'm shocked.

281
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,416
You dog. So who's
that texting you?

282
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,583
Your girlfriend?

283
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,875
No, a friend.

284
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,416
How come you had to
drag me along anyway?

285
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,583
'Cause it'd make Kyoko happy.

286
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,875
For some screwed
up reason, she likes you.

287
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay.

288
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,208
Yep. Each time I come here.

289
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,791
She always wants
to know if you'll

290
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,625
be coming with me next time.

291
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,500
Why the hell are the chicks
so into you these days?

292
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,375
My animal magnetism?

293
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:45,375
Listen, man, Kyoko's a
good friend of mine.

294
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,833
If you try anything
funny with her.

295
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,041
You'll be lucky that
you're already in the hospital.

296
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,291
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,083
So, what is she doing
here in the first place,

298
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,208
if you don't mind me asking?

299
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
It's messed up.

300
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,458
She was attacked by
that wacko serial killer.

301
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,916
Yes? Come in.

302
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,333
Hey! So. How are you doin'?

303
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,208
Much better now! Ayumu.

304
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,291
Now wait a minute.

305
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,666
I thought we talked about

306
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,916
you keeping your hair
in twin pigtails, didn't we?

307
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,833
It makes you look younger

308
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,791
and Ayumu said he's
into that kinda thing.

309
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,625
I never told you that.

310
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,416
I didn't actually know
that you were gonna be

311
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,916
bringing him up here with
you today. Hold on a sec.

312
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:46,958
Um, Ayumu. You remember me?
It has been a while.

313
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,875
Come on. You were in
middle school together.

314
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,375
No. I'm sorry,
I don't. I'm a jerk.

315
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
Aw, don't be silly. It's fine.

316
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,708
Yeah, now there they are.

317
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,125
What did I tell ya?
Pretty cute, right?

318
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,666
Yeah, totally cute.

319
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,166
You really mean it?

320
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,416
Of course. Oh, hey.
We got these for you.

321
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,333
That is so sweet.

322
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,333
So how's the recovery going?

323
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:25,250
Oh, pretty good actually.
By the way. I uh...

324
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,666
What's up?

325
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,083
Well, it's just that,
when I get out,

326
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm gonna stay with
my grandpa in Kyoto.

327
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,958
Oh, you are?

328
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,875
Yeah, for a while at least.

329
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,250
So I'm extra glad
you brought Ayumu.

330
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
I really can't thank you enough.

331
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,458
You know I'd do
anything for you.

332
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,791
Even drag this joker
around if you want me to.

333
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,625
Right.

334
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,583
I'm gonna see if I can
find a vase for those flowers.

335
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,750
Oh. That's so thoughtful of you.

336
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,708
No prob. It's all you, bud.

337
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,833
Sure thing.

338
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,333
Thank you. For coming by.
It means a lot to me.

339
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,458
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.

340
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,833
Hey, uh. I hope you don't
mind if I ask you about this.

341
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,208
But when that maniac attacked
you that night. Did you see him?

342
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,291
And if you did, I'd like to know
what you can remember about him.

343
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,166
Never mind. Forget I asked.

344
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
No, it's okay.

345
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,208
Honestly, I did catch
a glimpse of them.

346
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,666
Whoa! You did? You saw him?

347
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,708
What, what did he look like?

348
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,166
If I was alive, my heart
would be pounding right now.

349
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,416
Finally, I'm getting
closer to the truth.

350
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,958
I might be able to find justice
for myself and the others.

351
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,750
She... She had these
amazing blue eyes.

352
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,166
And she was young.
Probably around my age.

353
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,500
She!

354
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,458
Okay. This is
kinda crazy, but, tell me.

355
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,583
Was she wearing metal
gauntlets on her arms?

356
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,833
Also, did she have long
straight, silvery hair?

357
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,833
That's her! That's exactly
what she looked like!

358
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I can't believe it.

359
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,875
But she's the only one that
could match that description.

360
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,875
Damnit! Why does
it have to be her?

361
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,083
But how did you know that?

362
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,791
Do you know the person
who did this to me?

363
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,000
Please, tell me who it is!

364
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,625
Oh, uh. I've seen
a girl around who

365
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,666
kinda looks like that,
but there's no way it's her.

366
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,791
Ayumu, if you know who
it is, you have to tell me!

367
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,291
You can help
them catch the person

368
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,791
who killed my
mother and father.

369
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,291
She doesn't ever talk,

370
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,083
or even show any
kind of emotions at all.

371
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,166
That girl's the murderer,
I know she is!

372
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,833
Hey. Are you all right?

373
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,125
Yeah, uh. Your face.

374
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,541
Your cheeks are
turning bright red, Ayumu.

375
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,666
Do you have a
fever or something?

376
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,416
No, it's definitely
something else.

377
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,625
A couple of things,
now that I think about it.

378
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,416
You're okay.
No fever, at least.

379
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,416
A wooden sword?

380
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,750
Oh, yeah. My grandpa gave
it to me to protect myself.

381
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,791
He said that since
I saw the killer's face,

382
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,208
she might come here to
keep me from telling anyone.

383
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,291
I see.

384
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:44,875
I'm so scared.
I'll never forget her face.

385
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,750
She was so cold and empty.
She had no expression.

386
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,458
How could someone do that?

387
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,375
How could you just kill
someone and not feel anything?

388
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,333
No. I don't wanna believe it.

389
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,125
Swallow-Return Strike!

390
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,291
Wow! Not bad, Leaf Lady!

391
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,500
Of course! I'm good
at everything I do!

392
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,166
I hope you're good
at watching me eat!

393
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,833
You'll never have that pudding!

394
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,041
Beating you will make
it taste even sweeter!

395
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:19,958
The only thing you will taste
is bitter defeat! Now give up!

396
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,333
I'm a sucker for younger
chicks with great big racks!

397
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,291
Excuse me?

398
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:57,875
Yes!

399
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,583
Hello?

400
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,125
Yes!

401
00:24:59,208 --> 00:24:59,875
Stop!

402
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,666
No!

403
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,250
You're being super creepy.

404
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,958
And you're starting to sound as
desperate as your friend Orito.

405
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,291
Hey, pigtails would go great
with that dress you're wearing!
