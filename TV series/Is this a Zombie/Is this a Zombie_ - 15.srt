1
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,875
That stupid zombie
butthole practically broke

2
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,250
Mystletainn in half.

3
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,583
Now we're totally up a creek
if a Megalo drops by,

4
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,375
which means my grades
are completely shot, too.

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,791
Don't ask me.

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,125
Knowing him, he's probably
out pervin' it up somewhere.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,625
Now son, I don't
want to see you again.

8
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:53,791
Of course, sir.

9
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,708
Sorry for the trouble.

10
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,958
At least the weather's nice.

11
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,208
What are you doin' here?

12
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,250
I was looking for the worm
who decided to make

13
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,625
his pitiful privates
a public spectacle.

14
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,833
No doubt scarring
dozens of young minds.

15
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,083
You got the wrong idea
about me Sera--

16
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,208
Most people already think
you're a sex offending maggot.

17
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,708
You don't have to go out of
your way to prove them right.

18
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,666
Life, or whatever this is,
might be a lot of things,

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,083
but never predictable.

20
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,833
If Gaia sees fit to slam another
obstacle in front of me,

21
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,708
I've just got to man up
and power through.

22
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,708
Ya know.

23
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,166
Being the chosen one
kinda sucks.

24
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,500
That ass is like an onion.

25
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,583
Brings tears to my eyes.

26
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,916
I'm home.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,375
You are blowin' up!

28
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,833
Whaddaya talkin' about?

29
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,958
Rackin' up a hefty
number of views.

30
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,250
No!

31
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,875
Now that I've come out
of the magical girl closet,

32
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,875
I don't expect my
classmates to treat me like

33
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,333
the belle of the ball.

34
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,000
But once again I've got no
option but to meet whatever

35
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,708
fate throws at me, head on.

36
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,541
We chosen ones travel rocky
paths, sure, but it does

37
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,041
absolutely no good
to cry about it.

38
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,208
Hey, superstar!

39
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,166
Oh my god it's him!

40
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,000
You're practically
an A-list celebrity now!

41
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,041
I'm surprised this place
isn't paparazzi central yet,

42
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,416
but I bet good money
they're on their way!

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,416
Mm-hm.

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,208
You know they are!

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,708
Are you serious?

46
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,791
Oh yeah, I'm sure there's
gonna be a juggernaut of press

47
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,333
here in no time

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,708
So cool!

49
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
Hey, Ayumu.

50
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,750
All last night, I was thinking
about everything that happened

51
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,708
and I gotta admit that
I kinda like you even more now.

52
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,958
Even she drank the kool-aid?

53
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,375
We have got to get you
into counseling.

54
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,375
This is crazy!

55
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,791
Like some sort of
bizarro world.

56
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,708
I need a life line.

57
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,416
Someone I can trust!

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,791
Orito!

59
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,500
Hey man.

60
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,458
Uh.

61
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,958
I just wanted to tell you,
your legs are gorgeous.

62
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,458
I mean, handsome?

63
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,875
It's too rocky!

64
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,541
Gaia, this path is too rocky!

65
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,000
Miss Goth chick!

66
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm so glad you're here!

67
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,208
I need your slurred words
of wisdom more than ever!

68
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,625
Cool.

69
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,416
So what's crawlin' up
your crotch-huggers this time?

70
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,416
I'm getting it sideways,
lengthwise, up and down!

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,625
No matter what I do,
everything works against me;

72
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,833
if there's a way to turn it
around, I'm out of ideas.

73
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,583
It's hard out there for a wimp.

74
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,458
I hear ya, MooMoo.

75
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,916
I just can't handle being
the center of attention.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,833
You need a little
liquid courage?

77
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,791
Well, it's not like I've aged
since the last time so, no.

78
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,250
That just means
more hooch for mama.

79
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,000
If I were older this'd be a
great excuse to pickle my liver.

80
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,500
This is what they talk about in
religious philosophies, kiddo.

81
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,291
And annoying sports songs
that just won't ever die.

82
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,166
Ya get knocked down into
somersaults seven times but

83
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,750
ya get up like eight
or nine times at least!

84
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,041
But I sure am glad to be
sitting down right now.

85
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,750
Uh.

86
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,458
Gossip's not forever.

87
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,500
Only about three billion,
five-hundred million,

88
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,583
six-thousand, five-hundred
and seventy five days.

89
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,750
I always heard a season,
but I get ya.

90
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,416
And you're right,
all of this will pass.

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,166
Guess I just have
to roll with it.

92
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,458
Thanks for the
perspective Miss Goth Chick.

93
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,708
I can get through
this rough patch

94
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,083
and come out even stronger.

95
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,500
You bet your ass!

96
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,875
And don't be a stranger,
ya hear?

97
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,916
The one thing that can
heal all wounds; time.

98
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,541
Nomobuyo!

99
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,041
Where's the Nomobuyo guy?

100
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,791
He's not here right now,
but he'll probably be back

101
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,000
in a little bit.

102
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,291
That guy is so hot right now!

103
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,333
I wanna be just like him!

104
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:17,875
Nope!

105
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,166
Not gonna do it!

106
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,250
Hey, where ya goin?

107
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Tomonori?

108
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,916
Oh please.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,291
What am I gonna hafta' do to get
ya to call me by my first name?

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,708
And "Yuki" feels way more
intimate if ya know what I mean.

111
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,833
Yeah, I'm sorry.

112
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:34,833
Old habits.

113
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,916
So, whaddaya say,
you and me go up

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,416
to the mountains tomorrow night?

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,541
What for?

116
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,000
What's gonna happen?

117
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,458
Nomobuyo!

118
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,958
On second thought, the
mountains sound marvelous!

119
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,791
You wanna see stars?

120
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,583
Maybe.

121
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,833
That sounds like a
mountain-ney thing to do.

122
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,000
Escaping sea-level
reality, huh?

123
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,791
So manly.

124
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,666
I've got a few peaks
you might be interested in.

125
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
I'm not gonna lie, an escape
from the maddening crowd

126
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,000
just might be
what the doctor ordered.

127
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,125
And the way
she described everything.

128
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,666
Once you breathe that clean
mountain air and see those

129
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,375
billions of stars,
it's like you become

130
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,250
a completely different person!

131
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,416
I think I just need to hit
that big reset button on life.

132
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,208
To get a fresh
perspective on things,

133
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,000
get my priorities straight.

134
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,500
I gotta cut through
the noise and B.S.

135
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,250
of the modern world, ya know?

136
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,916
So it's just gonna to be
the two of you out there?

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Yep.

138
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,916
Uh.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,625
Hey.

140
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,250
What are you gettin' at?

141
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey!

142
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,958
I'm over here!

143
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,083
Yo!

144
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,166
Hope you weren't
waiting too long.

145
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,208
I thought you'd
be coming alone, is all.

146
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,291
Is that a problem?

147
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,541
It's cool.

148
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,791
I don't have any kind
of problem with that.

149
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,333
But the sock and sandal
combination is definitely

150
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,375
gonna be an issue!

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,291
Aw, don't get
your panties in a wad.

152
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,833
Let's roll out!

153
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,250
I wanna get an eyeful of that
big ol' spangle starred sky!

154
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,166
Sea urchins in my belly,
squid ink in my belly.

155
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,375
How much will it cost?

156
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,375
Hey!

157
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,041
Are we ever gonna get there?

158
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,291
Course we are.

159
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,916
If you don't drive us
all off a cliff first.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,416
Ugh.

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,083
Walking hurts my feet,
can't we just fly up there?

162
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,333
Look!

163
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,583
Your feet hurt 'cause
you're wearing sandals!

164
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,625
Hikin' mountains
is serious stuff you guys!

165
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,916
So quit your cryin'!

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,375
Or go home!

167
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,625
I gotta go water some flowers.

168
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,666
Are you crazy?

169
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,708
We're in the
middle of the forest;

170
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,125
there isn't any toilet paper!

171
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,958
I'll use a leaf!

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,291
Savor this moment.

173
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,166
She can't pee forever.

174
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,750
Looks like the stars
are coming out.

175
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,583
The place that we're
headin' the stars are like woah!

176
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,291
Oh man!

177
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,583
You won't believe it!

178
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,416
Oh, yeah?

179
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,916
Yeah!

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,208
I swear the view up there
is gonna knock those troubles

181
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,458
right out of your head!

182
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,125
That's exactly what I need.

183
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,500
I see.

184
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,750
You've come all this way
just for his sake, have you?

185
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,833
No it's not just
because of him!

186
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,541
I come here by myself
every single year!

187
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,041
It always makes me
feel way better.

188
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,708
So I thought this year,
I'd share it with him

189
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,666
'cause he needs
some cheering up.

190
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,833
The view alone
would cheer him up, eh?

191
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,291
Listen, you guys have
totally got the wrong idea!

192
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,958
And anyway, she is
taking way too long to potty.

193
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,625
There're ferocious bears
and stuff in the woods!

194
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,083
I'm so glad I have a big
strong stud here to protect me.

195
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,458
The peace is over.

196
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,375
I'll go try to
track down Haruna.

197
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,500
Stay right there, and I'll be
back as soon as I can, okay?

198
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:44,958
Hey!

199
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,625
Wait!

200
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,625
I'm coming with you!

201
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,125
Whoa, are you okay?

202
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:55,666
Oh!

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,458
Uh.

204
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,958
Yeah thanks a lot.

205
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,000
Actually, I should be giving you
a big thank you right now.

206
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,416
No, I mean it.

207
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,916
You went out of your way
to take me somewhere to enjoy

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,333
the peace and
quiet for a while.

209
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,583
It's not that big a deal.

210
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,208
Don't worry 'bout it.

211
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,458
Well it's a big deal to me.

212
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,708
I needed it.

213
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,541
I owe ya.

214
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,791
No really it's nothing!

215
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,125
Ya don't have to do
anything special for me!

216
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,291
I'm not trying to get
any kinda favors from ya.

217
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,333
Hey, listen.

218
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,875
Forget about me, okay?

219
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,041
It's what I should be doing.

220
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,125
I'm your wife and I
at least need to make ya

221
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,458
feel better sometimes.

222
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,250
But if ya did wanna
do somethin' for me.

223
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,625
I guess, there is one thing
that I can think of.

224
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,875
Just sometimes,
let me call ya--

225
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,833
Call me what?

226
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,625
It's nothing too weird.

227
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,416
Good.

228
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,916
I would kinda hope not.

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I mean, like,
somethin' special.

230
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,500
A pet name.

231
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
Huh?

232
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,208
It's what a wife's
supposed to do for the hubs.

233
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,291
Or I can just call ya Ayumu
if that's what you want.

234
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,458
Well I'll always answer to it.

235
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
Like, even for me?

236
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:58,666
Yeah.

237
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,583
It is my name.

238
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,666
I'll just say it
like a pet name.

239
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh-kay.

240
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,666
It's gotta be cute.

241
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
Super cute.

242
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,416
What's wrong with me?

243
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:10,916
Now.

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,958
Okay.

245
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,833
Maybe like.

246
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,000
Ayumu!

247
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,958
Get your head
outta your ass and listen!

248
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,583
We got trouble
with a capital B comin'!

249
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,291
Be careful walking along
dark paths at night!

250
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,250
Ah!

251
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,583
No more hentai!

252
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,000
Get your head
outta your ass and listen!

253
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,958
We got trouble
with a capital B comin!

254
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,375
What in the hell?

255
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,416
Bees?

256
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:45,875
Ayumu!

257
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,041
Wait for me!

258
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,583
I need you!

259
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,000
Haruna.

260
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:54,916
Are you serious?

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
You really feel that way?

262
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Special Move!

263
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,875
Ayumu Barrier!

264
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,250
I should have known!

265
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,750
Oh my god!

266
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,458
Let's make tracks!

267
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,166
Try not to scare him!

268
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,916
Oh I'm sorry.

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,375
I always thought
bears gave hugs.

270
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,916
My bad.

271
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,291
Yeah.

272
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,750
You should run now.

273
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,958
You gotta get us outta here!

274
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,666
I can't even
see what's happening!

275
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,125
We're getting chased by a bear!

276
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,083
Yeah I know,
but where're we going?

277
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,125
Ow.

278
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,208
Ayumu.

279
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,333
This is an
unfortunate situation.

280
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,000
Tell me why it shouldn't become
a painful one for you as well.

281
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,250
Right.

282
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,000
It's kind of a
heart-warming story actually.

283
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,416
You see.

284
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,125
My eyes!

285
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,583
My eyes!

286
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,166
He's such a
cuddly-wuddly little guy!

287
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,041
I don't think
that's very smart.

288
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,541
I'll have you know that

289
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,958
every animal that walks this
earth finds me irresistible.

290
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,041
Rare, and drizzled
with soy sauce maybe.

291
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,875
Perhaps a nice
baked potato on the side?

292
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,458
Don't be such a playa hater.

293
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,541
I don't even know
what the hell that means!

294
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,083
Obviously the effects
of lifelong rejection.

295
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't psycho-analyze me!

296
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,041
Must be nice.

297
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,541
Seems like you all
have so much fun together.

298
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,833
Prob'ly cause you're
spending time with him.

299
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,833
You'd better pump
your brakes, girly!

300
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,333
Cause it sure sounds
like you're sayin' we're all

301
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,125
in some weird love harem
with this graveyard reject.

302
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,041
Never.

303
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,875
The mere idea is
nausea-inducing.

304
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,083
Hold on.

305
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,041
Why the heck did you
follow him up here then?

306
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,125
What's the deal?

307
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,708
Do you hate me or somethin'?

308
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't have any
kinda problem with ya.

309
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,833
I came here tonight 'cause
I thought I'd have fun

310
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,625
hangin' out with you!

311
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,375
That's why I'm here.

312
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,916
I'm an idiot.

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,083
Sorry.

314
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,833
I'm bein a killjoy.

315
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,666
We were s'posed to see some
stars and have some laughs.

316
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,500
So let's go see some
freakin' stars!

317
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:49,958
We're here.

318
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,208
This is the spot!

319
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,291
This means no more
climbing, right?

320
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,375
Have I mentioned how much
I love flat ground?

321
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,958
That's cool.

322
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,916
"The stars in the sky
are eternally beautiful."

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,625
"But the constantly-changing
stars are beautiful, too."

324
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,625
Mm-hm.

325
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,166
Yep.

326
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,750
This is the big show
that I wanted you to see.

327
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,291
So, uh, it's pretty, isn't it?

328
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,750
Oh yeah.

329
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,833
Beautiful.

330
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,416
It's just what I needed.

331
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,291
Really?

332
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,583
That makes me happy.

333
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,833
Thank you.

334
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,916
I told ya.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,333
Ya don't have
to thank me for this!

336
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,375
I know.

337
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,250
Okay.

338
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,291
What do you say we make plans
to come back next year?

339
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,458
Ayumu.

340
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,500
Holy crap that's good!

341
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,333
It's amazing!

342
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,166
Try to contain yourself please.

343
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,791
Gorging is unbecoming.

344
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,375
Yeah I'm a kind of a badass.

345
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,458
Every egg-layin chicken dreams
of getting their little babies

346
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,875
beaten up and fried in
the skillet of yours truly.

347
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,583
That's why I'm called the
Genius Egg Whipper Master!

348
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,250
I'd let you whip
my eggs anytime!

349
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,708
You're gonna have
to get in line, lady!

350
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,500
I may have started up
that mountain a boy,

351
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,500
but now I'm a boy
that's over the hill.

352
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,166
I mean I'm an
over the hill man.

353
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,875
I mean I'm a man
that conquered a mountain

354
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,166
(with three teenage girls).

355
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,041
The point is-- I'm a man.

356
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,500
A new man.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,958
I wonder if he'll
sign my boxer shorts!

358
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,833
Maybe I'm not a
completely new man just yet.

359
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,541
You have so many admirers.

360
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,375
It must make you
feel really popular.

361
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,791
But they're all weirdoes.

362
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,708
Who wants that
kind of attention?

363
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,041
One for me please?

364
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,916
I can't do this much longer.

365
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,416
Is never being noticed by
anybody again too much to ask?

366
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
Ayumu Aikawa.

367
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,916
Whassup?

368
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay, fine.

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,333
Don't be stupid!

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,291
That is a very
important message from me.

371
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,500
Run that under water.

372
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,833
I just prayed to live the rest
of my days in total obscurity,

373
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,750
so of course I get a stalker!

374
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,583
My feelings are
hidden no longer.

375
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,375
If you wanna wax poetic you
could say my life is a boat

376
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,625
cast into stormy waters, and
the sharks are always circling.

377
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,958
Hey man!

378
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,291
Just what the hell
is your problem?

379
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,208
How come you bailed
on me earlier?

380
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,875
Ya' know, you can't just
give up on your bro job?

381
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,041
Mr. Aikawa.

382
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,375
Huh?

383
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,875
What in the hell?

384
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,291
Are you high?

385
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,000
Quite the opposite.

386
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,041
I am a man trapped
in the abyss staring up

387
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,458
at the face of Polaris.

388
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,708
Say what?

389
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,875
And you're a star
looking down at the world

390
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,291
in which you once lived.

391
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,500
At the people who crave
nothing but your light.

392
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,750
This is crazy talk, man.

393
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,166
I'm still me!

394
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,541
Yeah, I'm getting treated
differently after flashing

395
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,625
my sushi roll at
the entire school.

396
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,208
But below this popular exterior
I'm the exact same guy

397
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,541
that I've always been!

398
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,500
Sir.

399
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,041
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,000
The boy I called my BFF was
not a cross dressing pervert.

401
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,583
Nor was he the most popular
kid in the whole school.

402
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,625
The bromance is over.

403
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,208
It has to go both ways
to be truly healthy.

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,541
Oh-kay.

405
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,916
Give me some space.

406
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,208
I need time to work
this thing out.

407
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,416
Form a clear mental picture of
what your transformation means.

408
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,583
And get a firm grip
on my manhood.

409
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,458
I understand.

410
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,166
Don't you worry, bro.

411
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,083
You and me are forever, right?

412
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,083
I thought he would
always be around.

413
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:52,458
For better or worse.

414
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,750
My yummy man-meat dumpling.

415
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,166
Are you talkin' to me?

416
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,416
Don't ask such
stupid questions!

417
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,291
Do you see anyone else here
that would fit that description?

418
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,708
Do you, idiotic Adonis?

419
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,416
Listen loverboy.

420
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,708
I'm intensely and intimately
aware of your beguiling assets.

421
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,333
And rest assured I will
treat you as you deserve.

422
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,375
Home sweet home.

423
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,541
You are on a roll!

424
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,166
Oh man, what now?

425
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,375
An embarrassingly assertive
assembly of assorted Ayumu ass!

426
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,875
No!

427
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,583
Alright world,
prepare to be ass-tonished.

428
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,416
I admire your persistence, but
why don't you call it quits?

429
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,958
It's time Kyoko.

430
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,041
You may act all sweet.

431
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,291
But I know what
you're capable of.

432
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,541
Come now.

433
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,125
I just need for you to
give me honest answers

434
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,583
to a couple of questions
I have for you.

435
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,708
Make it nice and easy for me.

436
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,083
And things won't
get ugly for you.

437
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,000
Hello, my name is Fantasy Eu A!

438
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,000
And my name is Fantasy Eu B!

439
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:29,208
But together you can
call us Fantasy Double Eu!

440
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,875
Please stop embarrassing me.

441
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,333
It's real deal Eu!

442
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,375
How do you feel about the
dress and panties that Ayumu

443
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:37,666
has to wear when he's being
a Magical Garment Girl?

444
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,416
It was actually
shocking at first,

445
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,833
but I've gotten
used to it over time.

446
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,250
It's really something!

447
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,666
On anyone else it would be
a huge fashion faux pas,

448
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,375
but somehow he pulls it off!

449
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,000
I bet he can rock any
outfit that he wants!

450
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,041
I'm not so sure.

451
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,291
I have a great idea!

452
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,833
How about we let him wear
our costume sometime?

453
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:57,916
Oh my god!

454
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,541
So cute!

455
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,208
That's it.

456
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,458
Say bye bye, girls.

457
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,750
Bye bye, girls!

458
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,083
Bye bye.
