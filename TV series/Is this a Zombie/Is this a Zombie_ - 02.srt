1
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,958
When it happened, I honestly
thought it was over for me.

2
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,333
But then there she was,

3
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,541
the girl who gave
me another shot at life.

4
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,875
No, cut it out! You guys
have got it all wrong, I swear!

5
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,708
Oh my god! You're some
kinda Magical Girl now!

6
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,541
But my human life,
and my dignity, are over!

7
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,458
You see. Now I'm a zombie.

8
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,166
Oh, and somehow a
Magical Garment Girl, too?

9
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,750
Class, please note the
emphasis on the word "very".

10
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,916
The author carefully...

11
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,083
Turns out my life,
or unlife, wasn't over.

12
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,166
Cause now, If I make
an ass outta myself like that,

13
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,916
at least I can erase
everybody's memories.

14
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I guess becoming a Magical
Garment Girl isn't all bad.

15
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,708
But don't get me wrong,
if I got to pick my afterlife,

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
this would definitely be
one of the last on the list.

17
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,333
It's been a week since I
ran into that Megalo thing

18
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,583
and there haven't
been any more since.

19
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,125
That may be a perk to
being a "super tranny",

20
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:44,000
but man, I hate that outfit.
I wonder if I could use it

21
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,250
to sneak into the
girls locker room?

22
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,458
I guess it's time to give
Haruna's cooking a whirl.

23
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,583
You're lucky you're dead, cause
my rolled omelet's to die for!

24
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,250
Um, I had some left over,

25
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,333
so it's not like I made
this just for you, okay?

26
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,708
I'm not expecting much,
but who knows,

27
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,125
maybe she's the next
Iron Chef or something.

28
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,250
Uh. Well, it does
look interesting.

29
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,750
Now let's see what
kinda side dishes

30
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,541
she whipped up to go with it.

31
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,250
I guess she's not big on
the whole "variety" thing.

32
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
Ah, well, she is
new to this world.

33
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,291
This could be the first
lunch she's ever made.

34
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,541
Hope this thing's not
full of raw eggs.

35
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,125
Hey, so whatcha got
in the ol' bento today,

36
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,750
your typical sad
white rice? Holy crap!

37
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,416
Did you make
all those yourself?!

38
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,333
Well, yeah, since I
live alone, of course I did!

39
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh my god my mouth is in heaven!

40
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,375
Oh, b.s.
They can't be that good.

41
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,666
They're amazing! Everyone!

42
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,166
You've gotta try
these omelettes Ayumu has!

43
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,291
They're incredible!

44
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,791
Trade you a fried pie for one!

45
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,083
I'm home!

46
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,375
And, so?

47
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,791
So did I enjoy eating your box?

48
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,041
Not bad for your first time.

49
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,916
I am a genius, you know.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,750
Well you might wanna harness
that brain power a bit more.

51
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,583
Like thinking up
some side dishes.

52
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,875
A man can't live
on eggs alone ya know.

53
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,583
Shut up. Eggs are the
only thing I can cook

54
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
so you'll take what you can get!

55
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,500
That's really all
you know how to cook?

56
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,333
That's right, and I'm hungry!

57
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,500
Well, if you can make omelettes,

58
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,000
how come you didn't
make any for dinner?

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,833
'Cause I'd rather have something
yummier that you cooked.

60
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,958
Alright, I get it.
I'll get dinner started.

61
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,250
Dig in!

62
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,041
Wow, so this is kimchi pork?
I can't wait to devour it!

63
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,125
In our world, creepy laughs
are kinda bad manners.

64
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,541
Oh! I guess I'm
still acting like

65
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,333
someone from another world, huh?

66
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,375
Or just plain stupid.

67
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
Hey!

68
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,125
Oh, of course!

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,083
I got so hungry
waiting for you, stud.

70
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,250
Got anything I could
put in my mouth?

71
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,125
Oh you bet I do!

72
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,500
After we're done
with that, dreamboat,

73
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,083
I'll scrub you all
over in the bath.

74
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,833
Yeah, sure, rub-a-dub-dub
in the tub sounds fun!

75
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,583
What's wrong with you?

76
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,541
Fresh outta those.

77
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,541
I hope this helps my powers.

78
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,791
I don't think they're back yet.
I'm gonna need seconds.

79
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,416
So give me more of
your tasty white stuff!

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,458
No prob.

81
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,875
Come on! Shake a leg!
Hurry it up!

82
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,333
Alright! I'm going
as fast as I can.

83
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,708
Um, since you mentioned your
powers still haven't fully

84
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,833
come back, does that mean you
plan on staying here longer?

85
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,333
Sure does, so make
with the thirds, dude!

86
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,541
Oh! Can I have some more of your
delicious food, you sexy chef?

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,416
I'll be happy to give
you whatever you want,

88
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,041
so just name it!

89
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,250
In that case, I'd like
some miso soup, please.

90
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,791
Sure thing!

91
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,208
Sorry. Come again?

92
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,041
Miso soup.

93
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,791
Another one, huh? Great.

94
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,458
Delicious.

95
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,041
Bossy like the others,
but at least gives compliments.

96
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,125
Anyone mind telling
me who this chick is?

97
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,916
Actually, I kinda assumed
she was one of your friends.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,958
So do you know who she is?

99
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,625
Okay, I'll go ahead and
take your silence as a "no."

100
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,666
Listen lady.
No one here knows who you are,

101
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,833
so would ya mind
introducing yourself?

102
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,500
Very well then.
Since you insist.

103
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,291
My name's Seraphim.

104
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,666
Whoa, you're an angel?

105
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,125
I guess I've met
weirder things lately.

106
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,375
I am a practitioner of
the Swallow-Return Strike.

107
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,208
My special skill is the
Swallow-Return Strike.

108
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,208
And my hobby is the
Swallow-Return Strike!

109
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,916
Well if you're that into it,

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,625
it must be pretty
freakin awesome then.

111
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,041
What brings you to this dump?

112
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,125
I was dispatched
here to enlist the aid

113
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,125
of Lady Eucliwood Hellscythe.

114
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,416
I've been charged
to not only do that,

115
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,458
but accompany Lady Hellscythe
back to my village as well.

116
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,500
And where's that?

117
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,375
The village of Ninjas.

118
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,666
Oh, I was totally
about to guess that.

119
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,958
So, if you're from there,
does that mean you're a ninja?

120
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,125
Yes. And actually more.

121
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,750
I'm a vampire ninja.

122
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,958
A vampire ninja?

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And how am I supposed
to kick out a Vampire Ninja?

124
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,166
Uhhh...

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,541
Tell me, what exactly
is the relationship

126
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,083
between you and Lady Hellscythe?

127
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, you could say I'm
her guardian or as she calls me,

128
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,041
my big stud!

129
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:07,583
Aww man! Why couldn't
she call me her big stud?

130
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,583
Then please allow me to
become your servant, too.

131
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,458
You may address me as
"Sera" if you wish, my Lady.

132
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,791
Please reconsider.
I am far more intelligent

133
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,875
and capable than
this lowly maggot.

134
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,791
Just because I'm being
nice and feeding you,

135
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,458
doesn't mean
I'm some kinda boob.

136
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,291
Since it appears
you're the stubborn type

137
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,041
who will not surrender
their post willingly, maggot,

138
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
I suggest we take this matter
up somewhere more private.

139
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,708
I'm real sorry
to disappoint you,

140
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,625
but I make it a habit
not to fight girls.

141
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,041
You will, and I shall
make perfectly clear to

142
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,750
Lady Hellscythe which of us is
more suited to be her servant.

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,458
Hey.

144
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
Relax I've got this one.

145
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,791
I wasn't offering to help.

146
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,416
I just want you to get
this thing started already.

147
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,125
I'm sure I'm not the
first to tell you this,

148
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,375
but you're a real piece of work.

149
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,000
Taking your eyes off
me is dangerous, maggot.

150
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,500
If you think you're just
gonna be able to kill me

151
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,041
I've got some pretty
disappointing news for you.

152
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,875
If completing my mission
means killing you, then I shall.

153
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,375
Even if it is a bit trickier

154
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,250
seeing that you're
one of the undead.

155
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,166
How did you know that?

156
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,000
Ninjas know everything.

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,916
Whoa!

158
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,375
I'll slice you until
you're incapable of fighting.

159
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,375
Um, you do know that
zombies can feel pain, right?

160
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,166
Spare yourself and yield.

161
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,208
Sorry, no can do because
I was asked to send you away.

162
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,666
Alright, so be it!

163
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,375
I'm a practitioner of the
Swallow-Return Strike.

164
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,125
My special skill is the
Swallow-Return Strike.

165
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,791
And my hobby?

166
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,291
That's right!
The Swallow-Return Strike!

167
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,916
Brutal!

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,166
If that pitiful
excuse was all the fight

169
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,666
that you could muster up.

170
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,083
Then you're not worthy of being
Lady Hellscythe's servant.

171
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,750
You undead maggot!

172
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,708
Oh, man!

173
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,958
I misjudged her! She's tough!

174
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,666
Damn, I'm giving it my all.

175
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,291
But I'm still barely able to
dodge those strikes of hers.

176
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,625
Had enough?

177
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,958
What the?

178
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,875
Two hundred percent power!

179
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,125
Kinda hard to use that
Swallow-Return Strike

180
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,708
of yours now, isn't it?

181
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,250
You maggot!

182
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,250
Okay, ninja! I'll show
you what a "maggot" can do!

183
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,291
Swallow Return Strike!
Eight Slashes!

184
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,666
But...

185
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,458
How? It's because I'm a zombie.

186
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,541
You beat me. I now
understand why Lady Hellscythe

187
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,708
accepted you to be her servant.

188
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,458
Done?

189
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,625
Yes. Now that you've defeated
me, I shall return home.

190
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,458
You're being a
good sport about it.

191
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,208
It's simply my pride as
a vampire ninja. Farewell.

192
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,791
Seraphim the vampire ninja.

193
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,791
I don't know if I
could beat her again.

194
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,291
And I really don't want
another throwing star

195
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,250
in my head, either.

196
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,291
We're home!

197
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,916
Now wait a minute, what the
hell are you doing here?

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,416
You told us a few minutes
ago that you were going home.

199
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,333
And as you can
clearly see I did.

200
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,375
Oh, so then by "home"
you didn't mean your home,

201
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,250
but my home, huh?

202
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,791
Who gives a crap?
You shouldn't even be here

203
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
because you lost
the fight, remember!

204
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,375
I fail to see your point.

205
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,791
What about that whole "pride
as a vampire ninja" thing?

206
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,208
Fulfilling one's duty,
no matter what it takes,

207
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,083
is the pride of a ninja.

208
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,125
I'm dyin' to know that too.

209
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,875
Therefore, my Lady,
I am fully willing

210
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,833
to become the servant of
this truly repugnant maggot.

211
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,583
If that will allow me
to stay here by your side.

212
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,416
Well, if you wanna
be my servant,

213
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,541
then that means you have
to be at my beck and call

214
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,458
and do whatever I say.

215
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,750
Like wear a sexy maid
outfit and get me up.

216
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,416
I'm here to arouse you, Master.

217
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,416
And give me baths, too!

218
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,750
Well, Master, is there anything
else you'd like me to scrub?

219
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,333
Yes!

220
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:27,083
First things first! From now on,
you'll address me as "Master!"

221
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,250
No. That's repugnant.

222
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,666
Um. Then how about something
like "My Liege" 

223
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,166
or "My Smokin' Hot Lord?"

224
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,833
No. I shall call you "maggot!"

225
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,833
Why do you keep calling me that?

226
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,083
Maybe 'cause it rhymes with--

227
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,625
Shut up!

228
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:46,250
Yep, this is gonna be a long,
painful afterlife, isn't it?

229
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,625
Nice. I finally
get a moment's peace.

230
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,875
What have you done?

231
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,833
Something painful's
caused Lady Hellscythe

232
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,625
to guard her emotions.

233
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,375
What are you, a
vampire-ninja-psychologist now?

234
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,583
No, but I am a woman,
far more in tune

235
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,791
with the female heart
than a maggot like you.

236
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,541
She's not much of a talker.
That's just how she is.

237
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,833
There's more to it than that.

238
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,333
Some reason why she's
closed her emotions off.

239
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,166
Smirk all you want.
But the way she is now,

240
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,541
she'll be disinclined to
help me, meaning I stay here.

241
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,500
Unless you find a way to
change her current state.

242
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,500
Her current state, huh? Well...

243
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,375
It's the same one she was in
when we first met a month ago.

244
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,208
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

245
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,791
I wanted to break
the ice somehow

246
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,666
but couldn't decide
on what to say or do.

247
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,125
So tell me, do you
believe that UFOs are real?

248
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,916
Oh, crap, what was I thinking?!

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,541
Of all the things to say to a
pretty girl, that's what I say?

250
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,208
Gotta salvage this situation
and do something cool!

251
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,041
But what? I know, break dance!

252
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,250
Hey! Girl! Yo, yo, yo!

253
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,208
Check out this bro,
dancin' on the flo', yo!

254
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,666
I got a pure heart,
and loved ya from the start!

255
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,041
I'll drink to ya shawty,
so why not take part?

256
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,458
Break it dow--

257
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,250
Serves you right, dummy!
If you'd quit earlier,

258
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
she might have just
thought you were an idiot,

259
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,916
but now she knows that you are!

260
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,458
Oh, don't worry.

261
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,666
What kinda person
do I look like?

262
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,500
Yeah, I guess I do!

263
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,291
Even though she didn't
utter a single word,

264
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,625
she still had a lot
to say, or write, I mean.

265
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,208
I was usually always a spazz
around girls, but not this time.

266
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,583
Well, aside from the UFO talk

267
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,041
and the painful
break dancing, that is.

268
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,916
Bye! If you're sure ya
don't want me to walk ya home,

269
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,166
then just promise
you'll be careful. Goodnight!

270
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,041
How awesome is it that I
spoke to a really cute girl

271
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,541
and she seemed
interested in me, too?

272
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,708
Blood?

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,083
Oh no...

274
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
I better call an ambulance!
And the police, too!

275
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,041
Somebody help!

276
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,708
What do I do? Oh, hell!

277
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:35,166
I must be nuts. I'm no hero.
What the hell can I do?

278
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,833
And what happens
when I find the killer?

279
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,458
Oh shit, I'm in way over
my head. But I gotta help her.

280
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,250
Her scream sounded like
it came from upstairs.

281
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,166
Uh! What's going on?
I can't move!

282
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,958
I guess now I know what
happens when I find the killer.

283
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:12,083
Oh god. This hurts so bad.

284
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:34,333
Oh, you. Am I still alive?

285
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,333
So. You're the angel of death.

286
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,291
You did, huh? Who are you?

287
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,750
This is way too weird!

288
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,791
I don't understand!
Am I alive or dead?

289
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,875
That's how my
zombie life began,

290
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,375
and Eu has lived
with me ever since.

291
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,791
I know she referred to me as her
"servant" to Sera, but I wonder,

292
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,208
is that all she
considers me to be,

293
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,708
or does she think
of me as something more?

294
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,833
Ayumu! Seconds!
Now! C'mon, hurry up!

295
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,666
Okay I heard ya the first time.

296
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
More miso soup, maggot.

297
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,791
Oh, of course. Hey!

298
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,583
You could be nicer to someone
who's taken you into their home.

299
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,291
In my life,
niceties are rare things.

300
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,625
And why's that?

301
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,625
For the simple fact
that war has been waged

302
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,791
in the vampire ninja village
for one hundred years now.

303
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,375
Oh?

304
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,750
That sort of thing does tend to
make someone less than friendly.

305
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,666
Sorry you've had it so tough.

306
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,625
Do not presume to empathize
with me, you zombie maggot!

307
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,041
Does she have to
keep calling me that?

308
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,458
Oh, here, Ayumu,
got another box for you today.

309
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,208
Wait, don't tell me, it's all
rolled omelettes again, right?

310
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,291
Thanks for ruining
the joke ya jerk!

311
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,958
Do you think maybe
you could just make my lunch

312
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,416
without thinking of
it as being a big joke?

313
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,416
Nevermind, the stuff you
packed yesterday was so good,

314
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,916
you can do whatever ya want.

315
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,666
Oh, well of course you liked it!

316
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,833
But I really don't need
your permission to be a genius!

317
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,708
Stop laughing, it's repugnant!

318
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,416
It certainly is.

319
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
Geez!

320
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,375
Um, Haruna, not to
complain, but do you think

321
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,833
maybe you could also put in
some white rice with my lunch?

322
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,833
Look, either suck it up and
eat what ya get. Or drop dead.

323
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,875
What! Why not?

324
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,791
Aw Relax, she was
just messin with me,

325
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,375
she wasn't being serious.

326
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,333
Come on,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

327
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't touch me! Put your
hands on me again, pervert,

328
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,500
and you're gonna
friggin' die, ya hear me?

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,458
What'd ya do that for?

330
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,541
Eu...

331
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,666
Eat it.

332
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,083
I'm sure you'll love it!

333
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,125
Terrific. It had
to start raining.

334
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:10,958
How weird. It's almost as if
the sky's crying on Eu's behalf.

335
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,458
And more soup
for me, too, maggot.

336
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,000
Way to spoil the moment!

337
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:54,875
You popped up quickly.

338
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:55,916
I'm a ninja.

339
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,583
Yeah, but your
name's "Seraphim."

340
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:58,916
That's another word for angel.

341
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,250
I'm a vampire.

342
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,208
Yeah, I know, but---

343
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,416
You don't know anything,

344
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,333
and if you insist on
babbling on like this,

345
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,041
I will have to give you
another taste of my blade.
