1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:35,458
It'd been a few weeks since
everyone saw me, well, you know.

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,000
Thing is, even celebrity
pariahs need time off.

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,541
Sunday was gonna
be just for me.

4
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,125
A solid twenty four reserved
for yours truly alone.

5
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,208
Ah-ha, look at you.

6
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,958
You're adorable!

7
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,333
Models have come
a long way since I was a kid.

8
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,833
The current state of metal
die tech is proof civilization

9
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,958
is on the right track.

10
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,583
Oh, Kashim.

11
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,625
Love you, bro.

12
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,791
I'd tell the two of you
to get a room.

13
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,708
Except you'd use it.

14
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,625
We're in a room!

15
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,416
Yes, and you're
using it to spend

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
your "Me Day"
drooling over toys.

17
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,541
Must you aspire to validate
every creeper stereotype?

18
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,625
I'll have you know.

19
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,375
These happen to
be collector's models!

20
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,458
And?

21
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,541
It's a completely
respectable hobby!

22
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,791
They're merchandise
from a mech anime.

23
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,041
You know what, I'm not gonna
get roped into a discussion

24
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,000
about model building
with a female.

25
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,041
You're mind isn't
wired to appreciate--

26
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,916
And I'm not going to
dignify that chauvinistic

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,625
remark with a response.

28
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:56,208
As if you're
the resident expert.

29
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,083
Don't tell me that's
a real Arbalest?

30
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:58,750
Uh.

31
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,083
An herbalist?

32
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,333
What?

33
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,791
It's an infantry drone
from Full Metal Panic,

34
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,750
equipped with a Lambda Driver!

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,666
Silly me.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,250
Bitchin'!

37
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,708
I'm actually kind of impressed
you'd even know that.

38
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,250
Hello?

39
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,375
High IQ?

40
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,958
Oh my god.

41
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,291
Please tell me you're good for
putting together a Demon Baron!

42
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,583
There's no such thing
in the FMP universe.

43
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,666
I know that.

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,208
He's one of the
defenders of Villiers.

45
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,625
What does that mean?

46
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,250
Look, you can't just cross
pollinate two completely

47
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,458
different universes and expect
it to play realistically.

48
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,083
Says the Magical
Garment Girl Zombie.

49
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,791
Watch it.

50
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,041
If you're gonna play
with 'em, you have to be--

51
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,833
Sousuke!

52
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,333
Roiling underneath the banal
trappings of everyday life

53
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,625
are dark secrets
few would suspect.

54
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,833
Still juggling the
repercussions of his exposure

55
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,250
to uncomprehending classmates,
our hero heaps lie upon lie

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,416
to maintain a
semblance of normality.

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,125
Can his karma hold?

58
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,333
No way.

59
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,416
She busted it?

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,416
Totally.

61
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,666
I wound up having to work it

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,375
into a kind of battlefield
graveyard diorama.

63
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,708
An elegy to the
great fallen mechs.

64
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,958
Tried to make it look like
a burned out Hong Kong.

65
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,500
Seems like a pretty reasonable
way to deal with your grief.

66
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,166
I slew five other models!

67
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,291
I feel like a
freakin' Aztec priest!

68
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,125
Well, better they be destroyed
by someone who loved them

69
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
than some random girl.

70
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,000
Stop being so
damn philosophical.

71
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
Yet another wrinkle.

72
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,583
I mean, I knew
you were into models,

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,750
but I had no idea how deep.

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,500
Seems the whole thing means
more to you than a simple hobby.

75
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,166
Gives you layers, man.

76
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,708
It'd mean a lot to you, too,
if you were in my shoes.

77
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,750
Hell, I'd jump out of
a window to escape reality.

78
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,625
A model's like a friend
you don't have to justify

79
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,000
your existence to.

80
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,458
It's okay, I understand.

81
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,208
Some people deal with it
by burying their heads

82
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,000
in the sand; you smash toys.

83
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,250
Models.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,250
S'cuse me while
I whip this thing out.

85
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,166
What?

86
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,041
Don't let the family
friendly shtick fool you:

87
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,250
they only recruit girls
of a certain quality.

88
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,916
Girls that'll get your mind
off of model building.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,041
Um.

90
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,333
Okay?

91
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,958
They've got it tucked away
in an inconspicuous

92
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,958
lil' shopping center
down a back alley.

93
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,500
Ah.

94
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,708
And the world shudders

95
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,791
as two perverts put
their heads together.

96
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,625
Cosplay?

97
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,083
Nice try, dickwad.

98
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,375
Count me the hell out.

99
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,125
Don't run away from this.

100
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,875
Like it or not, this is
an important step for you

101
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,875
on the road to recovery,
and it's my job to make sure

102
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,416
you take it like a man.

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,583
By which I mean to sit you down
in front of some hot cosplay

104
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,625
chicks in hopes of giving you
a better outlet than wanting

105
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,500
to wear the same panties.

106
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,708
Now, go get you some!

107
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,541
Ugh.

108
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,750
Alright.

109
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,000
Welcome home, young masters.

110
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
How may we serve you
this evening?

111
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,791
Uh, hello.

112
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,458
Oh, sir; you look
terribly exhausted.

113
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,541
Yeah, no.

114
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,916
The usual spiel's
not gonna cut it.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,125
Dude, please.

116
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,458
Two, for the VIP course,
if you would.

117
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,666
The what?

118
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,708
Very well, master.

119
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,250
Right this way.

120
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,625
Why thank you, madam.

121
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,375
Better men have died
for the privilege

122
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,166
of peering behind
those curtains!

123
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,208
Turn back.

124
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,625
Or face the music!

125
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,083
Get lost!

126
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,041
The VIP course is
a real ball-buster.

127
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,291
Is there anything else

128
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,000
you do on the side
that I should know about?

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,000
Before I came along,
this place was just a boring,

130
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,083
family friendly watering hole.

131
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,958
Thanks to me,
it's now a fully interactive

132
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,541
cosplay coffee house.

133
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,416
You do know you're sideline
stuff is usually awful?

134
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,541
For your information, the
vampire ninjas happen to be

135
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,083
in the red right now and we're
doing all we can to recoup.

136
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,625
And I'd hardly call
adding some flair

137
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,333
to our fundraising
methods "awful."

138
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:27,958
Kirara!

139
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,333
Babe!

140
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:28,833
Doll!

141
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
Love!

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,125
Coming near me
without permission

143
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,583
is strictly prohibited.

144
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,125
Is that your idea of flair?

145
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,750
Don't criticize her, Ayumu.

146
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,833
She's maintaining a proper
distance between herself

147
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,458
and rabid fanboys.

148
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,166
You're completely
hopeless, dude.

149
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,375
Do you deny finding me
irresistible?

150
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,791
Please, we both know
I look great in this dress.

151
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,291
'Kay, whatever.

152
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,750
You know, there is a little
thing called personal space

153
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,333
I think you should do
some studying up on when

154
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,625
you get a chance.

155
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,333
Oh.

156
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,458
I'm an expert.

157
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,750
Hey, Kinobori!

158
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,958
What's the haps?

159
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,458
You'll take the coffee,
and you'll like it.

160
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,250
Whoa.

161
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,833
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,333
Hey, the food's decent and
the atmosphere's interesting.

163
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,666
Fact; I'm a regular here.

164
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,333
Well, isn't that an awesome
thing to learn about someone.

165
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,416
Anyone else here know me?

166
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,541
And don't take all day
deciding what the hell you want.

167
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,666
Do a lot of people opt
for the VIP treatment?

168
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,750
The second I infused
this place with attitude,

169
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,375
our sales went
through the roof.

170
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,833
Huh.

171
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,208
Must be a lot more freaks
in this town than I thought.

172
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,125
Look over the menu and
make up your minds before

173
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,458
I kick those
smirking faces in!

174
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,625
Now there's pair o' legs
that go all the way up,

175
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,166
am I right or am I right?

176
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,541
She could look like a burn
victim under those panty hose.

177
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,291
Okay, first of all.

178
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,000
They're not panty hose!

179
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,958
A real lady wears stockings!

180
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,416
Could you be
a bigger pain in the ass?

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,416
As a matter of fact, yes!

182
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,291
Sera?

183
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,125
Oh, you've got to be kidding!

184
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,666
If Mama doesn't work,
Mama doesn't get paid.

185
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,125
This is what you do when you
leave the house on an "errand?"

186
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,666
I have no choice
but to obey Saras.

187
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,250
Oh yeah.

188
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,000
I keep forgetting she outranks
you, or whatever that's about.

189
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,500
If I may say so, madam,
your body totally rocks.

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,708
For every second you sit there
undressing me with your eyes,

191
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,041
I will peel back an inch
of skin from your skull!

192
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,875
Hey, uh.

193
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,125
Yes?

194
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,500
Well, not to be that guy
but we're still waiting

195
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,750
on our water.

196
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,416
You demanding little maggot.

197
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,208
Don't act like you're here
for anything other than

198
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,625
the off chance of looking up
one of our skirts.

199
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,000
So we're not getting water?

200
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,875
If it's that important to you.

201
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,458
Sorry to make you wait.

202
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,958
Not you, too?

203
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,041
Tomonori, I knew you'd be
great in the cowgirl position!

204
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,125
Thanks!

205
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,250
Always good to see
you two gentlemen.

206
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,458
Hey, do me a solid when you
fill out the guest questionnaire

207
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,333
and give me high marks so
I can maybe get a lil' hike

208
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,000
in my salary, yeah?

209
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,583
You vampire ninjas
are so whimsical.

210
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,208
You guys know
what you want yet?

211
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,291
Everything on
the menu is awesome.

212
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,875
Are you eating with us?

213
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,666
What, are you crazy?

214
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,291
I'm your waitress!

215
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,208
Take all the time you need; I'll
come back when you're ready.

216
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,250
Oh, wait, no.

217
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,333
I mean stop
wasting my time, jerk!

218
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,750
The attitude's a bit
of a stretch for you.

219
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,291
Saras says we have to treat
the customer like total crap

220
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
or our marketing angle
goes out the window.

221
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,250
And it is adorable watching
you come to terms with that.

222
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,625
Say what you will
about the atmosphere;

223
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,041
the food's pretty good.

224
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,291
You ready to get outta here?

225
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,500
Nice try, my friend,
but not quite.

226
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh.

227
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,375
We gonna go in
for some dessert?

228
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,583
Every hot-blooded male

229
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,333
needs a little
dessert in his life, right?

230
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,250
See, they've got a kind of
challenge here that if you

231
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,625
can get five waitress
to go ga-ga over you,

232
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,166
you dine for free.

233
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
Free is always good.

234
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,166
If you accept it and fail,
you owe double.

235
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,625
This hole is a total sham!

236
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,041
Don't forget why
we came here, man.

237
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,375
The risk is what
makes this so therapeutic.

238
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,916
Here we go.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Now if you're gonna have any
hope of winning this thing,

240
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,833
it's absolutely crucial
that I spend as much time

241
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,125
with the waitresses as possible.

242
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,416
Just so you know,
you're not fooling anybody!

243
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,541
Excuse me,
we'd like a free meal!

244
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,708
Hello, and welcome
you dirty bastards!

245
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,083
If you lose, darling, you'll pay
double not with your wallet,

246
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,750
but with your body.

247
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,500
Embrasse moi.

248
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,208
Je t'aime a la folie.

249
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,708
Tout ce que tu fais,
ca fait battre mon coeur forte.

250
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:43,083
Hello, and welcome
you dirty bastards!

251
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,458
Prepare yourselves,
my tragic sirs.

252
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,166
Or should I say,
you disgusting vermin?

253
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:51,833
What?

254
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:52,958
Who the hell are they?

255
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:53,875
Silly, boy.

256
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,875
This is my Elite Force.

257
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,583
Let the hellish banquet
of your defeat begin!

258
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Leading the charge will
be Yuki Yoshida a.k.a.

259
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,750
Mael Strom!

260
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,625
Stop staring at me!

261
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,541
'Kay, look, this is me
being temperamental

262
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,666
so order a stupid dessert
before I blow a gasket!

263
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
You're trying to hard;
you can't just announce it.

264
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,208
Go easy on me,
I'm still learning.

265
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,958
Being a volatile she-bitch
the caliber of Sera or Kirara

266
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,375
takes a nuanced approach.

267
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
One where you don't
whine about your so-called

268
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,083
apprenticeship status right
out of the freakin' gate.

269
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't patronize me, jerk!

270
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,208
Look, no one's saying

271
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,333
you don't have other
exceptional qualities.

272
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,375
The trick is finding where
they give you the advantage.

273
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,875
Uh, what?

274
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,541
He's saying maybe there's
other jobs out there for you.

275
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:01,375
Do you not like me
working here?

276
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,375
Whether I like
it isn't really the point.

277
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,750
Think about it for a sec.

278
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,250
Aren't they're other
things out there you can do

279
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,208
to earn a buck that'd
you'd actually enjoy?

280
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,583
Well of course there are!

281
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,791
And let me tell ya:

282
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,791
it's easier to move around
in this than in that dress.

283
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,125
I'll bet it is.

284
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,125
You always give
the best advice.

285
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,875
He executed the
advice gambit perfectly.

286
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,375
Point goes to Ayumu.

287
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,375
Wha--?

288
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,625
Are you saying
I won that round?

289
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,375
Shoulda seen that coming, huh?

290
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,583
What the hell's so funny?

291
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,541
Don't rest on your laurels yet,
noble adversary.

292
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,166
She was the weakest.

293
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,625
The true test
has only just begun.

294
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,375
Tremble at the
thought, maggot!

295
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,750
Let's get the second round
under way, shall we?

296
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,166
Elite Two!

297
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,375
Oh yeah!

298
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,416
Time to bring some
genius to the table!

299
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,708
Oh crap.

300
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,458
Awesome-sauce!

301
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,000
Wait, you're-- Since when
are you a part of the whole

302
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,708
ninja vampire thing?

303
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,833
This is insane!

304
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,291
I work part-time.

305
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,583
Huh?

306
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,083
If you don't stop glaring at me
I'm going to break your neck.

307
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,333
This one comes off
a lot more real.

308
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,000
The elite team's definitely
throwing its A-game at us now.

309
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,541
You twerps have
five seconds to order!

310
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,916
5-4-3-2-1 bzzt!

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,375
Uh.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,333
Don't do this to me, man.

313
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,333
You laugh like that,
I think you snapped.

314
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,291
This is how a bitch-off
should be; a no holds bared

315
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,833
free-for-all where
it's anybody's guess

316
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,333
if she's gonna strangle you.

317
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,750
That'd usually be bad.

318
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,833
Ha!

319
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,041
My enormous IQ
gives me the advantage.

320
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,625
I'm not the kind of girl
who's gonna starting battin'

321
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,708
her eyelashes over advice.

322
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,708
She's got a point.

323
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,833
We'll have to tailor
our approach carefully.

324
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,708
The straightforward method
isn't going to get us very far.

325
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,000
What to do?

326
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,666
More water, please.

327
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,916
Huh?

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,958
Hey Cowgirl, get your
saddle bags over here!

329
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,125
Coming.

330
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,958
Lookin' kinda
shaky there, kiddo.

331
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,000
I've got this,
leave me alone--

332
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,375
Let me help.

333
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,458
My hero.

334
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,041
I'm the one who pours water
for Ayumu, thank you very much!

335
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,625
Now sit the hell
down and drink!

336
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,625
And order your dessert
'cause I'm bringing it!

337
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,458
Okay.

338
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,500
Uh.

339
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,875
Why are you so pissy
all of a sudden?

340
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,708
'Cause I'm the only waitress
you should care about!

341
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,875
A woman's heart has reasons
that reason knows nothing of.

342
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,416
Get out of there, Two.

343
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,375
This round goes to the vermin.

344
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,791
We made it through another one?

345
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,333
I was totally kidding!

346
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,083
Don't do this to me, please!

347
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,083
I demand a rematch immediately!

348
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:51,583
Elite Three.

349
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,375
Seraphim, It's my turn.

350
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,041
She's in bondage gear!

351
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,416
Oh.

352
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
Seems as though my handiwork
disturbs you, gentlemen.

353
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,541
I cobbled it
especially for today.

354
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,541
You didn't even know
we'd be here!

355
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,041
I'd just like to say
that sitting at a table

356
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,958
with pieces of human garbage
like you counts as a new low.

357
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,958
Words can't describe
my revulsion to this.

358
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,625
I've never been so humiliated.

359
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,708
That's right!

360
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,416
Pull no punches;
tell us we're worthless!

361
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,458
I'll thank you not to speak,
as every syllable out of

362
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,791
that rancid pie hole which
serves you for a mouth

363
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,625
makes my ears secrete puss.

364
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,625
Yes.

365
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,583
Every insult brings him
closer to ecstasy.

366
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,916
Oh, Sera.

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm out, bro!

368
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,500
So it appears you're
the only one remaining.

369
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
I have a special request.

370
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,875
What?

371
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,500
I want you to
make me something.

372
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,625
Whatever you're playing at,

373
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,000
Seraphim is not
allowed in the kitchen!

374
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
That's cool.

375
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,625
Would you please, though?

376
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,208
Uh.

377
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,125
I suppose so.

378
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,708
As you wish.

379
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,250
I thought seasoning it with
nitroglycerin would give it

380
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,750
a little extra kick.

381
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,750
She's good.

382
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,833
That dish would take out

383
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,833
a wildebeest in
the throes of passion!

384
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,875
Let us hope he can't
force it down.

385
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,333
Impossible!

386
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,833
I'd like another.

387
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,375
Ugh!

388
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,333
You don't have
to choke on it for my sake!

389
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,958
No really.

390
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,291
Aside from the blowin' up
part there at the end,

391
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,541
it was delicious.

392
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,625
Good for you.

393
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,125
I would expect nothing
less from the mind

394
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,791
attached to that delectable
ass, my filthy darling.

395
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,416
But let's see you pit
wits with Elite Four.

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,541
What?

397
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,500
This is bullshit!

398
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,791
You'd tell me if this outfit
was too much, right?

399
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,458
It's just, I'm a little
self-conscious about

400
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,125
how short the skirt is.

401
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,458
No, it looks perfect.

402
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,875
Anything you wear is
automatically made fabulous.

403
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,166
She's supposed to be
acting that way over you!

404
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,416
And he's trumped before
the final battle even begins.

405
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We're finished.

406
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,125
I got nothing.

407
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,750
This one's a total wash.

408
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,500
Wait.

409
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,208
I won?

410
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,666
Are you serious?

411
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,083
Well that was a battle
for the ages, wasn't it?

412
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,500
I have no idea.

413
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,291
What just happened?

414
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,875
That one only counts
as a scrimmage

415
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,291
for the real last round!

416
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,375
Like at a demolition derby?

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,083
I can take whatever
you dish out, Saras!

418
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,708
Give me your best shot!

419
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,791
Ha!

420
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,750
You think that
I'm your final opponent?

421
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,291
Excuse me?

422
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,166
The one you'll be facing off
with is someone I scouted out

423
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,333
especially for today.

424
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,458
Who in the hell
is she talking about?

425
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:24,958
Me!

426
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,541
Kanami Mihara!

427
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,208
I am completely
and totally screwed.

428
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,458
She doesn't have
a ga-ga bone in her body.

429
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,875
I'm about to have my ass
handed to me on a plate!

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,833
So, you're, uh,
working part-time.

431
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah.

432
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,500
The pay's pretty good but
I gotta tell ya; if I knew

433
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,291
I'd be dealing with you
I would have taken work

434
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,916
grooming some
old guy's butt hair.

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,875
Yeah, well, sorry
I came out to eat.

436
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,666
Why aren't you wearing
a pretty little dress?

437
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,291
Look, that whole thing,
I mean, seriously.

438
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,958
It's not what it seems.

439
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,750
No kidding?

440
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,916
Must be a hell of a story.

441
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
Not that I wanna hear it.

442
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,375
Just do us all a favor

443
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,416
and keep the frilly crap
under control, huh?

444
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,833
It messes with Taeko's head.

445
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,041
Look, whatever
you might think,

446
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,375
I never meant
to freak her out, 'kay?

447
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,625
Hurry and lose!

448
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,333
Huh?

449
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,750
Two things: you're boring me
to tears, and I'm not even

450
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,375
technically supposed
to be on shift today.

451
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,750
But I can't just give up.

452
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:27,375
Poor guy doesn't have
a snowball's chance in hell.

453
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,166
You're finished, Ayumu.

454
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,958
Man up and admit defeat.

455
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,083
Those scrumptious
hind quarters are mine

456
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,833
whether you like it or not!

457
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,458
So I was, uh, thinkin'
maybe you, uh, could poss--

458
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,958
Ayumu!

459
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,208
Orito?

460
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,958
You fought like a beast, dude.

461
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,041
Now it's my turn
to get your back!

462
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,625
He's about to tank
their chances even lower

463
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,500
than they were before, huh?

464
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,958
I'll take over
from here, my friend!

465
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,625
Prepare to meet
your match, Kanami!

466
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,083
Oh, this is adorkable.

467
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,250
Should I be shaking
in my stilettos, or what?

468
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,458
Kanami!

469
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,083
I love you!

470
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,375
Idiot, you never go all in
without at least a backup plan!

471
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,791
I'm sorry!

472
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,458
She's a Martian ice queen;
what were we going to do?

473
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,958
Ugh!

474
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,916
Next time just stay unconscious
and let me handle it, huh?

475
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
Leave him alone.

476
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,291
He was only trying to do
what he could as your friend!

477
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,166
What?

478
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,083
Seriously?

479
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,541
Did we just win this thing?

480
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,583
How the hell
was that going ga-ga?

481
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,291
I believe that's a wrap.

482
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:44,833
We made it!

483
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,208
We survived to the end!

484
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,416
Oh, come on!

485
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,791
I let my guard down for,
like, a millisecond!

486
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,875
And that
millisecond was enough.

487
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,416
It was a great fight
til the end, though.

488
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,958
I hope you die
in a fire, Orito!

489
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,708
I'll never wash
this hand as long as I live.

490
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,875
You really should.

491
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,583
It's got to be said:
you put on quite a spectacle.

492
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,375
Nicely done, Eucliwood.

493
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,208
Funny, I never pegged you
as a connoisseur of pageantry.

494
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,416
How'd you know her actual name?

495
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,083
Well, you know, I just
happen to be an Underworlder.

496
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,375
What?

497
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,083
We're home!

498
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,500
You guys were out late.

499
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,791
Tell me you didn't.

500
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,500
Haruna insisted
we buy you one so--

501
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,166
We were in the neighborhood.

502
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,541
Boy, work sure was
somethin' else today.

503
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,500
Don't just sit there,
make me some tea!

504
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,583
Sure.

505
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,250
I could go for some myself.

506
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,916
This is about a far
from something I'd put in

507
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,958
my collection as you can get
and still call it a model!

508
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,083
I get the wrong one?

509
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,083
Was the power out?

510
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,208
Did you have to
shop in the dark?

511
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,583
Well I think it looks cool!

512
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,291
Welcome to the model workshop!

513
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,541
Hooray workshop!

514
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,166
Girly applause!

515
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,583
Let's get prepared!

516
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,625
First you check that none
of the parts are missing!

517
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,833
Then rinse off the mould-release
agent with soap and water!

518
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,750
I'm opting out of
this segment, girls.

519
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,958
But it won't be as much fun
without the real Eu!

520
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,250
You've just gotta help!

521
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,583
You can read aloud
from the instruction manual!

522
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,166
Let me just talk to Ayumu.

523
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,166
Oh, that's sweet!

524
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,041
Good for the two of you!

525
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,500
Eu and Ayumu,
sittin' in a tree.

526
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,416
K-I-S--
