1
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,916
It's been months
since Eu disappeared.

2
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,833
We've looked everywhere, but we
haven't been able to find her.

3
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:50,416
I'm doing everything I can
to remind myself not to give up,

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
and remember that no matter
how bad things might get

5
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,541
there's always hope.

6
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,875
A light at the
end of the tunnel.

7
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,958
There has to be
something I can do.

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:11,625
Some way to find her.
Because I'm not giving up.

9
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,041
I'll keep fighting until
there's nothing left in me.

10
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,166
I owe it to her.

11
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,750
Haruna?

12
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,625
Aw this sucks! I can't
get these things off of me!

13
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,416
They're possessed.
Let go of me! Just get off!

14
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,958
You could at least bring in
your own laundry, you butthole!

15
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,416
Sorry about that.

16
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow, I gotta remember
to start being more careful

17
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,791
with how much I
can fit in my mouth.

18
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't make me eat
alone over here. Dig in.

19
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,458
Sure.

20
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,083
What's the matter, you little
pansy, can't take the heat?

21
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,583
Obviously your time away hasn't

22
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,458
altered your
charming personality, huh?

23
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,791
Were you able to
turn up any leads on her?

24
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,916
Nothing. It just
seems like she vanished

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,375
into thin air or something.

26
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,416
I guess you didn't
have any luck either, huh?

27
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,625
No, I couldn't find a thing.

28
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,958
Sera!

29
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,708
Oh no! Are you okay?

30
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,166
I'm fine. Just glad to be home.

31
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,583
You gotta talk to us. Please.

32
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,375
I tried to come up
with some kind of story,

33
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,375
but I just can't
bring myself to lie.

34
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,083
I was attacked by a conservative
faction vampire ninja.

35
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,375
It was one of my own people.

36
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,666
They came for me
because I forsook my duty.

37
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,250
Because I chose not
to follow their orders.

38
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,541
You mean deciding
not to kill her.

39
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,333
You were right to
follow your heart.

40
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,291
I should've known
this was going to happen.

41
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,291
I just wanted to come back
and check in with my friends.

42
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,750
And see if there was any new
information on Lady Hellscythe.

43
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,208
Hey. Are you okay?

44
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,666
Yes. But your face hurts me
more than the blows I suffered.

45
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,458
Ha. Nice.

46
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, yeah, Sera,
I almost forgot to ask you,

47
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,000
was that bath
water warm enough?

48
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,041
I reheated it after I used it.

49
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,333
Wait a second.

50
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,625
Do you mean I used the
same water you bathed in?

51
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,500
I find that even more
repugnant than bathing in a pool

52
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,875
of festering vomit, you maggot.

53
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,416
I'm sorry ma'am!

54
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,958
Delivery!

55
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,000
The Antonio Spaghetti!
It's finally arrived!

56
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,500
Who would've thought I'd
be able to order it here, too?

57
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,458
It's so good you'll
chew your cheeks off!

58
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,541
What the hell?

59
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,208
This isn't spaghetti,
they screwed up the order!

60
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,250
It says here this is an
'Antonio Stradivarius' violin.

61
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,750
What? No way.

62
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,958
Well, this sure takes
me back. A real Strad model.

63
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,875
Huh? A what?

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,125
Are you actually
saying you don't

65
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,583
recognize the
name 'Stradivarius?'

66
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,833
Oh! He's some sort of
famous Italian guy, right?

67
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,750
The Stradivari family
makes the finest instruments

68
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,333
in the world and if you dare lay
one of your grubby hands on it,

69
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,375
you'll draw back a stump.

70
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,666
Then I'll stay away from it.

71
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,416
This piece is a work of art.

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,625
I didn't know you
were a musician, too.

73
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,166
Yes. Some friends of
mine and I were in a band

74
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,458
back in the village I come from.

75
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,333
Well. Will you play us a song?

76
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Yes, I will. Though I'm
afraid the masterful beauty

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,875
of the notes will be wasted on

78
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,375
your ignorant ears,
maggot breath.

79
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,208
Well, hello, Mr. Yaruno.
Good evening to you.

80
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,416
I've been meaning to
tell you, the flea shampoo

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,666
you recommended
worked out quite well.

82
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,791
Well I'm extremely
pleased to hear that.

83
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,666
Although animals
can't talk, they do have ways

84
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,958
of communicating their
needs to their owners,

85
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,791
so it's very important that
we pay them close attention.

86
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,083
Yes. Thanks again.

87
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,458
Well, come on,
Happy. Let's get home.

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,333
So we finally meet.

89
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:43,000
Wait, that voice.
You're him, aren't you?

90
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,750
It's the scent
of death we give off.

91
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,291
The animals are drawn to it.

92
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,708
That right? Or maybe this guy
just likes me better than you.

93
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,291
I don't see
Eucliwood around anywhere.

94
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,541
You two get in a spat?

95
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,708
Or maybe she just got
tired of being around you?

96
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,083
What a crappy night,
you get jumped,

97
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,083
and then we run outta pudding.

98
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
Stay back!

99
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,833
What the hell's your deal, don't
act like you own the store!

100
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,333
So, she's not
with you two, either.

101
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,958
This doesn't mean
Eucliwood's returned

102
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,583
to the underworld, does it?

103
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,916
That's what we wanna know!

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,666
I left her in your keep so
you could keep an eye on her.

105
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,541
Well, in that case,
I guess I have to kill you.

106
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,000
What is this?

107
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,208
No, don't!

108
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,041
Why not?

109
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,375
I'll handle this one myself.

110
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,875
Ayumu!

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,000
Nice move. Is that all?

112
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,916
You're gonna have to
do better than that, friend.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,291
Okay then.

114
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,875
Holy crap! Your legs came off!

115
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,083
I told you to stay back!

116
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,250
Well, now that I've swept
you right off of your feet,

117
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,291
I think it's time I got to know
your friends a little better.

118
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,875
Meet my Swallow-Return Strike.

119
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,875
You're a lot quicker
than I thought you'd be.

120
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,125
Looks like I'll have
to turn it up a notch.

121
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,625
Put her down, now!

122
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,000
If you're wondering
why I'm doing this.

123
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,625
It's simple. By killing you
and your little friend here,

124
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,833
I'll draw her
back to me once more.

125
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,583
You can't just use us
like bait ya fruity bastard!

126
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,833
Is that so? Why don't
we test that theory?

127
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,916
Let me tell you what'll happen.

128
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,958
First I'll kill you both.

129
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,583
Then she'll come here
to try in vain to save you.

130
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,166
I'm sorry. I bet you were hoping
to see her on the other side.

131
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,583
No, you're wrong!

132
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,250
She's gonna come back
and we'll see her alive!

133
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,625
Such a charming fantasy,
but there's no way

134
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,583
in hell it'll happen.

135
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,208
Just run. Do it now!

136
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,833
Don't go thinking this show will
last without me appearing in it!

137
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,416
I don't appear enough.
You moron!

138
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,458
Oh wow. You came
here to rescue us?

139
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,625
We got this under
control so stay put.

140
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,750
Yes, we have located
the man in the report.

141
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,583
Requesting back-up.

142
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,791
Well, well. It would
appear that the guardians

143
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,833
of this world
have keen noses. Eh?

144
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,333
Fortunately for you,
I really don't like

145
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,083
the odds in this scenario.

146
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,750
But don't you worry.
We'll meet again soon.

147
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,833
Hold it!

148
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,000
Stop him!
We can't let him escape!

149
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,083
We need to find him
and get some answers.

150
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,750
This oughta keep
you glued together.

151
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,791
Use some more. Lay it
on there, nice and thick.

152
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,666
Yeah. I'm not
sure that wood glue

153
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,583
is really what's
called for in this situation.

154
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,458
You are a good friend, Saras.

155
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,333
You saved us. Thanks.

156
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,833
How dare you
speak to me like that!

157
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,333
I'm not your friend, traitor.

158
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,333
Seraphim, I don't
even want to look at you.

159
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,708
Is it just me, or is it
a little weird you came here

160
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,625
with the conservative ninjas?

161
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,416
This is a crisis situation.

162
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,041
It's times like this that we
gotta put aside our differences.

163
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,291
All right! All done!

164
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,125
Well, I should get goin,
if I'm gonna find him.

165
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,000
Right. Thanks again!

166
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,458
Uh, I think we might've
put them on backwards.

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,708
Hey, are you okay?

168
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,208
Yeah, I'm fine lard ass.

169
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,833
While you take
the maggot back home,

170
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,166
I'll continue to
search for Lady Hellscythe.

171
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,750
We should go together. If you
just give me a minute or two--

172
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,750
No. We can't afford to
waste any more of our time.

173
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,333
All right then.
Just please be careful.

174
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,958
That creep could still
be out there somewhere,

175
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,333
so watch your back.

176
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,708
Right.

177
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,208
You're heavy!

178
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,666
Sorry.

179
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,666
Hello? Seriously? Holy crap!

180
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,333
You mean you actually
have a lead on where she is?

181
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,041
Yeah. I'll send you
a text with a map in it.

182
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,541
She's actually
really close to your house.

183
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,083
She's nearby?
That's great news!

184
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,916
Listen up, I haven't told
anyone else about this yet.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,541
Only you. If I were
you I'd get over there fast.

186
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,166
Will do. Thanks a lot.

187
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,458
I owe you big time for this.

188
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,375
Hey! Don't thank me!
I did it because...

189
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,458
Geez! Just shut up, okay?

190
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,666
You're embarrassing me!
Hurry up and go!

191
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,208
Haruna!

192
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,875
I know where
she is, let's move out!

193
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,375
Are you for real?

194
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,458
Yeah! And apparently,
she's close by!

195
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,416
Great, there's the map.

196
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,875
Wow. She's super close!

197
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,125
Whoa! That's the place where I
shared some of my tom yum goong.

198
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
What the hell
are you talking about?

199
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,541
Who cares?
We gotta go get her, now!

200
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:46,500
Geez, wait for me you jerk!
Crap! Charley horse!

201
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,958
Haruna! Quit screwing around!

202
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,333
We're wasting time! Okay,
fine! Let me see your leg!

203
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:51,875
Ow!

204
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,375
Lady Hellscythe?

205
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,666
You've finally come back to us!

206
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,625
Yes, you've come back indeed.

207
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,333
But... Now you're
coming with me.

208
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:49,250
Lady Hellscythe. You're home.

209
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,625
Sera. Wake up!

210
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,833
Are you okay,
what happened to you?

211
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,958
Where am I? Let's go!

212
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,291
Just calm down and
tell us what happened.

213
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,416
It's Lady Hellscythe! She....

214
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,291
She was just in
front of the house!

215
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,666
She was?

216
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,083
I called out to her.
And then someone attacked me.

217
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,750
I see.

218
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,041
So, she was here.

219
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,000
Eu.

220
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,708
She was trying
to come back to us.

221
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,083
But that bastard stopped her!

222
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,833
Hold on!

223
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm coming!

224
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,666
Eu!

225
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,166
Welcome. I was
expecting both of you.

226
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,625
Please join us for dinner.

227
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,291
You'll hurt my
feelings if you don't stay.

228
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,916
Hey, this isn't Antonio
Spaghetti by any chance, is it?

229
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,291
It might be.

230
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,291
All right! Hooray!

231
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,375
I really did make
quite a bit of this dish,

232
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
so please, eat to
your heart's content.

233
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,416
More please! But of course.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,625
More. More. More more more!

235
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,875
More. More. More more more!

236
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,458
Do you want some more, too?

237
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,041
It's much better the
second time around.

238
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,250
What I want,
is you to let her go.

239
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,583
Come on, let's not
be hasty, friend.

240
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,708
We're all here enjoying
a nice meal together,

241
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,416
isn't that enough for now?

242
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,666
Surely that conversation
can wait 'till after dinner.

243
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,291
Yeah, shut your
mouth and stuff your face!

244
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,791
No way.

245
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,916
But I made so much.
Here. I insist.

246
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,083
Gimme!

247
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,166
So tell me something, friend.

248
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,166
What are your thoughts
on having an immortal body?

249
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,750
I don't know.

250
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,750
Come on, get real,
everybody wants eternal life.

251
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,500
But don't you think
the concept of a life

252
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,041
that never ends is
a boring prospect?

253
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,166
Listen. I don't care!

254
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,166
I see, but if you
stick around a little longer

255
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
your attitude--

256
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,041
Just shut up and
give her back right now!

257
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,291
No games.

258
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,083
You're not
getting away this time!

259
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,083
Hold on, are you
eating dinner with him?

260
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,791
Well, what a nice surprise.

261
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,666
Why don't you ladies
come on in and join us,

262
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,458
there's more than
enough to go around.

263
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,708
Never!

264
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,250
No, then?

265
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,125
It's such a tragedy to see good
food like that just go to waste.

266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,750
Let go of her. Now!

267
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,083
I can't do that.
I'm sorry, but if I let her go,

268
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,000
then she'll just run off
somewhere else, won't she?

269
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,375
Yeah! Because she
doesn't wanna be with you!

270
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:16,708
Ah. That must be why she
left you all those months ago.

271
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,250
What the? Haruna!

272
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,750
Huh? Hey!

273
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,625
Ayumu, there's something
on my head! What is it?

274
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,625
Yeah. What the
hell is that thing?

275
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,041
It's a bomb. Set to
detonate very shortly.

276
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,208
Hey! I may have been
a little greedy at dinner,

277
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,125
but this is
totally uncalled for!

278
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,291
It's no way to treat a genius.

279
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,166
I'd make it up to you,
but you and the others

280
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
will be dead in a few minutes.

281
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,666
Now, it's time to go.

282
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,208
No.

283
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,666
Euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

284
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:14,625
Eu. Please. Come back home!

285
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,333
Heh.

286
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,500
Euuuuuuuuuuuuu!

287
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,291
Damn. After them!

288
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,458
But what are we gonna
do about this bomb? Ayumu!

289
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,958
Oh, crap! Are you okay?

290
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,416
No! It's stuck!

291
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,875
How's it staying
on your head like that?

292
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,791
Uh-oh.

293
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,125
We're in trouble, this is
a parasitic time bomb!

294
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,250
Whoops.

295
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,458
Hey! Take it back right now!

296
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,166
No way! It was yours first!

297
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,750
Well, it looks
way better on you!

298
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,416
I don't want it.

299
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,583
Hey! This is no time
to goof around, guys!

300
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,416
Haruna! You think you
can deactivate the timer?

301
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,666
Yeah, I probably can.

302
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,833
But not with this
damned thing on my head.

303
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,708
Me and you should switch.

304
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,083
No!

305
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,250
Ah, man, this sucks!
If I die, I'm gonna haunt you!

306
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,416
Well, I'm no bomb technician,

307
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,166
but I think we probably
need to cut one of these wires.

308
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,708
Yeah, but which one?

309
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,625
Hmm. The green one!

310
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,958
Are you sure?

311
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,458
We've only got one
chance at this, so think hard!

312
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,500
I don't think
that's a good sound.

313
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,583
Holy shit, that worked!

314
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,375
Really? It did? That's great!

315
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,958
Sorry I doubted you.
I guess you really are

316
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,416
kind of a genius after all, huh?

317
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,041
We're safe! We're safe! We're--

318
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,541
It's still on!

319
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,166
That's not good.

320
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,041
Well? What the heck
are we gonna do now?

321
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,583
I've got an idea.

322
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,125
Ayumu, no.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,458
What're you doing? Take it off!

324
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,958
Don't do it.

325
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:27,125
There's nothing to be afraid
of, trust me. I'm a zombie.

326
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,291
You don't have to do this!

327
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,208
There's gotta be another way!

328
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't understand.

329
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,916
Why?

330
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:07,291
I offered you my hand.
Why didn't you take it?

331
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,708
Ayumu!

332
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,250
The star of
the show has arrived.

333
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,750
Wait, what?

334
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,125
My contract sucked, so I had
to sit out the first couple

335
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,166
of episodes in
my trailer, of course.

336
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,958
Hey, I get top
billing in this show!

337
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,916
Um. Did you see
yourself get blown up?

338
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,541
But I've got so much more to do!

339
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,000
You might wanna
check that contract, kid.
