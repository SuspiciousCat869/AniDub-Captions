1
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,625
Alright, scram!

2
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,625
Guys, look!
I found his right arm!

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,833
And I his left leg.
Aren't I lucky?

4
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,708
His head!

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,250
I find it hard to believe.

6
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,625
But he looks even
more repugnant this way.

7
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,833
Give 'em a break.
He is a zombie after all.

8
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,958
Why ain't he moving?

9
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,375
Yes, good question.

10
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,166
Leave it to me.

11
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,750
Hey, that ain't your job!

12
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,291
It's his bride's.
So get outta my way!

13
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,708
That's it! It's on, you heifer!

14
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,250
I've known Ayumu way
longer...

15
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,541
Hands off my man...

16
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,458
How typical.
Well, in that case.

17
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,916
I guess I'll have to
use the secret medicine.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,791
It's been handed down
in my village for ages.

19
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,458
Wait, this isn't medicine.
I think I must have accidentally

20
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,583
grabbed a bottle of
secret poison by mistake.

21
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,083
I couldn't have
asked for better weather.

22
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,208
A sky full of clouds.

23
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,333
It's almost perfect.
What a beautiful day for dying.

24
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,708
Why won't he wake up?

25
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,041
I think I know why.

26
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,166
With Lady Hellscythe gone he
feels he has no more purpose.

27
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,791
Haruna?

28
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,333
The reason why the
neckwear-mancer left

29
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,458
is 'cause you've
got no backbone!

30
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,041
No, I-I do.

31
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,500
No, you don't,
you repugnant maggot!

32
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,625
You could have gone after Lady
Hellscythe, but you didn't.

33
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,958
I couldn't because,
I had to save Haruna.

34
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,708
I'd never marry a guy like you.

35
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,750
Tomonori?

36
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,625
Bye, Ayumu.

37
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,500
Wait!

38
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:32,875
We're leaving
you behind.

39
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,916
Hold on!

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
Have fun stayin
here forever, loser.

41
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,000
No, things can't end like this!

42
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,250
Hey! Don't leave! Come ba...

43
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,375
Excuse me.
Would this happen to be

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,250
the residence of Ayumu Aikawa?

45
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:59,416
I just don't understand it.
Why isn't he waking up?

46
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,833
You're obviously troubled,
not only by his condition,

47
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,541
but by something else
as well, aren't you, dear?

48
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,166
Um, well.

49
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,208
It's okay, you can tell me
what's vexing you so much.

50
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,000
I've always encouraged
you and your classmates

51
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,416
to speak whatever is
on your mind, Haruna,

52
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,583
Class Refrain-Rising
Student Number Six hundred,

53
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,541
thirty four million, five
hundred twenty-six thousand.

54
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,166
Well, if I hadn't let
that bomb get attached

55
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,625
to me like that then
he would still be here!

56
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,000
This whole thing
is all my fault!

57
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,416
This young man isn't a
magic user, but it's apparent

58
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,625
that he's managed to weave quite
a spell over you, hasn't he?

59
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,625
Uh, I guess so.

60
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,125
And by working his magic,

61
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,875
he's made a big
difference in your life.

62
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,500
So now it's only fair
that you return the favor

63
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,916
and do the same for him, 'kay?

64
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,500
It's so quiet.
No one else is here.

65
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,583
Maybe I should just close
my eyes and sleep for awhile.

66
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,625
What kinda sissy-talk is that?

67
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,375
You're just a weenie

68
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,958
who can't come through
when things get tight.

69
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,375
Haruna?

70
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,541
You really think you're gonna

71
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,625
solve your problems
by doing even less?

72
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,916
You lazy ass. Only
people who've done something

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,583
worthwhile deserve to sleep!

74
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,583
Yeah, and you haven't!

75
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,791
Well, then what
am I supposed to do?

76
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,166
You should disappear.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,041
Yeah, disappear!

78
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,250
You're a loser as
a human and a zombie,

79
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,416
so why bother sticking around?

80
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
Yeah. Why?

81
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,375
And if you do it,
life'll be a lot easier for you.

82
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,791
Then that's it. I'll do it.
I'll just disappear.

83
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,208
Do it! Disappear!

84
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,625
Disappear.

85
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,500
Disappear! Disappear!
Disappear! Disappear! Disappear!

86
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,375
The only thing that's
gonna disappear are you fakes!

87
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,666
Why are you
doing this, you moron?

88
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,333
I thought she was the
one person in the world

89
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,375
that cared for me,
but I was wrong.

90
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,875
The rest of you guys
can get outta here, too!

91
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,500
Let me get this straight.
You honestly think that

92
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,416
the neckwear-mancer
doesn't like you?

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,541
Well, if she did, why didn't she
take my hand when I offered it?

94
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,083
Stupid butthole!

95
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,458
Don't you know that she's
always considered you to be...

96
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,833
Look. If you
want to be more than

97
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,833
just friends with
the neckwear-mancer,

98
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,041
all you have to do is tell her!

99
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:36,000
When I reached out to her, she
chose to leave with him instead.

100
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,166
Honestly, I don't
think I have what it takes

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,625
to change the way she feels.

102
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,208
Man up and grow a pair!

103
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,583
Just be direct with her, like
I'm being with you right now!

104
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,125
But if I do that, won't
she think I'm being a pest?

105
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,791
Oh, so I guess you're
saying I'm a pest, then, huh?!

106
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,083
No! Please don't hit me!

107
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,916
You gotta come back to us.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,291
Everyone needs you,
especially me.

109
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,125
You mean that?

110
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,416
Aw, forget it, I take
back everything I said.

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,250
If all you're gonna
do is just mope around

112
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,833
and feel sorry for yourself,

113
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,708
then you can stay holed up
in here forever for all I care!

114
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,208
Geez, Haruna.

115
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,458
You don't even hold
back in my dreams, do you?

116
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,875
You know me. I mean
business all the time.

117
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,708
Looks like I need
to cheer you up now.

118
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,208
But yelling and kicking
isn't really my style.

119
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,916
Yeah, I know.

120
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,375
Aha, you see,
I knew you'd be able

121
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,416
to cast some special
magic of your own.

122
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,500
Sarasvati.

123
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,583
I think you're going
to be needing that.

124
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,708
Check it out, Leaf Lady,
I finally got Ayumu up!

125
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,375
Ayumu. Do you see it?

126
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,958
Yeah. And this is all his doing.

127
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,416
Everything that's transpiring
is because of you, my dear.

128
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,041
Tragic. Because you
will not allow me to die,

129
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,583
I have no choice
but to destroy this city.

130
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,416
Thank you for coming.

131
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,625
It's time to go home, 'kay?

132
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,708
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

133
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,666
Yeah, it is. But,
it just isn't the same.

134
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,291
It's no fun without
you being there with us.

135
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,625
I've never
thought that about you!

136
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,083
Oh how touching.
But ultimately, pointless.

137
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't interrupt them, butthole!

138
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,458
What the hell are you
trying to pull here anyway?

139
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,250
I had our friend
summon a Megalo.

140
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,583
She may not say much, but she's
actually quite upset right now.

141
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,708
Don't you just love
that look on her face?

142
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,208
You're a real sicko!

143
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,875
This city and all
who live within it

144
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,416
will perish in moments.

145
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,166
Just because you stubbornly
refuse to grant my deepest wish.

146
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,666
Think of all the needless
deaths that will happen.

147
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,000
You could prevent them, though.

148
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,000
All you have to do is kill me.
If not, millions will die.

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Such a poor, conflicted soul.
She does truly hate me.

150
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,541
But she hates killing much more.

151
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,291
She doesn't realize
it's the kindest thing

152
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,041
she could do for me.

153
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,333
Please give me the only gift
that would end my suffering.

154
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,333
Ya know, I feel sorry for you.

155
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,708
Why?

156
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,708
It's obvious. You think
you've got her figured out,

157
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,625
but you're not even close.

158
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,875
The only thing that can seal
the gates of the underworld

159
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,708
is the tune
of a vampire ninja,

160
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,083
played by one with
a specific attribute.

161
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,291
She must have Lady Hellscythe's
blood flowing within her.

162
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,291
You are that vampire ninja.

163
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,750
But I've sinned.

164
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,250
Yes, I know, you have
gone against vampire ninja law.

165
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,208
Nevertheless, this is something
that only you can do, Seraphim.

166
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,416
Only I can do.
Very well, then.

167
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,708
May my song bring peace to
all of the wandering spirits.

168
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,333
When I first attained
immortality, I was so happy.

169
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,416
I really thought living
forever would be a blessing.

170
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,166
But it turned out to
be a monotonous curse.

171
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,500
You'll learn that soon enough.

172
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,916
Dying may be painful, but
living day after day without end

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,166
is even more unbearable. That's
why I need Eucliwood's help.

174
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,458
Still the same as ever.
I guess I'll just have to keep

175
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,541
hurting people until
you change your mind

176
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,375
since you've left
me no other choice.

177
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,583
Why don't I start with him?

178
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,750
Perhaps that will
persuade you to grant my wish.

179
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,708
No way, asshole!

180
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,500
Try all you want, but you won't
be able to lay a hand on me.

181
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,000
There are just
too many of them!

182
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,916
Resilient, isn't it?

183
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,583
The body of a zombie
can take so much abuse.

184
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,291
Pipe down! C'mon,
we're gettin' to the good part!

185
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,958
Say what?

186
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,083
Eucliwood. Watch closely now.

187
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,625
Because you refuse to help me,

188
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,500
your friend here is
going to suffer for it.

189
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,541
Ayumu! Let's transform together!

190
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,041
Is that really even possible?

191
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
According to
Mystletainn, it totally is!

192
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,000
C'mon, let's lay some
smack down! Whattaya say?

193
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,333
I say, "hell yes!"

194
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,166
Ready?

195
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,125
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa!

196
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,666
Dokeda. Gunmiicha! Deh Ribura!

197
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,625
Whoa. So I guess we
really can transform together!

198
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,916
Does this mean
you and Mysteltainn

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,458
communicate with each other?

200
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,291
Of course! I've been telling
ya since day one I'm a genius!

201
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,958
That mist is gonna be a problem.
Can we get rid of it?

202
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,791
I think I know just the thing!

203
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,875
Oh no.

204
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,166
Sounds like you need some help!

205
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,250
Sarasvati. And the others.

206
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,708
Just like back
in the village, huh?

207
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,625
You thinking what I'm thinking?

208
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,000
Yep!

209
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,208
Double Mystletainn Kick!

210
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,541
How quaint. Forgoing magical
power for physical combat.

211
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,458
Wait! That's not a kick!

212
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,750
Now let's give 'em hell!

213
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,000
Right!

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,458
This is incredible!

215
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,625
You're getting cuter
and cuter by the minute!

216
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,416
Thanks, so are you!

217
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,333
Oh my god! We are
such little 'ol cutie pies.

218
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,041
Insane.

219
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,166
Ayumu! Promise me you'll
kick that creep's ass, okay?

220
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,916
Haruna!

221
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,875
Four hundred percent power!

222
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,041
Fine, I'll use
five hundred percent!

223
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,583
Six hundred percent power!

224
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,416
Eucliwood's the most
caring soul I've met.

225
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,583
She'd never cause
pain to anyone. So tell me.

226
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,666
Why can't you get that
through your thick skull?

227
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,500
Seven hundred percent!

228
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,875
Still so new
and painfully naïve.

229
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,666
Wait 'til you've
known her as long as I have.

230
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,500
That's exactly what pisses
me off so much about you!

231
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,333
You might have known
her a lot longer than me,

232
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,041
but even so, buddy,

233
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,541
you still don't understand
a damn thing about her!

234
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,750
Eight hundred percent power!

235
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,375
Ever seen her smile?
It can light up the entire room!

236
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,458
But why the hell would
she ever smile at you?

237
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,791
Her smile?

238
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,083
Do you know anything about her?

239
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,541
Do you know
what makes her happy.

240
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,541
Huh? Do you?

241
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,791
What about her favorite food?

242
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,791
Do you have any idea what
that is? You think you know her?

243
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,291
Huh?! You don't know shit!

244
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,875
Using her powers as a
necromancer causes her pain!

245
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,458
A lot! But it
doesn't affect you,

246
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,375
because you don't give a
damn about her life!

247
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,541
But why the hell would you

248
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,791
when you don't even
care about your own?

249
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,875
Someday, you will
come to know the pain

250
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,291
of not being able to die.

251
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:41,750
It'll happen. Believe me.
But when that time comes,

252
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,041
please, don't blame
Eucliwood for it.

253
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,958
I would never
dream of doing that!

254
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,041
Because she's taught me
that life means a lot more

255
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,125
than just living for
yourself! I'm not like you.

256
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,166
Alone? Definitely not.

257
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,833
Well, Eucliwood,
haven't you seen enough?

258
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,791
Any more living would
be cruel to me. So, please.

259
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,708
This may sound ridiculous,
but I have one last request.

260
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,750
Would you please make me
a penguin? I love penguins.

261
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,666
I'm sorry for
all I've done, Eucliwood.

262
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,458
Promise me you're
not gonna run away again.

263
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,541
Promise me you'll stick around
for good this time, please!

264
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,166
You can't just
keep living in fear

265
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,125
of what could
happen to all of us.

266
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,500
I'll take care of
things no matter what.

267
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,291
You make life worth living!

268
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,541
And my life doesn't mean
anything if you're not in it!

269
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm not losing you again!
You can try and fight it,

270
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,291
but I'm not letting you go
until you promise me to stay!

271
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm just letting
you know what I want.

272
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,958
Call me selfish,
I don't give a damn!

273
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,541
Maybe you should do
something selfish for a change,

274
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,250
like letting yourself
get close to someone!

275
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,250
I don't believe that!

276
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,375
It's true.

277
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,875
From now on,
no matter what happens,

278
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,958
I'll stay by your side, Ayumu.

279
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,333
I can't guarantee
that it'll be easy.

280
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,375
I can deal with that.

281
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,208
But Ayumu, are you
sure you really want this?

282
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,666
You're positive?

283
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,958
You bet.

284
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,833
Is it selfish of me
to want to stay with you,

285
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,083
even though
I'll more than likely

286
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,166
end up putting you in danger?

287
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,208
No. You deserve to be happy.

288
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,875
I've always wondered
if I could live like this.

289
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,250
I guess we'll find out?

290
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,750
You're hurting me, Ayumu.

291
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,291
Oh! My bad,
sorry 'bout that.

292
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,166
Your wish. Did it come true?

293
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,583
That makes me very happy.

294
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,375
Yes, me too.

295
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:02,625
Incoming! Look out below!

296
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,333
I just traveled
all over the world!

297
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,791
That mist stuff can
be pretty freaking handy!

298
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,666
Welcome back, Haruna.

299
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,375
Whoa! So, she talks now?

300
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,958
Pretty surprising to hear her
voice for a change, isn't it?

301
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,583
Oh yeah, and she's
got a pretty cute one!

302
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,291
You should talk more.

303
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,375
Yeah, totally!

304
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,708
Duh, why do you
think I said that?

305
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,166
Hey, guys! I won passes
to the Yggdrasil resort!

306
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,541
Oh, hell yes!

307
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,333
We're gonna have
so much fun there!

308
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:41,291
A resort episode?
Finally! It's swimsuit time!

309
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,458
I don't want to see any
more of your flesh, maggot!

310
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:47,375
Gonna show some skin!
Gonna get real wet! Oh!

311
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,166
Come on Sera. You don't
even know what you're missing!

312
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,333
I saw you naked, remember?

313
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,125
I can speak.

00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,625
I never thought I'd be
able to talk to you like this.

315
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,083
At last I can say--

316
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,416
"I love you,
big, strong stud?"

317
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,583
Ayumu, stop being so delusional.

318
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,000
Sorry.

319
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,750
Don't rush things. We have
all the time in the world.

320
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,500
You are a zombie after all.
