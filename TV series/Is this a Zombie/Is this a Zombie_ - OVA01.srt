1
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,333
S'up, guys?

2
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,708
Long time no see...

3
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,208
Good to have you all back...

4
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,541
Sorry things got a little
crazy last episode...

5
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,875
Par for the course, though,
if you know what I'm sayin'...

6
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,291
But...

7
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,583
as you can see, the atmosphere's
a bit more tranquil--

8
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,083
Whatcha doin' Ayumu...?

9
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,250
You filming a reality show?

10
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,583
Don't touch that, dork!

11
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,958
You lookin' at me, tough guy?

12
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,041
Ya must be 'cause there ain't

13
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,166
no one else around
around to gawk at.

14
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,166
Cool!

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,041
This is like the most
awesome show ever!

16
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,625
Of course...

17
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,875
You putrefying maggot farm...

18
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,125
A hidden camera?

19
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,375
What...?!

20
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,541
How the hell's it hidden
when it's right out here

21
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,416
in the open?!

22
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,958
That's even more disgusting...!

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,083
So not only are we
being objectified...

24
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,041
we're expected to be
on board with it.

25
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,875
It's okay, I'm kinda
used to miscommunication.

26
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,708
I can hear you blathering...

27
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,250
Don't twist my disapproval
into hentai fodder.

28
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,750
So...

29
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,500
As you can see, things are
fairly amicable around here...

30
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,875
Sure, we bust each other's balls
like its goin' outta style,

31
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,291
but we do it with love...

32
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,250
Which, I should mention,
is a far cry from the way

33
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,916
things used to be
in this house--

34
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,583
Time to walk down memory lane!

35
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,583
Get a move on, Yukinori!

36
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,500
Right!

37
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,708
Let's do this!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,375
Kanami!

39
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,000
Heads up!

40
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,958
It's all you, Tae!

41
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,000
On it!

42
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,416
Swallow-Return Strike!

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,291
Oh, son of a...!

44
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,583
'Kay, best two out of three!

45
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,250
This is what
I'm talking 'bout...

46
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,750
Nothin' like an indoor pool
for livin' large.

47
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Hey!

48
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,750
Eyes front and center,
perv...!

49
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,416
My chest would be grateful.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,375
Sorry, but...

51
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,000
Have they always
been that perky?

52
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,916
It's called a push-up bra.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Well, yeah, it's just...

54
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,666
I mean, given the
raw materials and all...

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,666
It's fashion, Ayumu.

56
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,583
Look closer...

57
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,916
Her ta-tas are small...

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,541
But they're not all
a well-designed bra

59
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,875
has to work with...

60
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,166
It's rallying the troops
from all sides of her top.

61
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,416
That's cold.

62
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,375
Chicks have to do
what they can to fill out.

63
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,958
Preachin' to the choir.

64
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,666
That she's gone from a five to a
temporary seven is a testament--

65
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,750
Shut up...!

66
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,416
The only five here
is your manhood!.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,041
Ugh!

68
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,500
My chest is fine!

69
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,916
Now don't get violent...

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,416
And don't ever take
what he says to heart.

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,833
Neckwear-mancer?

72
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,125
Don't stare at me
like that, stud...

73
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,583
You know how bashful I am.

74
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,041
Huh?.

75
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,041
Oh...

76
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,458
Sorry, I just
kinda lost myself.

77
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,583
Jerk face...

78
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,250
Bleh...!

79
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,625
Whatevs.

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,458
Hiya, cutie.

81
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll take a medium smothered
in sprinkles -and when I say

82
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,458
smothered, hon, I mean I don't
want to see a millimeter

83
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,541
of the head exposed.

84
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,625
Huh?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,208
I'm coming!

86
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,750
I swear.

87
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,625
Only you could
sink on a kickboard.

88
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,541
Please Forgive me...

89
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,750
I don't know what I did,
but I know it was wrong.

90
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,083
Don't be so hard on yourself.

91
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,791
I'm sure that whatever god
watches over this pool

92
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,250
is just jealous of how good
a swimmer you are, ya know?

93
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
Oh, yes!

94
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,416
Sera, on the other hand,

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,625
has a built-in failsafe
against drowning.

96
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,958
Ayumu...

97
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,958
Hey, Tomonori.

98
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,458
Is it just me,

99
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,166
or is this place like the
perfect spot for a honeymoon?

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,583
Uh...

101
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,875
I guess?

102
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:27,541
Man...

103
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,583
Look at you...

104
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
It's not even fair, FYI...

105
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,041
What do vampire ninjas do
that you all look like models?

106
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,125
Well...

107
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,250
It's all about
training like a boss!

108
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,166
Um...

109
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,250
Random question...

110
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,333
Are you...

111
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,416
A Big Gulp or
tea cup kinda guy?

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,958
Excuse me?!

113
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,208
Aw Damn it...!

114
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,500
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

115
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,708
You kidding me...?

116
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,041
I'm having fun,
you should try it sometime!

117
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,208
I'm hunting the
Loch Ness Monster!

118
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,583
Strong.

119
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,416
Very strong.

120
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,500
So the maggot's befriended
a shutterbug...

121
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,375
Whatever is a self-respecting
girl to do...

122
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,208
about this
unfortunate infestation?

123
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,416
I'm tellin' ya: Nessie's here.

124
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,791
This pool is connected through
a series of subterranean rivers

125
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,458
to Scotland's Loch Ness.

126
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,375
There are more things
in heaven and earth

127
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,791
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

128
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,208
Yeah.

129
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,375
My adorable little roommate's
living proof of that.

130
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,166
After all, the Benzaiten
shrine feeds into

131
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,000
the Fuji Five Lakes...

132
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,083
so this place might actually
be connected to any number

133
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,375
of Scotland's lochs.

134
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,875
Wow, you really think so?

135
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,458
Please be careful
what you say...

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,416
This one'll believe anything.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Sold!

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,250
Follow me if you
wanna bag a serpent!

139
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,750
I'll pass.

140
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,041
Knock yourself out tryin'
to nab a fictional plesiosaur;

141
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,083
I've got a swimming
lesson to give.

142
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,125
Fine!

143
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,041
And boom...

144
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,458
Into the sunset.

145
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,000
Do what?

146
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,041
No way.

147
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,083
Answer me this.

148
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,708
What do you think of her?

149
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, then there's no reason why
the two of you can't be friends.

150
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,541
She's easier to warm up
to than you think.

151
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,166
Target acquired!

152
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,666
Huh...?

153
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,625
What now?!

154
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,416
Come on, Nessie!

155
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,166
What the hell is she doing...?

156
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,333
Okay, just so all of you know,

157
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
there' no way that's
a real sea monster.

158
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,916
Settle down, pretty girl.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,625
Hey...!

160
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,750
Don't be such an idiot!

161
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,000
That's not Nessie,
it's a blow up toy!!

162
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,916
Ayumu!

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,125
Yeah, what is it?

164
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,791
Wanna kick it with me?

165
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,541
Kind of in the middle of some--

166
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,041
Oh, yeah?

167
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,500
Aw, son of a...!

168
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,083
I gotta go, sorry...

169
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,625
See ya!

170
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,125
Great, I take my eyes off her
for a second and she's gone!

171
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,666
Um, Ayumu...

172
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,875
Holy crap...

173
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,458
Could, you...

174
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,125
oil me up, maybe...

175
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,458
please?

176
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:55,750
I'm...

177
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
sorta busy...

178
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I see...

179
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,041
So, no?

180
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,875
Her skin is delicate.

181
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,500
No...

182
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,458
No, I can't...

183
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,333
I wouldn't be right...

184
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,166
I've got to...

185
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,666
Do...

186
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,333
Something...

187
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,208
Else...

188
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,708
I forget what, but...

189
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,125
Oh god...

190
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,875
Maybe just a quick slather.

191
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,541
Good girl.

192
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,083
Way to go, chica.

193
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,041
Haruna...

194
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,375
Oh no.

195
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,666
Are you man enough
to take a dip with me?

196
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,666
But I've already
wasted so much ...

197
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,833
Is that so...?

198
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,333
You're not tempted?

199
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,208
Damn it!

200
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,541
I keep getting distracted!

201
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,875
No!

202
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,666
She might fall in too.

203
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,541
Come now...

204
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,166
What could possibly be wrong?

205
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,125
This...

206
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,000
sounds weird...

207
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,958
But I have to leave you for Eu.

208
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,875
I see how it is.

209
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,291
I'm a party girl...

210
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,291
The easy pickin's you come
to when you're in need of

211
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,541
a distraction.

212
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,416
What?

213
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,208
If that's how things stand...

214
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,541
I'll have to brave
the water alone.

215
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,500
Uh-oh...

216
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,583
Wardrobe malfunction
in the works.

217
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,541
Can't let her walk off untied...

218
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,041
Have to fix it...

219
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,000
Without her noticing...

220
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,083
Okay, it's not what
you think it is!

221
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,791
I was just trying--

222
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,041
You vile, simpering,

223
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,291
booger-twirling troglodyte
of a maggot farm!

224
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,750
Float like a death's head moth,
sting like when you pee,

225
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,958
you bitch!

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Uh...

227
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,583
Why am I dressed like this?

228
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,125
Good, you're awake.

229
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,583
Um, hi?

230
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,833
Get off me!

231
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,458
I'm drowning here!

232
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,875
Wait, is that...

233
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,125
Of course.

234
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,625
Observe the fate of sexual
deviants who presume to snap

235
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,750
covert pictures
of girls underwater...

236
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,875
Similar punitive measures are
in store for bikini snatchers.

237
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,916
Come on!

238
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,583
No mercy...

239
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,208
Swallow...

240
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,625
Return Strike!

241
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,791
That's it, kiddo; let loose...

242
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,958
Oh, teenagers.

243
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,041
Avast, me hearties!

244
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,583
Thar she blows!

245
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,041
Hey, when did you become
a Loch Ness Monster?

246
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:39,958
When do you think...?

247
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:40,958
Ugh.

248
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,458
Get me out of
this stupid thing.

249
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,666
Killjoy.

250
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,666
So what's your deal...?

251
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,250
Why're you acting like this?

252
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,666
Oh I dunno...

253
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,375
I just...

254
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,125
wanted quality time
with Neckwear-mancer.

255
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,583
Now I get it...

256
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,416
Haruna wasn't really thinkin'
she'd find Nessie here.

257
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,208
She just wanted
to hang out with Eu.

258
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,333
That explains the weirdness
with everyone else, too;

259
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,750
they didn't want me
to butt in on the bonding.

260
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,041
Goofballs.

261
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,791
That's cool and all...

262
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,708
But, I mean why
disguise your motives?

263
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,375
Well...

264
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,458
Because, butthole...

265
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,041
I'm embarrassed.

266
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:26,833
Hey-hey...!

267
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,291
Good news...

268
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,125
Haruna's actually all about
bein' buddy-buddy with ya.

269
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,500
And there you have it...

270
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,708
Friends doin' what friends do:
drivin' each other nuts.

271
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,375
Out of love, of course.

272
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,791
What's the old saying
about death and taxes?

273
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,750
You know the one, right?

274
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,250
Two things in life
that are certain.

275
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,333
I'd add to that list a few
observations of my own, though.

276
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,416
Stuff like homework, dropping
chopsticks on the floor,

277
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,833
stepping on thumbtacks,
getting your prints all over

278
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,500
a piece of scotch tape, blisters
from breakin' in new shoes.

279
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,208
Etcetera.

280
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,125
Sure, sounds like
a parade of suck when

281
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,000
you start naming 'em
all off, but I dunno...

282
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,625
In a way they're comforting.

283
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,708
Hey...

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,375
You really need to work on

285
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,416
building up some non-violent
communication techniques.

286
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,833
Now's not the time
to whine; what have you got?

287
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,166
'Scuse me??

288
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,958
That's what I get for
expecting a half-way house

289
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,708
forcoprophagic beetles
like you to look at a calendar.

290
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,166
Oh crap.

291
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,125
Eu's birthday is tomorrow?

292
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,333
Yes.

293
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,500
But I've got it covered...

294
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,375
We're throwing her
a big surprise party.

295
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,250
Nice...!

296
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,791
And surprisingly thoughtful...!

297
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,833
We've got to get Tomonori and
Orito in on this thing, too.

298
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,083
Don't forget yours truly...!

299
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,125
If anybody knows how to milk
a surprise, it's a genius.

300
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,541
So...

301
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,458
like, what are we doin' in
the way of birthday presents?

302
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,833
You're on your own.

303
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,250
Me...?

304
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,333
I'm giving her something
she'll love: a new accessory...

305
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,583
And it's only fair I warn you,
whatever you come up with,

306
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,166
you don't want to follow me.

307
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
Confident, huh?

308
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,958
Would that be an invitation
to some one-upmanship?

309
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,208
Whatever gives you hope
in the eleventh hour, maggot.

310
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,000
Challenge accepted.

311
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,958
I will not be ignored!!!

312
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,875
Whoa...!

313
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,583
You're inviting us to a party?!

314
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,125
Yup

315
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,541
I haven't been asked to a social
function since kindergarten!

316
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,083
Come on...

317
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,666
Hey.

318
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,583
Don't cry...

319
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,000
You're a late bloomer.

320
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,500
So,,, I can come too?

321
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,083
Yeah...

322
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:44,708
Of course.

323
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,166
Oh...

324
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,416
Thank you!

325
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,500
I totally need to
go shopping for a gift.

326
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,375
Hey, uh...

327
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,000
What cup size are you?

328
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:53,916
Oh, I'm an E...

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,791
Wait...!

330
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,500
I didn't meant to answer you!

331
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,375
Calm down...

332
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,916
I'm just using you as a proxy...

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,375
So if you're an E,
Eu's probably...

334
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,125
I'm so gonna rack you!

335
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:03,708
Wack me?

336
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,416
Rack!

337
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,541
Like rack your balls!

338
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,958
Hey, I'd be cool with that, too.

339
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,500
The items requested
by Seraphim.

340
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,458
Unless you prefer me
to force-feed them to you,

341
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,958
I suggest you take
them off my hands.

342
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:20,958
Uh...

343
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,375
Oh-kay...

344
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,583
You are hereby entrusted
with ingredients sacred

345
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,375
to Vampire Ninja tradition
so don't screw it up...

346
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,625
Or sneak a bite.

347
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,916
Not a problem.

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,791
Help me!

349
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,916
I'm being sexually harassed!

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,791
Take my word for it, perv:
this isn't sexual!

351
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,041
She's a man-eater!

352
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
A man-eater!!!

353
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,166
Which means you'd have a real
problem, if you were a man!

354
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,333
Hope Eu gets
a kick outta all this.

355
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,375
So, uh...

356
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,041
Got Anything in mind for dinner
or are we just wingin' it?

357
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,416
Distract Lady Hellscythe however
you can till the house is ready.

358
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,625
We'll need some time,
so lay it on thick.

359
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,833
Tell you what...

360
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,000
Why I don't I let you
decide tonight?

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,458
Let me give it some thought...

362
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,875
Pot stew would be
absolutely divine!

363
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,041
What kind of
pot stew ya like?

364
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,958
Let's see...

365
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,041
The kind that's layered
like the strata of hell...

366
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,125
Each infernal level more
harrowing than the one

367
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,333
that came before...

368
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,541
A horrifying hodgepodge
Dante, at his best,

369
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,875
would scoff to invent.

370
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,583
Not gonna lie:
you make it sound delicious...

371
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,416
What's with the look?

372
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,750
Something wrong?

373
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,041
Play it off.

374
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,208
Ruin the surprise
and it's my ass.

375
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:32,916
Huh...

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
Totally slipped my mind.

377
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,500
Hey...

378
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,083
I was joking back there
about letting your big day

379
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,583
slip my mind; in fact we've been
workin' on something for you.

380
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,083
Let's get to the house and I'll
show you what I'm talkin' about.

381
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
It's a birthday, not Halloween!

382
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,333
Haruna, I swear to god!

383
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:36,916
"If we don't proceed carefully,
we may never get back out.

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,125
I told you we geniuses
know how to milk a surprise!

385
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,666
Is Sera in on this?

386
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,750
Leaf Lady's happily doing
her part -in the kitchen.

387
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,000
Treat your taste buds to my
Periodic Table Double-melt...!

388
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,250
High in thallium,
low in sodium.

389
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,291
This is nuts...!

390
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,750
It's a party!

391
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh my, someone's gonna be
turned into sausage,

392
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,916
'less they can
find the way out.

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,833
Hardy har...!

394
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,583
Is this your idea of a joke?!

395
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,958
If you don't want to be smushed,

396
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,333
massage the sweet spot
with your index finger.

397
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,125
I see it!

398
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,458
Boo-ya!

399
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,250
Well done!

400
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:27,833
Son of a...

401
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,041
This isn't funny anymore!

402
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,208
Now then: which rope to ascend?

403
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,000
The silver?

404
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:32,750
The golden?

405
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,708
Or the Copper?

406
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,208
Damn it.

407
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,291
Ugh...

408
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,083
I am gonna ram my foot
so far up your--

409
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,916
Well done again!

410
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,916
Seriously...?!

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,416
This is getting real old!

412
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,666
Your next challenge--

413
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,791
Forget it; I'm not
pushing any more buttons.

414
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,916
Right on the money!

415
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
Screw this.

416
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,875
What is it...?

417
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,458
This isn't your fault...

418
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,166
No...

419
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,125
Haruna's just a moron.

420
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,583
Cheer up.

421
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,916
Well, we made it...

422
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,666
Barely...

423
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,125
Do me a favor...

424
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,833
See to it the rest of
your day is awesome-sauce.

425
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,250
Yo... Hope we're not
running behind--

426
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,458
Welcome to the party.

427
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,625
Dude, seriously...!

428
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,416
You're sparkling
like a Mormon vampire!

429
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,958
Hey, I thought it'd be
appropriate because birthdays

430
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,708
are a celebration of survival.

431
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,375
Fair enough...

432
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,083
but...

433
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,375
a little bit extreme.

434
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,250
Look, thing is,
Magical Garment Girls

435
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,416
are always fighting Megalos...

436
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,916
It's hard...

437
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
Make it from one birthday
to the next and you're lucky...

438
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,333
Like, really lucky...

439
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,166
Can't expect it
to hold forever...

440
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,416
I mean, it's only a matter of
time before your number's up.

441
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,291
It may seem lame to you guys,
but the way our culture sees it,

442
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,250
is birthdays are just a
reminder of your mortality.

443
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,375
Wow, leave it to you
to bring the room down...

444
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,083
Can we switch gears, please?

445
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,250
Hey!

446
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,958
It's time for some yummies!

447
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,125
A special meal
for the birthday girl!

448
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,458
That looks weird.

449
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,916
Have you never
eaten shabu-shabu?

450
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
It's like sex.

451
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
I am not eating
anything remotely like that

452
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,500
with you around!

453
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,250
Okey-dokey, prezzie time!

454
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,541
Yay!

455
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,958
Start with, the one from Sera!

456
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,208
Next up, open mine.

457
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,875
Bazonga-X!

458
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,125
You, are an all-occasion perv.

459
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,583
Oh, and I guess you got her
something better?

460
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, duh!

461
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,458
Ta-da!

462
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
You can never have too much
of this stuff, am I right?

463
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,750
Actually that was
pretty kick-ass.

464
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,541
Yeah...

465
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,125
You're always using
that little teacup...

466
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,708
So I thought maybe you'd like
some variety for your beverages.

467
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,916
Glad you're pleased.

468
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,666
I'm likin' the smile.

469
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,375
Just out of curiosity...

470
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,916
Who's birthday gift was your
favorite out of the bunch?

471
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,208
Yeah!!!

472
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:00,750
Wow.

473
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,041
Thanks a lot.

474
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:05,833
Alright.

475
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,416
Time for cake.

476
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,291
We're all unlucky
sometimes, sure...

477
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,291
Hell, every now and then
things get so rough

478
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,125
it's all you can do
just to carry on.

479
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,750
Who hasn't been there, right?

480
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,500
But birthdays are special.

481
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,750
They should always see
you tilted to catch the wind;

482
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,625
give you the kind of smile
that makes people wonder

483
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,208
what you're up to.

484
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,583
So, uh...

485
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,166
Exactly how many years
we celebratin' here?

486
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,833
Um, how old are you,
Lady Hellscythe?

487
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,666
Sweet dreams, everyone.

488
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,041
Thank you all for making
this the first birthday

489
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,333
I've been happy to celebrate.

490
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,875
But a lady never
reveals her age.
