1
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,208
Hiya, peeps...

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,416
Been a little while, hasn't it?

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,291
The more things
change, am I right?

4
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,291
Some seriously
good popsicles here.

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,458
Thank Haruna if you
like them so much...

6
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,333
Apparently someone online has
the time to blog about sweets...

7
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,833
And she of course has the
time to follow their posts.

8
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,250
Kudos.

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,083
Internet foodies: it's an
exciting time to be alive.

10
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,083
If there's a better way to beat
the heat, I don't even care.

11
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,083
Who knew popsicle technology
would come so far?

12
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,250
It's like a party
in my mouth!

13
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,000
Trying to focus on
my snack here, babe.

14
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,416
Target locked...

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,041
Watch me swoop in and destroy
a green tea one next.

16
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,125
Easy, chops:
that's your tenth one...

17
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,750
Your tummy's
gonna bitch you out.

18
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,833
Yeah, right...

19
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,750
I have a crazy
high pain threshold...

20
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,041
A little stomachache
never killed anybody.

21
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,458
That's a healthy attitude...

22
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,791
Should I dial for
an ambulance now?

23
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,791
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,958
So, yeah.

25
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,916
Welcome back to Weirdsville,
ladies and germs.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,916
Never a dull moment.

27
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,333
As our reluctant, perverted
hero picks his moment to pry

28
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,291
Haruna's stolen powers from
Chris' grasp, Gaia hovers

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,583
to drop an even greater
challenge in his lap.

30
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,125
Of course, he's oblivious.

31
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,875
And by "greater," I mean the
single most ruthless challenge

32
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
he's ever faced...

33
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,791
Not gonna lie:
being undead has its cons.

34
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,500
Wrinkles, for one.

35
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,125
Little buggers keep poppin' up
even when I'm not in the sun.

36
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,041
Rise and shine!

37
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,333
Bit early on a Sunday to be
dealing with you, isn't it?

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,916
If I'd waited
till you woke up,

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,666
we'd have missed
the flea market.

40
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,625
And I should care
about this, why?

41
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,500
Clams, bro...

42
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,541
It's a good way to stack up

43
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,666
a few while you
get rid of old crap.

44
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,125
Of course...

45
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,833
It's boring as hell 'less you
know how to add some spice.

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,083
So... I challenge you
to a sell-off!

47
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,458
Coming at you Sunday,
Sunday, Sunday...

48
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,250
You and Lady Hellscythe
get the booth set up...

49
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,791
While you do that,
I'll grab more boxes...

50
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,541
 Sound good?

51
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,083
Okey-dokey .

52
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
Guess you can start
by puttin' these guys out.

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,125
I would do anything I can,
to help my Big Stud.

54
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,375
That's my girl...

55
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,875
Nothing like a menial
task to bring us closer.

56
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,750
Seriously?

57
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,166
You're in on this?

58
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,083
Question...

59
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,375
Level with me...

60
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,958
What exactly was the point
of tripping the wire

61
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,916
on Haruna's competitive streak?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,791
You know the old saying:
when the wind blows,

63
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,958
the bucket guys
make out like bandits.

64
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:01,875
I do?

65
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,666
Wait...

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,000
I fudged that...

67
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,541
Basically it's the same
as saying one in the hand

68
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,291
is worth two in the bush,
know what I mean?

69
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,500
Point is...!

70
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,083
If Little Miss Hates-to-Lose
is on the case,

71
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,708
I know I gotta dig deep
and bring my A-game.

72
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,333
That's good for business.

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,958
Pink elephants on parade...

74
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,083
And the idea of her throwing
every dirty trick she knows

75
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,791
at me is kind of appealing.

76
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,083
It's winner take all,
my friend...

77
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,458
But the loser might just get
a whiff of moth-balled panties

78
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,500
in the bargain.

79
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,083
What is wrong with you?

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,500
You have quite a lot to learn

81
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,208
if that's your idea
of displaying the goods...

82
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,583
Put the box down
and find somewhere else

83
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,625
to stare into space.

84
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,958
Hello, beautiful!

85
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,041
Slow your roll.

86
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,083
Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

87
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Look, I'll get the stuff
sorted; you help Haruna...

88
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,291
Think that's
something you can handle?

89
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
Hey, uh...

90
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,833
You could come and be the mascot
for my booth, if you want!

91
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,583
Must your voice go up
three octaves every time

92
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,083
you address me, filth...?

93
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,791
It's like nails
on a chalkboard.

94
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,375
Right, right...

95
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,625
Tone is everything
to potential customers;

96
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,875
don't want to scare them off...!

97
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,916
Free tip from the
master saleswoman!

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,250
I don't think she meant
for you to take that

99
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,791
as encouragement, dude.

100
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:14,625
So?

101
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,958
How's tricks?

102
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,791
Anything I can do
to lend a hand?

103
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,833
As if...!

104
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,000
There'll be popsicle
stands in hell

105
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,666
the day a born
hocker like me needs help!

106
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,750
Yeah, about that...

107
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,541
Your prices aren't
exactly competitive.

108
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,041
Don't tell me
how to run a business!

109
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,791
'less you know a way I could
unload some of this junk.

110
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,500
Well, let's see,
you could, uh...

111
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,541
start with some nicer stuff.

112
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,791
Huh...

113
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,458
Like this little do-hickey,
for example.

114
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,541
Except...

115
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,625
You might wanna
put a price tag on it.

116
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,500
This "do-hickey"
isn't for sale.

117
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,166
Then what in the heck
is it doin' out here?

118
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,708
What's it gonna take
to get this stuff movin'?

119
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,250
'kay, look.

120
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,041
For starters, take a couple
zeros off what you're asking.

121
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,583
Think cheap.

122
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,166
Alright, fine.

123
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,000
Pleasure doing
business with you, hon.

124
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,875
Uh...

125
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,583
Did she escape from the zoo?

126
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,750
Hey now...

127
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,958
Don't look a gift cheetah
in the mouth.

128
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,458
I could've taken her
for more...!

129
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,625
I swear on my life,
if four-eyes wins this...!

130
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,458
Feast your peepers on value!

131
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,250
Anybody get a look at what he's
tryin' to pawn off over there?

132
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,375
Come n' get 'em while
they're hot, folks...!

133
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,250
Oh sweetie, don't
look at this trash.

134
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,083
Seriously, what kind of fascist
dystopia are we living in?

135
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,375
It ever occur to you
that a flea market

136
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,333
isn't the best place
to sell these?

137
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,208
Whatever, dude.

138
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,875
Sexy's always in demand.

139
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,083
Who the hell gets
turned on by cartoons?

140
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,708
These are precious.

141
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,625
How much?

142
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,708
300, please.

143
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,875
Quite a bargain.

144
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,750
Be sure to tell
all your friends about us!

145
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,958
Ayumu.

146
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,333
How's it goin'?

147
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,250
Whoa...

148
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,000
Did'ya make all
of these yourself?

149
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,541
I'm kinda crafty.

150
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,250
Trust me, this girl
knows exactly what to do

151
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
with a bun in the oven.

152
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,291
I can tell.

153
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,083
This stuff looks
good enough to eat!

154
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:21,875
Pay up!

155
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,791
Say what?

156
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,083
You touch it, you bought it.

157
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,416
It's wrapped.

158
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,083
I'll take a couple of those,
too, while you're at it.

159
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,166
That'll be an even 300,
good sir.

160
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,583
The second one...

161
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,208
I'll throw in free.

162
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,458
Oh, uh, thanks.

163
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,333
Hey, Ayumu!

164
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,541
You know, ramen does sound
pretty good right about now.

165
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,083
Hop on over and have a bowl!

166
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,916
You know you want some!

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,333
Yeah, okay...

168
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,875
I was just sayin' how
some would really hit the spot.

169
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Here ya go!

170
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,833
Holy crap...

171
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
Might just be the
best bowl I've ever had.

172
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,083
Oh...

173
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,833
Stop it, you're gonna
give me an ego.

174
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,583
Just callin' it
like I see it...

175
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,958
I know my ramen; nothing
I've had compares to this.

176
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,791
And you're not
just saying that...?

177
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,875
Well, here then.

178
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
Try this out and
tell me what you think.

179
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,708
Wow.

180
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,625
Fancy.

181
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,458
On the house.

182
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,875
It's sensei's recipe.

183
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,000
I guess you got
Haruna's secret out of her.

184
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,416
Sort of...

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,416
But I've got a ways to go
before I'm good as her...

186
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,708
What's the verdict?

187
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,583
Honest...?

188
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,750
It's pretty darn close.

189
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,125
Really...?

190
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,708
This may sound a little
kooky, but, I had a feeling

191
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,083
today's batch was gonna turn out
to be an extra special one...

192
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:38,625
Oh...

193
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,125
That's right...

194
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,333
Have a lookie.

195
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
The Kira-Kira Shop
is doing a cross-promotion

196
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,208

199
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,208
Nifty, huh?

200
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,291
♪ Your eyes may
give me what I need ♪

201
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,083
♪ Undying worship's
how I feed ♪

202
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,250
She may need to think
about getting a new agent.

203
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,833
And...

204
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,208
every CD on sale today features
one of 33 special collectible

205
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,291

207
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,041
Some are available
for individual sale...

208
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,125
Boom.

209
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,125
I must have all of them!

210
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,458
"Sexy's always
in demand" right?

211
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,916
Thank you very much...

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,750
May gleaming viscera ooze
out of your enraptured ears.

213
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,916
My headphones'll be so sticky!

214
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,458
Hit me, Kirara!

215
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,166
I can't wait anymore!

216
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,291
Love the enthusiasm.

217
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,916
Hate the rudeness.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,333
Cut in line again...

219
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,708
And I'll see to it your
entrails are used to rope off

220
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,250
the next one,
you sloshing sack of offal.

221
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,375
Uh, yes ma'am!

222
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,458
You tell him, Kirara!

223
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,833
Man, that was seriously hot.

224
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,916
What's wrong with you people?!

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,208
I'm totally drowning in value!

226
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,375
And don't get me
started on variety!

227
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,041
If you can't find it here,
you just ain't lookin'!

228
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,875
What does that horndog
have that I don't?

229
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,500
Guess it's that time of day
when his target audience

230
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,666
comes crawling out the woodwork.

231
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,541
Sorry, guys; limit one copy
per customer, please.

232
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,125
Whoa, dude!

233
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:15,666
Is this...?

234
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,208
Ah...!

235
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,625
Good eye, sir!

236
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,416
Yes, that's a premiere
edition you're holding there.

237
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,208
Clientele like that is
every merchant's wet dream.

238
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,791
Jackholes...

239
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,958
Why can't they give
pink elephants a chance?

240
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,541
Oh, come on, you've still
got a shot, Haruna...!

241
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,625
Just break out
your secret weapon!

242
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,333
Sera's sweet you-know-what...

243
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
Thank you very much.

244
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,291
Um...

245
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,750
I think I like this one.

246
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,791
Hey...

247
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,500
Mind if I pick it up
and have a look?

248
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,333
She's luring 'em
in like gangbusters.

249
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,000
Could you maybe
hand this one to me, miss?

250
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,500
Of course.

251
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,250
That's our whole economy...!

252
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,166
I see it now!

253
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,958
Haruna...!

254
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,666
That's the answer!

255
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,916
What is?

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,875
Never mind...

257
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,333
We might as well pack it in.

258
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,041
Don't even talk to me
like that!

259
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,625
I'm a Magical Garment girl
with top notch brains...!

260
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,500
I'm not just gonna
throw in the towel...!

261
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,458
I've still got a shot...

262
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,916
I can win this thing.

263
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,750
I agree.

264
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,750
Now is no time to quit.

265
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
You wouldn't want to
disappoint your customers.

266
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,250
Where did they all come from?

267
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
Sensei!

268
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,625
We can do this together!

269
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,333
Just put us to work.

270
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,375
Okay...

271
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,875
What's going on?

272
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,333
Ah, yes...

273
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,916
I see it now...

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,875
The bargain-hunting public has
come to its collective senses...

275
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,833
Step right up savvy shoppers...!

276
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,041
Everything on the
blanket is half off!

277
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,833
Hell yeah!

278
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,041
Step right up!

279
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,375
Spoiled.

280
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,583
Thank you!

281
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,500
What about this...?

282
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,833
There's no price tag?

283
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,333
Oh, I dunno...

284
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,666
That thing's not even mine,
it belongs to the Leaf Lady.

285
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,625
Name your price and I'll pay...!

286
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,666
Whatever you want, it's yours!

287
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,458
Alrighty, then...

288
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
How 'bout all the earnings
from your flea market till...?

289
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,083
Which would also mean
that the victor

290
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,333
in today's
little contest is moi.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,708
Okay I give up!

292
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,833
Up up up 

293
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,250
Son of a--where the hell
did it go?

294
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:55,750
Oh man...

295
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,291
All in a day's work, huh?

296
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,625
Yuck...

297
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,208
This stuff tastes like piss
squeezed through a dirty sock...

298
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,041
Haruna...

299
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,916
What is this?

300
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,416
Crap, crap, crap!

301
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,083
It's gone!

302
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,166
Uh, Haruna...

303
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:09,833
Is this...

304
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,500
like, uh...

305
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,000
supposed to happen?

306
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,708
'cause if it is, this stuff
should have warning label!!!

307
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,250
Hey!

308
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
You don't have to treat me
like I'm invisible!

309
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,625
That's what you get.

310
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,125
Maybe next time
you'll think twice before

311
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,750
helping yourself to my
super secret invention...

312
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,083
Sneaky dill weed.

313
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,750
Guzzling my elixir while
I'm on my hands and knees

314
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,541
searching for a
philosopher's stone!

315
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,125
Why would ya leave
an invisibility potion

316
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,791
lying around?

317
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,375
To who...?!

318
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,583
Peeing Toms?!

319
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,291
I advised her not to.

320
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,625
Just so you know,

321
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,666
your thirst cheated me
out of a small fortune...

322
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
Maybe I'm mad...

323
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,125
Maybe you owe me.

324
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,000
Am I ever gonna change back,
or am I stuck this way?!

325
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,250
Relax...

326
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,958
It's not designed
to last forever, okay...?

327
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,416
You oughtta be able
to check yourself out

328
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,583
in a mirror again real soon.

329
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,375
Oughtta?

330
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,833
What do you mean oughtta?

331
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,416
Never mind that for now...

332
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,916
I'd like us to focus more on
the philosopher's stone Haruna

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,416
lost at the flea market.

334
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,708
We need to find it and seal it
up as soon as possible...

335
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,500
Left outside of its
special box long enough

336
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,916
it's bound to go rogue...

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,583
It'll spontaneously
produce things like

338
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,458
that disgusting slime again.

339
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,208
So the fact that it's out there
floating around on its own

340
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,625
right now is a big deal...

341
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,791
Probably.

342
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,125
Then we need to get it
back, don't we...?

343
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,458
But you sold it and
you don't remember to who...

344
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,583
Could be anybody.

345
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah, no kidding.

346
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,916
The whole damn student body
was jostlin' your tchotchkes.

347
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,208
It's unlikely whoever bought it
is aware of its significance.

348
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,583
Remember that blond hottie with
the midriff who was browsing

349
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,416
for a present to herself?

350
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,083
I have a sneaking
suspicion it was her.

351
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,583
Of course it was.

352
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,958
Good instincts.

353
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,083
World's most adorable
detective right here...

354
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,458
Wait a second.

355
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,333
If it's true our culprit
was a girl, we're screwed...

356
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,000
The school's doing
physical exams tomorrow.

357
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,291
You're invisible, silly.

358
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,625
And it goes without
saying you're brave.

359
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,833
That makes you
the perfect private eye.

360
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,083
You do have a point there...

361
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:30,625
Alright!

362
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,166
Let's do this!

363
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,958
Swallow-Return Strike!

364
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,166
Don't even put into words
whatever vile shenanigans

365
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,666
you're dreaming up!

366
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,166
That's right, kids.

367
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,166
I'm a zombie, a Magical Garment
Girl, and now, evidently,

368
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,791
the Invisible Man...

369
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,458
Complicated life.

370
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:52,958
Right.

371
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,291
I'm out.

372
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,291
Don't have
too much fun, jackass!

373
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,750
'kay...

374
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,916
Commence Operation Creeper.

375
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,625
You know, I could
get used to this, actually.

376
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,000
Invisibility's a breeze.

377
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,666
Speaking of breeze...

378
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,250
Hmm...?

379
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Oh, right...

380
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,666
I'm naked as a jaybird...

381
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,916
I'm about to hop the proverbial
garden wall in my birthday suit!

382
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,333
Oh, man.

383
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,083
How's a guy
s'posed to concentrate?

384
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,958
Ugh.

385
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,083
Pull yourself together.

386
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,583
Get in, get out.

387
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,583
Oh my god!!

388
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,333
I've gained, like,
so much weight!

389
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:37,875
Whoops.

390
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,541
My bad.

391
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,375
Oh...

392
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,916
that was kinda weird.

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,958
Something wrong?

394
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,750
I just felt some creepy touch.

395
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,000
Must've just been
your imagination.

396
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,333
Wow, twenty centimeters,
look at you...!

397
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,708
Somebody's been doing
Pilates on the side.

398
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,916
Pilates and whole milk.

399
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,791
Snap out of it, dude!

400
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,000
This is beyond wrong...!

401
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,250
Two times two is four;

402
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,958
two times three is six;
two times four is eight.

403
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,875
Tomonori doesn't have the stone.

404
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,083
Moving on.

405
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,500
Alright, Kanami;
give it your best shot!

406
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,583
You can do it.

407
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,250
Way to go; fourteen point five.

408
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,875
Not bad, but
I don't think she has it.

409
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,791
Looks like you hold
the record so far, Yuki...

410
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,083
Your turn.

411
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,458
Okay.

412
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,875
Stay strong...

413
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,000
Yowza!

414
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,333
Seven centimeters.

415
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,500
Give me a break, Tae,
you're not even trying...

416
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,291
Now go down there
like you believe it.

417
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,125
Hey...!

418
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,625
Be nice, I'm doing my best.

419
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,208
Try bending more from the waist.

420
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,750
Well where else am I
supposed to bend from?

421
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,833
Looks good,
but no sign of the stone.

422
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,708
Alright, girls!

423
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,500
Upper body extensions are next!

424
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,750
Show us how it's done, babe.

425
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,958
I'm on it.

426
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,500
I love physical fitness.

427
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,833
Look at 'er go...!

428
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,750
Well, I can safely rule out
these two, I think.

429
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,666
Maybe it's on her.

430
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,500
Don't even think about it,
girl: just go for it...

431
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,750
I've got your feet.

432
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,833
Wish me luck!

433
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,541
Good luck!

434
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,750
You got this!

435
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,916
Show us the merchandise!

436
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,500
Okay...

437
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,750
No dice...

438
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,291
Well done, though.

439
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,208
That's it for, me!

440
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,708
Oh wow...!

441
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,708
that's gotta be a new record!

442
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,041
Awesome-sauce!

443
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:51,583
That girl...

444
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,166
Wow.

445
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,791
Just, wow.

446
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,625
Didn't hurt yourself, did ya?

447
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,666
Uh-uh...

448
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,166
I just felt kinda...

449
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,583
I don't know how
to describe it, really.

450
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,625
No, no, no, no!

451
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,500
Not now!

452
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,916
I'm gonna get busted.

453
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,291
Wait, bad choice of words!

454
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:09,833
Damn it, man!

455
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,083
Focus!

456
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
An invisibility technique...

457
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Who is this?

458
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,708
Oh crap...

459
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,750
I have ways of finding out.

460
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,291
Excellent muscle tone...

461
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,416
What's my dirty
darling up to now?

462
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,625
Listen to me...

463
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,125
I'm not doing
what you think I am.

464
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,500
Ayamu, you cheeky bastard.

465
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,458
Way to let your bud
suffer out here.

466
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,125
That's the story, I swear.

467
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,583
I take your word for it...

468
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,458
Letting the stone
float freely invites disaster...

469
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,916
You're going to need my help.

470
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,291
That'd be awesome.

471
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,291
Very well.

472
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,291
Standby...

473
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,166
It's Saras.

474
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,791
You realize I'm gonna
owe you my life for this?

475
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,666
Form a dragnet.

476
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,750
We're doing lost and found.

477
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,125
Guess I can head back home.

478
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:07,958
What?!

479
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,333
You've got to be kidding me!

480
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,208
Oh god!

481
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,458
Not here, not here, not here!

482
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,958
Like my yearbook blurb
isn't already gonna read

483
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,875
like a rap sheet!

484
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
Where was I s'posed to stash
an emergency pair of pants...?!

485
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,000
I've got to find something...

486
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,583
I'll never hear
the end of this!

487
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,333
Hello?

488
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,750
Someone back there?

489
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,791
Why does my luck
have to suck balls?!

490
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,208
Ah, what the hell.

491
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm already a
cross-dressing perv;

492
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,916
why not a full-fledged
streaker to boot...?

493
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,333
Maybe they'll name a piece
of legislation after me.

494
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,333
Oh...

495
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,833
What are you doing in here?

496
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,333
Oh...!

497
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,916
You know...

498
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,375
I'm looking for
my contact lenses!

499
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,791
Funny, I thought
for sure you'd be Orito...

500
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,125
He's more of a creeper.

501
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,666
Of all the people
to be confused for...!

502
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,791
What did you expect, man?

503
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,208
Put yourself in her shoes!

504
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:53,916
Please...

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I know this looks bad...

506
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,416
But I'm honestly
not up to anything...

507
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,666
perverted...

508
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,166
Worst.

509
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,708
Defense.

510
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,958
Ever.

511
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,208
It's cool...

512
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,333
I believe you.

513
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,583
Seriously?!

514
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,708
What is wrong with her?

515
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,708
I wouldn't!

516
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,166
You know, if you'd like me to...

517
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,166
I could bring you
something to cover up with.

518
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, That would be wonderful...

519
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,208
Cuz...

520
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,708
I left all my clothes
at home in the wash.

521
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,541
I see...

522
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,916
Interesting...

523
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
How did you get
to school today, then?

524
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,125
Uh...

525
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,916
I ran like a maniac?

526
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,625
Way to sell it, dumbass.

527
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,791
I'm gonna go out on a limb

528
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,291
and say you're not
looking for contacts.

529
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,958
And you would be correct.

530
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,875
Problem solved...

531
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,083
Here'ya go.

532
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,416
Oh my god, you're a lifesaver!

533
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,708
Could you maybe turn
around for sec, please?

534
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,250
Oh...!

535
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,791
Yes, of course.

536
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,166
Hey, mind if I ask
what this is?

537
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,625
Pretty cute, isn't it...?

538
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,208
Just a lil' something
I bought from Haruna

539
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,125
at the flea market yesterday.

540
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,000
Is this for sale?

541
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,500
I'd love to have it.

542
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,791
Sure, no problem.

543
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,000
I'll even give you
a special helper's discount.

544
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,166
This is actually what
I've been looking for.

545
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,791
What a nice coincidence.

546
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,000
Seriously, Tae...

547
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,166
I owe you big time.

548
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
Oh don't mention it...

549
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,666
Glad I could help.

550
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,541
Now, why exactly
did you have to be naked?

551
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:28,875
What?!

552
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,666
Haruna was "mistaken?!" 

553
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,625
I found the real one

554
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,875
under a couch cushion,
as per orders from Saras.

555
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,250
'course you did...

556
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,500
and it explains why
this one says "fake" on it.

557
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,208
My goof guys:
this one's totally on me...

558
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,875
Kobo falls from his branch...

559
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,041
Sometimes even monkeys
let the brush slip...

560
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,041
Yeah, that's not gonna cut it...

561
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,458
You have any idea how many
hoops I jumped through for you?

562
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,625
I think someone needs a crash
course in responsibility.

563
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,875
Nothing.

564
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,416
I'm good.

565
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,666
Then why are you giving off
steam like a boiling octopus...?

566
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,916
Are your brains evaporating
from an excess of filth?

567
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,625
Like I just told you:
it's nothing.

568
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,208
Hang on...

569
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,625
Where's that bottle of potion I
had sitting here a second ago?

570
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,916
Well, boys and girls:
that's the story...

571
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,041
Hope you enjoyed it
as much as I did.

572
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,125
One day they'll pass
a piece of legislation

573
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,833
with your name on it, maggot!

574
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,583
I propose we do it again
sometime, eh...?

575
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,166
Give us a little while and I'm
sure there'll be plenty more

576
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,625
stories to tell.

577
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:50,916
Hey butthole...!

578
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,875
Chuck it up or
I'll siphon it out of ya!

579
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,041
What the...

580
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:55,875
Where The hell is your...

581
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,083
bra...?

582
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,166
Jerk!

583
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:06,958
Zombie.

584
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,416
Magical Garment Girl.

585
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,708
Invisible Man.

586
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,666
X-ray vision guru.

587
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,416
Like I said,
never a dull moment.
