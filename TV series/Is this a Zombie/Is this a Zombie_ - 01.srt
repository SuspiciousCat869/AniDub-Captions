1
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,833
Today's forecast...

2
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,166
With these cloudy skies, I doubt
we'll see the sun at all.

3
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,000
There's a seventy-five percent
chance of scattered showers.

4
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,291
So if you plan to be
out today, bring an umbrella,

5
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,375
because you'll need it!

6
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,208
We'll, I'm headin'
to school, so see ya later.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,833
What a perfect day.

8
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,583
Are you serious?

9
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,500
Yeah!

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,833
Was that quiz tough or what?

11
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,041
I used to be like them.

12
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,625
Just your average
high school student.

13
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,750
My life was pretty carefree.

14
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,458
I thought those days
would last forever.

15
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,791
But as I found out
recently, they don't.

16
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,083
Are weather people ever right?

17
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,375
Dude, please tell me you'll
lend me your physics notes!

18
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,916
Sure thing.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,166
Sweet! You saved my life, Ayumu!

20
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,416
Then you can repay me
by buying me lunch today.

21
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,666
Much like today's forecast,
my previously held beliefs

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,708
on life were wrong.
Most people live their lives

23
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,000
without ever knowing it, but the
world is full of weird stuff.

24
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,666
Things like magic and monsters,
and the thing that I've become.

25
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,875
No, kid, wait!

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,583
Aww, don't worry. I'm a zombie.

27
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, crap!

28
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666
Noooo! I'm not some
weirdo flying pervert,

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,625
so please don't look at my junk!

30
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,208
Did I imagine that kid?

31
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,833
No, there's my hairpiece.

32
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:49,625
Oh, man. If I weren't
a zombie, I'd be street pizza.

33
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,291
What's with your hair today pal?

34
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,250
It looks like a porcupine
decided to camp out

35
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,458
on top of your head.

36
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,625
Hey I'm home.

37
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,708
I guess I just pumped the thing
a little too hard this morning.

38
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,416
Oh man that sounds bad. Uhhh.

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
Hey that reminds me, what's
the difference between...

40
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,958
Um, Eu? Did you hear me?

41
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,416
Uh, I don't know.

42
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
Neither one of
'em is in my garage.

43
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,916
With a porcupine,
the pricks are on the outside.

44
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,291
Oh, sorry. I know I'm late,

45
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,875
but I kinda got creamed
by a truck on the way home.

46
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,375
Geez! This is just your
tough-as-nails exterior, right?

47
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,000
What you really meant
to say instead was:

48
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,750
Ayumu, I'm oh-so-hungry.

49
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,333
Would you please
hurry up and make me dinner?

50
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,791
And I feel dirty, so you
can scrub me til I'm clean.

51
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,375
Yeah. Of course.
That's what she meant.

52
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,666
Aw. Don't worry
about it you know

53
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
what they say
about "too many cooks."

54
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,625
Anything exciting happen
around here today?

55
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:14,083
Ohh! My nap today would've
been much nicer with you.

56
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,875
That sounds so nice.

57
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, you've got some
rice stuck on your--

58
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,041
It sucks that
zombies can feel pain!

59
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:40,250
Uh-no. If you hadn't brought
me back, I'd still be dead,

60
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,625
and a fractured wrist
is way better than that.

61
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,541
I wasn't trying to
complain just then.

62
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,041
Besides, if I'd stayed dead...

63
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,416
I couldn't search for
the person who killed me.

64
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,500
Eucliwood Hellscythe - Eu for
short - necromancer of Hades.

65
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,666
She started living
here a month ago.

66
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,208
But I still can't
say I really know her.

67
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,708
Orito. Hey, what's up?

68
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,416
Holy crap, are you
watching the news?

69
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,541
Uh, no.

70
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,708
Dude, there's been
another murder!

71
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,291
How many does this make now?

72
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,208
I think one was too many.

73
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,291
No joke, a serial killer on the
loose is some scary shit, man.

74
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,708
You should probably
be extra careful

75
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,250
since you live alone, ya know.

76
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,916
Yeah, sure, "Mom." 

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
You don't have to be a dick.

78
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,375
All kidding aside, I'm serious
about stopping the killer.

79
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,166
That's why I go out
every night in search of him.

80
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,958
I've gotta stop him from
doing what he did to me,

81
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,916
to anyone else in this city.

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,458
But it's a big place. Finding
him is easier said than done.

83
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,791
Strange as it sounds,
I find this spot to be

84
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,666
a lot more calming than home.

85
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,416
It shouldn't be
much of a surprise.

86
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,458
I am a zombie after all.

87
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,208
Yep. This is my new happy place.

88
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,583
Holy crap!
What in the hell is that!

89
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,041
And now, you lousy bastard, it's
time for you to friggin' die!

90
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,291
The hell? What was that?

91
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,416
Some kind of cosplayer?

92
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,708
Hey, wait. If you attacked me,
then that must mean...

93
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,125
You, you're the
serial killer, aren't you!

94
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,291
What?! I wasn't attacking you!

95
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,000
You just got in the
way of that freak!

96
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,833
Aw man!

97
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Oh. Guess you mean this freak?

98
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,125
Dammit, I'm gonna
lose points for that now!

99
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,916
Anyway, don't worry,
'cause I'll avenge you,

100
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,125
so be a good boy and
rest in peace, okay?!

101
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,666
Um, look, about that...

102
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,958
Shut up and go into
the light! To the light!

103
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,083
I don't see a light,
you dingbat!

104
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,416
Mystletainn!
Magical power to full!

105
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:03,833
Let's go! Ultimate technique!
Mystletainn Kick!

106
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,375
Cutting into someone
with a chainsaw

107
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,041
isn't a kick, you psychopath!

108
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,875
That may have been a little
grisly, but I got the job done.

109
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,083
You forgettin'
about me over here?

110
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,541
Or did you mean to do that?

111
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,041
Hey, why aren't you dead, pal?

112
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,541
Because I'm a zombie.

113
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,166
Hold on, you mean
you're not human?

114
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,833
Well, I used to be. But for the
last month, I've been a zombie.

115
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,250
Eew!

116
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,166
Show some respect
for the undead.

117
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,500
So, you gonna introduce
yourself or what?

118
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,666
I'm a genius
Magical Garment Girl!

119
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
The name's Haruna!

120
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
The fur ball was a
Megalo named Kumacchi!

121
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,333
A big part of my
grade comes from

122
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,958
how well I can take him down.

123
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,000
And I gotta say
I kicked major ass!

124
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,416
Too bad it was mine...

125
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,375
Sorry, but if you were a
real genius, you would have

126
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,750
found a way to stop that bear
thing without cutting me in two.

127
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,166
Oh, yeah, Mister smart-mouth?

128
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,958
Well, I'd love to tell you
you're gonna regret that,

129
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,916
but you wouldn't
remember me saying it!

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Ya know why? Because
I'm gonna erase your memory.

131
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,125
Say what?! No, wait!

132
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,791
Your clothes!
Um. Where'd they go?

133
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,333
My clothes? What the
hell are you talking about?

134
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,041
I'm wearin' em ya dope!

135
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,625
Crap! I'm naked!

136
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,166
Hey, stop gawking
at me, you pervert,

137
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,041
and give me back
my powers immediately!

138
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,875
This instant!
Post-haste! Lickety-split!

139
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,041
Now, now, now, now, now!

140
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,625
You dirty creep, you're not
a normal human, are you?

141
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,958
I told you,
I was a zombie, remember?

142
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,208
Oh, and on that topic,
would you mind grabbing

143
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,958
my lower body up there for me?

144
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,083
Lower body? You pervert!

145
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm not a pervert, I'm a zombie!

146
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,541
So, um. Why would
a magician like yourself--

147
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,541
Magical Garment Girl!

148
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,083
Why would a "Magical
Garment Girl" like yourself

149
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,416
want to come to my house?

150
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,750
I'm at your house
because you put me in a bind.

151
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,041
You absorbed my magic powers.

152
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,833
I did? Is that some zombie
ability I didn't know I had?

153
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,458
So you owe me big time!

154
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,625
Well, how am I
supposed to pay you back?

155
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,333
I'll tell you how!
You may be a disgusting zombie

156
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,250
and a pervert,
but until my powers return,

157
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,791
you're gonna let me stay here.

158
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,916
Stay here? Well, um.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,333
As long as you don't
disturb the neighbors,

160
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,583
I guess I'm okay
with that arrangement.

161
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
Plus, you'll provide me with

162
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,250
high-quality meals, snacks,
and a bedroom, too.

163
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,041
Now wait just a minute.

164
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,000
And who is this chick?

165
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,291
She's a necromancer from Hades,

166
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,958
Eucliwood Hellscythe,
or Eu for short.

167
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,916
Oh, really?
A "neckwear-mancer" huh?

168
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,791
"Necro," not "neckwear."

169
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,625
Oh, yeah.
Um, hey, what's-your-face?

170
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,333
My name is Ayumu.

171
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,750
Let me use your phone.

172
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,291
So what am I lookin at here?

173
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,958
It's a cell phone.

174
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,458
A what?

175
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,291
By the way you're looking
at it, I take it you don't have

176
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,916
cell phones in your
magic world.

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,708
That's no phone!

178
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,750
Back in Villiers,
phones are stylish machines

179
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,666
you talk into like this!
"Hello? Hello?"

180
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,416
"May I ask who's calling?"

181
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,375
Cell phones work the same way.

182
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,583
Look. Just open it up and
dial the number you wanna call.

183
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,375
Oh, wow. This thing is
just like a phone, huh?

184
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,333
I told you!
It is a phone!

185
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,666
Yes, is this you, Head Teacher?

186
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,041
It's me. My student number?
Sure thing.

187
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
Six hundred,
thirty four million,

188
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,416
five hundred
twenty-six thousand.

189
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,875
I'm from Class Refrain-Rising.

190
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,541
Name's Haruna.
The reason I'm calling?

191
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,541
Something kinda went
wrong with the mission.

192
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
I hit a little snag.

193
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,208
I've lost my
magical powers, okay?

194
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,041
I guess she really does
come from a world of magic.

195
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,000
Ya know. Not too long ago,
I would've thought someone

196
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,458
with a story like that was
full of it. But that was before

197
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,875
I was brought back to life
by a Necromancer from Hades.

198
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,458
And before the little tummy
tuck that one gave me with her

199
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,166
chainsaw earlier tonight.
But, like I said before,

200
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
the world is full
of weird stuff.

201
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,125
Thank you for
being so understanding.

202
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,750
Wait, how much am I gonna
get charged for that call?

203
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,708
Magical Garment Girl. Detected.

204
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,958
Am I nuts? Trying to
live life as a normal

205
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,375
high school student when
I'm actually one of the undead?

206
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,666
And what happens if
everyone finds out?

207
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Gross, you mean my best friend

208
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,333
is some kinda
flesh-eating freak!

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,375
You haven't left yet?

210
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,833
Still here.

211
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,708
Dude, what's the dealio;

212
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,791
it's like I barely
see you outside anymore.

213
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,500
That's 'cause zombies
can't walk in the sun.

214
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Eh... It's these
killer allergies.

215
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,375
Yeah. You could
still go home, though.

216
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,291
Things are a little
crazy there now.

217
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,333
But, you live alone.

218
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,583
Oh, I almost forgot,
I got a new zombie flick!

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,458
Wanna go watch it at your place?

220
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,416
No!

221
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,916
It's hard enough keeping secret
the fact that I'm a zombie.

222
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,416
But if word gets
out that I'm living

223
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,916
with two female roommates,
one a necromancer and the other

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,583
a so-called
Magical Garment Girl.

225
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,291
I'm screwed!

226
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,083
Okay, no problem!

227
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,833
I'm sure you've got a
real good reason to say no.

228
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,875
Some other time
then, dude. Well, see ya!

229
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,083
Yeah, have a good one, ol buddy.

230
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,583
Okay. That was weird.
What's up his ass?

231
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,416
Speaking of which,
it looks like I'm now stuck

232
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,333
with two female roommates.
Oh, well. I guess life can't get

233
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,166
any stranger than it
already has been, right?

234
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,125
Who's this freaky old guy
and what does he want?

235
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,041
What I want,
my boy, is you.

236
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,458
I want you!

237
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,083
Oh, no, does that mean
what I think it means?

238
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,333
Now it's time, to get
to the bottom of things!

239
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,291
Ahh!

240
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
So it's not enough that
I died and became a zombie,

241
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,791
but now I have to get
molested by this creep, too?

242
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,041
Help me!

243
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,958
Haruna!
What are you doing here?

244
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,041
You like old guys?

245
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,625
Hell, no!

246
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,250
Yeah right. But any idiot would
know that this guy's a Megalo!

247
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,458
How would I know!

248
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,375
Don't worry,
I'll be gentle.

249
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,916
Oh no way!

250
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,041
Uh! He's a crawfish?

251
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,833
Yep, a Double-A Class Megalo,

252
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,541
the incredibly diabolical Zari!
At least I think he is.

253
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,416
Correct, that's me!

254
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,750
I came here because

255
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,833
I was drawn by the power
of a Magical Garment Girl.

256
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,291
But I'm perplexed as to how that
power resides in this human!

257
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,000
That's gonna take
a while to explain.

258
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,166
I hate long stories!

259
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,708
I wasn't talking to you!

260
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,833
Super Magical Garment Change!

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Nomobuyo... Oshi...
Hawsh-tah-wah.

262
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Do-kay-dah... Goon-mee-cha...!
Deh Ribura!

263
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,416
Whoa...

264
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,083
Oh, no, why is this
happening to me again?!

265
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,458
I don't know exactly,
but when a Magical Garment Girl

266
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,875
loses her powers, she not
only becomes helpless,

267
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,208
but so much easier to kill, too!

268
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,875
What the hell happened
to all of that bravado

269
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,375
you had back in the graveyard?

270
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,666
I dunno.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,416
You're scared,
aren't you? Admit it!

272
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,708
Me being scared of
some dumb crawfish Megalo

273
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,833
is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard!

274
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,541
Gimme a break! I'm a genius
Magical Garment Girl, remember?

275
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,625
If you don't think I
can turn scissorhands here

276
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,083
into etouffee, then screw you!

277
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
But before I can
suck out your heads,

278
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,416
I have to pinch off your tails!

279
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,666
What?! How could a
human have so much power?

280
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,458
Simple, you
bottom-feeding bastard.

281
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,583
You see, humans can't use one
hundred percent of their power

282
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,541
because their bodies always have
to keep some of it in reserve.

283
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:46,000
But me? Well. I'm a zombie.

284
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,125
So I can use a hell of a lot
more power than humans can!

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,083
Like one hundred percent!

286
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,208
And even one hundred and twenty
percent if I feel like it!

287
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,291
Yee-ouch, that hurt! Crap!

288
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,625
Oh my god that totally
snapped my arm like a toothpick!

289
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,583
Stop flapping around
and heal! 

290
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,166
Oh, no! He may be strong,

291
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,750
but he's no good
if he loses his limbs.

292
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,833
I gotta think
of something quick.

293
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:32,666
Your undead body might
be tough but it's still human!

294
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,916
Listen up Zombieboy!
You gotta use Mystletainn!

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,666
Your chainsaw?

296
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,166
Yeah, since you stole my powers,

297
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,125
you can become
a Magical Garment Girl!

298
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,708
What? I don't
want to become a girl!

299
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,916
Man up and turn into
a girl or we're toast!

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,458
Dammit! Alright, then!

301
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,791
Now say it with me!

302
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,833
Nomobuyo... Oshi...
Hawshtahwah.

303
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:58,500
Dokeda... Gunmiicha...!
Deh Ribura!

304
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,625
Oh, my god!

305
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,375
I feel it!

306
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,333
Here it comes!

307
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,875
It's coming!

308
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,791
What! Not this get up!

309
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,375
It's gonna make you
stronger and way more brave

310
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,958
so don't knock it, ya jackass!

311
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,125
For real?

312
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,208
Oh, you're a pervert, too?

313
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,875
I am not! Dammit,
I'm sick and tired

314
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,541
of everyone
calling me a pervert!

315
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,250
Now what was the name of that

316
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,000
ultimate technique
thing Haruna used?

317
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:55,750
Let's see. Oh, yeah, now I
remember. Mystel-tainn. Kick!

318
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,875
Cutting someone with
a chainsaw's not a kick.

319
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,458
You cross-dressing pervert!

320
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm not a pervert!

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,791
That freakin hurt.

322
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,958
What the hell? Ayumu?

323
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:17,708
Uh.

324
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,208
Eww, gross!

325
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,583
Is that cosplay?

326
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,750
Wait. It's not what
ya think. I can explain! Um.

327
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,458
Don't tell me you're
some kinda tranny?

328
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,500
No! Don't take pictures!
Cut it out!

329
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,916
You guys've got it
all wrong I swear!

330
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,083
Hey!

331
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,708
Haruna, please!
Tell them I'm not a drag queen!

332
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,541
Listen up, folks! Ayumu.
He isn't a drag queen!

333
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,666
But he is a Magical
Garment Girl! Now and forever.

334
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,875
I used to live the life of an
average high school student,

335
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,458
and I thought it would last
forever, but now those days,

336
00:22:54,541 --> 00:23:00,083
like my human life
and my dignity are over!

337
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,625
What a perv!

338
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,875
Cross-dresser, huh?

339
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,458
That's so not cute!

340
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,958
Now I'm a zombie.

341
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,833
Oh, and somehow, a Magical
Garment Girl, too.

342
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,625
Is it weird that I'm a zombie?

343
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,125
Yeah, I guess so.
Zombies get a lot of bad press.

344
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,416
The word's definitely
got a negative connotation.

345
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,958
Why not call
yourself something else?

346
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:02,833
Like what?

347
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,375
Hmm? Life-challenged?

348
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:07,541
No, wait, how 'bout a living
impaired Magical Garment Girl!
