1
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,791
Yeah, sure.

2
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,583
It's gonna be domesticated
before too long if you guys

3
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,416
keep feeding it like that.

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,333
Somebody say "feed?" I'm 'bout
ready to gnaw on my own tongue.

5
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,625
Breakfast is now ready,
everybody.

6
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,125
Rub-a-dub dub;
thanks for the grub.

7
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,208
So, yeah.

8
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,416
I'm a zombie.

9
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,000
Most people live their lives
without ever knowing it,

10
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,500
but the world is filled
with weird stuff.

11
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:49,458
Things like magic and
monsters, and-- well, me.

12
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,041
Not that knowing
makes life easier;

13
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,500
just the opposite, actually.

14
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,083
Those of us on a first name
basis with the shadow side

15
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,416
aren't exactly well-adjusted.

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,916
Fact is, it can royally suck
being a "chosen one" sometimes.

17
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,000
That said, though.

18
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,583
I do alright.

19
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,250
'Kay.

20
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,708
So I'm Gaia's golden boy.

21
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,458
We've established that.

22
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,416
Now what?

23
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,583
Alright.

24
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,333
It's probably best
if we leave off there.

25
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,583
Lunch.

26
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,250
Give me liberty
or give me death!

27
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,708
And food.

28
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,708
Up for a trade?

29
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,125
I got pastrami--

30
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,375
Dude!

31
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,166
You look like an old man's
scrotum with eyes!

32
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,250
Gaia smiles on me.

33
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm a chosen one.

34
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,875
I don't think I've seen him
this bad before.

35
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,958
Guy really needs
to start moisturizing.

36
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,208
Let's get you down
to the nurse's office.

37
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,416
Sound like a plan?

38
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,333
Mother Theresa could
take a page from you.

39
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,708
Too bad she's, like,
you know, dead.

40
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:47,791
What the--

41
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,916
Who are these
damn shelves made for?

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,375
Ah, son of a-- 

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
Who's the little girl?

44
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
I don't think you're
supposed to be in here.

45
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,208
Not to be a narc or anything.

46
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,083
It's not what
it looks like, I swear!

47
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you drunk?

48
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,291
Don't judge me!

49
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,375
Ethyl alcohol has
a variety of medicinal uses!

50
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,166
The hell was that about?

51
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,291
Random, thy name is a
pink-haired Goth chick.

52
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,208
We talkin' full-on Lolita?

53
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,208
Yeah.

54
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,666
Workin' it like
nobody's business.

55
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,625
For your information
I'm right here!

56
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,625
For your information,
no one was asking.

57
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
Keep trash-talkin', worm bait.

58
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,208
See where it gets you.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,541
Don't think I can't
read between the lines

60
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,125
of your smutty lil' anecdote.

61
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,083
I don't have the first clue
what you're talking about.

62
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,708
You did say "workin' it" in
reference to an underage girl.

63
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,041
Hey!

64
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,500
I was talking about
the outfit she was wearing!

65
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,041
I understand that.

66
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,833
But the fact you took mental
note of a little girl's wardrobe

67
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,458
in the first place is suspect.

68
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,291
Next you'll be driving a van.

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,541
That's a rather presumptuous
conclusion to draw

70
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,958
from so little information.

71
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,708
I think maybe
somebody's been watching

72
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,333
too much History Channel.

73
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,500
Hey.

74
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,833
You remember your
job descriptions, right?

75
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,333
I'm second rank
Vampire Ninja, Seraphim.

76
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,458
What of it?

77
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,750
Magical Garment Girl
with enormous IQ.

78
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,708
And "ghost" is going too far?

79
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,125
I'll thank you to
save the touchiness

80
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,916
for your "alone time", maggot.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,125
Hey, just 'cause
magic's in my title

82
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,500
doesn't mean I'm anti-science!

83
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,041
I'm a regular Paracelsus!

84
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,500
Whoever that is.

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,541
Your new friend could
be a hallucination borne

86
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,666
of unconscious urges struggling
to burst into waking life.

87
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,291
If you're bursting
on drunk ten year olds,

88
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm gonna kick your ass!

89
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,000
Hallucination.

90
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,291
I don't know.

91
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,375
Another helping!

92
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,000
Snap to it!

93
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,250
That's your tenth bowl today.

94
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
You got a trash
compactor in there?

95
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,916
It's called a healthy appetite,
garcon, and it means I'm back!

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,666
A furnace with this much
umph needs hella fuel,

97
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,625
so shut up and start shoveling!

98
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,500
Yeah!

99
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,083
Well I for one have
been counting the days till we

100
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,625
can say Ayumu's tea party
princess phase is behind us.

101
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,666
Okey doke,
I'm headed out, then.

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,000
Something wrong?

103
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,500
Time will slow to a tortuous
crawl while you're gone,

104
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,625
my darling.

105
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:20,083
I shall await your return
on pins and needles.

106
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,875
Kiss me farewell.

107
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,000
Settle down, Eu.

108
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,875
Yeah, I know.

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,541
The gals love to bust my chops.

110
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,666
Makes for kind of a homey
atmosphere, though.

111
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,041
Seriously.

112
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,250
Ah hell, he's gone
back to a ball sack!

113
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,166
Hey, Ayumu!

114
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,541
Hey Tomonori.

115
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,916
I think you're really gonna
like what I made for you today.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,916
Ta-da!

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,916
Whoa.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Went all out, didn't you?

119
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,875
Daw. No big deal.

120
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,083
I mean, sure, I had to
get up at 5 this morning...

121
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,916
Yuki's got it pretty bad, huh?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,625
Whatever it is that
poor girl sees in him,

123
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,250
I'm just not picking up on.

124
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,041
You really shouldn't
say things like that.

125
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,291
To who?

126
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
I think he's cute.

127
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,208
'Kay, look--whatever:
I'm not made of stone.

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,166
There are worse couples
out there, I guess.

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,458
Did you really have
to call them a couple?

130
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,708
You're killin' me.

131
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,541
How do I get in on this
personal chef action?

132
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,750
Sorry, Four Eyes.

133
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,125
I don't cook for
disgusting creepers.

134
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,000
That might've been
a little harsh.

135
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
Yeah.

136
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:44,125
Look, it's just I, I'm sorta
like Ayumu's school wife.

137
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,333
And I don't spread it around!

138
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,833
So what you're saying is
that I'd be a third wheel.

139
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,666
Eat up so you can
tell me what you think!

140
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,916
Okay.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,500
Except, uh.

142
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,375
Maybe don't wave an artillery
belt of condiments in my face?

143
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,916
'Scuse me?

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,625
Oh, I brought these for home
ec class, so they were handy.

145
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,041
Sorry.

146
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,083
It officially tastes wonderful.

147
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,208
Yeah, sure.

148
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,541
Like it competes
with whatever you call

149
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,708
that awesome omelete-looking
thingie you brought.

150
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,583
Don't be intimidated,
it looks glamorous,

151
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,333
but eating the same box
everyday gets old.

152
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,125
Hello, my pretties!

153
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,583
Who wants the honor
of being cracked open first?

154
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,083
Yeah, what about 'em?

155
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,791
This momma's forte is the sweet
mystery of chicken ovaries!

156
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,208
Sorry, I didn't think
anyone was still here.

157
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,625
Goes for both of us.

158
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,583
I had some
after-school stuff to do.

159
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,708
Ah.

160
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,916
A class monitor's
work is never done.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
What is it they say?

162
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,958
No rest for the wicked?

163
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,500
Heh.

164
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,500
I guess that somebody has to
take one for the team, right?

165
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,666
I can give you hand.

166
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,500
That's okay.

167
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,458
I'm all done.

168
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,958
'Sides, don'tcha think
you ought to be getting home?

169
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,250
This place has a way
cooler view of the sunset.

170
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,750
I'm stuck here till
it goes down anyway.

171
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,041
It's funny.

172
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,000
I never thought of you
as the type of guy

173
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,583
who cared about stuff like that.

174
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,416
S'pose it's never come up.

175
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,625
Well, see ya.

176
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,583
Yeah, you bet.

177
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,083
Careful goin' home.

178
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,250
Ugh.

179
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,500
Finally I can walk back without
lookin' like a cantaloupe

180
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,125
someone left on the window sill.

181
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,250
Sucks how the days
are gettin' longer.

182
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,958
That isn't a smell
that belongs here.

183
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,500
Someone there?

184
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,458
Bit late for anyone
to be hangin' out.

185
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,416
Don't tell me.

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,583
No.

187
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,791
100%!

188
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
Gotcha!

189
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,625
You're that girl.

190
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,291
My hallucination!

191
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,375
Don't drink until you're of
legal age, boys and girls!

192
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,375
What kind of
hallucination is this?

193
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,541
Hightower you said
your name was?

194
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,333
Um, no.

195
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,166
It's Aikawa.

196
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,125
What is?

197
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,208
Never mind; it's not important.

198
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,208
Hot potato, hot potato, 1-2-3.

199
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,000
So, um, any special reason
you're using an alcohol burner

200
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,083
to cook squid?

201
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,291
'Cause it's whimsical
and unexpected.

202
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,125
You'll get it when you're
old and you have to fight

203
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,583
to be interesting.

204
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,500
You really think you
should be drinking so much?

205
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,625
It's my god-given
right as an adult!

206
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,666
She's an adult?

207
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
Want a lil' taste?

208
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,000
Crap!

209
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
How wasted am I that
I offered booze to a minor?

210
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:24,791
Bad.

211
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,250
Bad.

212
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,625
My inner life must be really
messed up to produce this.

213
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,375
You after something, Icarumba,
or just chillin'?

214
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,708
Aikawa.

215
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,583
Look, it's-- it's
kind of a long story.

216
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,875
I read you, kid.

217
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
Life's a bitch, right?

218
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,291
C'mon, bottoms up!

219
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, well I'm still underage.

220
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,875
Is it illegal for you
to knock back tap water?

221
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,125
A toast.

222
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,083
To spitting in the
wrinkly face of adversity.

223
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,333
Screw that whore!

224
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:49,958
Uh.

225
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,541
Sure, whatever.

226
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,958
Talk about the wrinkly
face of adversity,

227
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,791
you should see me in the sun.

228
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,416
Heh.

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,791
The other kids in my class
are totally gettin' wise

230
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,125
to what's up, in which case
I'll be like an outcast.

231
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,458
To hell with 'em!

232
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,083
Let all the snot-nosed,
zit-riddled ne'er-do-wells

233
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,583
dream up whatever they like.

234
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,750
What's high school gossip

235
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,083
got on being Gaia's
friggin' chosen one?

236
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,375
They're just jealous
'cause they're boring!

237
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,833
S'pretty good advice.

238
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,041
Hey, thanks for lettin' me
hash this B.S. out with ya.

239
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,833
Can we make
this a regular thing?

240
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,375
They're just jealous
'cause they're boring!

241
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,583
She's real.

242
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I don't see how she could be.

243
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,166
Alcoholic, pink-haired midgets
baking squid a la ethyl

244
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,083
aren't typically real people.

245
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,875
Dumb Ayumu making
me self-conscious.

246
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,583
I'm just not
good enough for you.

247
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,875
Oh, don't let it get to you.

248
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,666
C'mon.

249
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,166
Look at it this way:

250
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,666
you're completely free from
the pressure of expectation.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,250
Huh, I can sense evil afoot.

252
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,333
This place is about to become
a battleground once again.

253
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey there, girlies.

254
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,708
Come to papa.

255
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,250
Dude!

256
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,625
Coolest news ever!

257
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,708
You know that creepy old
cemetery behind the school?

258
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,125
Yeah.

259
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,541
It's totally haunted by a
chainsaw-wielding psycho!

260
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,166
Apparently they've been
desecrating the graves

261
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,750
in full drag.

262
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,208
The press is playin' it down,
probly to keep from inciting

263
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,125
a panic, but just
look at this thing.

264
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,791
Is it just me or
is he a dead ringer for Ayumu?

265
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,625
Whoa.

266
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,083
I hadn't noticed, but yeah.

267
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,541
That's kind of weird.

268
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,958
No kidding.

269
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,583
Knock it off, people!

270
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,875
This is exactly how
rumors get started

271
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,291
and I know we're
all better than that!

272
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
Thank you.

273
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,125
For not trusting your eyes.

274
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,208
Yeah.

275
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,208
It's just the
resemblance is unreal.

276
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:09,958
I know, right?

277
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,833
What are the chances?

278
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,666
Oh come on, guys.

279
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,166
Ew!

280
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,958
Like Ayamu would use his spare
time to grave-hop in drag?

281
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,666
'Cept, I kind of do.

282
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,458
Will you talk some sense
into them please?

283
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,375
You guys believe
whatever you read?

284
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,541
You're a tabloid's wet dream.

285
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,375
Miss Goth chick?

286
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,333
The net's totally
closing in on me!

287
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,041
The whole school's about
to know my secret identity!

288
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,291
Sure, I didn't chose this path,
it chose me; but you think

289
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,583
a bunch of teenagers
are gonna understand that?

290
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,583
It's not fair, damn it!

291
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,416
I've been busting my--

292
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,625
Okay, awkward.

293
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,083
I'm not the age
of consent either, FYI.

294
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,625
Look, I just came
in here to vent, alright?

295
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,291
I'm not really
comfortable with--

296
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,250
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

297
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,916
Hold on a second!

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
Who the hell are you?

299
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,708
Someone who's
very interested in you.

300
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,291
Oh crap.

301
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,375
Deja vu!

302
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,250
Prepare to be mine!

303
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,500
A Megalo?

304
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,833
I've trekked across lands
untold in search of gooey

305
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,125
Magical Garment Girl goodness,
yet my nose leads me here.

306
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,583
How does a scrawny boy give off
such an irresistible scent?

307
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,583
Oh, who cares?

308
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,375
I can't withstand
this compulsion!

309
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,208
I will have you if
it's the last thing I do!

310
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,250
100%!

311
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,250
I'm clearly not dealing with a
garden variety human, am I?

312
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,375
No, you're dealing
with a zombie!

313
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,041
Not in the eyes!

314
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,250
Not in the--!

315
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,708
Wait for it.

316
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,666
I'm also a Magical Garment Girl!

317
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,333
So, you have lady parts too?

318
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,000
Get your damn story
straight, dill weed!

319
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,333
Haruna?

320
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,666
Now that my powers are
back to their full glory,

321
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,708
the Magical Garment Girl
here is me!

322
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,750
And I'm about to teach this
tentacled piece of garbage

323
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,125
that Megalos
aren't welcome here!

324
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:18,583
Nomobuyo oshi hashitawa dokeda
gunmiicha deh ribura!

325
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,833
And now's probably as good
a time as any to mention

326
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,333
I'm a freakin' genius!

327
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,166
This was a bad idea.

328
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,500
Awesome to see you at
the top of your game again.

329
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,791
Hold up!

330
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,083
Wardrobe malfunction!

331
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,875
'Scuse me: kickin' ass here.

332
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,208
I thought somebody
cranked the AC!

333
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,458
Maybe somebody was
overselling their recovery.

334
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,333
Avert your eyes, perv!

335
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,500
I couldn't help but see it!

336
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,166
And here I was
actually getting nervous.

337
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,125
Haruna, heads up!

338
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,250
What was that?

339
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,291
Something just blow up?

340
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,416
Alright, someone tell me
what the hell's going on?

341
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,250
Taeko!

342
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh no you did not!

343
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,750
Help me!

344
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,333
We got no choice.

345
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,458
The hell do we do?

346
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,041
You know damn good
and well what we do!

347
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,750
But.

348
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,041
Everybody's watching!

349
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,083
So just wipe their stupid
memories afterwards;

350
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,416
quit whining and get on with it!

351
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,791
S'pose I don't have a choice.

352
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:47,833
Nomobuyo oshi hashitawa
dokeda gunmiicha deh ribura!

353
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,708
No, no, no.

354
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,833
Don't take pictures.

355
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,291
This is humiliating
enough as it is.

356
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,666
Ah crap.

357
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,333
Here it comes.

358
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,125
This is happening.

359
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,166
Oh god.

360
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,041
I knew it, he looks exactly
like the magazine!

361
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,083
I'm not believing this.

362
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,291
My best friend's
a cross-dresser!

363
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,000
Sorry, Taeko.

364
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,791
Those pics were
of me all along.

365
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,000
I am so confused right now!

366
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,291
I'll just say it:
he's got nice legs.

367
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,416
So, he's a homo?

368
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
Who cares? He's hot!

369
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:34,708
Girl.

370
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,250
Guy.

371
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,125
Doesn't matter.

372
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,250
Either way, you're mine!

373
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,916
Tentacle strike!

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,250
Not something a guy in
this outfit wants to hear!

375
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,500
Wait, the chainsaw's
not just a prop?

376
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,333
I can take the cross-dressing...

377
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,458
Don't judge me!

378
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,625
Evidently, he's into it enough

379
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,208
to wear actual
panties under there.

380
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,791
Oh that is just twisted!

381
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,625
Don't you think I know?

382
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,541
Hold on, okay?

383
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,125
What are you waiting for?

384
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,541
Do the thing!

385
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,208
Mr. Mystletainn?

386
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,375
You got it!

387
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,916
200.

388
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,291
300.

389
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,541
400.

390
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,708
500.

391
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,000
600.

392
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,458
700.

393
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,375
800.

394
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,958
900.

395
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,125
Reign it in, dumbass!

396
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,625
You're getting
way too fabulous!

397
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,916
1000%!

398
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,541
If it's possible to get more
perverted, he just achieved it!

399
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,333
Let's make calamari!

400
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,625
Mystletainn Kick!

401
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,833
Technically not a kick.

402
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,750
He is so awesome!

403
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,458
And totally rockin' that dress!

404
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,291
How could you?

405
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,375
How the frak could you
do that to yourself?

406
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,625
Listen, it's not what
you think, I swear!

407
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,541
Thing is, I--

408
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,833
Um, thank you?

409
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,833
I like the, uh, bows.

410
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,625
Uh-uh, screw a bunch of this!

411
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,666
Wipe this the hell out of
these people's memories!

412
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,375
Wait, no.

413
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,208
Not right now.

414
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,375
It's too much!

415
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,500
Emashite resu a moka
monina momeyu moia!

416
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,500
Oh great, now he's
speaking in tongues.

417
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,333
Oh, very funny, Mystletainn!

418
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,541
What's the hold up?

419
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,833
Haven't these people
been traumatized enough?

420
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,000
I know I have!

421
00:21:59,083 --> 00:21:59,833
Please!

422
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,333
Stop it!

423
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,000
No!

424
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,166
You're going to--!

425
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,750
Dude, you're freakin' my mind!

426
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,541
I can't handle
much more of this!

427
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,583
Come on, damn it!

428
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,166
Emashite resuwa!

429
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,333
I said stop!

430
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,041
Son of a--

431
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,791
Nice. You broke Mystletainn
and you're naked.

432
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,625
Good combo there.

433
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,250
Oh, eat me!

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,541
Wow.

435
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,458
Seriously?

436
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,416
This is so becoming a meme.

437
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,458
Stop looking at me;
this isn't what you think!

438
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,666
You think you know a guy.

439
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,041
Guess it's the
nice one's you gotta watch.

440
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,125
Bet those sirens are for you.

441
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,166
For the record,
this is all your fault!

442
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,583
Yeah.

443
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,666
Says the kid cupping his junk
in the school courtyard.

444
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,291
Shut up!

445
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,041
I couldn't be certain
so long as he was fully clad.

446
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,583
But now in the light of full
disclosure I'm an avid convert.

447
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,166
That ass will launch
a thousand ships.

448
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,000
Whaddya think of our handsome
protagonist's latest brush

449
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,875
with fate?

450
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,166
Pretty wicked, right?

451
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,541
Oh, I'm Fantasy Eu, by the way.

452
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,458
This just went
from random to Meta.

453
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,416
OMG, it's the actual Eu!

454
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,583
Why does the fantasy version
of me sound like a chew toy?

455
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,583
Cut it out!

456
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,041
For the record,
the more annoyingly cute I am

457
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,125
the more it offsets
how much of a bitch you are.

458
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,625
Oh, you'll offset something,
just you wait and see.
