1
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,333
Wow! Look at all this meat!

2
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,208
Ayumu must've spent a
fortune at the grocery store!

3
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,083
It's a carnivore's wet dream!

4
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,541
Too bad. Cause I
feel like making veggies.

5
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,291
How can you possibly
be having this much fun?

6
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,875
Yo, ninja! C'mon!

7
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,250
Whoa! Haruna!

8
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,625
You're in charge of that pot.

9
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,166
I've got a score to
settle with these veggies!

10
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,833
Oh yeah! Get all fired up!

11
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,375
What the hell are
they making in there?

12
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:18,458
No. It's not good. We'll never
be able to find the killer.

13
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,916
There's no evidence.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,625
It looks like you're pretty
into this show aren't you?

15
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,208
Why not? There's no point now!

16
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,541
You make me sick!

17
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,291
Get a hold of yourself!

18
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,833
It's okay, but I think I'd
rather watch you undress.

19
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,333
Really? You don't say.

20
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:39,125
Honestly. I did
catch a glimpse of them.

21
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,500
Tell me. Was she wearing
metal gauntlets on her arms.

22
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,500
Also, did she have long
straight, silvery hair?

23
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,583
It couldn't be.

24
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,750
Right?

25
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,416
What's this?

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,833
I asked her for
some ninja skills

27
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,125
and this is what came out.

28
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,333
It's a mystery to me.

29
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,875
Looks like a tragedy.

30
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,916
This is my first attempt at
this pastime you call "cooking."

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,041
Wonderful.

32
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,583
Actually, I find it
quite fascinating.

33
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,875
Well what are you
waiting for, maggot. Taste it.

34
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,708
That?

35
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,166
Do you see anything else?

36
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,833
Or would you
rather taste my blade?

37
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,625
What the hell?!

38
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,166
It appears that my
dish might have turned out

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,458
just a little spicier
than I had anticipated.

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,333
Hurry up and put it in your
mouth before the bowl melts!

41
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,625
I get the feeling this
is gonna be more painful

42
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,583
then when I got stabbed.

43
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,000
Come on Ayumu, be a man
and slam it down the hatch!

44
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,916
Chug chug chug chug chug!

45
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,208
No pulse, and he
smells a little funky.

46
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,583
That's normal. He's a zombie.

47
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,916
I'm running to
the light just as fast as

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,083
my little legs can take me.

49
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,791
You came back to life in the
nick of time! I am starving!

50
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,500
Haruna?

51
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,125
I'm so hungry.
Don't you have anything

52
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,333
I can nibble on, you sexy thing?

53
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,833
You can eat this.
There's still plenty left.

54
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,625
Screw it! We're having pizza!

55
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,583
I don't understand, you're gonna
screw a piece of what, now?

56
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,125
"Pizza" and we're eating it.

57
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,291
Sounds good!

58
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,125
Hello there. I'd like
to order four small seafood

59
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,916
and shrimp pizzas for rush
delivery if you would, thanks.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,458
Ayumu.

61
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,291
Uh, hey!

62
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,541
Let me borrow your phone!

63
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,041
Hi there, is this
the Head Teacher? Oh.

64
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,250
It's not, huh?.

65
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,333
I wonder why she's
calling them right now.

66
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,541
Oh I'm sure it's uber important.

67
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,041
You're joking right?

68
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,125
Well, If I'm getting charged

69
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,333
for a call to Villiers,
I hope it is.

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
Just let her know that I haven't
found the item she wanted,

71
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,833
but it'll turn up soon. Thanks!

72
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,041
Talk to ya later! Buh bye.

73
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,208
So what is this "item"
that you just spoke of?

74
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,541
Let's see. What was it called?
"Toe fungus" maybe?

75
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,375
No, that's not it.
Maybe it was "toe jam" instead.

76
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,125
"Toe jam?" What kind of sicko
asks you to pick that up?

77
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,916
You're one to talk, perv!

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,916
My Head Teacher does, so there!

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
That's why she sent me here.

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,833
That was fast.

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm coming!

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm looking for
Mr. Ayumu Aikawa.

83
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,666
Uh. Yeah, that's me.
Are you the pizza guy?

84
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,000
No, I'm not the pizza guy.

85
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,791
Pleasure to meet you,
my name's Kerberos Wansard.

86
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,375
It's nice to meet you.
Wait! Are you a Doberman?

87
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,833
No, I'm not a Doberman either.

88
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,583
See for yourself.

89
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,416
A megalo?

90
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,208
I am a guardian of
the underworld, Mr. Aikawa.

91
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,625
Though I should explain,
that title means something

92
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,833
a little different
where I'm from.

93
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,375
I don't refuse entry
to those who come in,

94
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,125
and I don't allow
those who leave to get away.

95
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,500
You came to the underworld
once and managed to escape.

96
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,750
You walk among the living.
But now...

97
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,500
You're planning on
dragging me back to hell,

98
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,208
aren't you,
Mr. Wansard? Right?

99
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,458
I appreciate your
understanding. Now then.

100
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,458
What's wrong?

101
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,458
He's been attacked
by that demon!

102
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,708
Eu?

103
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,708
Oh wow. That was quick.

104
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah that was
super quick. Thank you.

105
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
Lady Hellscythe?

106
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,416
Lady Eucliwood Hellscythe.

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,583
So this is where you've
been spending your time?

108
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,666
I take it this
is your handiwork?

109
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,666
How come you didn't
tell me this sooner?

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,166
If I would've known
you were involved,

111
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,416
I wouldn't have
bothered coming here.

112
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,083
And you, Mr. Aikawa...

113
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,833
Are you aware of what it means
that Lady Hellscythe healed you?

114
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,708
Sort of?

115
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,750
Lady Hellscythe,
you should be more careful.

116
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,666
Take what?

117
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, I see. Well.

118
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,750
Sorry for the mix up.
I'll be going now.

119
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,666
I don't get what you came
here for in the first place.

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,333
A wild goose chase.

121
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,333
The trip wasn't a
complete waste, though.

122
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,958
A couple blocks
over there's a guy about

123
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,375
to kick his oxygen habit.

124
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,916
So maybe I'll be draggin' a soul
back to hell with me after all.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,958
And score a bone or two.

126
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,375
Hold on,
somebody's being killed?

127
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,000
You guys stay here!
This is my problem, okay?

128
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,791
Eu.

129
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,250
Gotta say, I wasn't
expecting that.

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,416
What?

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,666
Lady Hellscythe.
I'm surprised she decided

132
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,000
to use her healing powers to
fix your wounds, aren't you?

133
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,333
Why?

134
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,750
Wait, you mean you don't know?

135
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,541
Listen, kid. When she uses
her healing powers on someone,

136
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,708
there's a tradeoff.
She takes on their pain.

137
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,750
She does?

138
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right. She experienced
the horrible pain of the wounds

139
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,500
I inflicted on you
just the same as you did.

140
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,291
I had no idea.
But I don't understand!

141
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,833
Why does she do it then?

142
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,583
That's one of the many
things that make her unique.

143
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,958
She's a
special person, that one.

144
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,583
At the center of everything.

145
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,041
She chose to heal
your wounds out of kindness

146
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,208
and of her own free will.

147
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,041
Which means, Lady Hellscythe
must consider you

148
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,250
a special person as well.

149
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,416
Special? But I'm not.

150
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,208
There. The scene of the crime.

151
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,708
That's terrible.

152
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,500
Well, they're kibble now.

153
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,208
And the soul's gone AWOL too.

154
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,041
This type of thing has been
happening a lot these days.

155
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,750
Souls haven't been
making it to the underworld.

156
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,583
They "don't make it"?
Where do they go then?

157
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,500
Hard to say.
They might have been sacced.

158
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,208
Whaddaya mean "sacced"?

159
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,916
Sacrificed. It means
they were used as an offering.

160
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,708
There are those who say that
when the souls of the dead

161
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,916
are offered up in sacrifice,

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,750
an enormous amount of
magical power is then granted.

163
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,708
Wait, I don't get it. To who?

164
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,916
That, my friend,
is the big question.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,541
The only lead I've got so far is
a name. "The King of the Night."

166
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,708
You know who that is?

167
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,333
Well, word on
the street is he's a--

168
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,708
Look out!

169
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,166
No!

170
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,625
I can't move!
It's just like that last time!

171
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,875
I can't see their face!

172
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,958
Mr. Aikawa.

173
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,333
Lady Hellscythe.
Take care of her.

174
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:47,916
Be kind. No matter what,
she must not be made to grieve.

175
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,291
Where is Sera?

176
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,416
Oh, I see.

177
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,083
Eu, we need to talk.

178
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,375
He sacrificed
himself for me, a zombie.

179
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,083
You know? He wasn't
so bad after all.

180
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,083
I'm sorry about earlier.

181
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,291
That must've hurt you.
I feel terrible.

182
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,666
I see.

183
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,541
Eu, you have to talk to me.

184
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,708
Why do you bury
your emotions deep inside?

185
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,375
Yes, please.

186
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,916
No matter what. Yes.

187
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,541
"The ribbons of
fate move forward.

188
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,458
They blow in the
wind constantly waving

189
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,500
from side to side
in a perfect rhythm.

190
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,500
But when those same
waves are affected by magic,

191
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,291
they become fiercer,
and more intense.

192
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:29,083
My magic is disturbed by
turmoil, anxiety, fear, hate,

193
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,375
and strong shifts in mood.

194
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,250
This interferes
with the natural order

195
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,916
and disrupts the ribbons
of fate which alters reality.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
As a result,
I cannot be permitted

197
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,750
to show any
emotions whatsoever."

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,375
"There is a reason
that I never talk.

199
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,791
It's because inside each
of my words, there is magic."

200
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,750
Unfortunately,
as a result of this fact,

201
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,375
I must never be
permitted to speak."

202
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,916
Fish sticks put it in the pizza.

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,166
"My words,
like a burden, are heavy.

204
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,833
I can't control
the magic in them,

205
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,375
nor predict which
words will be empowered.

206
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,291
So I must never be permitted to
speak under any circumstances."

207
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,958
Yeah, but you can
at least say stuff like

208
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,083
"ah" or "oh", can't you?

209
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,541
Oh. You can't?

210
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,625
"When my words become
empowered, an unbearable pain

211
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,875
shoots through my head.
I hate when that happens."

212
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,541
"The power of eternal
youth lives within my veins.

213
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,833
And my heart emits
a massive amount of magic

214
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,583
that must be suppressed."

215
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,708
So, is that why
you dress like that?

216
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,625
"I wear these
gauntlets and plate armor

217
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,583
to suppress my magic
and keep it under control.

218
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,166
My power is so strong that
it will outlive my body."

219
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,166
Does that mean?

220
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,166
I'm so sorry.

221
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,916
Oh yeah, meatloaf,
put it in the pizza.

222
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,375
No! Why would I?!

223
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,833
Where would you get that idea,
I could never hate you!

224
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,333
Don't be ridiculous!

225
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,666
There aren't any
monsters around here, okay?

226
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,916
The only thing that is
here is a kind-hearted girl

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,166
who brought me back to life!

228
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,750
Hey. You can feel whatever
you wanna feel, all right?

229
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:29,833
As far as fate goes. Don't
worry, I'll take care of that.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,250
I don't care if
it's a gigantic megalo

231
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,875
or a nuclear missile.
I'll take them all on.

232
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,375
If that's the price
for having Eu with me,

233
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,791
it's one I'm willing to pay.
I'll be waiting right here!

234
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,958
This isn't exactly
what I had in mind,

235
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,000
but I guess it's
pretty dramatic!

236
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,750
Ahhh!

237
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,708
Holy shit!

238
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,083
I can't believe it!
It's a triple-A class Megalo,

239
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,875
the ever-beaten,
never victorious blue whale!

240
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, whatever your
plan is, maggot,

241
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,291
you'd better enact it quickly.
Don't just stand there!

242
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,083
Yeah, are you gonna
kill that thing or not?

243
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,166
I'm working on it!

244
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,291
Take this!

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,583
Transform into
a Magical Garment Girl!

246
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,708
You don't stand a
chance the way you are!

247
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,166
All right then, fine! Now,
how did that incantation go?

248
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,500
Nomobuyo. Oshi. Hashitawa.

249
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,916
Dokeda. Gunmiicha! Deh Ribura!

250
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,416
There's no need to worry. Didn't
I say I'd take care of it?

251
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,125
Now get up there and
show tons o' fun what

252
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,625
a magical garment girl
can do! Beat him for me!

253
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,208
You're vile. Seeing you
in that frilly dress

254
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,833
makes me want to vomit!

255
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,791
Could you be any more repugnant?

256
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,416
Well, I don't like it
any more than you do,

257
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,291
but unfortunately,
that's the way it is.

258
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,166
You see, if I
don't wear this dress,

259
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
then I won't be able to fly!

260
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,208
What's taking you so long?
Hurry up and kill it!

261
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
And how am I
supposed to do that?

262
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,625
Aww, come on! Cut off its
big fat head and it'll die!

263
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,666
Oh, well that makes sense.

264
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,083
It's so thick.

265
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,500
If we don't act now. The entire
city will surely be destroyed.

266
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,000
Let the genius
Magical Garment Girl, Haruna,

267
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,500
take care of this one!

268
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,958
Haruna!

269
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:06,083
It's so heavy! Do it, Ayumu!

270
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,291
Well, it's a little dangerous,
but I'll give it a shot. Sera!

271
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,333
What's your plan?

272
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,916
Your sword.
Can you make it bigger?

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,666
It's possible. But what are you
planning to do with it, maggot?

274
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,666
What I need you to do is make
an incision in the whale's neck.

275
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,125
If you can manage that,
I'll take care of the rest!

276
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,625
All right, it's a deal.

277
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,875
But please, do not mistake
this as a sign of friendship.

278
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,625
You're a cross-dressing
filthy maggot,

279
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750
festering in a
bag of rotting garbage.

280
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,416
But because I respect
your power, I'll help.

281
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,250
Two hundred. Three hundred.
Four hundred percent.

282
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,833
When I wear this dress,
I have no limits!

283
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,708
Swallow return strike! Ha!

284
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,458
Seven hundred and fifty.
Eight hundred!

285
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh crap!

286
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,916
Eight hundred fifty.
Nine hundred. A little more!

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,958
He's starting to hit dangerous
levels of cuteness here!

288
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,041
Nine hundred and fifty.
Nine hundred and eighty!

289
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,291
Ayumu, don't! Whatever you do,
don't get any cuter than that!

290
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,916
One thousand percent!

291
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,083
Hey, what the hell is this?

292
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,708
Hurry up, you filthy,
cross-dressing maggot!

293
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm coming, Sera. Hold on!

294
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,791
All right!

295
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,083
Okay, ready for step one
in "How to make a Harem?"

296
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,375
Huh?

297
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,625
Get close to someone
who's always around girls!

298
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,125
Hmm.

299
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,250
Eventually they'll rub off
on you! Right, "best buddy?!"

300
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,666
I feel so used!

301
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,625
Come on! Please help
me make a harem!

302
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,666
I'll do whatever you want!
