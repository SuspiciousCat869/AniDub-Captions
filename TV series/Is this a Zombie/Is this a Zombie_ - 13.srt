1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,416
Festival! Festival!
Come one, come all

2
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,875
to the Festival!
Fe-Fe-Fe-Fe-Festival!

3
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,666
What the...?

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,708
Well, this looks like fun?

5
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,041
They're supposedly doing a
really awesome fireworks show

6
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,625
down at the riverbed but of
course we end up at lamestock.

7
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,208
This thing is
pretty dead, isn't it?

8
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,291
We could do better than this.

9
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,041
Haruna was right, so we decided
the only thing we could do

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,416
was throw our own festival

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,291
and put a certain
person in charge of it.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,333
Check it out! Alright
let's get this thing started!

13
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,833
You guys ready to party or what?

14
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,875
Listen up,
because this competition

15
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,291
is gonna be a major ball buster!

16
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,625
Split open the huge one
hanging from the main hall

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,250
and you'll win a kitten ticket!

18
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,791
One of these
pussycats could be yours!

19
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
Oh, I want a pussy ticket.

20
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,000
Sorry, but it's gonna be another
lonely night for you guys.

21
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,583
Hey what gives? Why are
you all suited up like that?

22
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,458
I see. The whole thing's rigged.

23
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,958
Haruna's gonna let you win so
neither of the girls gets stuck

24
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,500
getting roofied by one
of these desperate losers.

25
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,458
I gotta fight just as
hard as these creeps,

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,875
but I ain't scared
of getting dirty!

27
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,958
Well bring it on!

28
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:30,041
It's a fight over kittens,
so use your claws, boys! And go!

29
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,541
At that moment,
every guy at the Festival

30
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:39,000
had one singular thing on
his mind. Getting the pussycat.

31
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,708
Not only did they want
to be the first one there

32
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,375
and win the kitten-ticket, they
wanted to look manly doing it.

33
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,458
And so, the fierce
competition began with a bang!

34
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,208
It was every man for himself!

35
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,541
First off! Some speed-eating!

36
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,666
Damn! They beat us
to the cotton candy!

37
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,333
Looks like we're
scarfin' octopus balls!

38
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:03,833
I need you in
my mouth! It's hot!

39
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,291
I bet that explosion

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,916
had something to
do with Sera's cooking.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,666
Hold on, what do you mean?

42
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,958
What the hell are you
doing with that stuff?

43
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,791
Are you trying to
cheat or something?

44
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,625
Here this'll make it even!

45
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,583
Well, in that case,
thanks a lot.

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,000
You want a shot of this?

47
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,041
Naw, I'll take
my balls dry, thanks.

48
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,708
Sure your loss. But Sera told me
she made this especially for us!

49
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,208
Don't eat that!

50
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,208
I tried to warn you
but it was too late.

51
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,083
Are you guys gonna be okay?

52
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't wait for me.
Go on. I'll be just fine.

53
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,666
I swear on my life, Orito,

54
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,416
I won't let your
tragic death be in vain.

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
I'll go. And when
I'm on my winning date,

56
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,458
I'll try to make
you proud, buddy.

57
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
You havin' a good time?

58
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,666
I don't understand.

59
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,083
What made you agree
to be one of the prizes?

60
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:14,291
Because Haruna seemed,
sad, huh? As well as...

61
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,666
I get it.

62
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,166
"The goldfish seem
to be having some fun.

63
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,458
It's like they're playing tag.

64
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:28,125
I love watching people
having fun. It makes me happy."

65
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,625
This uphill trail has
been polished so slick,

66
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,333
there's no way these
guys'll ever make it up!

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,125
Well, I guess this can't get
any more difficult, at least.

68
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,500
Swallow-Return Strike!

69
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,208
What in the hell's your problem?

70
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,250
Don't you want me to
beat these old perverts?

71
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,625
Of course not!
You must be out of your mind!

72
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,583
You'd just try to molest her,
you repugnant maggot!

73
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,500
You're wrong. Trust me.
All I wanna do is protect her.

74
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,000
You'll have to get to her first!

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,250
That sucked. What did I do

76
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,791
to deserve this kind
of treatment anyway?

77
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,000
Ayumu! You know
what your problem is?

78
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,916
You got no spunk!

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,333
Orito?

80
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,250
It's what makes a man a man.

81
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,083
And I've got it!
Loads and loads of it!

82
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,041
Are you for real? And wait.

83
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,875
Didn't you just get
killed in that explosion?

84
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,458
That's it! An explosive
fire of adrenaline.

85
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,750
His power spews from
deep inside his loins.

86
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,291
A river of manliness
rages inside me!

87
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,208
And the dam is
just about to blow!

88
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,458
Swallow-Return Strike.

89
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:14,166
Oh please. Guys like you always
blow your dam way too early.

90
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,666
Orito, stop it.
You've gone far enough!

91
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,041
Do you wanna win
that damn ticket or not?

92
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,708
Answer the question, do you
want some pussycat or don't you?

93
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,875
The sex drive is the most
powerful, most human desire

94
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,375
that a person possesses.

95
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,833
You might even
go so far as to say

96
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,041
it's proof that you're alive.

97
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,541
The spirit of
eroticism and desire is one

98
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,916
all human beings can relate to.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,125
By denying its existence,

100
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,291
you're denying your
own existence, as well.

101
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,916
Come on.

102
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:57,708
Yep. I was wrong. But no more.
I gots to get me some kitty!

103
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,000
I may not have a snowball's
chance in hell, but I gotta try!

104
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,291
I'm stakin' my
claim, here and now.

105
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,875
Nobody's playin'
with that kitty but me!

106
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,833
You preach it, brother man!

107
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,458
Wait, what's that?

108
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,166
Holy shit!

109
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,041
That Kokeshi doll looks like...

110
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,041
Let's go.

111
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,583
Oh yeah.

112
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,125
Oh my god! The sexual
energy is rubbing on us.

113
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,916
Is that the strange
tingling in my pants?

114
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,083
You know I'm not gay,

115
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,750
but you're getting sexier
and sexier by the minute.

116
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,833
You too, Orito. You sexy beast.

117
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,458
Let's double team this chick
with the pounding of her life!

118
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,916
Not a chance! Try a
Swallow-Return Strike!

119
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,625
Why don't you
try to swallow this?

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,916
Show 'em all how sexy does it!

121
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:34,208
Watch out pussy cat!
Here I come!

122
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,458
The river of manliness
burst forth from Orito

123
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,916
and he rode it straight
into the arms of victory.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,333
Unfortunately, he celebrated
first by eating a bowl

125
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,791
of Sera's homemade
noodles, which no man,

126
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,250
no matter how virile,
could ever survive.

127
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,250
As they hauled him
away to intensive care,

128
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,583
the sirens rang out,
singing a mournful song

129
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,666
for our fallen hero.

130
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,291
We do appreciate you cooking,
but we could've helped you out.

131
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
It would be awefully
shameful if I stayed here

132
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,708
without pulling my weight.

133
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,916
Don't put that in
your mouth, you big sexy stud.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,500
If you're hungry, I've got
something you can nibble on.

135
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,583
Here. Don't be shy.

136
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,708
I'll try it.

137
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,416
So, basically,
that's the gist of it.

138
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,458
My word. What a fool.

139
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,958
So, in your estimation,
this is what's required?

140
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,208
Hey, Ayumu! Whaddaya got there?

141
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,958
Apparently it's an
ancient vampire ninja recipe.

142
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,208
Oh.

143
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,875
I sure do love meat and
potatoes, don't you guys?

144
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,750
It is said that
Katsushika Hokusai

145
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,291
was the person who made this.

146
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,458
So respect it.

147
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,291
"The Great Wave" guy?

148
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,833
All right, I've done
my part, don't screw it up.

149
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,750
Wow, how crazy.

150
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,708
I mean what great timing!
I signed up for a cooking class

151
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,208
that starts right
after school today!

152
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,833
So. You gave the
recipe to Mael Strom?

153
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,750
Yes. I'm very sorry.

154
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,250
What's wrong with you?

155
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,916
You can't even
run a simple errand?

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,375
Uh, no.

157
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,833
That's a precious document,
you maggot scumbag!

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,541
Yeah, I know. It's no biggie,
we can just ask for it back.

159
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,958
Sit down. Who said you
could relax, maggot breath?

160
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,291
Right. So sorry.

161
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,541
Yo, genius here! What's up?

162
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,958
Haruna, how come
you're answering this phone?

163
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,541
'Cause Dookinori's
busy right now.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,958
You know, this recipe
sure has a lotta really cool

165
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,958
pictures drawn on it.
They're so pretty.

166
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,458
I'm glad to hear it.

167
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,083
I think I might
take it to Villiers

168
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,791
and show it to
my Head Teacher.

169
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:13,958
No, hold on!

170
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,041
I'll talk to you later, okay?

171
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,208
What did she say?

172
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,583
Well, Haruna basically said,

173
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,708
"Try and force it outta me,
you bubble-breasted bimbo!"

174
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,583
Or something kinda like that.

175
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,541
Is that so? Well,
if she wants a piece of me,

176
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,041
I'll give her more
than she can handle!

177
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,083
Um, is it totally
necessary for all of us

178
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,125
to be wearing leotards?

179
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
We're in the
catsuit club. Wanna join?

180
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,208
It looks like
knocking on the door

181
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,750
and asking to come in
isn't the best strategy.

182
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,125
This is the base for
Mael Strom's faction,

183
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,666
so I promise you they're
always ready for an attack.

184
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,166
Go.

185
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Wait, you mean I have to go?

186
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,500
Be a hero.
Please! Do it for me!

187
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,083
I'm a zombie, not a guinea pig.

188
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,083
Hey, be careful! There's really
no telling what might set off

189
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,291
the death lasers, electric
shocks, or concentrated acid.

190
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,416
Now you tell me!

191
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,875
This is no time for joking!

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,041
"ALERT"

193
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,458
Oh, not my cute little tushy!

194
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,708
Come on, just keep going.

195
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,416
Don't you have a heart woman?

196
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
"ALERT"

197
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,083
Wow, I never
would have thought that

198
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,958
a spear in my butt
would feel so fabulous!

199
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
I think I could
take another one!

200
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,500
His repugnance has
finally reached its peak.

201
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,041
Swallow-Return Strike.

202
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,916
It's quiet. There's not
a lot of guards around.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,541
Hmm. Probably because
they didn't figure on anyone

204
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,000
carving open the door like that.

205
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,041
It's only eight o'clock
and both of them are asleep?

206
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,875
What are they, little babies?

207
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,083
Come on, let's find that scroll.

208
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,875
Don't the busty
characters normally do this?

209
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,666
That's the worst
hiding place ever!

210
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Nice and easy. Here goes.

211
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,416
Uh-huh. Well, looky here.

212
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Pervert. Pervert.
Pervert. Pervert. Pervert.

213
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,083
No. It's not like that.

214
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,958
Now for the ol' pullout method.

215
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,875
And that's how it's done!

216
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,000
Intruders.

217
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:20,916
What the--?

218
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,291
Take this, you perv!

219
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,708
Why did you have to hide that
thing down your shirt like that?

220
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,083
Do you want me to
put my foot in your ass?

221
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,916
Creeping around drooling
over boobs might work

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,875
in your dirty magazines,
but it ain't gonna work for me!

223
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,750
Isn't that the truth?

224
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,208
Come on, I'm innocent!

225
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,333
Now open wide!

226
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,750
Well, the recipe doesn't
call for laundry detergent,

227
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,625
so I guess I'll have
to leave it out this time.

228
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,958
Hey, Sera.

229
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,125
I don't get it, why are
you so intent on cooking?

230
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,208
I've lived my whole
life by the sword.

231
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,833
Yeah, but what does
that have to do with it?

232
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,791
The sword might
keep people safe,

233
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,125
but it can never bring
them true happiness.

234
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,125
Not really. But cooking's
different. You see.

235
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,666
The blades of
war are for killing,

236
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,250
but the blades of cooking
are purely for spreading joy.

237
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,833
Yucky!

238
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,041
Please forgive me.
After all this time,

239
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,375
I was hopeful that

240
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,666
my pitiful cooking skills
had improved somewhat.

241
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,041
Perhaps I should've added
the detergent after all.

242
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,125
It's nasty.

243
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:49,208
But coming from you, it's
not bad. So gimme some more!

244
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,333
To stick with the
theme of miso soup,

245
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,208
I used a tiny mythril sword.

246
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,166
I guess I understand?

247
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,083
If you abbreviate my-thril
sword you get mi-so.

248
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,583
Don't you realize these
wordplay jokes don't translate?

249
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,875
Hey, Tae! Didn't you hear me?

250
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,500
Sorry about that.

251
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,250
What were you daydreaming about?

252
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,500
Huh?

253
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,875
Come on, you were like,
in deep space just now.

254
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,666
Oh I'm fine. It's nothing.

255
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,583
The time has come!

256
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,625
The traditional card
matching tournament begins now!

257
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,291
This year's theme is Nursery
Rhymes, so I hope you brushed up

258
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,666
on your kindergarten
reading list, 'cause here we go!

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,708
Cards and nursery rhymes?

260
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:59,041
What, are we in grade
school here? Am I right or what?

261
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,416
No way, you're dead wrong.

262
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Don't you get it?

263
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,458
Right now,
we're explorers, in search of

264
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,291
a brave new world in
the crevices of dark places.

265
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,666
The winner of this year's
contest will be awarded a prize!

266
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,625
A totally awesome fountain pen!

267
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,208
Whoa, seriously!

268
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,041
You really think
that's a good prize?

269
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,708
Oh yeah! Who wouldn't?

270
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,541
All right!

271
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,708
The preliminary
match begins... now!

272
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,833
"Mary had a little
lamb whose fleece..."

273
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,416
it "was white as snow!"

274
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
"Jack and Jill went up
the hill to fetch a" what?

275
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,166
 "To fetch a pail of water!"

276
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,291
Nice job, Orito.

277
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,541
Yeah, you too, man.

278
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,833
I wanna ride out this
moment no matter what it takes,

279
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,291
do you understand me?

280
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,791
If that means winning
this dumbass game, so be it!

281
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,333
"Peter Piper picked a" what?

282
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,000
"A peck of pickled peppers!"

283
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,875
"One, two, buckle my shoe!"

284
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,833
"Three, four,
knock at the door!"

285
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,958
"Humpty Dumpty
had a great fall!"

286
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,875
"All the King's horses,
and all the King's men,

287
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,166
couldn't put Humpty
back together again!"

288
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,083
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, only two more rounds

289
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,916
to go and this
competition will be over!

290
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,041
Now I present to you,
the masters of rhyme!

291
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,750
The semi-finalists!

292
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,916
Oh yeah! Let's do this thing!

293
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,875
"One fish, two fish..."

294
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,625
"One fish, two fish,
red fish, blue fish."

295
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,166
Oh no!

296
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,083
Hey! Why the hell
are you standing up?

297
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,208
So I can look down
on you, lowly maggot.

298
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,416
I've facing something
way too powerful.

299
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,916
It's got me in its grip
but I don't wanna look away.

300
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
Be strong, man!

301
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,583
I don't give a crap if I win
anymore! 'Cause right now?

302
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,750
I can see the promised land!

303
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,958
Snap out of it, Orito! You may
be able to sneak a peek,

304
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,041
but those dark
stockings don't show a thing!

305
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,333
You have no imagination!

306
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,708
In my head, I'm practically
sealing the deal!

307
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,625
You boys can look all you want.

308
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,750
Because either way,
I'm winning this.

309
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,666
That's a dirty trick, ya know?

310
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,208
Say what you will. It may be
a dirty trick, but it works.

311
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:16,041
Go ahead and objectify me,
perverts. It just helps me win.

312
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah? Well, two can
play at that game.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,875
"Old Mother Hubbard!
Went to the cupboard!"

314
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,208
You got it, Yuki!

315
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,250
"To get her poor doggie a bone!"

316
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,583
Yeah, totally nailed that one!

317
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,500
So that's it. I knew
there was no way she'd make it

318
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,541
this far without a little help.

319
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,833
"Little Johnny wants to play."

320
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,375
"Rain, rain, go away!"

321
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,083
"Baa baa black sheep,
have you any wool?"

322
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,250
"Yes sir, yes sir,
three bags full!"

323
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,750
Didn't see this coming!

324
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,875
Got a bit of a three-way
with Ayumu, Yuki, and Taeko!

325
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,000
But who's getting lucky?

326
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,041
How 'bout that, I made
it all the way to the top?

327
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,583
How come you only
took that first card?

328
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,333
It doesn't matter, I got what
was most important, after all.

329
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,541
It's go time!
Let's see some slappin!

330
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,666
"Star light, star bright,
the first star I see tonight."

331
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,458
"I wish I may, I wish I might!"

332
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,708
"She sells sea
shells by the..."

333
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,791
It's "she sells sea shells by
the sea shore!"

334
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,208
Last one.
"Old McDonald had a farm."

335
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,375
You got it!

336
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,250
Ee-aye-ee-aye-oh!

337
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,750
It's her boobs.
Right there. I want to look.

338
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,250
I really want to look.

339
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,458
But I can't. I can't do that.
I can't look! Don't do it.

340
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:00,916
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't you do it! Don't you...

341
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,625
Aw this is way better
than some stupid pen.

342
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,083
Alright folks,
let's hear it for Yuki!

343
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,500
Did she earn that pen or what?

344
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,041
Oh yeah!

345
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,416
Well, that's all
for today! Shimomura out!

346
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,791
So did you let her
win on purpose or not?

347
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,000
You could tell, huh?

348
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,458
I thought that would
probably work. Are you mad?

349
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,958
No. Not at all.
I just wondered why.

350
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,083
'Cause of how
badly Yuki wanted it.

351
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,083
We're talkin' about the
fountain pen here, right?

352
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,250
That's actually really
sweet of you. Nice goin'!

353
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,458
Really?

354
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,166
I always thought you
were really sweet, too.

355
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,375
You have?

356
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,750
Remember that time.
A rainy day just like today.

357
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,458
I was coming home
from school. Remember?

358
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,875
And I found that
abandoned puppy.

359
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,250
We wanted to keep him, but we
weren't allowed to have a dog.

360
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,500
And I brought
another umbrella from home.

361
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,916
So at the very least, I could
keep his head from getting wet.

362
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,916
And then.

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,166
Ah, there, there.
You must've been cold.

364
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,500
I'm not allowed to have a
dog or I'd keep you. Sorry.

365
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,875
Uh. Here.

366
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:37,166
Take it. I want
you to. It's yours.

367
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,708
Thanks a lot.

368
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:46,000
Did that actually happen?
I don't remember.

369
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:50,416
Yes, it did. For sure.
And I'll never forget it.

370
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You taught me what
kindness means that day.

371
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,041
Since then,
I've been watching you.

372
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,041
I've always
wanted to be like you.

373
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,083
Can't get enough of
that tush. What a man!

374
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,833
That's so sweet.
You're makin' me blush.
