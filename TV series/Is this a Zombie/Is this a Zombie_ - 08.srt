1
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,041
Shakespeare wrote,
"Men are April when they woo,

2
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,208
December when they wed. Maids
are May when they are maids,

3
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,416
but the sky changes
when they are wives."

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,291
Shakespeare also wrote,
"To climb steep hills requires

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,541
slow pace at first"
and "How poor are they

6
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,625
that have not patience."

7
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,000
That exam was so tough.

8
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,583
It's also said. "People
never realize the true worth

9
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,500
of something they care
deeply about until it is lost."

10
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,041
Nice catch.

11
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,833
I believe these belong
to me, thank you very much.

12
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,875
Let's see here.
If I were to guess,

13
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,958
I'd say you were
being perverted again.

14
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:50,000
You're repugnant. You're nothing
but a crude, obscene person.

15
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,625
Forgive me, I misspoke.
You're not a crude,

16
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,500
obscene person but
a crude, obscene little maggot.

17
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,291
I know, I know, I'm a filthy
zombie, a magic tranny pervert,

18
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,250
and a crude
obscene little maggot, too

19
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,875
Hey, hot stuff.

20
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,583
You're late. You dim-wit!

21
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,291
Why in the hell are
you dressed like that?

22
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,583
Don't you remember? I snatched
away all your special powers.

23
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,708
And your outfit. See?

24
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,875
Don't come near me!
Just stay back perv-bag.

25
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,083
I mean it! Let me go!

26
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,208
You really are sexy ya know?

27
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,708
Not to mention, beautiful.

28
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,833
The other girls
don't even come close.

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
What're you doing?

30
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,666
Now close your eyes.
My gorgeous little angel.

31
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
What's wrong with you?

32
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,250
Noooo!

33
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,750
Eu, you're so naughty.

34
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,791
You really think I
should take off my pants?

35
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,833
How dare you try
to do nasty things

36
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:46,083
to me in my dreams you big
pervert! Say you're sorry!

37
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,875
You should count your blessings.

38
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,041
After violating her in her
dream like that, you're lucky

39
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,375
she didn't throw you
into the sunlight to fry.

40
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,333
How the hell am I
responsible for her sex dreams?

41
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,708
And although I don't care for
her, I can't help but feel sorry

42
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,250
for Mael, since you
forced yourself on her as well.

43
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,083
That was an accident!

44
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,291
That's so sweet.
Thanks for sticking up for me.

45
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,958
That stupid jerk.

46
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,875
What the hell did he
have to kiss her for anyway?

47
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,333
Ayumu, what is up, bro?

48
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,875
I've been Jonesin' big
time for more of those eggs.

49
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,500
Let me just grab
a couple. Uh. What the hell.

50
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,416
That looks like a box of
burnt sperm, what gives?

51
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,833
Seriously? You're Japanese
and you've never seen

52
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,500
boiled seaweed before?
Not the most delicious stuff.

53
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,375
But Haruna thought I
deserved it for some reason.

54
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,916
Oh mama! That's amazing!

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,250
Give me some!

56
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,208
I want a bite!

57
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,250
Wow! So good!

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,708
Yeah!

59
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,625
Yuki! One more lap to go!

60
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,416
Oh my god. Did you see
that big box of seaweed?

61
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,833
It wasn't that bad I guess,
but it looked totally gross.

62
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,041
Yeah, I thought he was
supposed to be the eggman.

63
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,833
Well. Maybe seaweed's the
next big thing or something.

64
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,625
They say it's supposed
to be good for dieting.

65
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,791
Really? I wonder
why he had it then,

66
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,458
he's like super scrawny.
I could use some though.

67
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,875
Hey, Kanami.

68
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,375
What's up?

69
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,333
You're in the same
class as Ayumu, aren't you?

70
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,208
Oh yeah, totes.
You got something going on?

71
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,916
Oh, not really.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,166
But could you give me a
little advice about him?

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,500
What you wanna fall
in love with him?

74
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,833
Hey, this is private
information so do me a favor

75
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,250
and keep a lid on it!

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,458
Are we talking about
the same guy here?

77
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,916
He's always hanging
out with that creepy nerd.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,791
You said fall in love, right?

79
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:29,000
Not that you fell in love
already. Are you even going out?

80
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,291
You can do better than
a guy like that, can't you?

81
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,291
I can't help it, okay?
It's a law, so it ain't my...

82
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,500
I mean, I uh...
Look, it's a really long story.

83
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,541
But the bottom line is this:
I have to fall in love

84
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,791
with the guy eventually,
no matter what it takes.

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,708
Here we go with
another long story.

86
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,625
He ain't my first choice
in guys or anything,

87
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,416
but I gotta fall for him.

88
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,250
The real problem is
it's my first time,

89
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,125
so I don't know what I'm doin'.

90
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,166
And it's a super big deal
cause we're gonna get married

91
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,833
so I gotta make
sure he doesn't hate me!

92
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,875
Hold on a second. Now you
two are gonna get married?

93
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,416
Uh, well, I have to, okay?

94
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,291
If me and him are
gonna be together forever

95
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:15,166
he's really gotta like me.
He's gotta like fall in love.

96
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,458
All right just keep your
dress on okay,

97
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,833
let me think here for
a sec. Showing a little skin

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,833
will get him to notice you
but if you want him to love you,

99
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,000
you should totally
make him some food!

100
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,375
Sexy food!

101
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
Welcome home, you big stud.

102
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,041
Anything you wanna eat?
I'll do anything for you.

103
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,375
I'm your little slave.

104
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,250
That's doesn't
sound like me at all!

105
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,125
Hey! You spazz! Don't freak out.

106
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,416
Take a deep breath!

107
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,875
Hmm?

108
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,375
Shut up.

109
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,833
I'd start out
making lunches for him

110
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,708
every day before
he goes to school.

111
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,541
I'll get on it
first thing tomorrow.

112
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,083
Then again, he seems
to be stepping up

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,375
his lunch game lately,
so it might be tough.

114
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,458
You're gonna have to
work your ass off on 'em.

115
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,083
Yeah. You're right.

116
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,541
You giving up that easy?

117
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,916
Not on your life!

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,875
Because the tougher
they come, the harder they fall!

119
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,083
It'll be just like one
of your track meets, Yuki.

120
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,416
Yeah, whatever.

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,875
I ain't giving up!

122
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,166
And one more thing.
You really are gonna have

123
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,875
to do something
about the way you talk.

124
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,208
How I talk? But why?
There ain't nothin' wrong.

125
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,541
Ain't "ain't" a word, you know?

126
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,458
Why is that such a big deal?

127
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,291
Just take my word for it okay?
Now you gotta try and wow him.

128
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
Yeah? But how?

129
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,041
Find out what he's
into and be that for him.

130
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,125
Try to be what
he fantasizes about.

131
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,375
Of course,
word on the street is

132
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
that he's into
little girls, so...

133
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,291
If you be my big strong man,
I'll be your sweet, little girl.

134
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,500
Wanna play?

135
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,375
Um. Gross.

136
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,750
Yeah well. That's his thing.

137
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,500
Maybe, but I
ain't... Uh, I mean.

138
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,625
I'm not really
that type of girl.

139
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,833
Aw come on you
just gotta put on

140
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,583
your big girl pants
and make it happen!

141
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,083
Well, I'll try.

142
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,375
So that's what
boys like. Okay.

143
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,875
Here ya go.

144
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,375
You made me lunch.

145
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,500
And I'm gonna keep
makin' it for you everyday.

146
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:14,375
From here on out. A good wife
has gotta keep her man happy.

147
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,250
Wow, that's really nice of you.

148
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
As long as it's not that ramen
stuff you made me before,

149
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,333
I'll definitely take it.

150
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,500
Sorry bout that.

151
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,041
Aw. Come on.
I'm just messin with ya.

152
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,958
It looks really good.

153
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,083
Nicely done.
Guys just love that box.

154
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,375
Come on, Tomonori, you gonna
share the wealth or not?

155
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,208
Hyyahh! No.
Hands off four eyes!

156
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,458
I made it especially for him.

157
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,541
All right, I don't mind if I do.

158
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,125
Hold on!

159
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,958
Lemme season it a little.

160
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,416
Well, bon appétit or whatever.

161
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,750
Uh, thanks. I think.

162
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,000
A secret message?
Let's see here.

163
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,958
Uh... I feel like I
drank a gallon of gas.

164
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,750
If someone put a match to me
right now, I'd go up in flames.

165
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,791
Okay. So after I make him lunch,

166
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,416
then what am i supposed to do?

167
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,333
Duh! You gotta work
on your chemistry together.

168
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,958
What kinda chemistry
are you talking about?

169
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,583
Well, what kind do you think?

170
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,333
Really? Aw this sucks!

171
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm just not a
make-the-first-move kinda girl!

172
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,916
Listen. Just trust
me here, okay?

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,208
And if you play
your cards right,

174
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,875
who knows how far it'll go!

175
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,083
Seriously?

176
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,000
All right.

177
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
Hey Ayumu, do you
wanna walk home together?

178
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,708
Uh... Okay.

179
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,541
Hey. Is this the
way home for you?

180
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,666
Yeah. Sure is.

181
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,208
It'll get me
close enough at least.

182
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,791
So. Tell me,
what kinda house does

183
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,958
a vampire ninja live in? Is
it like some ninja compound?

184
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,833
Hey. You're gonna
blow my cover!

185
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,708
Being a vampire ninja's
a secret, you know.

186
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,791
And if you wanna
keep it that way

187
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,833
you should lower
your voice ya dummy!

188
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,416
Look at that, right in
the middle of the street.

189
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,250
Kids these days sure
are bold, aren't they?

190
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,708
Uh... Tomonori.
Sorry 'bout that.

191
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,791
Come on. I told you
before I don't like that name.

192
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,833
It just sounds
way too formal for me.

193
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,083
Well, how 'bout
I call you "Kooky Yuki?'

194
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,791
That's even worse!

195
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,875
I was just kidding.

196
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
Call me whatever you want.

197
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,208
Hey, listen.

198
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,500
Hmm?

199
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,458
I didn't agree to
marry you, so do me a favor,

200
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,166
don't go around saying
you're my bride, okay?

201
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,166
I've already made up
my mind to be your bride

202
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,708
so am I just supposed
to ignore how I feel?

203
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,166
And what?
My feelings don't matter?

204
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,333
Sorry, but the law's the law.

205
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,833
But don't worry,
I know I can be

206
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,625
the kinda girl
you're looking for!

207
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,958
I promise.

208
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,500
You sure are stubborn.

209
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,791
I guess you're
gonna start talking about

210
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,666
moving in with me too, right?

211
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,750
I'd love to move in
with you, but since Seraphim

212
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,916
is living there I don't think

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,375
it'd be all that
great of an idea.

214
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh yeah. That whole thing.

215
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,541
I forgot that you two are
kinda at odds or something.

216
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,583
Our two factions haven't gotten
along for like a hundred years.

217
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,833
So we wouldn't make
very good roommates.

218
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,083
It sounds like it's
off the table to me, then.

219
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,583
We don't really
have the room anyway.

220
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,000
By the way. What happened
to your ramen machine?

221
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,125
Yeah, that.

222
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,291
It broke.

223
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
Well. I'm this way.

224
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,083
Oh. I'm the other way.

225
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,500
Hey, can I tell you something?

226
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,666
Sure.

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,625
I really think you
and I could mesh well.

228
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,958
But what if we didn't
use words like "bride"?

229
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,208
What if we say
we're just friends?

230
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,458
I thought I made this clear,

231
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,041
but I ain't doin' that! I can't!

232
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,458
Yeah, but--

233
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,083
I'm doin' everything I
can to fall in love with you!

234
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,750
So you have to do everything
you can to fall in love with me!

235
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,583
That's how this works.
So you have to try harder!

236
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,916
Aww, look at that,
a lover's spat.

237
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,083
Kids these days sure are bold.

238
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,083
Hey! You don't have to shout
it out from a mountain top.

239
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,833
It's embarrassing
enough as it is!

240
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,125
Oh shut up! It's even
more embarrassing for me!

241
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,458
Oh yeah? Well, I'm the one
who's really embarrassed here!

242
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,208
What the hell? Haruna? That's
a lotta hat you got there.

243
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,708
What's with the outfit?

244
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,041
Well excuse me. And you look
pretty ridiculous yourself!

245
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,208
But what are you
doing all the way out here?

246
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,875
I was going to come
pick you up, you big dummy.

247
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,458
What the heck was that for?

248
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,250
'Cause I'm in a bad mood!

249
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah, thanks,
I gathered as much.

250
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,958
Look, next time I have a
day off, I'll take you out

251
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,041
and we'll have
some fun, so cheer up.

252
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,166
You really mean it?

253
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,958
Yeah. It'll be my thank you

254
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,708
for helping me
out with that test.

255
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,125
So, it'll be the two of
us and no one else, right?

256
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,041
Wait a sec. I want you
to take me with you too!

257
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,583
I mean, we're supposed
to be together,

258
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,958
so it only makes sense.

259
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,458
Sure, why not?
And while we're at it,

260
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,791
why don't we invite the
other girls to tag along.

261
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,833
How does that sound?

262
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,333
Yeah, but--

263
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,083
Well, all right then,
it's a date!

264
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,000
I never said that,
we'll just be hangin' out!

265
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,916
We got a date! We got a date!

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,083
We got a date and
it's gonna be great!

267
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,000
Hmm. I wonder if this
will affect the economy.

268
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,583
Well, the ladies always
get my stock to go up.

269
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,583
Wow, a zombie
in a mall huh?

270
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,125
I think I might have
seen this somewhere before.

271
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,291
Hey, Ayumu?

272
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,125
Can we maybe hold hands?

273
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,625
I think we should.
I'm your bride, remember?

274
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,208
Come on, didn't I ask
you to stop talking like that?

275
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,166
What's the big deal?
We're a couple, right?

276
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,666
Everywhere we go,
they're all over each other.

277
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,208
Oh my,! Get a room you two.

278
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,291
What's the hold up?
We don't have all freakin' day!

279
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,583
Oh, sorry.

280
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,875
We've got shopping to do.

281
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,000
Ta-da!

282
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,750
How much cash is
this gonna cost me?

283
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,791
Hey. That would
look really good on you.

284
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,791
You should try it on.

285
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,166
What?

286
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,750
And then, try these.
You'd look absolutely amazing!

287
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,791
No, you festering
pile of maggot dung!

288
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,916
Sorry.

289
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
Meow.

290
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,708
Ah! My eyes!

291
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
These panties are cute, huh?

292
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,208
Yeah, but I think this
nighty is more my style.

293
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,666
My eyeballs have
finally regenerated.

294
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,791
Oh wow. That's some
pretty fancy underwear.

295
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,458
I guess it's
for "special occasions".

296
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,875
That bed looks so nice,

297
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,250
it's almost a shame
we have to mess it up.

298
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,500
We do?

299
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,166
Don't you worry about
a thing. I'll be gentle.

300
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,916
You will?

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,375
Well at first.

302
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,375
Real nice and gentle.

303
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,875
There's no way
I'm ready for that!

304
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,500
Wow, this is great!

305
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,500
I buy all this stuff for you
guys and I get to carry it too.

306
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,416
I'm so hungry.

307
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,833
I need you to fill me up,
you big sexy stud you.

308
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,750
Well, should we go
get something to eat?

309
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,625
Yeah, I'm starving!

310
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,791
Me, too. What should we get?

311
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,625
Need some help?

312
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,250
Eh... Don't bother.

313
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,875
I hope you have a lovely day.

314
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,375
Yeah, I know it's fast food, but
I hope everyone's okay with it.

315
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,250
Oh, yes! You sexy beast!

316
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,416
If you're hungry,
I've got something you can eat!

317
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,541
The food looks great,
so let's eat it up!

318
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,875
Put down that sauce right now!

319
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,333
I can't let you
disrespect the beef like that.

320
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,041
No good?

321
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
No good.

322
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,083
It's impolite to the chef, too.

323
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,291
All right then. If you
say so, I'll give it a try.

324
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,958
I don't get it. Why the
hell'd you have to kiss her?

325
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,708
You're still
going on about that?

326
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,541
You know it wasn't on purpose.

327
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,000
It never would've happened
if you hadn't pushed me anyway.

328
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,416
Nu-uh predator,
this was all your fault!

329
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,250
Don't just sit there!
Come on and have some fun!

330
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,416
Yeah. Sure.

331
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,208
Hey do me a favor
and watch the bags okay!

332
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, Mommy, I want that one!

333
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,791
You need to watch
that attitude young man.

334
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,125
I like this one.
And this one, too.

335
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,875
You've gotta be in
grade school to think

336
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,750
a kiss means that
you're married to someone!

337
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625
She doesn't exactly
have a choice in the matter,

338
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,708
it's the law.

339
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,041
We've kissed, so
according to your rules

340
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,541
we must be married too!

341
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,458
That was different, I had
to suck your blood to survive.

342
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,875
Besides, you're a woman.

343
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,416
Girl-on-girl
action doesn't count.

344
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,750
Hey, what's up?

345
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,000
You want something to drink?

346
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,916
Ayumu, there's something
I want you to do for me.

347
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,166
What d'ya want?

348
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,708
Look at me.

349
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,041
Make up your mind.

350
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,583
I want you to kiss me!

351
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,083
Here I am, out for a nice
stroll, and I run into you.

352
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,250
Well. Quite an
unlucky coincidence.

353
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,375
Wouldn't you agree, Eucliwood?

354
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,208
What are you
waiting for? Kiss me!

355
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,875
Just be a man for
once and get on with it!

356
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,750
I don't think
that's a good idea.

357
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,791
I mean things are
complicated enough as it is!

358
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,833
Are you trying to
play hard to get?

359
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,791
What's your problem? I'm a bad
ass genius Magical Garment Girl!

360
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,083
Hold on!

361
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,666
Why in the hell you
would pick that girl

362
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,291
to be the only one you kiss!
She ain't got nothing on me!

363
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,500
Stop it!

364
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,625
And what kind of
scumbag invites someone out

365
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,541
on a date and then
brings other people?

366
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,541
Are you trying to turn this into
some kinda gross group thing?

367
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,708
Haruna? Please be
gentle with me.

368
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,375
You're gettin' off
easy this time, buddy.

369
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,083
Hank you berry mush,
das berry kind.

370
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,333
Sorry that took so long.

371
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:11,250
Hold on. Where's
the neckwear-mancer?

372
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,833
I know it's kinda weird,

373
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,583
but I'm really excited
about our marriage, aren't you?

374
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,375
Yeah, I'm completely overjoyed.

375
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,041
Awesome! I knew
you'd come around!

376
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,125
Let's start making
plans for our real wedding.

377
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,375
I've got colors picked out and--

378
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,708
Look, I'm way too
young to get married, so--

379
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,375
Ah shut up and get to
work on those invitations!

380
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,875
Hope you like licking stamps!
