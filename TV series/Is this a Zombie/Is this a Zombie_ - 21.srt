1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,333
Chris, the most powerful
Magical Garment Girl...

2
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,916
Led an unsuccessful
coup and was given

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,208
a truly hellish
punishment by the queen.

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,291
She was forced to take the
form of a boring, impotent,

5
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,625
middle-aged man,
and to make matters worse,

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,958
a high school teacher.

7
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,958
What are we gonna do about
getting Haruna's power back?

8
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,416
Um...

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,916
Well, considering that she
would wipe the floor with me

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,666
in a battle, I wouldn't
suggest that you attempt

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,666
to engage her yourself.

12
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,500
I can't believe that I thought
she was a Goth-chick.

13
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,833
How queer.

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,333
Anyway...

15
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,541
Is there anything else you
can think of that might work?

16
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,458
Perhaps, but I've
been trying to decide if

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,916
I should tell you or not.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,916
Oh, let me help...

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,333
Yes you should tell me!

20
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,666
I know that you
may not trust her,

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,791
but Kyoko has
offered a suggestion.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,833
Kyoko?!

23
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,083
She claims to know
what Chris's weakness is.

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,500
You believe her?

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,333
Yes.

26
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,958
Then let's do what she says.

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,166
Right away!

28
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
Kyoko, the busty magical garment
girl who first sent Ayumu

29
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,666
to the underworld, plunges
like a revealing neckline

30
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,208
into the picture once again.

31
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,750
Now she wants
to join with Ayumu,

32
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,208
but her motives are unclear.

33
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,625
Revenge, remorse,
or removal of garments--

34
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
what could she have in mind?

35
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,208
The tea is really yummy. Seems
like it's been quite a while...

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,041
since we last met.

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,541
Yeah, well you've been kinda...

38
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,875
tied up.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,333
And we're bound together...

40
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,583
You and I've literally been

41
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,625
all the way through hell
and back haven't we?

42
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,750
Thanks for reminding me who
sent me there in the first place

43
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,041
when you turned my guts
into swiss cheese.

44
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,083
Oh, I know I've done
some bad things,

45
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,208
but I wish you'd stop
givin' me the evil eye...

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,250
Believe it or not
I'm totally a good girl now.

47
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,875
Who the hell are you, again?

48
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,250
Uh...

49
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,708
You forget about that
huge fight we had with her?

50
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,666
I live my life
on the cutting edge, pal.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,375
I'm not some loser
who's stuck in the past.

52
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,750
So...

53
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,916
still the same Haruna
who only cares for herself.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,916
Talk about evil eye!

55
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,041
There's something
that I don't understand...

56
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,291
Tell me...

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,250
what kind of court
would decide to free you?

58
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,458
In Villiers, you wear the
dress, you make your own rules.

59
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,708
Well, that explains a lot...

60
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,583
actually.

61
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,083
Well I gotta admit,

62
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,666
I'm curious as to how you know
what Chris's weakness is.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,750
The King of the Night
told me...

64
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,791
It was from something
he said the one time he ever

65
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,208
brought up anything positive
about what happened to him

66
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,458
back in the day.

67
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,916
Another name I didn't
wanna hear again.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,875
Okay, what is it?

69
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,958
You're always
such a serious guy.

70
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,583
But if you promise
to show me a good time,

71
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,666
I promise I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know!

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,250
That's my deal, so you
can take it or leave it.

73
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:54,958
A good...

74
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,541
time?

75
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,458
Yep...

76
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,750
You know...

77
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,875
I haven't had
any real excitement

78
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,041
since I got
taken back to Villiers...

79
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,041
I've been so bored and lonely.

80
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,208
Watch where you're
pointin' those things...!

81
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,000
You're like
a walking boobie trap!

82
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,916
For a "genius" you don't know
much about keeping quiet...

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,333
I know you've lost your
powers, and I will kill you.

84
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,791
Listen bitch just because your
boobs are a millimeter bigger

85
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,833
doesn't mean
you're any better!

86
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,958
All I have to do
is have some fun with you?

87
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,625
That's right...

88
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,375
Bad idea.

89
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,083
I'll show you
a real good time alright.

90
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,416
Listen...

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,833
I know you're
not crazy about this,

92
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,833
but I gotta handle it myself.

93
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,333
She's a psychopathic
serial killer.

94
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,500
She's unfinished business.

95
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,916
This ends here...

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,250
and now!

97
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,208
Then I understand...

98
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,541
And I can also trust

99
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,375
that you will endeavor
to make good on your word.

100
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,916
Thank you Sera.

101
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,541
Oh there's
that big strong man!

102
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,458
I can't stand to spend
another night alone.

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,875
Three hundred percent power!

104
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,083
Don't play around with me.

105
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,000
Why not...

106
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,708
It beats playing
with myself...

107
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,291
Hey, aren't you turned on
by little girls with pigtails?

108
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,375
Let's step outside.

109
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,833
Are you gonna take me out
on the town?

110
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,291
Is it a date?

111
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,166
Such a blatant
disrespect of privacy...

112
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,750
The nerve of some
people is appalling.

113
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,250
Here ya go.

114
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,083
Oh...

115
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,958
That is so sweet, thank you!

116
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,125
Haven't had coffee in a while.

117
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,583
All they gave me was water
in that god-forsaken hellhole!

118
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,500
She didn't even drink it!

119
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,958
uh...

120
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,166
I know the swing's
a lotta fun...

121
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,958
But let's head back.

122
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,916
Let's stay out for just a little
bit longer, pretty please?

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,083
I gotta get up and go
to school in the morning.

124
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:17,958
How silly...

125
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,041
 A zombie that goes to school.

126
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,291
I know it's ridiculous,

127
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,458
but I still gotta try
to keep up appearances.

128
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,250
Well I haven't had
my fill yet...

129
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,916
But there is something
I've always wanted to do

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,708
that would be
a whole lotta fun!

131
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,083
What's that?

132
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,875
If you make this happen...

133
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,791
You will have lived up
to your end of the bargain

134
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,666
and I'll give you
anything you want.

135
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,625
I would love to be in the
middle of a group thing...

136
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,958
Mix things up with
a buncha couples.

137
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,500
Do you remember what happened?

138
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,791
Not really, someone
must've spiked the drinks.

139
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,958
So...

140
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,375
A group blind-date?

141
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,541
Yeah...

142
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,166
I mean, we're all
still young and firm...

143
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,500
so let's live it up
while we can!

144
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,208
You're usually
such a boner deflator

145
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,125
that I'm kinda suspicious...

146
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,625
 What's up your sleeve, man?

147
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,416
You're right,
It wasn't my idea ...

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,916
A girl from
another school asked me,

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
so I thought
"you only live once!"

150
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,125
But you're the one
that's putting it all together?

151
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,250
Girl it sounds like
you need to get yo freak on.

152
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,458
O M G.

153
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,583
Come on!

154
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,791
Let loose,
raise the roof, get stupid!

155
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,541
Holla!

156
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,041
Are you okay?

157
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,708
Yeah of course,
I'm awesome...

158
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,458
Livin' large and
in charge girlie...

159
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,166
word.

160
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,750
Let's go see the nurse.

161
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,750
Hey, don't be
such a player hater...

162
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,625
 Let's get off the hizzook!

163
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,958
Oh you really have no idea

164
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,333
what you're getting
yourself into, Ayumu...

165
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,291
I can't wait
to see you squirm...

166
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
It'll be so hot.

167
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,916
What is her deal?

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,208
Rabies?

169
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,375
"Group date"...

170
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,750
 "First time"...

171
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,083
For boys and girls...

172
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,666
Very desperate...

173
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,500
How can you be so slimy and yet
so dried up at the same time?

174
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,875
I really had to overdo the
enthusiasm at school today...

175
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Laughing on the outside
while dying on the inside.

176
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,208
Like a clown!

177
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,041
I hope you know that I'm doing
all of this for your sake.

178
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,666
Really, well do you want me to
give you a hand with something?

179
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,666
No, I think things
are hard enough already.

180
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,500
Cool!

181
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,250
Just try not to screw it up!

182
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,791
Wow, you're really plannin'
to go all out for this, huh?

183
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,333
Oh, yeah...!

184
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,416
Gonna have a funky good time!

185
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,458
And of course both of you lovely
young ladies will be getting in

186
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,500
for the unbelievably low price
of just a smile and a wink.

187
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,041
Dude, you really need
to start drinking more water!

188
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,083
Hey, he's really into this,

189
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,250
so let's go to
make him feel better.

190
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,041
Free food sounds pretty sweet.

191
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,625
This party's gonna be
the bomb-diggity!

192
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,083
You're digging your hole
deeper and deeper Ayumu...

193
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,416
You better bring all the
lotion from your bedside table,

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,125
'cause you're gonna dry out
like an old guy's nads.

195
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,041
I'm beginning to understand what
you're trying to do here...

196
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,541
Getting retribution on

197
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,208
the person that you feel made
your existence unbearable.

198
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,416
Come on...

199
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,625
I really am looking
forward to the party...

200
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,208
Since I'm outta prison,

201
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,666
I've gotta start getting back
into the social game don't I?

202
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,125
Ha...

203
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,458
You're far too petty for me
to believe that nonsense.

204
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,125
So, you think you're
just way above all that.

205
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
We ninjas do not
consider ourselves above

206
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,583
whatever our duty
may require of us.

207
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,375
Is that so?

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,791
You justify whatever
you claim as your duty.

209
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,416
And now you've shown me
your true colors as a woman

210
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,458
who's become attached to Ayumu.

211
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,208
Utter rubbish.

212
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,000
Well...

213
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,083
If we're done here...

214
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,916
Their love for you
is nothing...

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,833
compared to the hatred
that burns inside me.

216
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:09,375
Yamada!

217
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,458
Hanako!

218
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,333
You kids have some
explaining to do!

219
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,875
No holding hands, talking,
or making goo-goo eyes!

220
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,250
That is an order!

221
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,583
Hey Saras!

222
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,666
Looky looky,
I got my ticket to party!

223
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
That inane
group mixer thing...

224
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,208
A waste of time...

225
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm far too busy preparing
for my next concert.

226
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,291
Oh, you're
not even gonna go...?

227
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,875
Geez, Ayumu worked
pretty hard on it.

228
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:37,416
What?

229
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,333
It's his party?

230
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,250
Yeah.

231
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,916
Well, that dirty little tramp...

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,541
With the dirty little rump...

233
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,000
As the situation stands now,
I can't say I'm interested.

234
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,541
Wow, seriously?

235
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,666
You should go...

236
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,958
 Have fun.

237
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,958
Oh yeah...!

238
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,958
So, what is a mixer?

239
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,500
A silly human
group-courtship ritual...

240
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,291
A make-out party.

241
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,875
Make out with a group?

242
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,083
People all around the world
seek out each other's...

243
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,333
um, companionship...

244
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,291
It's natural, but this party is
meant to speed up the process;

245
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,500
give nature a lil'
kick in the ass.

246
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,875
What does Gaia have in store
for the folks gathered here?

247
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,791
Thank you all
for coming tonight...

248
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,958
now what do you say
we get this party started!

249
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,208
Ha!!

250
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,500
I can see his nipples!

251
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,000
That is a pretty bold look
for a guy to pull off!

252
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,416
That's the last time I get
fashion tips off the web!

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
This alone was worth it!

254
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,208
Pretty cool, brah.

255
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,541
They said this is
the cutting edge look

256
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,125
on all the fashion blogs!

257
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,833
Did anyone order
a hot side of beef?

258
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,208
You got one too?!

259
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,250
Oh no!

260
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,833
You're nipple twins!

261
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,833
You guys must cruise
the same sites.

262
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,333
Can I please just
vanish right now?

263
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,833
Alright kids,
the star is here!

264
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,541
I hope you're ready for
some Garment Girls gone wild.

265
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,125
They both insisted on coming
here, so I am their chaperone.

266
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,416
It is getting way too crowded.

267
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,708
You're so cute
I could just eat you up!

268
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,791
Excuse me...

269
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,083
Looks like I made it
here just in time.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,291
She's so cute.

271
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,833
Nice to meet everyone...

272
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,791
My name's Kyoko...

273
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,833
And I gotta confess
that I'm actually the one

274
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,958
who put Ayumu up
to all of this.

275
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,583
It's the girl of my dreams!

276
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,458
More like your
wet nightmares...

277
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,583
And wasn't she
like a sister to you?

278
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,250
Kyoko's a good
friend of mine...

279
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,500
If you try anything
funny with her...

280
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,916
You'll be lucky that you're
already in the hospital.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,583
Will you marry me right now?

282
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,458
Yo...!

283
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,750
It's show time...

284
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,625
Who's ready for a night
of "sheer" pleasure?

285
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,666
Now I know how
ridiculous I look.

286
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,583
Isn't the boy-girl
ratio a little off?

287
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,791
What?

288
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,666
Is there a rule that
it should be one on one?

289
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,000
Everybody knows that,
silly head.

290
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,791
Where the hell are we
gonna find some guys

291
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,125
to even things out?

292
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
Don't worry, ya little punk.

293
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,750
We're like your brand spankin'
new BFFs now, creampie.

294
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,708
These aren't tears of terror,
they're tears of joy.

295
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,458
BFFs?

296
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,333
Oh, everyone loves you, stud.

297
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:22,791
Aw, but you're the only one
who truly understands me.

298
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,166
I've never been part of
a group thing before...

299
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,208
 I hope we end up together.

300
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,208
Don't worry...

301
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,750
 I'll make it happen.

302
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,958
We should play the "king game".

303
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,375
Like Truth or Dare,
but only dare.

304
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,583
I've got a great idea
to break the ice you guys.

305
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,500
I think we should all
play the King Game!!

306
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,250
Alright, let's get started!

307
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,208
Who is the King?!

308
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,000
Looks like I'm two.

309
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,416
Do we really have to do this?

310
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,500
Better do the king's bidding.

311
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,333
Yeah...

312
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,958
I'm gonna do what she says.

313
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,041
Can't you read, it says the
king's orders are absolute!

314
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:12,708
Yeah...

315
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,916
It's only a game...

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,750
Let's just do it.

317
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,666
It'll be way less creepy if
you don't tighten up like that.

318
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,333
Oh...

319
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,208
man...

320
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,583
It's just a stupid game, okay!

321
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,250
Try not to forget to keep your
hands above the equator, Ayumu!

322
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,833
Let's go for it!

323
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,250
Yeah!

324
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,958
The king is very wise...

325
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,750
All hail the king!

326
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,583
Alright, break it up you two!

327
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
It's just a game, remember!

328
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,041
Sorry if I held on too long.

329
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,708
Aw, it's okay...

330
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,541
Hm?

331
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,500
I was only following orders!

332
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,291
Am I supposed to sit here
in this muscle sandwich

333
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,083
while he gets all the nookie?

334
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,291
Oh, sweet Jesus...

335
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,750
You're the king?

336
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,958
Okay, look alive
three and seven.

337
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,625
Oh, I'm number three!

338
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,875
You gotta wrestle with...

339
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,458
Your tongues.

340
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,750
Oh my god...!

341
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,541
That is almost too
embarrassing for words!

342
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,541
Who the hell is number seven??!

343
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,791
Silence!

344
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,916
It looks like you're gonna
get lucky, number seven!

345
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,541
Relax guys!

346
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,083
It's just a game!!!

347
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,500
The king's made
his royal decree.

348
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,833
We should do
whatever he tells us...

349
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,208
I can't think
of any reason not to.

350
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,250
Kyoko, this is just a game...

351
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,083
You're taking this
a little too seriously.

352
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,625
And I've seriously got you
right where I want you.

353
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,708
Excuse me for being so
ridiculously fashionably late!

354
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,708
Head Teacher!

355
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,208
I'm gonna OD on cuteness!

356
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,458
It's you!

357
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,333
The news got around that
Ayumu Aikawa was having

358
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,625
a killer party here tonight and
I would just die if I missed it.

359
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
Do you know this girl?

360
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,500
Yeah, she's the head...

361
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,750
I mean uh.

362
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,000
I may be wrong,
but I think her name is Ariel...

363
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:16,625
Rie...

364
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,750
Rie Headuh.

365
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,250
Damn, that was
a brilliant saving throw.

366
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,083
Thanks for the introduction...

367
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,875
It's so very nice
to meet everyone.

368
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:25,416
I'm so pissed.

369
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,291
I'm so pissed.

370
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,083
I'm so pissed. I'm so pissed.

371
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:27,708
I'm so pissed.

372
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,916
Oh shit.

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,375
I think she's pissed.

374
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,916
If you'd please try not
to make the situation

375
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,375
any more complicated,
I'd appreciate it.

376
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,333
♪ I say your heart is weak
just like a soft-boiled egg! ♪

377
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,416
No way!

378
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,750
You've already
graduated high school?

379
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,125
Yeah!

380
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,500
Oh my god she's an older
woman, why must I forever be

381
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,166
so hopelessly drawn
to forbidden love?

382
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,750
It's especially
forbidden by me.

383
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,125
Hey, four eyes!

384
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,291
Don't just sit there,
shake your groove thing!

385
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,791
Yeah!!

386
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,416
I'm shaking!

387
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,958
I'm coming!

388
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm shaking!

389
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
I'm coming!

390
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,041
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

391
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,500
Pardon?

392
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,458
Keeping a close eye on me?

393
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,000
Honestly, that wasn't
my intention...

394
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,541
But I did come up
with an excellent idea.

395
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,166
You think you're so much
better than me don't you,

396
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,625
you white-haired bitch?

397
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,708
I don't really think
you wanna do that here.

398
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,791
I don't know that you'll be
able to do anything about it...

399
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,208
I'm on the verge of
losing total control.

400
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,625
Let's go.

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,083
Are you seriously gonna
bail on your own party?

402
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,416
No, wait!

403
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
This is another test for him.

404
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,375
I did mention that
I had an idea, right?

405
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,833
Hold on...

406
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,208
This is same place
where we fought before.

407
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,500
Nobody will notice us here.

408
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,833
I apologize.

409
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,208
For what?

410
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,333
I realize I throw
a pretty lame party.

411
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,958
You're just gonna give up?

412
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,958
That's kinda the gist of it...

413
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,625
So take out your frustration
on me until you're satisfied.

414
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,125
But once you've had your fun.

415
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,166
I want you to tell me
what you know about Chris.

416
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
Alright Ayumu...

417
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,916
 I'll do it.

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
Nomobuyo...

419
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,500
oshi...

420
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,750
hashitawa...

421
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,666
dokeda...

422
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,958
gunmiicha...

423
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,416
deh ribura.

424
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,750
It feels good to let my hair
down and just be myself again...

425
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,500
I was about to freak out.

426
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,083
I have a feeling
things are gonna get wet.

427
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,416
Do whatever you want.

428
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,166
You're such a fool!

429
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,041
I want you to know...

430
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,958
that I love you.

431
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,625
Oh yeah...?

432
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,958
strange way of showing it.

433
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,416
This is the only way I could
think of to get close enough

434
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,375
to cuddle.

435
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,791
That's what you wanted?

436
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,375
Honestly...

437
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,375
I don't know what I want...

438
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,208
Just a minute ago I wanted to
turn you into a shish kebob...

439
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,791
But this is nice too.

440
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,291
I did have a good time
at the party.

441
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,916
Being with everyone.

442
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm glad.

443
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,750
But I know all their memories
of me will be erased...

444
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,666
It'll be just like
I never even existed.

445
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,083
That's kinda how it works
for Magical Garment Girls.

446
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,166
It's just hard...

447
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,291
Knowing that
I'll be forgotten...

448
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,875
You know...?

449
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,583
That's my real punishment.

450
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:19,958
Listen...

451
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,791
I'll remember you.

452
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,208
After tonight...

453
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,625
I'll go back to prison
for hundreds of years...

454
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,208
You'll forget about me too.

455
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,166
I promise I won't...

456
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,666
I am undead you know.

457
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,750
I guess this is one of those
life-changing encounters

458
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,333
you hear about.

459
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,250
I didn't believe in them...

460
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,000
 Until I met you.

461
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,541
When you think about me...

462
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,125
Remember this moment...

463
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,625
and, remember me smiling.

464
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,125
I will.

465
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,083
I believe you.

466
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,166
It seems our Ayumu
worked things out after all.

467
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,125
What's up, teach?

468
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,833
You thinking about
the good old days or somethin'?

469
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,250
No, I'm thinking there's one
less thing to hold me back.

470
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,750
So I gotta get up
and start gettin' down.

471
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,875
He is.

472
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,250
What the hell?!

473
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,583
Which one is the King?!

474
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,125
Oh my gosh it's me...!

475
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,375
Hark and hear my royal decree!

476
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,583
B must give C...

477
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:46,625
A big kiss.

478
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,958
Ooooohhh.

479
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,458
We must do as he commands
or we'll be punished...

480
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,833
C'mon, gimme a smooch.

481
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,166
No!

482
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,416
This has gotta be forced
unlawful carnal knowledge.

483
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,875
We can't have
a party with just me.

484
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:58,250
It's the real Eu!

485
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,333
It's just plain sad.

486
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,708
No it's not it's fun!

487
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,291
There may be one of you!

488
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,750
But there's three of us!

489
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,000
You're never lonely if you
have multiple personalities!
