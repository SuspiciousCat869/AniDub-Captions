1
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,375
As many of you know,
Mr. Kurisu is kind of

2
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,125
on sabbatical for
the next few weeks, so...

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,875
Let's all extend
a warm welcome to our

4
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,666
substitute homeroom teacher...

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,625
Say hi to Miss Rie.

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,625
Hello, everyone...

7
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,958
I can't tell you how
excited I am to be here.

8
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,166
Awesome!

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,291
Isn't that the lady
from the mixer?

10
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,958
I would kill
for her waistline.

11
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,916
You'd think being raised from
the dead to slash through

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,041
high school as a cross-dressing
occult warrior would guarantee

13
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,333
a lonely existence.

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,416
But I've learned that
no zombie is an island.

15
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,291
And now that Miss Ariel has
moved to the head of the class,

16
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,166
so to speak, looks like things
are getting even more crowded.

17
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,833
No rest for wicked, huh?

18
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,208
Look...

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,166
Whatever you're cooking up here
I think I'm entitled to know!

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,583
Can't you put it together?

21
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,791
Chris has us at Def Con One...

22
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,583
You know from firsthand
experience the havoc

23
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,791
she could wreak if
we just let her run loose.

24
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,791
I was caught off guard
-I can still --!

25
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,458
Answer me this.

26
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,541
She was my teacher
once upon a time...

27
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,416
You think you're cut out to take
on someone of that caliber?

28
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,708
I do.

29
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,791
Very well!

30
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,416
Then it's my job
to make sure your butt

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,833
can cash the check
your mouth just wrote!

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,458
What kind of test?

33
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,458
The kind that if I fail
my memories get erased.

34
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,583
Memories of what, exactly?

35
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,166
A thousand times no!

36
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,791
I can't bear the thought of
being exiled from your brain!

37
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,791
Wow...

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,125
Dumbass!

39
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,541
I get deported if you
go back to the old you,

40
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,333
so your dumb memories aren't
the only thing at stake...!

41
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,541
You damn well better
pass with flying colors!

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,708
I'll be lucky to pass
with colors at half-mast

43
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,583
for all I know what's in store.

44
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,500
I'll be your new student
teacher, Miss Haruna...

45
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,791
'sup, yo?

46
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,541
Subtle as a heart attack.

47
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,791
Thanks.

48
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,291
Since when is she on the
student teacher program?

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,333
Well, she's been turning up
in Home Ec a lot to show us

50
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,000
how to cook eggs, so I guess
for a little while at least...

51
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,583
Score...!

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,208
My harem fantasy is coming true
one hot new teacher at a time!

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,708
Today's lesson:
the science of fried eggs.

54
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,583
Um, excuse me.

55
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,083
Where is that in the text book?

56
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,291
Welcome to a little thing
I call real world experience,

57
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,750
where textbooks are for losers.

58
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,875
Oh.

59
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,458
Slow down, genius
-you're losing us.

60
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,791
Gotta admire her style.

61
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,541
Something she was a little
short on before coming here...

62
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,583
Clearly someone's been
a good influence on her.

63
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,416
Yeah, who knows?

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,291
Step one: crack that
puppy into your beaker.

65
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,833
Is it weird that
I'm all excited to learn

66
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,083
her famous fried egg
recipe, or what?

67
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,333
I know, right?

68
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,541
Next you mix for
all you're worth

69
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,333
or I don't even wanna know ya.

70
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,708
Then insert your philosopher's
stone -or nearest equivalent.

71
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,750
Not really sure
what that'd be.

72
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,500
If this is your first time,
I suggest using an eraser.

73
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,916
That's the secret?

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Now, I'm stirring
at a speed of Mach 3,

75
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,000
which you wanna do
for about half an hour.

76
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,833
Is it supposed to--

77
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,958
Oh son of a...!

78
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,375
Interesting factoid:

79
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,875
fried eggs have a very
similar consistency to slime.

80
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,083
The formula for both
is next to identical.

81
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,583
Nice to know that now!

82
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,375
I've known professional
chemists who'd give their arm

83
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,083
for a culture this large...

84
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,791
Excellently done, Haruna.

85
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,625
Woo-hoo!

86
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,208
Compliment from teach!

87
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,333
Hold on a sec...

88
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,000
What is it doing?

89
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,291
Whoa!

90
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,291
Indecent slime is indecent!

91
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,500
Have no fear, children.

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,958
It only dissolves clothing.

93
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:35,833
Yeah!

94
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,791
The slime is still rated PG-13!

95
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,291
I didn't do this so you'd
get your rocks off, jackass!

96
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,875
That's the furthest thing
from my mind right now!

97
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,708
It's like being stuck
inside a really pervy anime!

98
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,250
My poor students trusted me
and I've let them down!

99
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,166
So it leaves the socks
and underwear intact...

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,125
What kind of bullshit
is that supposed to be?

101
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,791
Shut your pie-hole, dude!

102
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,875
Whatever can be done to rectify
this peccadillo, Ayumu?

103
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
Time to improvise!

104
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,958
I'm rather eager to see
what you'll come up with.

105
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,291
Ha...!

106
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,208
Human limitations don't
apply to the undead--

107
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,958
Aw, Come on!

108
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,833
Crap!

109
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,625
Stay with me, Taeko!

110
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,250
Here!

111
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,000
Give me your hand!

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,041
You're practically naked!

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,916
Don't come near me!

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,416
Orito!

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,541
Incoming!

116
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,500
Haruna!

117
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,333
Listen...

118
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,583
You need to know this.

119
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,291
I only took this stupid
teaching job so that

120
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,541
when the time comes
you'd have some backup!

121
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,541
Yeah, duh...

122
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,625
Don't thrash, okay?

123
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,416
Gah!

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,333
Don't touch my lady parts!

125
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,666
I asked you not to thrash--

126
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,166
I've seen quite enough.

127
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,041
Holy crap.

128
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,375
Oh...

129
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,291
Extra credit!

130
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:26,958
My eyes!

131
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:27,458
Help me!

132
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,250
I'm blind!

133
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,333
Uh...

134
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,458
Thank you, teach...

135
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,000
Couldn't ha'
done it without ya!

136
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,500
Such a shame...

137
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,208
For a while there, I fully
expected you to power through.

138
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,291
Huh?

139
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,000
Not to be rude, but you'll
have to explain why I'd let

140
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,583
freaks like you
stay in my house.

141
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,875
Moron...

142
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,625
Sorry...

143
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,375
The name is Ayumu.

144
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,250
And you're also a moron!

145
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,083
Well this is a most
unfortunate turn of events.

146
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,791
Sorry, I wish there
was a better way...

147
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,541
But in the interest
of keeping the boy safe,

148
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,041
it's best we let him
luxuriate in blissful ignorance.

149
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,541
What you really mean is that we
have to protect Ayumu from us!

150
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,666
But she's right,
Haruna -it's no use...

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,458
This is for his own good.

152
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,041
I think we should get going.

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,291
Um...

154
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,333
Excuse me...

155
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,500
I don't see why you
have to leave, necessarily...

156
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,416
Fact I kinda feel
like I want you to stay.

157
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,833
You're such a mess.

158
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,333
C'mon, please?!

159
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,166
Sticky situation, huh?

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,458
I'll just say it...

161
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,166
Coming from me this
might be a little odd, but

162
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,500
I sincerely feel walking away
now would be admitting defeat.

163
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,541
Head Teacher, please!

164
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,916
I'm beggin' you, here...!

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,208
You can't let Ayumu
forget about us...!

166
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,666
It's not right!

167
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,583
Well, I haven't
finished my tea yet...

168
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
I don't wish to be rude...

169
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,208
Perhaps there's
time for another test?

170
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Seriously, that
would be awesome!

171
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,916
You'll have your
work cut out for you.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,041
If, traveling through
his mental topography,

173
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,375
you're able to make
contact with his core self,

174
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
his memories of the past
few months should reemerge.

175
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,125
Best of luck.

176
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,666
This is phenomenally reckless.

177
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,041
I think she's the sort of person
whose burden requires her

178
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
to be reckless
from time to time.

179
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,291
Lady Hellscythe,
you're voice has been restored!

180
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,208
Only because we're projecting
ourselves onto the astral plane,

181
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,875
free from our bodily tethers...

182
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,958
Once we've returned,
I'll be mute again.

183
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,375
Magic is quite strange...

184
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,291
Oft times even cruel.

185
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,416
Dumb Ayumu!

186
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,000
Wassup?

187
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,750
I didn't mean you!

188
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,500
Uh, sorry...?

189
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm guessin' my actual
form is givin' you gals

190
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,541
a bit of a headache right now...

191
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,666
What are you
supposed to be exactly?

192
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,708
Sort of like
a leftover memory...

193
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,375
At least I think so.

194
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,625
Come.

195
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,791
As long as you're sure
I'm not too much of a hassle.

196
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,625
Ah...

197
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,916
Those are the breaks, kiddo...

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,083
If you're going to be
an exemplar of our kind,

199
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,875
a trial this simple should
be a walk in the park.

200
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,375
Otherwise...

201
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,583
Jeepers, my head seems
like a pretty crazy place.

202
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
I've seen crazier.

203
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,208
Actually as minds go,
this one suits you well.

204
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,000
huh...

205
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,000
What kind of person was I?

206
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,833
A repugnant maggot.

207
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,000
Score!

208
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,250
Is it me or does this look like
the stage for a burlesque show?

209
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,708
Nyuh-uh...

210
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,458
We're in boss country!

211
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,958
I'm gonna go out on
a limb here and assume I was

212
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,333
a little awkward...

213
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,541
Welcome, dirt flecks.

214
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,333
Glad you could make it.

215
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,166
Please, girls:
call me Asmodeus.

216
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,125
Do what?

217
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,291
He's a demon.

218
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,666
The vilest indiscretions
of lust incarnate.

219
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,708
Someone's a know-it-all,
aren't they...?

220
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,541
Good thing you're cute ...

221
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,208
He's really grossing me out!

222
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,375
This explains a lot more
than I want it to.

223
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,208
Ladies.

224
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,541
My name's Beelzebub.

225
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
I am called Behemoth.

226
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,041
Wow.

227
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,000
Rather awkward.

228
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,750
Ugh...

229
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,958
That's the truth.

230
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,291
I'm Lucifer.

231
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,583
There's no way you guys
are part of my mind!

232
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,041
Call me Leviathan.

233
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,416
Stop announcing yourselves!

234
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,250
It's freakin' weird!

235
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,250
For the record,
it makes you look

236
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,291
like a bunch
of adolescent tools.

237
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,458
Satan.

238
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,791
These are aspects
of Ayumu's unconscious.

239
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,875
Hold on...

240
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,791
You mean these
chodes are part of me?

241
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,166
Why do I suddenly feel like
I'm crawling with poison ivy?!

242
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,708
Not to rub salt in your wounds,

243
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,875
but it's a little unnerving that
you took this long to react.

244
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,916
We're here to retrieve
our friend's memory...!

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,750
Get in the way and be prepared
for my foot up your ass!

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,458
Full of piss
and vinegar, I see.

247
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,125
You think you've got
what it takes to tango

248
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,916
with Ayumu's sins made flesh?

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If so, I highly advise
you get a second opinion.

250
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,208
Or at least promise
to make this interesting.

251
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,750
For the record,
I refuse to accept

252
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,750
responsibility
for these assholes!

253
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,041
They're his adolescent
coping mechanism...

254
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,791
If we can get
past them, we're in.

255
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,666
Really?

256
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
In that case...

257
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,708
Prepare for an ass-beating!

258
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,708
On the astral plane I can
take whatever form I choose!

259
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,500
Nomobuyo!

260
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,666
Oh shit...

261
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,541
Oshi!

262
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,083
Son of a bitch!

263
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,333
Hashitawa!

264
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,041
Dokeda!

265
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,541
Gunmiicha deh ribura!!

266
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,375
Wusses.

267
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,291
So much for his
coping mechanism.

268
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,333
That was easier than expected.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,708
Don't think you have triumphed.

270
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,250
We are the Alpha and the Omega;

271
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,750
Stop talking like that!

272
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,125
You're not all there is to me!

273
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:39,625
Huh...

274
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,375
So, yeah...

275
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,416
Let's go!

276
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,541
Hello...?

277
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,958
Hey Ayamu?

278
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,333
There you are!

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,625
Yo...!

280
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,750
Get off your butt...!

281
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,458
We're blowin' this
popsicle stand!

282
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,166
What'd be the point?

283
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,125
Huh?

284
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,375
Like it matters.

285
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,041
Don't even start, Ayumu;
we're taking you home.

286
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,833
For your information,
the name is Belphegor.

287
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,541
Whatever...

288
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,833
Let's go already.

289
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,083
The lightweights
you hustled past

290
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,791
to get in here
were just bouncers

291
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,166
-they'd kowtow to
anything in a skirt.

292
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,958
Your friend's real form
won't be so easy to subdue.

293
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,291
You said Belphegor...

294
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,791
The incarnation of slothfulness.

295
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,833
So his true form's
a lazy ass...?

296
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,333
I hate to say it, but this is
making a lot more sense to me.

297
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,458
All I wanted was to follow the
path of least resistance...

298
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,750
Then you came knocking down
my door with your drama,

299
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,333
your bullshit and
whatever the hell else...

300
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,375
You don't represent his final
thoughts on the matter,

301
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,708
you're just one aspect.

302
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,166
Are you so sure...?

303
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,125
I mean, no doubt you're a
powerful sorceress and all,

304
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,875
but I don't think mind-reading
falls under your skill set.

305
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,250
If you could, you'd blush
at how hard it's been for me

306
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,208
to be nice up to now.

307
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,833
No one asked you to be nice...

308
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,291
So don't.

309
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,375
You think Ayumu Aikawa is
really a "caring soul"...?

310
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,000
He's probably just trying
to keep the peace between

311
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,750
all you hotties, the guy
sounds like a doormat.

312
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,500
Ha!

313
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,000
You're full of it!

314
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,458
As of today, his caring side
goes on permanent vacation.

315
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,958
No more ass-kissing!

316
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,375
Ah.

317
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,458
Come back to yourself,
have we?

318
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,250
I, uh...

319
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,083
I think so...

320
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,041
Could you, uh,
give me a second?

321
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,375
Sure?

322
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,541
And I'd like it if you called
me Belphegor from now on...

323
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,333
Think you can do that?

324
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,083
I can...

325
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,250
I suppose...

326
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,416
Yes.

327
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,166
I'll also accept
"Alterna-dude Ayumu." ...

328
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,541
Point being,
the old me's gone bye-bye.

329
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,791
Do you mind if I call you

330
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,208
Dark Ayumu just to keep
things a bit simpler?

331
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:07,708
Fine.

332
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
Whatever...

333
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,625
As long as you know who's
givin' you the business.

334
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,750
Payback's a bitch!

335
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,791
Oh dear

336
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,083
Clothes really do
make the woman, huh?

337
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
Sorry, I was lettin' Lust take
the wheel there for a sec,

338
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,750
my bad...

339
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,208
You try to keep
the boggarts at bay,

340
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,625
but the bastards just won't
give you a moment's peace.

341
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,416
I'm assuming Haruna
and the gang failed

342
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,208
to retrieve your memories?

343
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,125
No, They got it right...

344
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,708
I'm afraid this was
the real me all along.

345
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,291
Ah.

346
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,666
I see.

347
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,125
Gotta run; don't
wanna be late for school.

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I'll have to kill you on
account of that panty shot,

349
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,291
just so you know.

350
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,000
 Boop beep boop!

351
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:48,708
Holy crap...!

352
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,750
Where's Ayumu?!

353
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, you just missed him,
I'm afraid.

354
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,083
You let that recalcitrant thing
loose upon the world...?!

355
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,625
Great.

356
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,291
Yeah.

357
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,500
I brought enough for everyone.

358
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,458
Okay...

359
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,583
so what are you supposed to be?

360
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,416
You look like you
just got out of bed...

361
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,000
Everything's such
a royal pain in the ass...

362
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
The hell do we even
bother to breathe?

363
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,791
Somebody please tell me he's
not starting an emo phase.

364
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,500
No offense, but I uh...

365
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,916
I mean you look like
you've got a lot more

366
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
on your mind than usual...

367
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,041
No shit...

368
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,625
You'd think that keeping all
of the world's darkest secrets

369
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,041
would be a breeze.

370
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,791
I envy the cow-eyed ignorance
you jerks nourish yourselves on.

371
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,291
Wanna see the nurse?

372
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,375
You'll have to excuse your
brooding classmate, children:

373
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,291
he's not feeling
quite himself today...

374
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,166
Try not to engage with him.

375
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,500
Mr. Aikawa, I expect
to see you after class,

376
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
thank you very much.

377
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,791
Only if you promise
to be a bitch.

378
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,333
You little cockroach!

379
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,625
Haruna?

380
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,041
I'll teach you to be
an unappreciative maggot!

381
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,083
Clear a path, children.

382
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:03,416
Remind me why I should be scared
of a gal who's lost her power?

383
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,416
Seriously?

384
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,708
Thanks, babe -but I'd much
rather you sit on my face,

385
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,416
if it's all the same to you.

386
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,708
Bona fide sexual harassment!

387
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,625
Gotta say; the fact that
you never talk makes you

388
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,750
every hot-blooded
male's wet dream.

389
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,750
Owie owie owie owie owie...!

390
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,791
Attention all ladies: Ayumu
does not speak for all men!

391
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,125
You and me are
stepping outside!!!

392
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,291
So we're gonna hash it out
on the school yard, huh...?

393
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,375
You know, if I gave a damn,

394
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,458
I could see myself
getting nostalgic.

395
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,750
I know my dirty darling...

396
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,750
And this is not who he is.

397
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,291
Whoever's in there...

398
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,291
I am not a fan.

399
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,166
Do we really have to do
this now, sweetheart...?

400
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,250
Seems like such
a waste of time.

401
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,416
Okay...

402
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,958
Not something Ayumu'd say.

403
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,041
Actually...

404
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,041
I'm not having
a hard time buying it.

405
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,583
You go, neckwear-mancer!

406
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,666
Kick this imposter's
lazy butt into next week!

407
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:39,625
Alright.

408
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,791
Kinda cool.

409
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,250
300%!

410
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,791
I really want you
right now, babe.

411
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,125
No.

412
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,625
You're not the Ayumu
I fell in love with.

413
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,125
Huh...?

414
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,041
I'm not a friggin' psychic
-you've got to write it down.

415
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,041
You care too much, babe;
that's your problem.

416
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,125
Interesting.

417
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,291
Sorry, toots.

418
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,750
Not a good tactic...

419
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291
Don't get upset, though...

420
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,416
You've only got
yourself to blame.

421
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,333
She might be on to something.

422
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,708
Stop that...!

423
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm not...

424
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,041
I can't...

425
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:07,916
You...

426
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,833
No...

427
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,541
I mean...

428
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,750
I...

429
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,750
What's with the
waterworks, neckwear?

430
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,416
The real Ayumu's coming back
-that's a good thing!

431
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,125
Give it to him real good!

432
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,291
I won't cave in to this!

433
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,458
I am not your
precious Ayumu...!

434
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,041
My name is Belphegor
and I'm in charge here!

435
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,250
You're Dumb Ayumu
so shut your stupid face!

436
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,875
Come back to us!

437
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,000
My name is...

438
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,291
Ayumu...

439
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,791
We need you!

440
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
Eu...!

441
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,000
What the hell
is wrong with you!

442
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,583
Stop it!

443
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,291
Snap out of it right now or I'll
cut you into a million pieces!

444
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,250
Huh?

445
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,041
Oh, right.

446
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,041
I'm, uh.

447
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,416
Wait...

448
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,416
Why you gotta be
such a stupid jerk?

449
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Anything you'd like to say
to all of us, worm food?

450
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,541
There's, uh...

451
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,625
No place like home...?

452
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,125
Oh, and...

453
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,958
Would you mind
grabbing my lower body?

454
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:34,958
You pervert...!

455
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,541
What do you take me for?!

456
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,916
How predictable...

457
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,416
We could've gone to hell
and back for you twice over

458
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,625
and you'd still be
an insufferable prig.

459
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,958
I suppose there are
worse ways to pass a test

460
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,708
than by the skin of your teeth.

461
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:56,541
Most people live their lives
without ever knowing it,

462
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,541
but the world is filled with
all kinds of weird stuff...

463
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,916
Despite being human,
this Ayumu fellow is

464
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,208
a fascinating creature,
don't you think?

465
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,458
Meow meow!

466
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,333
Forgive me for letting
things get out of hand.

467
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,916
Meow meow meow!

468
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,833
Knowing what I do now,
though, I'd do it all again.

469
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,500
Well, hope you're
not the jealous type,

470
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:22,250
'cause Lady Ariel's taken
a shine to your little protégé.

471
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,166
The more the merrier,
that's what I say.

472
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,875
That's a relief, 'cause I'm
taking the kid under my wing,

473
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,458
too, ...

474
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,416
Now you're just being catty.

475
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,666
You know, I do
need an assistant.

476
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,416
Can't believe I was
on the brink of being

477
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,416
indifferent to all this.

478
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,625
What a shame that
would've been, right?

479
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,916
Good thing my memories
made it in one piece...

480
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,375
You'd be sleeping under
an overpass otherwise.

481
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,750
Ha!

482
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,250
Bet you'd like to believe
that, wouldn't you...?

483
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,833
For the record I have tons
of places I could've crashed,

484
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,708
so don't go thinkin' this place
is special to me 'cause of you!

485
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,416
Why would I get
that impression?

486
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,166
Could you stop being a maggot
for five minutes, please?

487
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,958
Oh, hey.

488
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,333
Not that I expect much of you,
but once the five minutes is up,

489
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,500
by all means, carry on.

490
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,041
Kind of nice that things
are back to normal, huh...?

491
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,583
Even if by "normal"
I mean whatever this is.

492
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,750
Wouldn't have it otherwise.

493
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,500
I can't believe
it's the final episode!

494
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,333
Don't say that!

495
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:42,541
It's not true!

496
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,208
We'll totally
be back next week!

497
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,375
Look at it this way:

498
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,833
endings mean the start
of something else.

499
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,250
I may be cute,
but I know when someone's

500
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,750
blowing smoke up my butt!

501
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,958
As long as you don't forget us,

502
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,625
you can blow all the smoke
up our butts you want!

503
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,708
Remember your counterparts
on the flip-side!

504
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,333
And if you enjoyed the show,
that goes for you people too...

505
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,916
Alrighty?

506
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,375
Oh fantastic, now she's blowing
smoke up the audiences' butt!

507
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,208
Bye-bye!

508
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,666
Please try not to forget us!

509
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,541
Thank you for watching!
