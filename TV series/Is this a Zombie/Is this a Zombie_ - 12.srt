1
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,291
Wow Haruna,
major score this time!

2
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,833
Duh! Winning!

3
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,250
And as long as
I don't go outside,

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,375
I can swim like a normal person!

5
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,125
How many times did
you enter before you won?

6
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,916
Well I did win nine hundred
ninety nine mousepads

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,541
before the big prize.

8
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,291
The fans'll want
a nip slip or two.

9
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:45,833
No way!

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:46,750
That's too bad!

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,458
This is gonna rule, you guys!

12
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,041
Alright, Miss Funbags! You win
this time, but watch out!

13
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,625
I win? What are
you talking about?

14
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,958
Oh you'll see, next year
I'll be twice as bouncy as you.

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,583
I don't think so.

16
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,791
I'll have you beat for sure.

17
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,125
Yeah, of course you
will because I'm a guy!

18
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,916
So you're giving
up already? Typical!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,500
I've got major problems if
my boobs get bigger than--

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,958
Oh, hey.

21
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,083
Jeez, I should have
known you were the kind of

22
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,666
creepy guy who judges girls
by the size of their boobs.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,416
Well, luckily for you,
I'm not like that.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,083
Oh cool. You found a swimsuit?

25
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,083
I guess I'm not good
enough to get a creepy stare?

26
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,791
This is logically
the next step after years

27
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,291
of simply undressing
everyone in the room

28
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,541
with that perverted gaze.

29
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,125
Aggravated eyeball assault.

30
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,416
Well at least
I'm upping my game.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,625
Hey! Ayumu!

32
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,333
Oh great, it's you.

33
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,333
It's so amazing how love
can pull two people together.

34
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,708
That, or swimming.

35
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,833
It's true love, pal!

36
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,416
I'm starting to get the
feeling that contest was rigged.

37
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,791
Well I did win, like, nine
hundred ninety nine mousepads

38
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,166
before this go around.

39
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,708
Oh yeah, I did too.

40
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,458
You're both very persistent.

41
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,000
So how's the water?

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,791
You must be the exchange student
that Yuki was talking about.

43
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,500
How come you're
writing us notes?

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,625
She's got laryngitis,
but it's not contagious!

45
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,958
Oh, it's fine. What do
ya say to getting wet

46
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,791
or playing with some balls?

47
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,791
Here it comes!

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,916
I can take it!

49
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,750
I'll give it a good smack! Ha!

50
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,625
I'm getting a
strong sex offender vibe

51
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,916
from you right now.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,250
Oh give me a break!
The only thing I'm doing

53
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,333
is having some good clean fun.

54
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,208
Your creep factor just went
up about two hundred percent.

55
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,291
At least
something's getting up.

56
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
I think it was a good
idea for Lady Hellscythe

57
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,125
to enjoy herself a bit.

58
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,583
Me too.

59
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,208
The battle was
a hard fought victory.

60
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,583
Aw. I can take way
worse than what went down.

61
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,458
I'm a zombie after all.

62
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,750
You're a maggot.

63
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,916
Hey dumbass!
You're supposed to hit it back!

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,833
Back off! I didn't know
it was coming in my face!

65
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,791
I hope I can drink this
without any balls to the face.

66
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,583
You losers love me?

67
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,875
Yup, another wannabe
pop star payin' their dues.

68
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,208
Well, ya gotta
start somewhere. I guess.

69
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,083
Alright you
disgusting wastes of space!

70
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,958
Are you ready to get blown?

71
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,500
Yeah!

72
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,291
Now boys! Hold on tight!

73
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,833
Oh my god! This has
got to be some scheme

74
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,708
for taking over the world! No.

75
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,625
Our culture's love
for saccharine pop songs

76
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,916
will be our downfall!

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,958
If you need virgin's
blood you can suck me dry!

78
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,083
Orito? Hey!

79
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,458
You're a fan?

80
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,666
That freak!
Why is she up there?

81
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
What do you mean "freak?"

82
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,500
"Lovely Kirara"
is totally killing

83
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,291
it on the internet right now!

84
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,291
She's the biggest
net idol there is!

85
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,416
She's an internet star?

86
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,750
Don't be stupid!

87
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,541
Ugh. Do you even have a life?

88
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,500
Sorry, but I don't spend all my
time fapping to internet stars!

89
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,000
Maybe you should! Lovely
Kirara is the biggest star

90
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,666
the internet has ever known!

91
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,250
Overnight the chatrooms started
blowing up with her name!

92
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,416
She's more viral
than the bubonic plague!

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,791
She's cute and playful,
but so cruel! It makes me crazy!

94
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,750
I'd be more than happy to die if
it just meant she'd notice me!

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,958
The only thing I understood
out of all of that stuff

96
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,125
is that you're
a lonely, lonely guy.

97
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,375
I'm far from lonely.

98
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,375
Yhere are tons of guys
like me in her fanclub.

99
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,916
You're just jealous cause I'm
riding the wave of the future.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,708
And I'm guessing that
wave smells like hand lotion.

101
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,791
Count me out man, I'm good.

102
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,750
What?!

103
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,250
Holy G-string!

104
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,583
I think I must be seeing things!

105
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,708
Please tell me this is just

106
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,166
some kind of
bizarre waking nightmare.

107
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,875
That looks like Saras!

108
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm afraid you're wide awake.

109
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,208
I'll be back.

110
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,791
Listen. I vote we ignore
this and move on. Or not.

111
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,125
Sarasvati!

112
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
No, this is horrible timing,
Everybody's watching!

113
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Seraphim, what are you doing?

114
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,666
I should be asking you.

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,083
Vampire ninjas live
and die in the shadows.

116
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,250
Why are you exposing yourself?

117
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,416
For our future.

118
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,458
Is this a part of some new

119
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,000
secret mission
you've been sent on?

120
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,500
No, you fool!

121
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,916
Geez. It seemed like a
reasonable question to me.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,458
Although I do live my
life beneath the shadows.

123
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:08,125
In the light I have another
existence. As Lovely Kirara!

124
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,125
If you worms
wanna die, come to me now!

125
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,500
Me first, me first!

126
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,708
We're not worthy!

127
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,875
I'm not sure if they know,

128
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,000
but she's not really
joking around here.

129
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,125
So Sera wants a
taste of fame, does she?

130
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,791
Go on. Step into the
spotlight, my budding star.

131
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,500
Show us everything you've got.

132
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,666
Now, let's pop that cherry!

133
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,083
Whoa! Predator much?

134
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,333
Still, how does
this help our future?

135
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,666
We ninjas must adapt to
the times or face extinction!

136
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,250
But I don't see why you've
chosen such a ridiculous path!

137
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,833
Your ignorance
is truly stunning.

138
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,666
The path I've chosen is one
of the most brutal there is.

139
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,041
The world of the pop idol

140
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
is filled with danger,
betrayal, and exploitation.

141
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,750
Where a thousand dreams
are crushed every minute.

142
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,166
A world where
the strong survive

143
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,750
only by feasting on
the lives of others.

144
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,250
Do you people realize
what you're cheering for?

145
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,416
Holy crap! Kirara is going
through the roof right now!

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,791
It goes that fast?

147
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,750
Hello. What's this?
Sera just broke into the charts!

148
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,083
She's not a pop star!

149
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,458
We got a brand new
contender on our hands

150
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,166
and I can't wait to see
how far she'll go for fame!

151
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,833
But... I... Uh...

152
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,166
Wait. That's me!

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,125
How dare you
challenge me like this!

154
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,125
I'm not!

155
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,041
But. If she gets big and
famous, she'll leave us behind!

156
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,375
She's gonna forget
about all us little people!

157
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't cry, it's the
duty of a true star

158
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,250
to realize they're
better than normal people.

159
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,916
You've got the body
of a sex goddess...

160
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,333
Calm down!

161
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,583
What's wrong? Don't tell me that
you've lost your nerve already!

162
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,458
No, but I do have my pride!

163
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,208
And I honor my noble
heritage as a vampire ninja!

164
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,208
Stop this farce immediately!

165
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,833
Why don't you stop me yourself?

166
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,625
Uh. What?

167
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,250
There's only one
way you can do that.

168
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,583
How in the hell did this happen?

169
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:18,208
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,750
This is gonna be the biggest
battle in musical history

171
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,208
and we're here to see it!

172
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,166
If you defeat
me here, I will give up

173
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,375
and go back to the old ways.

174
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,541
This goes against
the very core of my being.

175
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,166
But if it's the only
way to fight for the honor

176
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,250
of the Vampire
ninja clan, then so be it!

177
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,041
You called my work as an idol

178
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,333
"a farce, childish,
stupid, vapid,

179
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,250
self aggrandizing,
and spiritually bankrupt".

180
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,958
Uh, I never said all that!

181
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,208
Let me show you
how brutal it is!

182
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,250
No one but a bonafide
superstar could pull off

183
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,791
a costume change like that
without even missing a beat!

184
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,875
I'm losing?

185
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,291
You're through.

186
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,041
It was foolish of you to
think you could ever defeat me.

187
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,583
No! I have to catch up to her!

188
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,166
I'll be fantasizing
about this for months!

189
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
I may have not been
into this at first,

190
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,375
but it's got its finer points.

191
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,166
Hey, Haruna. The hell?

192
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,833
Not bad. You didn't beat me,
but you managed to keep up!

193
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,208
I will get you in the end.

194
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,000
Fame's gone to
your head already?

195
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,208
I've always had
faith in my abilities.

196
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,791
We'll see what
happens on the next song.

197
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,083
You zombies wanna
get a piece of me?

198
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,333
Oh my god!

199
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,583
What's she doing?

200
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,125
You thought you could
just leave me behind.

201
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,416
But I'm not gonna
let you get away

202
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,208
with hoggin
all the fun, chesty!

203
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,500
Uh. I'm not really
doing this for fun you know!

204
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,666
This is not your place!
Get off the stage right now!

205
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,625
You're her boss,
not mine, so I'm staying!

206
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,625
Is that so? I said get off!

207
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,333
I got a right to be a star too.

208
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,541
I'm gonna be huge in
psychospace! A big star!

209
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,666
"Psychospace" would be right on.

210
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,291
Besides the fact that stage
doesn't have a pole on it,

211
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,666
this is like my
wildest fantasy come true.

212
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,583
If you're ready
to rock say, "yeah!"

213
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,416
Yeah!

214
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,833
I don't get it!

215
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,625
Rock on Haruna!

216
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,541
You people will yell
and scream over anything,

217
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,875
you're like flies swarming
around a big pile of crap!

218
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:29,958
Oh yes! Yes!

219
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:30,916
No! No, no!

220
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,000
She's outta control!
We gotta get her down, now!

221
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,541
No!

222
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,583
It's the producer!

223
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,291
Yeah, she's rough.
But I like her.

224
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:51,000
She's got lots of spunk.
I can see it all over her face!

225
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,333
Haruna's climbing up
the charts like crazy!

226
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,541
With this crappy song?

227
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,125
You know how the saying
goes, "crappy" is merely

228
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,083
in the eye of
the beholder, my friend!

229
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,458
Or the ear!

230
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,666
This is disgraceful.

231
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,125
My show. She ruined it!

232
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,166
She scares the pants off me.

233
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,333
Ya know. I think I'm
just gonna wait right here.

234
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,791
My show. She ruined it!

235
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,541
Hey Haruna! Do you
realize how many people

236
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,125
you're pissing off with this
crazy stunt you're pulling?

237
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,750
This is amazing!

238
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:59,833
I'm shining like a
real star! They love me!

239
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,416
Let's turn up the heat!

240
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,916
What the!

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,541
Haruna's the hottest thing
goin' on the internet right now!

242
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,500
Oh wow! I've never
seen anything like it before.

243
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,125
Even my
tabletpad blew its wad.

244
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,458
Eew, really?

245
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:18,166
Yeah! Here we go!
Don't stop the rock!

246
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,958
This is humiliating!

247
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,791
What'd I tell ya? This little
cutie is the next big thing!

248
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,541
Whoa his head! It's so shiny!

249
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,916
Rock my lame ass!

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,625
Somebody please,
make it stop! Hey.

251
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,875
Do you wanna be on
stage with them or something?

252
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,458
Oh, Head Teacher. Is there
something we can help you with?

253
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,083
Ta-da! I call this little
beauty my Magic Vacuum!

254
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,583
Huh?

255
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,666
I thought a situation like
this would come up eventually,

256
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,041
so I brought this with me
from Villiers just in case.

257
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,625
It's handy because

258
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,708
it can suck all the magic
powers right out of one person.

259
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,750
And put them into someone else.

260
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,166
Uh.

261
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,833
Here's your chance. You
can play the hero and take on

262
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,291
her powers for a bit and she
can sing her little heart out.

263
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,833
You mean. I could
actually do that for her?

264
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,083
No kidding?

265
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,250
Of course!

266
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:28,125
Yeah!

267
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,583
Whoa, it's the neckwear-mancer!

268
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,458
Aww. It's so sweet.

269
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,833
Did you forget? Since you took
on Lady Hellscythe's powers,

270
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,125
you'll experience
the same unimaginable pain

271
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,083
that she does
whenever you try to speak.

272
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,458
Holy crap! My head's exploding!

273
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,416
She can really sing.
I never knew.

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,208
It's beautiful.

275
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,416
She's making the
sweetest love to my ears.

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,208
What a wonderful time
to be alive... What the?

277
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,583
My headache went away.
No, not now!

278
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,291
Oh dear. It seems we're
running out of power already.

279
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,375
That's definitely a problem.

280
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,500
Oh no.

281
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,583
Having a little trouble?

282
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,708
If you use some of my magical
power, you should be able

283
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,500
to make it
through the song, right?

284
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
I don't mind at all.

285
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,166
That's cool.

286
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,333
Where in the world did that one

287
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,000
learn how to be so
considerate and helpful?

288
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,750
Says her teacher.

289
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,916
Not what I had planned.

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,625
Don't be fooled. The path of
an idol is a treacherous one.

291
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,958
Well, I didn't see
this coming. But who cares?

292
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,083
This is the kind of moment of
bliss that may only come about

293
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,416
once in your life or
whatever you call what I have

294
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,875
since I'm not technically alive.

295
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,708
I'm just gonna soak it all in.

296
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,750
Yep, I could
definitely get used to this.

297
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,250
If all the girls in the world

298
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,250
could look like that all the
time, it would rule so hard!

299
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,500
You need to be careful
what you wish for, young man.

300
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,250
As you wish.
I will see it is done.

301
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,375
That was Mystletainn!
I didn't know he could hear me!

302
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,083
Guess he can. And I
forgot Eu has the power

303
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,916
to alter the fabric
of reality with her words.

304
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,750
Oh, dear me.

305
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,000
Holy exposure!

306
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:47,625
Oh no!

307
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,916
It's so degrading.

308
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,416
This had to've come
from a truly sick mind!

309
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,750
This is the like
greatest power ever!

310
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,583
I'm king of the world.
I mean, uh...

311
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,583
You see. You have
to be very careful

312
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,708
when you have the kind of
power that Lady Hellscythe does.

313
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,583
Ayumu Aikawa.

314
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,666
So you're the one behind all
of this disgraceful business?

315
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,541
This was all your idea?

316
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,166
No, wait. Hold on!

317
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,500
You. Are the
world's biggest scumbag!

318
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,666
We put on a pretty
good show didn't we?

319
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,125
Sure! Anytime!

320
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,541
That's the last time
I go swimming with them.

321
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:08,208
I just wanna relax. The last
few months have been so crazy.

322
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,291
I almost can't believe I made
it through to the other side.

323
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,208
Like I always say,
most people live their lives

324
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,291
without ever realizing it.

325
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,750
But the world is
full of weird stuff.

326
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,125
Secrets that should
probably stay that way.

327
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,750
Cause once you
discover them, it's too late.

328
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,458
You can never go back
to your normal life.

329
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,791
I'm home.

330
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,166
You're late, loser. We were
just about to eat without you.

331
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,916
I made it this time.

332
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,625
But ya know?
It could be a lot worse.

333
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,041
Even for a Magical
Garment Girl-Zombie like me.
