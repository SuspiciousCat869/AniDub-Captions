1
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,166
- Hatsuka: WOW!
- Youka: THAT GUY IS SO CUTE.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,166
I JUST TOOK HIS PICTURE
WITH MY PHONE.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,958
- Nina:
OH, YEAH, HE'S OKAY, I GUESS.

4
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,708
- SERIOUSLY, WHATEVER, NINA.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,916
I'M SO OVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOUR TYPE IS.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,625
- I KNOW.
I JUST WANT A GOOD LOOKING GUY

7
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,083
WHO'S REALLY STRONG AND SWEET,

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,833
SOMEONE WHO WILL PROTECT ME

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,125
AND BRAVELY FIGHT
TO DEFEND MY HONOR.

10
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,250
- Both: WHAAA!

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,458
- All: AH!

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,166
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT--

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,791
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

14
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,791
THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A REALITY CHECK, NINA.

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,041
- Both:
TRUST US, HE DOESN'T EXIST.

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,958
- YEAH, I KNOW.

17
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,333
BUT I GUESS THAT I--
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS DREAM

18
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,416
THAT ONE DAY A PRINCE WOULD
COME TO ME OUT OF THE BLUE

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,458
AND-- AND RISK HIS VERY LIFE
TO PROTECT ME.

20
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,916
MAYBE A GUY LIKE THAT
ONLY EXISTS IN FAIRY TALES,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,458
BUT IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THE PRINCESS HE LOVES,

22
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,583
A TRUE PRINCE
WILL BRAVELY FACE ANY ENEMY

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,666
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,500
TO SAVE HIS BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
AND REALIZE HIS EVERY DREAM.

25
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,791
HUH?

26
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,250
DOES THIS CAKE NORMALLY COME
WITH HARD CANDY?

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,541
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER ORDERED THAT BEFORE.

28
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,041
- MAYBE THEY'RE ADDING THE CANDY

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,791
AS A NEW FORM
OF CUSTOMER APPRECIATION.

30
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,916
I HEARD A RUMOR
THAT A NEW CAKE SHOP

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,125
IS ABOUT TO OPEN UP DOWNTOWN.
- I LOVE CAKE!  I LOVE CAKE!

32
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,958
- YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE PROBABLY WORRIED

33
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,875
THIS NEW SHOP WILL STEAL
ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS AWAY.

34
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,625
- I GET IT!  SO THIS IS LIKE
A LITTLE PRESENT.

35
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,000
- Both: HOW IS IT?
- ( grunting )

36
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,541
I'M NOT SO SURE
THIS IS CANDY.

37
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,458
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BITE INTO.

38
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,083
- ( all gasping )

39
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,083
- AHHH!

40
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,458
- ( all shouting )

41
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,875
- Nina: WHAT'S GOING ON?

42
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,000
- Zero: IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE.

43
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,041
- YOU ARE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

44
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,041
- READY?

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,958
- YEAH.
LET'S GET THIS THING STARTED.

46
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,375
DON'T WORRY.
WE WON'T LET YOU GET INJURED.

47
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,166
STAY BACK AND WE'LL PROTECT YOU,
OKAY?

48
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,875
- DID YOU SAY
"PROTECT ME"?

49
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,708
- SHIELD MAGIC!
CRYSTAL BARRIER!

50
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,166
- ( all shouting )

51
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,000
- ( thinking ) I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

52
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,833
THESE GUYS
JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

53
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,791
AND NOW THEY SAY
THEY'LL PROTECT ME.

54
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,791
IT'S JUST LIKE THE PRINCE
IN THE FAIRY TALE

55
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,833
WHO WATCHES OVER HIS PRINCESS,

56
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,125
WHO FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE,

57
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,541
AND DEFENDS HIS DREAM
TO THE BITTER END.

58
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,916
THEY'RE LIKE TWO PRINCES WHO
HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,375
JUST TO PROTECT ME.

60
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,375
- Ichii: LOOKS LIKE
WE SCARED 'EM OFF.

61
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,375
I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL BE COMING BACK.

62
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,375
- Zero: ARE YOU SURE IT FELL
IN THIS AREA?

63
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,625
WHAT IF THEY FIND IT
BEFORE WE DO?

64
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,500
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, ZURA.

65
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,958
WE, FROM THE SEA HORSE TRIBE
ARE GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE PEARL.

66
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
AND I KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND IT,

67
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
EVEN WITHOUT
THAT RAGGEDY LOOKING FINDER.

68
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,666
SO YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, GUYS.
- YOU'RE POSITIVE?

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
- IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
THEN FINE, ZURA.

70
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,833
BUT EVEN ZERO'S FINDER
KEEPS SAYING

71
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,541
THAT IT'S SOMEWHERE
AROUND HERE, ZURA.

72
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
- IT'S SAYS THE PEARL'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

73
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,041
- ( thinking )
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT?

74
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,500
- AH, MAYBE IT'S BROKEN.

75
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,208
- ( beeps )

76
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,208
- Both: HUH?

77
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,291
- AHHH!

78
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,791
- NO WAY!
- QUESTION--

79
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,125
HAVE YOU SEEN A CRYSTAL PEARL
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS?

80
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,833
- NN-NNH.  WELL, MAYBE.

81
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,291
I THINK IT CAME WITH A PIECE
OF CAKE THAT I ORDERED.

82
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,583
- AHH!

83
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,416
SO--
SO WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,375
- I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD CANDY,
SO I ATE IT.

85
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,833
- AHH!
- SAY WHAT?

86
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,208
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

87
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,583
GIVE IT TO ME!

88
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,291
SPIT IT OUT, RIGHT NOW.
GIVE IT BACK.

89
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,250
- ZERO!
- SHE'S GOT THE PEARL, ICHII.

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,041
- YEAH, SHE SWALLOWED IT.

91
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,875
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

92
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,541
SO JUST TRY TO CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

93
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,125
YOU DON'T WANNA DRAW ANY
NEGATIVE ATTENTION TO US,

94
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,583
DO YOU?

95
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,500
- BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT
CRYSTAL PEARL BACK FROM HER.

96
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,458
HOW ARE WE GONNA
BECOME PROS WITHOUT IT?

97
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,208
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND, BUT--
- Nina: AHH!

98
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,250
- Girls: WHAT IS THAT THING?
- ( owl hooting )

99
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,375
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
HOW DID SAN AND FORTE FIND US?

100
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,833
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT US, ICHII.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

101
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,541
AND WHY ARE YOU GUYS HANGING OUT
WITH THESE PATHETIC HUMANS?

102
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,958
DID YOU FIND A CLUE
ABOUT THE CRYSTAL PEARL?

103
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,750
- OH, THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

104
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,000
IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR?

105
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,166
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

106
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,333
- SO YOU DO
KNOW ABOUT IT THEN.

107
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,583
- ( laughing nervously )

108
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S SAYING!

109
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,125
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE SWALLOWED IT,
ZURA.

110
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
- GREAT.
- WAY TO GO, SEAHORSE.

111
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,791
- WE CAN HEAR YOU, YA KNOW.
- All: AH!

112
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,625
- SOMETHING SMELLS FISHY!

113
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,375
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING.

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,708
- I THINK THEY'RE
HIDING SOMETHING TOO, FO.

115
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,916
- SURE LOOKS THAT WAY.
NOW DOESN'T IT, SAN?

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,791
- WELL, GOODBYE.

117
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,833
- THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY!
- Girls: NINA!

118
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,916
- San: WE'RE ON TO YOU!

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,208
- Forte: SO YOU DO KNOW
SOMETHING, DON'T YOU?

120
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,708
I'M SURE OF IT.

121
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,750
YOU MUST KNOW
WHERE THE CRYSTAL PEARL IS.

122
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,375
HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU GUYS.
NOW ANSWER ME!

123
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,125
- HOW'S THIS?

124
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
- All: OOH!

125
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,583
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
HOLD ON TIGHT!

126
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,083
- YOU CAN'T GET RID OF US
THAT EASY.

127
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,875
- Both:
TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW, ICHII.

128
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,083
YOU'D BETTER TELL US
WHERE TO FIND THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

129
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,833
- COME ON!

130
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,625
- Forte: NOT AGAIN!
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

131
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,000
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRIVE
A LOT FASTER, ICHII.

132
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,833
THEY'RE GAINING ON US.
OH!

133
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,333
- COME ON, JUST ANSWER ME,
ICHII!

134
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,416
OH, NO.

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO FALL
FOR THE SAME TRICK AGAIN.

136
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,458
- YOU BETTER DUCK, FO.
- HUH?

137
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,625
AHH!

138
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,791
WHOA, I GUESS FLYING AN OWL
IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

139
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,708
AHH!

140
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,916
- ( both crying )

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,416
- YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, ZERO!

142
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,375
ICHII!

143
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,416
- Ichii:
THIS LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SPOT.

144
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,208
YOU CAN GET OUT NOW.
WE SHOULD BE SAFE HERE.

145
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
- WE LOST THOSE GUYS
REAL EASILY.

146
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,166
- AHH!  SO, UM...

147
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,291
HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING ON
CLINGING TO ME, YOU PERVERT?!

148
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,416
- AHH!

149
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,375
( grunting ) OW!

150
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,416
HEY, WHY DID YOU HIT ME?

151
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,250
- ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID?
NOW WHO ARE YOU GUYS ANYWAY?

152
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,291
- SHOULD WE TELL HER?
- YEAH.

153
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,458
- I GUESS WE DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE, DO WE?

154
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,000
- THEN LET ME GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

155
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,291
SEE, WE'RE NOT
FROM THE PLANET EARTH.

156
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,541
WE'RE NOT HUMANS, LIKE YOU.
- WHAT?

157
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,083
- WE'RE SORCERERS.

158
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,166
- SO-- SO YOU CAN USE MAGIC?
- All: YEAH.

159
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,125
- THEN, THAT MEANS

160
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,083
THAT YOU GUYS
FLY AROUND ON BROOMSTICKS.

161
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,125
AM I RIGHT?
- All: YEAH.

162
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,666
- PHEW, I'M RELIEVED.

163
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,541
YOU DO KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

164
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,375
I THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE A HARD TIME.

165
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,416
- AHH!
DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?!

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,416
GIVE ME A BREAK!

167
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,125
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK
I BELIEVE

168
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,750
YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE LIES,
DO YOU?!

169
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,541
- YOU REALLY AREN'T AN EASY
PERSON TO GET ALONG WITH.

170
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,291
- YEAH, DIDN'T YOU SEE
ALL THAT COOL SORCERER STUFF

171
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,250
WE DID EARLIER?
- THAT'S IT!

172
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,125
I WANNA KNOW
WHO YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT NOW.

173
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,166
- WE'RE SORCERERS,
LIKE WE SAID.

174
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,916
- AND RIGHT NOW, THE TWO OF US
ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,750
OF BECOMING
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

176
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,625
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY
WE'RE TAKING OUR FINAL EXAM.

177
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,041
EVERY YEAR THE EXAMINEES
PAIR UP TO TAKE THIS TEST.

178
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,208
IT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR CENTURIES.

179
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,291
SEE, THE TEACHERS DROP A BALL,
CALLED THE CRYSTAL PEARL,

180
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,541
AT SOME RANDOM SPOT
IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

181
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,541
THE FIRST TEAM THAT MANAGES
TO FIND IT BY CHRISTMASTIME

182
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,750
PASSES THE TEST

183
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,000
AND THEN THEY BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

184
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,500
- OH.

185
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,791
SO WHERE EXACTLY
IS THIS PEARL LOCATED NOW?

186
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,583
- YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS!
YOU ATE IT EARLIER

187
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,500
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS CANDY!

188
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
- SO THE HARD CANDY THAT CAME
WITH THE CAKE I ORDERED

189
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,250
WAS REALLY THE CRYSTAL PEARL?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

190
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,541
YOU PUT IT
IN YOUR MOUTH

191
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,541
AND YOU SWALLOWED IT!

192
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,375
- WAIT.
AND THAT MEANS...

193
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,083
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY SORCERERS?

194
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,000
- THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU.

195
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,541
- DOES THIS MEAN
I'M GOING TO BE CHASED

196
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,916
BY THE SORCERER EXAMINEES
UNTIL THE TEST IS OVER?

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,125
- OH GOOD, GUYS.

198
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,541
- All: I THINK SHE
FINALLY UNDERSTANDS.

199
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,625
- YOU GUYS HAVE GOTTA
GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!

200
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,958
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THERE
CAN EVEN BE A TEST ANYMORE

201
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,083
WITH THIS CRYSTAL WHATEVER
THINGY INSIDE MY STOMACH.

202
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,625
- EXACTLY.
- OKAY.

203
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,666
I BETTER PUT A CALL
IN TO HEADQUARTERS.

204
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,416
- THIS IS CAUSE OF
YOUR BIG MOUTH.

205
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,458
- WHAT?

206
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,208
- HI.

207
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,291
I THINK WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE PROBLEM DOWN HERE.

208
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,166
WELL, IT'S...

209
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,875
- Man: IS THAT SO?

210
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,208
THIS IS MOST DISTURBING.

211
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,291
THE CRYSTAL PEARL
ISN'T MEANT TO BE INGESTED.

212
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,666
WELL THEN, THERE IS MEDICINE
THAT CAN REMOVE IT.

213
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,333
HOWEVER A BATCH
CAN'T BE READY UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

214
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,333
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CANCEL THE TEST

215
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,500
OR DROP ANOTHER PEARL
FOR YOUR STUDENTS TO LOOK FOR?

216
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,791
- I'M SORRY.
- AH!

217
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,416
- WHAT DID I DO?!
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?!

218
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,958
- STOP CRYING. IF ANYONE SHOULD
BE CRYING, IT'S ME.

219
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,541
WE'VE WORKED SO HARD
PREPARING FOR THIS EXAM.

220
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,666
AND NOW
YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING.

221
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,208
I HATE THIS.

222
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,583
NOW I'LL BE A STUDENT
FOR ANOTHER YEAR!

223
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S ALREADY OVER.

224
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,541
I DON'T WANNA THROW AWAY
THE DREAM

225
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,791
THAT I'VE WORKED
SO HARD TO ACHIEVE.

226
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,125
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

227
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,833
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

228
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,041
- HUH?

229
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,583
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO DO THIS.

230
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,791
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

231
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,416
UNTIL THE DAY
THAT THE TEST IS OVER.

232
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,958
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH
OVER HER

233
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,541
UNTIL THE MEDICINE
IS READY

234
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

235
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,583
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

236
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,125
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

237
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,583
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

238
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,791
REALLY?
- REALLY.

239
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,916
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- NINA.

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,250
- WELL, MY NAME'S ICHII.
AND YOU CAN CALL HIM ZERO.

241
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,750
- SO IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,
THEN WE HAD BETTER DO IT RIGHT.

242
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,458
I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP
ON MY DREAM JUST YET.

243
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
IT'S SETTLED.
WE CAN PROTECT HER.

244
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,416
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

245
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,583
WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
WE POSSIBLY CAN

246
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,583
TO PROTECT NINA AND THE CRYSTAL
PEARL UNTIL THE TEST IS OVER.

247
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,583
- Forte: AHA!
I KNEW IT.

248
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,750
- All: HUH?

249
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,708
- THAT'S WHY YOU RAN OFF
WITH HER EARLIER.

250
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,541
- BUT, YOU'RE-- 

251
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,708
- WE'RE EXAMINEES 003
AND 004.

252
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,416
MY NAME'S SAN.
- FORTE.

253
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
- OH, YEAH.

254
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,333
OF COURSE.
IT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

255
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,875
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE
ACTING STRANGE,

256
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:29,875
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED

257
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,916
THE CRYSTAL PEARL
WAS INSIDE HER.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,250
- SO HAND HER OVER.
- AW, GIVE ME A BREAK.

259
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,708
SHE'S OURS. WE'RE NOT GIVING
HER UP TO YOU FREAKS.

260
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,000
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS GIRL.

261
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,708
- THEN I GUESS IT'S MY TURN
TO TAKE ACTION, HUH?

262
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,916
THIS IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,750
I'LL MAKE A SPECIAL SUMMONING
OF STEP CAT!

264
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,833
- ( meow )
- YEAH, WHATEVER.

265
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,000
I'LL JUST USE
MY DESTRUCTION MAGIC.

266
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
- AH!

267
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,791
- REMIND ME
WHY WE'RE RUNNING AWAY AGAIN.

268
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,875
- BECAUSE WHENEVER
YOU USE YOUR MAGIC,

269
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,958
YOU ALWAYS GO CRAZY
AND DESTROY EVERYTHING.

270
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,791
- WELL, WHAT IF I GO EASY
ON 'EM?

271
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,375
- HE'S CATCHING UP TO US.
SO STEP ON IT!

272
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,541
- ( meows )
- AWW, SUCH A CUTE KITTY.

273
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,583
- JUST SHUT UP.
HE'S TRYING TO KILL US.

274
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,583
- IT'S GETTING CLOSER, ZURA.

275
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,000
- ZERO, I THINK YOU BETTER
TAKE NINA SOMEWHERE SAFE.

276
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,791
I'LL STAY HERE
AND USE MY DEFENSE MAGIC

277
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,125
TO TRY TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS THING.  GO!

278
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,750
- A BLOWFISH?

279
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,000
- Zura: I'M NOT A BLOWFISH.
I'M A SEAHORSE.

280
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,833
- I THINK I'M GONNA FALL.
- JUST SHUT UP.

281
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,791
AND HOLD STILL
OR I WILL DROP YOU.

282
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,000
YOU'VE ALREADY CAUSED US
ENOUGH TROUBLE AS IT IS.

283
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,125
THANKS TO YOU,
ICHII AND I HAD TO RUN AWAY

284
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,375
FROM THOSE TWO LOSERS.

285
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,125
- DON'T MIND HIM.
ZERO'S JUST IN A BAD MOOD

286
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,916
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T GET
TO FIGHT 'EM.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,958
- NOT TRUE.

288
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,750
- WELL, I DON'T
CARE WHAT YOU DO.

289
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,125
JUST PUT ME DOWN.
I DON'T WANT TO BE PROTECTED

290
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,416
BY SOMEONE WHO THINKS
I'M JUST GETTING IN THE WAY.

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,708
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, NINA?

292
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,708
IF YOU KEEP JERKING AROUND
LIKE THAT,

293
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,583
I'M GONNA FALL AND THEN
WE'LL BOTH BE IN TROUBLE.

294
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,416
AHH!
- NO WAY.

295
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,666
WE'RE A LITTLE TOO CLOSE
TO EACH OTHER.

296
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,833
OH, NO. MY HEART IS BEATING
SO FAST. THIS IS NOT GOOD.

297
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,291
- NINA?

298
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,791
YOU HAVE...

299
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,125
NO BOOBS.
- AH!

300
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,250
AHHH!

301
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,583
THAT JERK!
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

302
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,041
I MEAN, FIRST HE TELLS ME
THAT HE'S GONNA PROTECT ME,

303
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,708
AND THEN HE JUST COMPLAINS
THAT I'M ALWAYS IN HIS WAY.

304
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,625
WHATEVER!  I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

305
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,208
HE WAS EVER HERE TO HELP ME.

306
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,916
- San: THEN DO YOU WANT
TO JOIN US?

307
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,541
I WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN
MOVEMENTS IF I WERE YOU.

308
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,458
- WAIT A MINUTE, I REMEMBER--

309
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,041
- I'VE GOT YOU NOW.
AND I'M NEVER LETTING YOU GO.

310
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
( laughing )

311
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,833
- Zero: NINA!  NINA!

312
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,041
- ( Forte laughing )
WELL, THAT WAS EASY.

313
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,041
- YEAH, SHE DID GIVE UP
WITHOUT MUCH OF A FIGHT.

314
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,416
WHERE'S MY REWARD?
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

315
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,125
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD HURT A GIRL,

316
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,333
EVEN IF IT MEANS
ACING THE SORCERER TEST.

317
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,250
- REWARD, NOW!

318
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,250
- I REALLY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!

319
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,416
I HAVE TO
GET THE PEARL SOMEHOW.

320
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,416
- COME ON, FO,
GIVE ME A TANGO TART

321
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,416
OR ONE OF BUJIYA'S CREAM PUFFS
OR PASTELA'S PUDDING

322
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,250
OR COZY CUL DE SAC'S
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.

323
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,333
JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING ALREADY.
I DESERVE A REWARD!  AHH!

324
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,416
- AHHHH!

325
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,833
OKAY, FINE, TAKE THIS
AND GO BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT!

326
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,708
DON'T HURT ME.
- YAY!

327
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,666
THANKS, FO.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

328
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,708
- I HOPE YOU KNOW
THAT I'M EXPECTING CHANGE,

329
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,875
AND BRING BACK THE RECEIPT!

330
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,916
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,541
WHY'D I AGREE
TO BE HER PARTNER?

332
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,166
- DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU KEEP WORKING HARD,

333
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,833
SOMETHING GOOD'S
BOUND TO HAPPEN, SO--

334
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,958
- SHUT UP ALREADY!
- San: FO, I'M BACK!

335
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,541
AND LOOK AT ALL THESE CAKES
I GOT.

336
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,791
BUT I THINK
I SPENT ALL THE MONEY.

337
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,833
- OH!

338
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,000
- HUH?

339
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,250
- NINA!

340
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,458
- WOW!
THIS CAKE IS SO DELICIOUS.

341
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,416
- THIS ONE TASTES GOOD TOO.

342
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,958
- NOW OPEN UP AND SAY "AH."
- AH!

343
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
- Both: OH MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

344
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,458
THAT CAKE
IS THE MOST SCRUMPTIOUS THING...

345
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,500
- IF I COULD DO NOTHING
BUT SIT AROUND...

346
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,375
- WHAT'S WITH THOSE TWO?

347
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,833
FIRST OF ALL, THEY BOUGHT
THOSE CAKES WITH MY MONEY,

348
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,458
SO WHY CAN'T THEY
BE MORE LIKE--

349
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,958
- Both: HERE YOU GO, FO!

350
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,625
- OR MAYBE LIKE--
- LET US FEED YOU, FO!

351
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,041
- WHY CAN'T THEY
JUST BE NICE TO ME?

352
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,208
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY SOME YUMMY CAKE?

353
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,416
- NO, THANK YOU!
- OKAY.

354
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,541
- WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO MEAN?
- SHUT UP!

355
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,541
AND AS FOR YOU, SAN,
YOU CAN'T SIT AROUND

356
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,958
AND EAT CAKE ALL THE TIME.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

357
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,791
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
PROTECT THAT LITTLE BRAT

358
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,041
TILL CHRISTMAS GETS HERE,

359
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,000
EVEN IF SHE DOES
HAVE THE PEARL IN HER STOMACH!

360
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,500
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GET SNIPPY.

361
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,250
- WELL,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL,

362
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,916
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,750
TO GET THE CRYSTAL PEARL
OUT OF HER BODY?

364
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,416
- HUH?

365
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,250
- I SEE.
- IT MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT?

366
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,250
I MEAN
THERE AREN'T ANY RULES

367
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,791
THAT SAY WE CAN'T HURT HUMAN
BEINGS DURING THE SORCERY TEST.

368
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,000
SO I GUESS IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO HER

369
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,250
AS LONG AS WE'RE ABLE
TO GET THE PEARL BACK.

370
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,250
- HEY NOW, PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG.

371
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,208
WE'RE FRIENDS, REMEMBER?

372
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,500
WE JUST ATE ALL THAT CAKE
TOGETHER. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

373
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,250
- I THINK YOU MAY BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

374
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,291
- WHAT?!
- HER LIFE'S MEANINGLESS.

375
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,500
LET'S JUST GET THE PEARL
FROM HER AND BE DONE WITH IT.

376
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,833
- HUH?  BUT-- BUT, FORTE?
- HEY, NINA.

377
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,916
THOSE CAKES--
PRETTY DELICIOUS, RIGHT?

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,625
- WAIT, SAN.  OH.

379
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,958
- NINA, WHERE ARE YOU?
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

380
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,583
IF THOSE TWO FIND HER, THERE'S
NO TELLING WHAT THEY'LL DO.

381
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,166
- IT'S ALL ZERO'S FAULT.

382
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,208
I UNDERSTAND
YOU WERE IN A BAD MOOD,

383
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,375
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE SO MEAN TO HER.

384
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,791
- HEY SHUT UP.

385
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,666
WE'RE GONNA FIND HER,
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, ZURA.

386
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,458
- AND HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT, ZURA?

387
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,166
THE FINDER ISN'T WORKING,

388
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,916
AND I'M NOT PICKING UP
ANYTHING WITH MY INTUITION.

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,250
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
FIND SAN AND FORTE

390
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,916
IN A CITY AS BIG AS THIS?
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,500
WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE WHERE
SAN AND FORTE WOULD HIDE OUT.

392
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,916
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

393
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,500
THEN I KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND THEM.

394
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,666
- AHH!

395
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,208
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
LET ME GO.

396
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,166
- ( blowing flute )
- FORTE.

397
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,875
AHH!

398
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,000
- NOW BEAR WITNESS
TO MY SKILLS, NINA.

399
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,958
BY SIMPLY USING MY FLUTE,

400
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,125
I CAN GAIN CONTROL
OVER ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.

401
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,000
IT'S HYPNOSIS MAGIC.

402
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
- AHH!

403
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,333
( thinking ) I CAN'T TALK.
I CAN BARELY BREATHE.

404
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:35,500
AT THIS RATE,
I WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER.

405
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,250
- IT'S OKAY.

406
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
SHE'S JUST A PATHETIC HUMAN,
AFTER ALL.

407
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,958
- Forte: I THINK YOU MAY BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

408
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,958
- NO.
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

409
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,583
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

410
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS THE END.

411
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,416
- Both:
WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

412
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,416
WE'LL PROTECT YOU!

413
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,708
- Zero: WE'LL GUARD YOU
UNTIL OUR LAST BREATH.

414
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,208
WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING
FOR OUR DREAM.

415
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,833
AND ONLY THROUGH DEFENDING YOU
CAN WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.

416
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,041
- ZERO.

417
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,875
- Both: SO HAVE FAITH IN US,

418
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,625
BECAUSE WE'LL PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS.

419
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,000
- ZERO, ICHII, WHERE ARE YOU?!
I NEED YOUR HELP.

420
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:17,166
PLEASE COME AND SAVE ME!
- I THINK I FOUND HER.

421
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,000
I KNEW SAN AND FORTE WOULD
BE HIDING OUT IN THIS AREA.

422
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,291
RIGHT THERE.
- ZERO.

423
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,333
- NINA!

424
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,875
AHH!

425
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,791
- ( both crying )

426
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,666
- I THOUGHT
WE'D FIND YOU HERE.

427
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,000
- ZERO, ICHII!

428
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,000
- SORRY WE KEPT YOU WAITING,
NINA.

429
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,583
- FORTE, DUDE,
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER EVER TELL YOU

430
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,166
THAT IT'S NOT NICE
TO STEAL OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS?

431
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,500
- WHOEVER FINDS THE PEARL
WINS THE TEST.

432
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,583
THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS!
IN OTHER WORDS,

433
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,708
THE CRYSTAL PEARL
BELONGS TO US, NOT YOU.

434
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,500
SO JUST LEAVE US ALONE,
YOU GOT IT?

435
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,875
( playing )

436
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,208
COME FORTH.
RAVAGE THIS GIRL'S BODY

437
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,875
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
BUT THE CRYSTAL PEARL!

438
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,208
- Both: NO WAY!

439
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,416
- MAGIC CRYSTAL, HA!

440
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,166
- ( both grunting )

441
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,083
- ZERO, ICHII, NO!

442
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,750
- Forte: I WONDER HOW MUCH
LONGER THEY CAN KEEP THIS UP.

443
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,625
IT MAY ONLY BE HYPNOSIS,

444
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,416
BUT ONCE I'VE GOTTEN
A HOLD OF THEM,

445
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,583
THEY'LL HAVE TO DO MY BIDDING.

446
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,500
- HE'S GONNA KILL EVERYONE!

447
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,583
I'M SO SORRY THAT
I'VE GOTTEN YOU GUYS

448
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,791
INTO ALL OF THIS TROUBLE.

449
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,833
PLEASE STOP.
FORGET ME.

450
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,750
AND JUST GET AWAY
FROM HERE, ALL RIGHT?

451
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,875
- DON'T WORRY.
THEY'LL BE OKAY, ZURA.

452
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

453
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,750
- ZERO AND ICHII
WILL NEVER LOSE.

454
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,500
AND THEY'LL NEVER RUN AWAY
FROM DANGER.

455
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,083
YOU SEE, THEY'RE FIGHTING
FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL.

456
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,291
- Zero: WE CAN'T GIVE UP
BECAUSE WE CAN'T LET HIM DOWN.

457
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,000
NINA, JUST AS WE'RE
PROTECTING YOU RIGHT NOW,

458
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,291
SOMEONE ALSO WATCHED OVER US
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.

459
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,666
EVEN THE TIMES
I GOT DISCOURAGED

460
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,708
AND EVEN WHEN
I COULDN'T PULL MYSELF TOGETHER,

461
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,750
HE WAS ALWAYS WATCHING OVER ME
AND MAKING SURE I WAS ALL RIGHT.

462
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,208
NOW THAT I'M OLDER
I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE HIM.

463
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,416
HE GAVE ME A HELPING HAND
WHEN I NEEDED IT.

464
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,208
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO BE A PROFESSIONAL.

465
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,041
BECAUSE JUST AS HE HELPED ME,

466
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,458
I NOW WANT TO HELP AS MANY
PEOPLE AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

467
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,958
- NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

468
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,958
IF YOU'RE PROTECTING SOMEONE

469
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,750
AND IF SOMEONE ELSE
HAS PROTECTED YOU BEFORE, ZURA,

470
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,375
THEN THAT CREATES A SPECIAL BOND
THAT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

471
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,541
AND YOUR GUARDIAN
WILL STAND BESIDE YOU

472
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,375
AND KEEP YOU SAFE NO MATTER
HOW DANGEROUS THINGS BECOME.

473
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,958
BECAUSE DEFENDING SOMEONE
GIVES YOU INCREDIBLE COURAGE.

474
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,708
- MOTHER, FATHER.

475
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,833
THAT'S RIGHT.

476
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,291
WHENEVER I HURT MYSELF
OR GOT SICK,

477
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,333
THEY STOOD BY MY SIDE.

478
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,583
THEY WERE ALWAYS MORE CONCERNED
WITH MY WELL-BEING

479
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,083
THAN THEIR OWN.

480
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,000
- PLEASE HELP MY DAUGHTER.
YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER.

481
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,750
- Nina: THEY WERE ALWAYS
PROTECTING ME.

482
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,833
- PLEASE DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
SHE'S EVERYTHING TO US.

483
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,416
- YOU SEE, YOUR MOTHER AND
FATHER WEREN'T ALWAYS AS STRONG

484
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
AS YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT,
ZURA.

485
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,833
WHEN YOU WERE BORN,

486
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,666
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THEY
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

487
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,625
BUT THEY GRADUALLY
BECAME STRONGER

488
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,375
AS THEY LEARNED
FROM DAY TO DAY, ZURA.

489
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,416
THEY MADE MISTAKES
AND THEY SCOLDED YOU,

490
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,625
BUT STILL THEY DID IT ALL
BECAUSE THEY LOVED YOU, NINA.

491
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,708
AND THEY RAISED YOU THE BEST
WAY THEY KNEW HOW, ZURA.

492
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,333
THEY MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN PERFECT,

493
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,208
BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TOOK

494
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,666
TO PROTECT THE ONE THEY LOVED.

495
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,333
- ZERO, ICHII!

496
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,583
- AND NOW THEY'VE PROMISED
TO PROTECT YOU.

497
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,166
AND THAT GIVES THEM
ENOUGH COURAGE

498
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,791
TO FIGHT WITH EVERYTHING
THEY'VE GOT.

499
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,541
AND THEY'LL NEVER GIVE UP
ON THEIR DREAM,

500
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,916
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, ZURA.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

501
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,375
THEY'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.

502
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,500
- I WILL NEVER GIVE UP
ON MY DREAMS!

503
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,541
- WE'LL ALWAYS PROTECT
THE PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT.

504
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,250
- DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

505
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,083
AHHH!

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,083
MAGIC CANNON!

507
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,833
- ( both shouting )

508
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,625
- Forte: ZERO, ICHII,
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS!

509
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,791
- San: NINA, LET'S EAT CAKE
TOGETHER AGAIN, OKAY?

510
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,583
- THEY'RE GONE!
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME.

511
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,416
I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO SEE
THEIR ANNOYING FACES AGAIN.

512
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,083
- HEY, GUYS.
- HUH?

513
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,166
I-- 

514
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,416
I WANT TO THANK YOU, BECAUSE
YOU BOTH WORKED REALLY HARD

515
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,416
AND PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE
TO DEFEND ME,

516
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,375
EVEN THOUGH I SAID SOME
HORRIBLE THINGS TO YOU EARLIER.

517
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,583
I'M SORRY.

518
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,375
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
NINA.

519
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,166
- Zero: REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
WE'D PROTECT YOU

520
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,083
NO MATTER WHAT STANDS
IN OUR WAY.

521
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,625
AND WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

522
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,083
- YOU CAN COUNT ON US.

523
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,708
- ( thinking ) IT'S JUST LIKE
THE FAIRY TALE.

524
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,208
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THE ENEMIES MAY BE,

525
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,416
THEY'LL BRAVELY FACE THEM,

526
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,291
AND GIVE IT EVERYTHING THEY'VE
GOT TO PROTECT THE ONES

527
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,666
THEY LOVE AND TO NEVER LOSE
SIGHT OF THEIR DREAMS.

528
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,583
THESE GUYS ARE--

529
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:04,375
THESE GUYS ARE MY--
MY PRINCES.

530
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,000
- BUT WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

531
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,000
IF YOU TRIED TO STAY
OUT OF TROUBLE FROM NOW ON.

532
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,125
- NO KIDDING.
AND WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

533
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,291
WILL BE STAYING WITH YOU
UNTIL THE TEST IS OVER.

534
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,500
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE STUCK WITH US.

535
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,666
- WHAT?! WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO SAY IT LIKE THAT?

536
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,208
- ( both shouting )

537
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,458
- Nina: SO ANYWAY,
THESE ARE THE GUYS

538
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,458
WHO ARE GOING TO BE
PROTECTING ME,

539
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,791
AT LEAST UNTIL
THEIR SORCERER'S TEST IS OVER.

540
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,416
AND MORE THAN LIKELY,
THE ROAD AHEAD OF US

541
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,666
WILL BE A BUMPY ONE FOR SURE.
- ( shouting continues )

542
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,208
- I WONDER WHAT NEW DIRECTION
THIS WILL TAKE ME IN LIFE.

543
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,083
( growling )
ARGH ARGH ARGH!

544
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:45,125
EITHER WAY, I KNOW IT WILL BE
AN ADVENTURE I'LL NEVER FORGET.

545
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,958
- Nina: I ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED THE CRYSTAL PEARL

546
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,208
AND NOW I'M IN BIG TROUBLE
'CAUSE I'M BEING CHASED

547
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,875
BY THE SORCERER EXAMINEES
FROM THE MAGIC WORLD.

548
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,750
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING AT MY SCHOOL?

549
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,916
YOU MEAN THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE
RIGHT BESIDE ME

550
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,500
EVEN WHEN I'M EATING MY LUNCH
OR CHANGING CLOTHES?

551
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:35,083
AND YOU'LL BE SITTING RIGHT NEXT
TO ME IN CLASS EVERY DAY?

552
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,291
- Zero: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
SAN AND FORTE

553
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,791
INFILTRATED YOUR SCHOOL
IN ORDER TO CAPTURE YOU.

554
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,916
- ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF "SAVE ME, LOLLIPOP"...

555
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,125
PROMISE YOU'LL WATCH, OKAY?

556
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,208
- Ichii: YEAH, CAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT TO MAKE ZURA ANGRY.

557
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,500
- Zura: ARGH! BITE BITE BITE.
