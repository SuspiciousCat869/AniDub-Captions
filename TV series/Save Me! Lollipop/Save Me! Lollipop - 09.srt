1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,833
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,958
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,416
I ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,916
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,583
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,708
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,458
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,625
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,916
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,125
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,458
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,583
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,041
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,916
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,041
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,125
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,333
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,541
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,125
- YOU MEAN HER?

21
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,750
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,208
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,250
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,375
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,083
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,708
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,791
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,500
- JEEZ, I'M GONNA BE
REALLY LATE FOR SCHOOL.

29
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE ZERO AND ICHII
LEFT WITHOUT WAKING ME UP.

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,125
THOSE JERKS.

31
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,208
- ( both shout )

32
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,583
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?
SLOW DOWN, GIRL.

33
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,958
YOU ALMOST
KNOCKED US BOTH DOWN.

34
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,791
SEE YA 'ROUND.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,916
- I THINK I COULD
REALLY FALL FOR THAT GUY.

36
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,375
- AHH!

37
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,041
- WHERE'D YOU GO, KUKU?
- WELL, TOTO,

38
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,041
FOR ME TO HAVE ANY CHANCE
AT BEING POPULAR HERE,

39
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,125
I REALLY NEED
TO MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

40
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,791
- WHAT'S THAT BOOK CALLED?

41
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:29,125
"101 PICK-UP LINES,
GUARANTEED TO GET YOU GIRLS"?

42
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,041
SO, ANYWAY,

43
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,958
SOUNDS LIKE I FINALLY GOT A
READING ON THE FINDER. LISTEN.

44
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,250
- THE PEARL IS IN THE AREA.
THE PEARL IS IN THE AREA.

45
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,666
- GOOD WORK, TOTO.

46
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,458
I SEE. THEN IT MUST BE
SOMEWHERE INSIDE THAT BUILDING.

47
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,500
IT HAS TO BE!

48
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,583
- GOOD MORNING, YOU TWO.
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

49
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,125
- THE DEAL WITH WHAT?

50
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,583
- WHY DID YOU LEAVE
WITHOUT WAKING ME UP?

51
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,583
- WELL, I HAD TO GET UP EARLY
TO GO RUN A FEW ERRANDS.

52
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,166
- YOU MEAN ZERO DIDN'T WAKE YOU?
- APPARENTLY NOT.

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,083
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU OVERSLEPT, DORK.

54
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,125
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- DORK DORK DORK DORK DORK!

55
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,791
- HEY!

56
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,875
GET BACK HERE!  ZERO!

57
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,958
- Zura: CAN'T WE GET JUST ONE
MOMENT OF PEACE AROUND HERE?

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,916
- HELLO!
I AM HERE.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,375
- HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY.

60
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,500
- WELL WELL,
WHAT'S THIS I SEE?

61
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,916
IT'S THE CUTIE I MET EARLIER.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,333
- YOU TOO.

63
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,833
I'M HONORED
TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE AGAIN,

64
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,333
MY LITTLE CUTIE PIE.

65
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,458
- ( all squealing )

66
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON, NINA?
WHO IS THAT GUY?

67
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,000
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
HOG ALL OF THE NEW GUYS?

68
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,833
- BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

69
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,750
I ACCIDENTALLY
BUMPED INTO THIS GUY

70
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,750
WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY
TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

71
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,291
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE NOW?

72
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,208
- I'M HERE FOR MY ZERO.

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,250
- AH!  THIS ISN'T GOOD.

74
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,958
IT'S KUKU.
- ( laughing ) 

75
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,875
- ZERO! I KNEW THAT
I'D EVENTUALLY RUN INTO YOU

76
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,333
IF I WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN
THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

77
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,041
LOOK AT YOU.
- YOU'RE A SORCERY STUDENT?

78
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,291
- YUP. WE'RE
EXAMINEES. 009 AND 010.

79
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,833
KUKU, AND...
- TOTO.

80
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,125
- AHH!

81
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,041
I FINALLY FOUND YOU, ZERO!

82
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,125
- HUH?!
- WHAT?!

83
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,041
- SHE'S A GIRL?

84
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,291
- ZERO.
( laughing )

85
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,666
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU!

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,208
- All: WHAT?!  NO WAY!

87
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,958
- GET OFF, KUKU.
- WHAT'S THE DEAL, ZERO?

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,958
WHY IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS?

89
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,708
- LEAVE ME ALONE.
- ZERO!

90
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,708
JUST WHO IS THIS GIRL?
- COME ON, TELL US.

91
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
- WELL...
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

92
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,083
HAVE YOU NOT TOLD YOUR FRIENDS
ABOUT ME?

93
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,875
- SHUT UP.
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

94
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
- QUIT STALLING, ZERO.
WHO IS SHE?

95
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,750
- I GUESS THAT I'M--
- All: YOU ARE-- YOU ARE--

96
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,916
- HIS FIANCEE.
RIGHT, HON?

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,416
- All: HUH?!  WHAT?!

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,041
- SHE'S HIS FIANCEE?

99
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,291
- KUKU, WE NEED TO TALK.

100
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,750
OUR PARENTS DECIDED THAT WE
SHOULD GET MARRIED, I DIDN'T.

101
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,791
SO THAT DOESN'T--
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

102
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,875
IF OUR PARENTS
MADE THE DECISION.

103
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,500
A PROMISE IS STILL A PROMISE,
ISN'T IT, ZERO?

104
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,000
AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED
TO BECOME AN EXAMINEE

105
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,125
AND FOLLOW YOU HERE
TO THE HUMAN WORLD, MY--

106
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,208
- BACK OFF!

107
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,666
I AM NEVER GOING TO MARRY YOU,
KUKU.

108
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,166
- WHA!
HEY, YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME.

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,416
GET BACK HERE!

110
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,958
- THIS NEW GIRL COULD BE A BIG
PROBLEM FOR YOU.

111
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,000
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.
- IT LOOKS LIKE

112
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,125
YOU'RE IN ANOTHER LOVE TRIANGLE,
NINA.

113
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,208
- BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
YOU GUYS.

114
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,041
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ZERO AND I.

115
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,291
- All: WELL THEN,
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL, NINA,

116
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,791
ICHII MUST BE THE ONE
THAT YOU REALLY LIKE THE MOST.

117
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,875
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
GEE WHIZ.

118
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,625
THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T CARE
IF ZERO HAS A FIANCEE.

119
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,875
I REALLY DON'T.

120
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,500
SO WHY--

121
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,291
WHY-- WHY--
- ( laughing )

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,125
- WHY AM I SO ANGRY?!

123
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,041
- JUST DON'T GET IT.

124
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,625
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THIS BOOK TELLS ME TO DO.

125
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,958
SO WHY ISN'T ZERO
FALLING FOR ME?

126
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,250
- WHAT'RE YOU READING?
( sighs )

127
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
"101 WAYS
TO BE THE IDEAL WIFE."

128
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,000
NOW DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

129
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,000
BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
THAT YOU AND ZERO

130
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,958
ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER,
KUKU.

131
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,625
YOU SHOULDN'T MARRY SOMEONE
JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR PARENTS.

132
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,416
AM I RIGHT?
- SHUT UP!

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,916
A PROMISE HAS BEEN MADE
AND I AM NOT GONNA BREAK IT.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,666
- BUT--
- ALL RIGHT.

135
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,375
I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT.

136
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,083
- HEY, KUKU!
WAIT FOR ME.

137
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,791
KUKU. ( sighs )

138
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,250
- Kuku: ZERO.

139
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,166
- AHHH!

140
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

141
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,208
SO, LIKE WHAT YOU SEE?

142
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,166
- LOOK AWAY.
AVERT YOUR EYES.

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,875
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, KUKU?!

144
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,750
THIS IS NUTS!
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

145
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,500
- JEEZ, WHY DO I HAVE
TO LET ZERO

146
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,583
GET UNDER MY SKIN LIKE THIS?

147
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,541
I'M JUST GOING TO SIT DOWN
AND RELAX

148
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,583
AND EAT A DELICIOUS BUTTER CREAM
SANDWICH AND ORANGE PASTRY

149
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,041
WITH RED BEAN AND MAPLE SYRUP
AND LET MY WORRIES SLIP AWAY.

150
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,250
'CAUSE I NEED A NICE
RELAXING BREAK FROM-- AH!

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,125
HEY!  WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?
IS THAT FOR REAL?

152
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,166
WHAT IS SHE WEARING?

153
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,375
- UH, NINA,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

154
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,166
- YOU'RE SUCH A HUGE JERK!

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING DOWN HERE,

156
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,291
AND WHY IN THE WORLD
IS SHE DRESSED LIKE THAT?

157
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,333
YOU LETCH!  UGH!

158
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,291
- HEY, WAIT.

159
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,291
- DON'T YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME.
- HOLD ON, KUKU.

160
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,583
HEY, YOU SHOULD PUT THIS ON.
- JUST SHUT UP.

161
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,666
- PLEASE, KUKU.
- ZERO!

162
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,250
- WAIT, HOLD ON.

163
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,041
JUST STOP FOR ONE SECOND AND PUT
SOME CLOTHES ON.

164
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,791
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOU
TO BE IN PUBLIC LIKE THAT.

165
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,625
( panting )

166
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708
I CAN'T CATCH UP.

167
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,625
WHY DOES KUKU
HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS?

168
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,458
MAYBE IT'S MY FAULT.

169
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,666
- Zura:
AW, SO THAT'S HOW IT IS.

170
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,250
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

171
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,250
- ( thinking )
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

172
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,375
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FELL FOR ZERO'S LIES.

173
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,541
- I'M JUST GLAD TO
BE BACK TO NORMAL

174
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,125
SO I CAN SEE YOUR SMILE AGAIN.

175
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,916
IT BOTHERS ME.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,250
WHENEVER I SEE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH THAT GUY,

177
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,916
IT MAKES ME FEEL SO JEALOUS.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,083
- I NEVER
SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED HIM.

179
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,833
OH NO,
WHY AM I CRYING?

180
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:36,458
I SHOULDN'T CARE
IF HE HAS A FIANCEE.

181
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,958
I-- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

182
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,583
I CAN'T TAKE THIS PAIN
IN MY HEART ANYMORE.

183
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,333
WHY DOES IT ACHE SO MUCH?
( sobbing )

184
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,875
- NINA.

185
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,375
- WHAT IS IT NOW?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

186
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,375
- OH, IT'S JUST,
FOR A SECOND,

187
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE CRYING.

188
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,625
- YOU-- YOU...

189
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,500
JERK!
- AH!

190
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,750
HEY, THAT COULD HAVE
REALLY HURT ME, YOU KNOW?

191
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,916
SO WATCH IT.
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF!

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,208
I WASN'T CRYING.
- YOU WEREN'T?

193
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,416
- JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

194
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,083
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
SPENDING QUALITY TIME

195
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,958
WITH YOUR
FIANCEE NOW ANYWAY?

196
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,291
ARGH!
I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!

197
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,541
- HATE ME?

198
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,208
- ( thinking ) OH NO.

199
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,208
THAT WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

200
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,291
- BUT--

201
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,541
YOU KNOW,

202
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,666
I-- I DON'T FEEL THE SAME.

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,958
I DON'T HATE YOU, NINA.

204
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,916
I COULD NEVER FEEL THAT WAY.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,416
- I'M SO SORRY, ZERO.

206
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,791
- Kuku: WHERE ARE YOU?!

207
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,791
- OH, CRAP!

208
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,958
- HEY, ZERO!  WAIT.

209
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

210
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,458
I WILL NOT LET YOU
GET AWAY FROM ME AGAIN.

211
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,666
NO MATTER WHERE YOU RUN,
I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN

212
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,625
AND YOU WILL BE MINE!
I PROMISE YOU THAT!

213
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,500
I'LL FIND YOU, ZERO,
AND YOU WILL BE MY HUSBAND!

214
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,000
- HA.  NOT A CHANCE.
BE QUIET.

215
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,416
- ( thinking ) "BE QUIET"?
COME ON.

216
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,583
LOOK AT THE SITUATION
WE'RE IN AND HOW CLOSE WE ARE.

217
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,708
MY HEART IS POUNDING.

218
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,625
ZERO.

219
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,458
- I SAID BE QUIET.
- WHOA, WHOA!

220
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,916
IT FEELS LIKE MY HEART'S
GOING TO EXPLODE.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,166
- WHERE'D HE GO?

222
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,750
- ALL RIGHT.
I THINK SHE'S GONE.

223
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,333
OH, SHOOT.
SHE'S STILL HERE.

224
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,083
LET ME BACK INSIDE.
- I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

225
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,166
- HUH?
- AHH!

226
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,625
- Both: WE'RE BUSTED.

227
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,875
- YOU HAVE
SOME 'SPLAINING TO DO.

228
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,000
WHY WERE YOU HIDING IN A LOCKER
WITH HER?

229
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,500
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT CHEATING ON ME.

230
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,500
- I'M NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU,
SO I CAN'T EVEN HAVE AN AFFAIR.

231
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,541
- THAT'S IT!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

232
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,583
YOU'VE BROKEN MY HEART
FOR THE LAST TIME, ZERO.

233
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,708
TAROT CARDS!
ANIMAL!  TRANSFORM!

234
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,916
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,666
KUKU.
- IT'S ANIMAL TRANSFORM MAGIC.

236
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,000
AND AS TIME PASSES, YOU WILL
GRADUALLY CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

237
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,000
AND THEN WHEN THE PROCESS
IS FINISHED,

238
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,833
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RETURN
TO NORMAL FOR A FULL 10 YEARS.

239
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,583
- ( barking )

240
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,375
- Both: WHAT?
FOR 10 WHOLE YEARS?

241
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,000
- DON'T YOU WORRY.

242
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
ONCE YOU'VE FULLY TRANSFORMED
INTO A DOG,

243
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,541
I PROMISE I'LL STILL
TAKE CARE OF YOU, ZERO.

244
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,250
YOU'LL COME HOME WITH ME.

245
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,500
SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU TWO
ENJOY THE REST OF THE TIME

246
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,583
YOU HAVE AS HUMANS
WHILE IT LASTS.

247
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,708
THERE ARE STILL THREE STAGES
REMAINING UNTIL IT'S COMPLETE.

248
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,125
SEE YA!
- WHAT?  THIS IS CRAZY.

249
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,458
SHE ISN'T REALLY GOING TO TURN
US INTO ANIMALS IS SHE, ZERO?

250
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,625
- Both: THIS IS NUTS!

251
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,666
- ( Koko laughing )

252
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,250
- AH.
WHERE DID SHE GO?

253
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,458
KUKU?  KUKU?

254
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,416
- ARE YOU LOOKING FOR KUKU?

255
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,583
- YEAH.  HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
- WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

256
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,166
BUT I BET SHE'S PROBABLY
CHASING ZERO AGAIN, ZURA.

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500
- ( sighs )
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

258
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,125
- DON'T BE SO PITIFUL.
- HUH?

259
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,250
- TELL ME, JUST WHEN EXACTLY
ARE YOU PLANNING

260
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,041
ON SPEAKING YOUR MIND TO HER,
ZURA?

261
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,208
YOU HAVE TO LET HER KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL

262
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,166
OR SHE WILL ALWAYS
JUST SEE YOU AS A FRIEND.

263
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,166
RIGHT?
- WHAT?

264
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,750
- DON'T TRY TO PLAY DUMB
WITH ME. I'M NOT BUYING IT.

265
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,291
I'M A PRO WHEN IT COMES
TO LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS,

266
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,916
SO YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, ZURA.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,166
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, YOUNG MAN.

268
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,458
- BUT KUKU WILL NEVER THINK OF
ME AS MORE THAN JUST A FRIEND.

269
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,041
- BUT WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT KUKU.  HUH?

270
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,416
HA!

271
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,333
- YOU TRICKED ME.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

272
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,125
- I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YA,
PAL.

273
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,291
AND I SUGGEST
THAT YOU LISTEN TO ME.

274
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,625
STOP BEING SUCH A BABY
AND TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.

275
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,166
- I CAN'T.

276
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,291
KUKU WANTS ZERO.

277
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,333
AND I'M JUST HER PARTNER.

278
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,458
I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE
ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT TO HER.

279
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,708
- STOP.
- AH!

280
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,583
WHY'D YOU HIT ME?

281
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,000
- STOP MOPING
AND JUST TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.

282
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,625
HOW WOULD KUKU
KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED

283
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,000
IF YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
MADE A MOVE ON HER, ZURA?

284
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,208
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
AT LEAST SOME KIND OF EFFORT

285
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,333
IF YOU EXPECT TO GET THE GIRL.

286
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,750
GO!
TELL HER YOU LOVE HER.

287
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,708
IF SHE DOESN'T
RETURN YOUR FEELINGS,

288
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
IT WON'T BE
THE END OF THE WORLD.

289
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,833
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU'LL ALWAYS
REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T.

290
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,875
SO GO AHEAD
AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

291
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,250
JUST TELL KUKU
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

292
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,875
- YEAH.
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

293
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,083
GOOD LUCK.
YOU'LL NEED IT, ZURA.

294
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,166
YEAH, HE CAN DO IT.
I AM SUCH A GOOD COACH.

295
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,000
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.
- LET'S SEE, WHAT'S THIS?

296
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,750
- THE ANTIDOTE IS NEAR
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND

297
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,250
IN THE MAGIC WORLD.

298
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,875
WE'LL NEVER FIND IT HERE.
- WELL, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

299
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,875
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE
TRANSFORMED INTO A SQUIRREL.

300
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,000
- AND I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.

301
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,041
BUT STILL, THERE'S NO
HUMAN MEDICINE

302
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,125
THAT CAN CHANGE US BACK.

303
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,958
WE HAVE TO THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE, NINA.

304
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,958
- Girl: OH MY GOD,
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH NINA?

305
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,708
- Girl #2: YEAH, I KNOW.

306
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
- COME ON.
THIS WAY.

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,416
LET'S HIDE HERE FOR A WHILE.

308
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
- I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

309
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,708
BUT IN A WAY--
- HUH?

310
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,833
- WE'RE IN BED TOGETHER.

311
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,000
- HUH?
IS SOMEONE IN HERE?

312
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,291
- OH NO.

313
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,166
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

314
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,291
- WELL, IT'S MY HEAD.
IT HURTS.

315
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,250
I NEED A NAP.
YOU MIND IF I LAY DOWN HERE?

316
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,083
- THAT'S FINE.
GET SOME REST.

317
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,791
FEEL BETTER.
BY THE WAY,

318
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,250
IF I STEP OUT, WILL YOU BE OKAY
HERE BY YOURSELF?

319
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,333
- YEAH, I'LL BE JUST FINE.
THANKS.

320
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,250
- ( Nina thinking )
HURRY UP AND GET OUT OF HERE.

321
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,250
- 'BYE.

322
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
- ( sighs )

323
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,083
SORRY, NINA.

324
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,291
- UH, IT'S OKAY.

325
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,875
- ANYWAY, I DON'T--

326
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,458
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE US BACK.

327
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,458
AND I DON'T WANNA BE A DOG
FOR 10 WHOLE YEARS.

328
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,541
- WELL THEN,
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

329
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,916
THE LAST TIME WE WERE IN
A PREDICAMENT LIKE THIS,

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,083
WE HAD TO HOLD EACH OTHER
AND UNIFY OUR HEARTS

331
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,708
TO PUT EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL.

332
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,958
- THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

333
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,833
YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT, NINA. WE
SHOULD TRY THE SAME THING AGAIN.

334
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:36,916
- AH!

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,208
- IF WE BRING OUR HEARTS
CLOSE TOGETHER,

336
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,208
MAYBE WE CAN FIX THIS.
- RIGHT.

337
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,541
- ( heartbeats )

338
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,083
( dings )
- IT DIDN'T WORK

339
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,416
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO TRY.

340
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,625
WE SHOULD--
- THEN WE--

341
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,583
- Both: SHOULD KISS?

342
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,708
( both laughing )

343
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,625
- I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY

344
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,833
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
- YEAH, RIGHT?

345
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,916
- BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY IT
AND SEE IF IT WOULD WORK.

346
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,833
WHO KNOWS FOR SURE?
IT'S POSSIBLE. LET'S KISS.

347
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,416
- WHY WOULD I KISS YOU
WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE

348
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,875
THAT IT'LL TURN US
BACK TO NORMAL?

349
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,375
- YEAH, WELL,
I WAS JOKING.

350
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,250
SORRY.

351
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,916
- SURE, WHATEVER.

352
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
- I AM SORRY.

353
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,000
IT-- IT WAS JUST A JOKE.
SORRY.

354
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,375
- ( thinking ) I HOPE
I DIDN'T HURT HIS FEELINGS.

355
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:48,625
IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T WANT TO.
IT'S JUST--

356
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,833
GO AHEAD.

357
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:59,000
IT'S FINE.
AND I'M READY.

358
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,083
KISS ME.

359
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
- BUT-- BUT YOU.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,458
- IT COULD
TRANSFORM US BACK, RIGHT?

361
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,625
SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY IT,
SHOULDN'T WE?

362
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,208
- ( thinking ) NINA.

363
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,541
OKAY THEN, HERE GOES.
READY?

364
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,708
- YEAH, I'M READY.

365
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,416
- COULD YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES?
- AH, YEAH.

366
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,791
( thinking ) OH MY GOSH.
AM I REALLY GOING TO KISS ZERO?

367
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,750
ZERO...

368
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,541
AND ME.

369
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,833
THAT WAS WEIRD!
- AH!

370
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,166
- AH!  WHAT HAPPENED?

371
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
- WE'VE TRANSFORMED AGAIN.

372
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,708
- OH, JUST LOOK AT YOU TWO.
HOW'S IT GOING?

373
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,291
YOU'RE LOOKING PRETTY PATHETIC,
ZERO.

374
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,125
NOW DO YOU REGRET
HAVING AN AFFAIR BEHIND MY BACK?

375
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,125
- ENOUGH.
CUT IT OUT, KUKU.

376
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,833
IF YOU INSIST, THEN MAYBE I CAN
TURN YOU BACK TO NORMAL, ZERO.

378
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,125
- BUT THEN
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME?

379
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,541
- YEAH.
YOU HAVE TO FIX HER TOO.

380
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,791
I WANT YOU TO TURN US
BOTH BACK TO NORMAL.

381
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,291
AND DO IT NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

382
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,916
- ZERO!
- JUST DO IT.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,291
CHANGE HER BACK
OR I'LL NEVER TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

384
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,666
- WHAT'S THAT?
DID YOU JUST THREATEN ME?

385
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,916
IS SHE REALLY THAT IMPORTANT
TO YOU, ZERO?

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,500
DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT HER
MORE THAN YOU CARE ABOUT ME?

387
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,833
'CAUSE--

388
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,708
'CAUSE I WANT YOU
ALL TO MYSELF!

389
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,500
- Nina: KUKU.

390
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,791
- I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

391
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,458
AND THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY
REASON I CAME TO THIS PLACE.

392
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,708
I-- I REALLY MISSED YOU.

393
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,500
BUT NOW I'M HERE
AND I SEE YOU'RE WITH HER.

394
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,375
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE THIS, ZERO.

395
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,875
IF-- IF YOU WON'T COME HOME
WITH ME,

396
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,208
I'LL TURN EVERYONE
INTO ANIMALS.

397
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,375
- Both: HUH?

398
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,375
- TAROT MAGIC!

399
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,625
ANIMAL TRANSFORM, EXPAND!

400
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,875
- ( all gasping )

401
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,291
- WHAT'S GOING ON?!
- DON'T ASK ME.

402
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,333
- QUIET. ( quacking )
- UH, TEACHER?

403
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,416
- WHAT-- 
WHAT IS THIS IRRESISTIBLE URGE?

404
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,083
- HEY.

405
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,000
- I CAN'T STOP MYSELF.
I NEED TO WASH SOMETHING.

406
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,833
- PLEASE SNAP OUT OF IT, YOUKA.
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A RACCOON.

407
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,041
YAY!
I'VE GOT A TOY.

408
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,875
- THIS HAS TO BE KUKU'S DOING.
I'VE GOTTA FIND HER.

409
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,208
- HEY, NINA, ZERO.

410
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,958
- YOU'RE HERE.
- ICHII.

411
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,375
- WHY DO YOU TWO LOOK LIKE THAT?
- HAVE YOU SEEN YOURSELF?

412
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,958
- YOU'RE LOOKING QUITE HANDSOME,
ZURA.

413
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,041
- OH! AHH!
I AM HANDSOME.

414
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,791
- WHAT HAPPENED?
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS IN A PANIC.

415
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,375
- SO WHAT?

416
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,083
AS LONG AS THE JERK ZERO
REFUSES TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME,

417
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,583
EVERYBODY'S GOING
TO STAY LIKE THIS.

418
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,500
- KUKU!

419
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,916
- DO IT.
- PLEASE STOP.

420
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,125
THIS IS POINTLESS, KUKU.

421
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,916
IT ISN'T GOING
TO SOLVE ANYTHING,

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,375
SO JUST CALM DOWN
AND CHANGE THEM BACK.

423
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,708
- NO WAY. YOU JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL, DO YOU?

424
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,125
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ME
AT ALL!

425
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,333
- NO.  LISTEN.

426
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,541
 I DO UNDERSTAND YOU, KUKU.

427
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
EVER SINCE
WE WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS,

428
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,083
I'VE BEEN RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

429
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,166
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

430
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,458
EVEN ALL THAT TIME
YOU WERE CHASING AFTER ZERO,

431
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,416
I WAS THERE...
- ( laughing )

432
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,916
...LOOKING OUT FOR YOU,
PROTECTING YOU.

433
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,583
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
- HUH?

434
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,333
- KUKU--
- JUST SAY IT.

435
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,458
- LISTEN TO ME.

436
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,791
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL
ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU,

437
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,541
NO MATTER WHAT.

438
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,041
I WANNA BE WITH YOU
ALL THE TIME.

439
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,541
I WANNA BE THAT SPECIAL PERSON
YOU SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH, KUKU.

440
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,125
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

441
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,541
- OH, KUKU.

442
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,958
- YOU'RE SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

443
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,708
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT?

444
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,500
- TOTO!

445
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,833
- I'M HERE FOR YOU,
KUKU, FOREVER.

446
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,958
I PROMISE.

447
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,000
- AW.

448
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,833
- WAS IT ALL JUST A DREAM?

449
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,833
- ( yawning )

450
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,875
- THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

451
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,041
- I'M SORRY, NINA.

452
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,041
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

453
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,083
- YOU GOING BACK
TO THE MAGIC WORLD?

454
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,250
- MM-HMM.

455
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,375
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE SORCERY TEST.

456
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,875
AND BESIDES, I HAVE TO NURTURE
MY BRAND NEW LOVE.

457
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,333
- GOODBYE.
- BE CAREFUL.

458
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,833
- SEE YOU LATER.
- HEY, NINA?

459
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:01,125
I THINK YOU AND ZERO
MAKE A REALLY CUTE COUPLE.

460
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,458
INVITE ME
TO YOUR WEDDING, OKAY?

461
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,416
- AHH!

462
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,458
- SEE YOU LATER.
- KUKU!

463
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,208
- TAKE CARE, NINA!

00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,708
- WHAT?!  NOTHING.

467
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,708
- WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?
- NOTHING!

468
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,583
- YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

469
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,583
AHH!
- HEY!

470
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,625
- SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

471
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,583
Nina: BUT THE TRUTH IS
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN.

472
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,291
MAYBE.

473
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,875
- JUST TELL ME WHAT SHE SAID
AND I'LL STOP!

474

475
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,625

476
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,333
I HOPE THAT YOU SHARE
A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER.

- Ichii: BACK THEN,
SARASA WAS EVERYTHING TO ME.

478
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,750
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
I FELT I COULD TRUST.

479
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,750
BUT WHEN I MET ZERO,
EVERYTHING STARTED TO CHANGE.

480
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,625
I DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN,

481
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,958
BUT I HAD FOUND
MY PERFECT PARTNER.

482
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:36,250
HIS PASSION FOR MAGIC HAS HELPED
TO THAW MY FROZEN HEART.

483
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,291
NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME! LOLLIPOP"...

484
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:46,166
- Young Zero: ICHII,
YOU'RE THE ONLY PARTNER FOR ME!
