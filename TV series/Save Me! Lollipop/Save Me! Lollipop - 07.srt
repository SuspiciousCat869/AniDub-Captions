1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,333
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,708
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,416
I ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED
SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,625
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,041
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,708
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,833
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,583
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,750
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,250
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,416
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,541
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,875
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,041
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,458
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,666
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,875
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,333
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,375
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,208
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,833
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,916
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,000
- EVERYBODY'S
ACTING SO STRANGELY.

29
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,250
- NO KIDDING.
WHY ARE THEY ALL SO RESTLESS?

30
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,250
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN, NINA?
- MAYBE.

31
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,083
TODAY IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY.
- Both: VERY SPECIAL DAY?

32
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,875
- THE DAY OF THE HIGHLY
ANTICIPATED ANNUAL COMPETITION

33
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,291
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED, EVERYONE!
WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE?

34
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,333
- All: ME ME ME ME!
- Ichii: WHAT'S THIS?

35
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,000
- IT'S THE COURAGE TEST.
ALL THE FEMALE STUDENTS

36
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,208
HAVE TO PICK A BOY
THEY WANT TO PAIR UP WITH.

37
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,666
AND THEN IF YOU CONFESS YOUR
LOVE TO YOUR PARTNER--

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,041
- All: YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP!

39
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,125
- I SEE.
SO IT'S A GAME.

40
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,083
- I WANNA PLAY, ZURA.
- I'VE GOT A QUESTION, NINA.

41
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,250
WILL YOU BE CONFESSING YOUR
UNDYING LOVE TO ZERO OR ICHII?

42
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

43
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,000
- COME ON, IT'S GOTTA BE
ONE OF THEM, AM I RIGHT?

44
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,791
- Both: HUH?  HUH?
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE TONIGHT.

45
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,458
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

46
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,958
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD PICK ONE OF THEM?

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,000
- Ichii:
THIS SOUNDS INTERESTING.

48
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,125
- Zero: YEAH, LET'S SIGN UP.

49
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,333
- HUH?

50
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:36,041
OH, NO!
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

51
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,916
- HEY, YAKUMO,
ARE YOU SURE IT'S IN THIS AREA?

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
- YEAH.
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

53
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,833
JUST LISTEN TO THE FINDER.
- THE PEARL IS CLOSE.

54
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,583
THE PEARL IS CLOSE.
THE PEARL IS CLOSE.

55
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,208
THE PEARL IS CLOSE--
- SEE WHAT I MEAN?

56
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,875
- IT'S JUST THAT--
I DON'T KNOW--

57
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,833
WHAT IF THE RUMOR WE HEARD
IS TRUE

58
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,083
AND SOME GIRL SWALLOWED THE
CRYSTAL PEARL ON ACCIDENT?

59
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,166
BESIDES, I DON'T THINK
THAT RAGGEDY FINDER

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,000
WILL BE ABLE
TO PINPOINT IT ANYWAY.

61
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,958
- THAT THING'S PRETTY
BEATEN UP, YAKUMO.

62
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,041
- JUST SHUT UP!

63
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,291
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT THIS "RAGGEDY OLD FINDER,"

64
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,291
AS YOU CALL IT, HAS BEEN
PASSED DOWN IN MY FAMILY

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,041
FOR GENERATIONS NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

66
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,375
IT WORKS FINE!
I DON'T NEED A NEW ONE!

67
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,791
- YEAH.
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

68
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,125
JUST FACE THE FACTS--
IT'S NOT VERY ACCURATE

69
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,208
AND IT'S ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN.

70
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,750
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO REPLACE THAT THING.

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,750
- NO WAY, NANASE! MY FATHER AND
GRANDFATHER PASSED THE TEST

72
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,125
USING THIS LITTLE THING!

73
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,583
AND NOW I'LL USE IT TO GUIDE ME
TO THE CRYSTAL PEARL

74
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,166
AND THEN I'LL BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL SORCERER

75
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,666
JUST LIKE THEY WERE.

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,250
- IT MUST BE DIFFICULT BEING THE
HEIR TO THE SORCERY DOJO.

77
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,041
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE A LOT
OF EXPECTATIONS TO LIVE UP TO.

78
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,958
- THE CRYSTAL PEARL
IS IN THE AREA.

79
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,250
THE CRYSTAL PEARL-- ( dying )
- ( grunting )

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,583
YOU STUPID FINDER!
- SEE?

81
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,583
I TOLD YOU SO--
YOU NEED A NEW ONE.

82
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,083
- ( shouting gibberish )
- THE PEARL IS RIGHT HERE!

83
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,333
THE PEARL IS RIGHT HERE.
- WHERE IS IT?!

84
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,250
- RIGHT HERE! DON'T YOU
EVER LISTEN? HELLO?

85
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,750
- YES, I FOUND THE PEARL!
I REALLY DID IT.

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,625
CHECK IT OUT, NANASE.

87
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,541
I'M GETTING A VERY STRONG
READING ON THE FINDER!

88
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,541
- IT'S RIGHT HERE.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

89
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,166
- NANASE?
- Girl: SEE YOU LATER, GUYS.

90
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,333
- BYE.
- HUH?!

91
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,208
IT'S GONE.

92
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,208
- I BET IT'S BECAUSE
THE GIRL WHO SWALLOWED THE PEARL

93
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,750
HAS GONE HOME FOR THE DAY.
- YEAH, I BET THAT'S IT, NANASE.

94
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,041
- All: YOU'RE SO INTELLIGENT.
- ARGH!  HEY!

95
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,041
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

96
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,333
WHY ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH ALL
THESE GUYS AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

97
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,916
WE HAVE WORK TO DO, YOU KNOW?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,583
WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED
ON THE TASK AT HAND--

99
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,083
- SO HAVE YOU ASKED ANYONE
TO BE YOUR PARTNER?

100
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,500
- NO, NOT YET.

101
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,708
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHO TO ASK.
- THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT!

102
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,000
THAT'S OUR CHANCE.
- HUH?  I DON'T KNOW.

103
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,208
- NOW I KNOW
HOW TO FIND THE PEARL.

104
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,875
WE'LL USE THE COURAGE TEST
TO GET CLOSE TO THE COMPETITORS,

105
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,458
THEN USE MY SWEET FINDER
TO SEARCH FOR IT.

106
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,833
IT'S BRILLIANT!
A STROKE OF GENIUS!

107
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,250
- ( giggles ) HERE IT IS. WHAT
DO YOU THINK? TELL ME THE TRUTH.

108
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,041
- WOW, YOU LOOK PRETTY.
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,541
- IT'S MY SUMMER KIMONO.

110
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,333
ALL THE GIRLS HAVE TO WEAR THEM
FOR THIS EVENT.

111
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,208
- WELL, I THINK
IT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

112
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,375
- WHAT?
OH, THANK YOU.

113
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,875
- WILL YOU BE CONFESSING YOUR
UNDYING LOVE TO ZERO OR ICHII?

114
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,500
COME ON, IT'S GOTTA BE
ONE OF THEM, AM I RIGHT?

115
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,166
- BUT HOW CAN I DO THAT?

116
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,291
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?
OH, BOY.

117
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,166
- ( phone ringing )

118
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,750
- HI, THIS IS ICHII.

119
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,375
- Sarasa: ICHII?
HEY, IT'S ME.

120
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,416
- SARASA.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

121
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,958
- ( thinking ) A GIRL?

122
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,833
WHY IS SOME RANDOM GIRL
CALLING ICHII ANYWAY?

123
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,541
IT CAN'T BE!

124
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,333
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

125
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,583
- Hatsuka: WELCOME!

126
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,958
AND NOW ALLOW ME
TO OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE

127
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,625
THE BEGINNING OF THIS
YEAR'S COURAGE COMPETITION.

128
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,916
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,333
I WANT EVERYONE TO PICK A
PARTNER AND PAIR UP.

130
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,666
- HEY, IS IT OKAY
IF I'M IN THE COURAGE TEST?

131
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,500
- I WON'T LET THE PEARL
SLIP AWAY FROM ME THIS TIME.

132
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,791
- Rokka: ICHII, MY LOVE, I WANNA
BE YOUR PARTNER. OH, PLEASE.

133
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,291
- YES, WE WOULD LIKE TO THROW
OUR NAMES INTO THE HAT ALSO.

134
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,750
- Nina: CAN'T I EVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT YOU GUYS?

135
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,291
- HEY, WHO'S THAT?

136
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,708
HE CAME TO CLASS WITH ROKKA
THAT ONE TIME.

137
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,333
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

138
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,125
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING OUT, DO YOU?

139
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,875
- I'M GOU.

140
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,708
( echoing ) I'M GOU.

141
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,250
I'M GOU.
I'M GOU.

142
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,500
- OH, WOW!
I'M SO IN LOVE.

143
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,750
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE MET SUCH A MATURE MAN.

144
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,000
AND HE'S CUTE.

145
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,541
- Both: WHAT?

146
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,375
- HOW COULD YOU ALREADY
BE IN LOVE?

147
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,166
- YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH TIME.

148
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,666
- Both: HUH?
- I WANT-- I WANT TO--

149
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,916
I WANT TO BE WITH GOU,
ALL RIGHT!

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,375
- LET'S GET STARTED ALREADY.
- WOO-HOO!

151
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,291
EVERYONE,
THE COMPETITION BEGINS NOW.

152
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,500
- AHHH!

153
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,583
( Yakumo laughing ) THIS IS THE
PERFECT PLAN. IT HAS TO WORK.

154
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,791
WE'LL SCARE OFF
ANYONE WHO COMES THIS WAY,

155
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,875
AND THEN,
WHEN WE GET THE GIRL ALONE,

156
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,375
I'LL USE THE FINDER TO DETERMINE
IF SHE HAS THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

157
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,416
AND IF SHE DOES,
I'LL EXTRACT IT.

158
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,750
THEN WE'LL BOTH
BECOME PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

159
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,791
- YOU THINK THAT'LL WORK, HUH?
I'M NOT SO SURE.

160
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,166
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK, NANASE.

161
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,375
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN
GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THAT GIRL

162
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,208
TO GET A READING
FROM THE FINDER.

163
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,250
- AND THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU
TO GET A NEW ONE.

164
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,791
- JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
( gasps )

165
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,541
SOMEONE'S COMING.

166
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,333
LET'S GET STARTED.

167
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,541
- IS THIS PLACE HAUNTED?

168
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,791
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TOLD,

169
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,416
BUT I HOPE WE DON'T FIND OUT.

170
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,291
- ( both screaming )
- Forte: I'M OUTTA HERE!

171
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,875
- I'M GONNA GET YOU!

172
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,583
- Both: THEY'RE GHOSTS!

173
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,125
- ICHII, ICHII, ICHII,
ICHII, ICHII!

174
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

175
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,916
LET GO OF ME BEFORE I KICK YOU
INTO NEXT WEEK, YOU BIG BABY!

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,166
- I'M SCARED OF GHOSTS!
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME, ROKKA.

177
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,833
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE!
- GET OFF OF ME!

178
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,791
IF I WERE YOU, I'D MUCH
RATHER FACE THOSE GHOSTS

179
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,458
THAN DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES
OF TOUCHING ME AGAIN.

180
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?!

181
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
OH, ICHII, MY LOVE!

182
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,791
PLEASE,
I NEED YOU TO SAVE ME, MY ICHII!

183
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,375
- Forte: WHERE'D SHE GO?
- I FEEL FOR YOU.

184
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,208
- YEAH.  I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT GIRL RAN OFF AND LEFT YOU.

185
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,916
DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A VERY GOOD FRIEND TO ME.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,666
- JUST SHUT UP!

187
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,750
- I THINK WE'LL BE MOVING ON
TO THE NEXT PAIR.

188
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,166
- OHHHH!

189
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,291
( groans )

190
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,750
- ( laughing )
IT'S SO CUTE!

191
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,166
- Both:
OOH! WE'VE COME FOR YOU.

192
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,125
- HEY, PUT THAT DOWN.

193
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,125
- ( San laughing )

194
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,041
- Both: OOOH!
- NICE OUTFIT!

195
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,166
- WE'LL HELP YOU MAKE A COSTUME
IF YOU LEAVE US ALONE.

196
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,875
- SO DID YOU USE A MAGIC MARKER
TO DRAW ON THE EYES?

197
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,083
- OF COURSE NOT,
WE CUT THEM OUT WITH SCISSORS.

198
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,083
- THEN YOU FLIP IT OVER
AND PATCH THE HOLE WITH A--

199
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:51,250
- Both: DO YOU EXPECT US TO
GIVE AWAY ALL OUR SECRETS?

200
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,375
- OH, BOY!
I WANNA BE IN YOUR GHOST GANG.

201
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,625
- Both:
THIS IS BAD.

202
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,458
- I WANT TO JOIN YOU!
- THIS IS BAD.

203
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,416
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

204
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,791
LET'S JUST MOVE
TO THE NEXT PAIR.

205
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,708
- SO YOU--

206
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,500
- WELL, WHAT IS IT?

207
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,500
- I, UH...
- SPIT IT OUT.

208
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,666
- ( thinking )
OH, HE'S SO AWESOME.

209
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,750
I FIXED THE DRAW
SO WE'D BE PARTNERS,

210
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,666
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

211
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
HE'S WAY TOO COOL FOR ME.
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO HIM.

212
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,041
NO, HATSUKA, TALK TO HIM.
THIS MAY BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

213
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,916
SO GOU,
DO YOU HAVE A HOBBY OR ANYTHING?

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,791
- I ENJOY SCULPTING BONSAIS.

215
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,791
- REALLY?
THAT'S SO AMAZING.

216
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,708
MAYBE YOU CAN TEACH ME
TO SOMETI-- ( sighing )

217
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,583
- Both: NO, NO PEARL.
LET'S MOVE ON.

218
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,208
- Ghosts: OOOH!

219
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,166
- ICHII.
- HUH?

220
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID,
NINA. 'CAUSE I'M WITH YOU.

221
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,250
- ( thinking ) I'M NOT AFRAID.

222
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,416
I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THAT PHONE CALL EARLIER.

223
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,958
AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO ENJOY THE COURAGE TEST

224
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,333
WHEN I CAN'T STOP WONDERING
WHO HE WAS TALKING TO?

225
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,875
COULD IT BE HIS GIRLFRIEND?
I REALLY HOPE IT WASN'T.

226
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,541
- NINA?

227
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,458
WHAT'S WRONG?
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN TELL ME.

228
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,833
- I-- I'M FINE.

229
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,000
- OKAY.
JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

230
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,583
- ( thinking ) STOP BEING SO
NERVOUS. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

231
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,416
ASK HIM ABOUT IT.

232
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,833
DO YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR ANYONE,
ICHII?

233
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,375
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

234
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,333
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SOME SMALL TALK!

235
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
SOME GIRLS FROM SCHOOL
WERE WONDERING

236
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,333
IF YOU, UH, WERE AVAILABLE.

237
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:37,041
- I AM SINGLE, BUT I'M ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND.

238
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,583
- THEN WHO WAS THAT GIRL
EARLIER?

239
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,541
- WHAT GIRL DO YOU MEAN?

240
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,083
- Both: OOOH!
- AH!

241
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,666
- Both: WE'RE GONNA GET YOU!
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU!

242
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,083
- ( screaming )

243
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,041
- ( Nina thinking )
OH NO, ICHII!

244
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,000
HE'S SO CLOSE.

245
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,708
- GET YOUR LIPS
AWAY FROM MY MAN!

246
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,250
AHHH!

247
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,541
- ( both shouting )
- ROKKA.

248
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,541
- ( Forte shouting )
- ( ghosts shouting )

249
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,916
- San ( laughing ):
HEY, FO!  FO.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,833
- A GHOST!

251
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,333
- Yakumo: GIVE ME A BREAK.

252
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,708
HOW DO YOU EVER EXPECT
TO PASS THE COURAGE TEST

253
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,916
WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT?
- MORE GHOSTS?

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,541
NO WAY.  NO!
- WE'RE NOT GHOSTS, YOU IDIOT.

255
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,166
- HEY, I KNOW YOU TWO!

256
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,791
- ( all shouting )

257
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,791
- ZERO AND ICHII?
- All: IT'S YAKUMO.

258
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,541
- AH!  SO THAT MEANS YOU TWO--
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

259
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,791
- Both: WE'RE ALSO EXAMINEES.
- ( gasping )

260
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:48,583
- ( both laughing )

261
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,583
- ( all shouting )

262
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,000
- HEY, I KNOW YOU TWO.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

263
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,666
WE'RE EXAMINEES #007
AND 008.

264
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,958
- NANASE AND--

265
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,708
- YAKUMO. WE'RE HERE
TO FIND THE PEARL

266
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,750
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

267
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,000
- I DIDN'T THINK
WE'D RUN INTO YOU GUYS HERE.

268
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,750
- I COULD HAVE GONE
THE REST OF MY LIFE

269
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,458
WITHOUT SEEING YOUR
IDIOTIC FACE.

270
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,041
- OH YEAH? AND JUST WHERE DO
YOU GET OFF CALLING ME AN IDIOT.

271
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,458
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
GET THE PEARL FROM US, PAL.

272
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,166
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
I DOUBT YOU'LL BE SO CONFIDENT

273
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,250
AFTER NANASE AND I
KICK YOUR BUTTS.

274
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,958
- SO I GUESS YOU GUYS
AREN'T VERY GOOD FRIENDS, HUH?

275
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:38,250
- WE'RE NOT FRIENDS AT ALL.
I CAN'T STAND THEM.

276
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
- WE WERE IN THE SAME CLASS
TOGETHER, UNFORTUNATELY.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,791
- OH, REALLY? IS THAT WHERE
YOU TWO LEARNED MAGIC?

278
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,541
- NO, THAT'S WHERE
WE LEARNED HOW TO FIGHT.

279
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,583
- AND TO SHARPEN
OUR COMBAT SKILLS.

280
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,583
TWO STUDENTS HAD TO PAIR UP
FOR A SORCERY BATTLE

281
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,041
AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH.

282
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,291
EACH TIME WE FOUGHT
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

283
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,833
IT ALWAYS ENDED IN A DRAW,

284
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,833
SO THE RIVALRY BETWEEN US
HAS NEVER BEEN SETTLED.

285
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,875
- AND IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T
LIKE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH?

286
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,166
- NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
IT RUNS MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT.

287
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
RIGHT, GUYS?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

288
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,750
- NANASE,
JUST GO AHEAD

289
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,958
AND TELL HER WHAT WE HAD TO
GO THROUGH BECAUSE OF THEM.

290
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,333
TELL HER ABOUT ALL THE TROUBLE
THAT ZERO PUT YOU THROUGH.

291
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,333
JUST TELL THEM.
DO IT.

292
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,833
COME ON,
TELL THEM HOW THEY HURT US.

293
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,250
- WHAT IS IT?

294
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,166
- WHAT DID ZERO DO
TO THEM ANYWAY?

295
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,000
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

296
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,500
- IT ALL HAPPENED
SO MANY MANY YEARS AGO...

297
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,083
RIGHT AFTER
I BEGAN SORCERY SCHOOL.

298
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,833
- CAN I CARRY YOUR BAG FOR YOU,
NANASE?

299
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,875
- GO AHEAD.
- YEAH, AND AFTER SCHOOL,

300
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,041
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE ARCADE WITH ME?

301
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,666
- OH, SURE. ALL OF THIS
ATTENTION IS JUST SO FLATTERING.

302
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,666
MAYBE I SHOULD HOLD OFF
FOR A WHILE

303
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,500
BEFORE I TELL THEM
I'M REALLY A BOY.

304
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,791
AHH!

305
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,500
- SORRY, DUDE.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

306
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
- WHY DON'T YOU WATCH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, JERK-FACE?

307
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,208
- YOU REALLY
COULD HAVE HURT THIS GIRL.

308
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,583
- WAIT, THIS "GIRL"?
BUT THAT ISN'T A GIRL.

309
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,958
- All: WHAT?  NO WAY.
SHE'S A BOY?

310
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,125
A BOY?  A BOY?

311
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,916
- HEY,
WHERE'S EVERYONE GOING?

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE ME.
WE CAN STILL HANG OUT!

313
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,458
Nanase: AND MY PLAN
TO BECOME SUPER POPULAR

314
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,083
AT SCHOOL
WAS BRUTALLY SHATTERED.

315
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,875
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF ZERO.
HE RUINED ME FOREVER.

316
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,500
- OH YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU'RE SUCH A FRAUD.

317
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,958
- THAT SOUNDS JUST LIKE FO.
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH, SAN.

318
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,166
- AND THAT'S NOT ALL,
IS IT, ICHII?

319
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,541
AS YOU KNOW.
MY VERY SPECIAL TECHNIQUES

320
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,833
INVOLVE THE USE
OF WEAPONRY MAGIC,

321
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,500
WHICH CAN TRANSFORM ANYTHING
INTO A WEAPON.

322
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,166
LIKE THIS FAN, FOR EXAMPLE.
LOOK OUT.

323
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,041
- All: OH!
THAT IS JUST SO AWESOME!

324
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,166
I'LL NEVER GET TIRED
OF THAT TRICK, YAKUMO. YAY!

325
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,500
- YES, THAT'S THE RESPONSE
I GET FROM MOST PEOPLE, ZERO.

326
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,291
BUT BACK IN SCHOOL,
ICHII WAS ALWAYS LIKE--

327
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,625
- THAT'S LAME.
- AHH!

328
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,041
ARGH!

329
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,958
- THAT'S LAME.
THAT'S LAME.

330
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,791
THAT'S LAME.
- AHH!

331
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,750
ICHII!

332
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,958
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW BADLY YOU STOMPED

333
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,916
ON MY SENSE OF SELF-ESTEEM
AND CONFIDENCE

334
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,875
WHEN WE WERE BACK
IN SCHOOL TOGETHER?

335
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,833
- DIDN'T I ALREADY APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT?

336
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,583
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

337
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,958
- BUT WHY?
WHY WAS HE MEAN?

338
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,916
HE ALWAYS SEEMED SO SWEET
AND INNOCENT TO ME.

339
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,958
- WHAT?  DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

340
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,416
OH YEAH,
HE MAY SEEM QUIET NOW,

341
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,375
BUT BACK IN THE DAY,
HE WAS NOTORIOUS FOR--

342
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,666
- YAKUMO.
- WHAT IS IT, ICHII?

343
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,333
NOW DON'T INTERRUPT ME.
I'M READY TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

344
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,791
SO COME ON.
LET'S GO.

345
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,583
- WELL, IF YOU INSIST.
ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?

346
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,750
- AH, YEAH, I'M ALWAYS READY.
BRING IT.

347
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,875
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

348
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,333
AHHH!

349
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,500
FIREBALL PISTON!

350
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,541
CURSE CARD MAGIC,
SLOW DOWN TIME!

351
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,000
( laughing ) YOU'LL HAVE
TO MOVE FASTER THAN THAT.

352
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,500
- HERE I COME, ICHII!  AHH!

353
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,958
- Both: AHH!

354
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,291
- NANASE! I THINK WE REALLY
NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

355
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,666
COME ON, LET'S GO.

356
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,791
I THINK WE LOST THEM.

357
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,833
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT OUR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE.

358
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,541
WE NEED A PLAN TO GET
THE CRYSTAL PEARL

359
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,750
BEFORE ZERO AND ICHII.

360
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,791
- HEY, LET GO OF ME.
YOU'RE HURTING MY HAND.

361
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,583
- HUH?  WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, NANA--

362
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,541
AHH!

363
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,708
- LET GO.
- WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?

364
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,916
- YAKUMO!

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,208
- HEY, WHAT GIVES?

366
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,125
- THANKS A LOT FOR RUNNING OFF
LIKE THAT

367
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,125
AND LEAVING ME BEHIND,
YOU JERK!

368
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,000
AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE,
YOU HAD TO CONFUSE ME

369
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,000
WITH AN UGLY GIRL, DIDN'T YOU?
- HE DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

370
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,000
- LOOK, I JUST GOT
A LITTLE CONFUSED, SORRY.

371
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,375
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
YOU LEFT ME ALONE

372
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,125
IN A VERY STICKY SITUATION
BACK THERE, YOU IDIOT.

373
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,750
- THE CRYSTAL PEARL IS NEAR.
THE CRYSTAL PEARL IS NEAR.

374
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,625
- ARGH!
- AH!

375
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,458
- SO THAT MEANS

376
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,833
THAT YOU MUST HAVE SWALLOWED
THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

377
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,625
- OH NO!
I'M-- I'M BUSTED.

378
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,875
- BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT WAS JUST A RUMOR.

379
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,916
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE
WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO SWALLOW IT.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,875
- KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.
- I SEE.  THAT'S IT--

381
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,375
ZERO AND ICHII
MUST HAVE BEEN

382
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,083
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME.

383
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,916
HUH?
- WHAT?

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,541
- NOW THAT I GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT YOU, YOU ARE PRETTY CUTE.

385
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,000
YOUR NAME?
- NINA.

386
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,583
- ( laughing )

387
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,875
LISTEN, NINA, HOW ABOUT YOU
KICK ICHII AND ZERO TO THE CURB

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,750
AND COME HANG OUT WITH A REAL
MAN LIKE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

389
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,916
I'LL PROTECT YOU
UNTIL THE TEST IS OVER, OKAY?

390
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,916
- CAREFUL, YAKUMO.

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,208
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANOTHER PROMISE

392
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,750
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP, ARE YOU?

393
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,458
- I WILL NEVER STAY WITH YOU.
- AND WHY NOT?

394
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,958
I CAN PROTECT YOU
JUST AS WELL AS ZERO AND ICHII.

395
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,291
YOU'LL BE SAFE WITH ME.

396
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,000
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE--

397
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,291
- I'LL MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE
HURTS YOU, ALL RIGHT?

398
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,166
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY? DO YOU WANT
TO STAY WITH US, NINA?

399
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,416
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TRUST YOU.

400
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,541
- Zero: HEY, THERE HE IS.
LET'S GET HIM!

401
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,625
- ZERO, ICHII.

402
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,416
- GOOD TIMING.

403
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,750
- THE GIRL WHO SWALLOWED THE
CRYSTAL PEARL WILL NOW--

404
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,500
- BE UNDER OUR PROTECTION.
DO YOU JERKS UNDERSTAND ME?

405
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,541
- NO WAY.  WE'RE THE ONES
WHO ARE PROTECTING NINA.

406
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,250
- SO HAND HER OVER NOW.
- HA!

407
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,166
OH NO. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
LET NINA DECIDE FOR HERSELF.

408
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,500
AND IF SHE MAKES THE DECISION
TO STAY WITH US,

409
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,791
THEN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

410
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,541
SOUNDS PRETTY FAIR TO ME.

411
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,083
- BUT NINA WOULD NEVER DECIDE
TO STAY WITH YOU.

412
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,083
- ARE YOU SURE?

413
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,500
BECAUSE I NOTICED A LITTLE
TENSION BETWEEN YOU EARLIER.

414
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,666
MAYBE NINA'S FINALLY TIRED
OF HANGING OUT WITH YOU LOSERS.

415
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,250
- NINA DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW TOO
MUCH ABOUT YOUR PAST, DOES SHE?

416
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,166
I THINK SHE MIGHT FEEL
A BIT DIFFERENTLY

417
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,416
IF SHE KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE CAPABLE OF.

418
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,166
- HUH?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

419
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,666
- ZERO, ICHII,
ARE YOU CONFIDENT

420
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,333
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NINA?
YOU THINK SHE'LL STILL LIKE YOU

421
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,583
ONCE SHE FINDS OUT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?

422
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,041
MAYBE SHE'S BETTER OFF
WITH NANASE AND ME AFTER ALL.

423
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,583
SO IF YOU WANT HER BACK,

424
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,500
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME THROUGH
US TO GET HER.

425
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,708
- YOU JERK.
- FINE THEN.

426
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,166
- HEY.
- IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO HER NOW.

427
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,041
IF NINA WANTS TO STAY WITH YOU,
THEN I WON'T GET IN HER WAY.

428
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,166
I PROMISE.
SHE HAS TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF.

429
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,958
- BUT ICHII, WHY?

430
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,666
- THINK IT'S TIME WE
HEAR FROM HER.

431
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,666
AND I'M SURE SHE'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

432
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,916
WHAT DO YOU SAY, NINA?

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,583
- UH...

434
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,958
( thinking )
MAYBE HE'S GOT A POINT.

435
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,291
THE TRUTH IS,

436
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,666
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ZERO
AND ICHII'S PAST.

437
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,791
JUST BECAUSE
I'M ALWAYS WITH THEM,

438
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,000
AND THEY'RE
ALWAYS PROTECTING ME,

439
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,875
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I UNDERSTAND
WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

440
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,416
TRUTH IS, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THEM--

441
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,041
ANYTHING.

442
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,583
- SARASA.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

443
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:04,458
I AM SINGLE, BUT I'M ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND.

444
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,541
- WHAT? DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

445
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,000
OH YEAH,
HE MAY SEEM QUIET NOW,

446
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,125
BUT BACK IN THE DAY,
HE WAS NOTORIOUS.

447
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,666
- YAKUMO!

448
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,708
- ( thinking ) SO IT DOESN'T
MATTER IF IT'S ICHII OR YAKUMO.

449
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,291
I STILL NEED SOMEONE
TO PROTECT ME.

450
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,958
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE--

451
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,208
- NINA!  NINA!

452
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,583
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW THEM
AT ALL, SO...

453
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,250
I'VE DECIDED
TO STAY WITH THEM.

454
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,291
AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR PAST,

455
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,250
I KNOW I CAN TRUST THEM BOTH,

456
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,333
AND THAT THEY'LL PROTECT ME
NO MATTER WHAT,

457
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,583
BECAUSE THEY GAVE THEIR WORD
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

458
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,541
SO I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

459
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,291
BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO STAY
WITH ZERO AND ICHII.

460
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,375
I'M SORRY.
( crying )

461
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,208
- I ALWAYS HAD FAITH IN YOU,
NINA.

462
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,791
I KNEW THAT YOU'D STAY.

463
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,500
BUT I'M HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE BACK WITH US.

464
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,750
- ICHII, ZERO!
- NINA.

465
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,750
- I FEEL SAFE
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

466
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,791
- YEAH, AND BY THE WAY, WHAT
WERE YOU PLANNING ON DOING

467
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,250
IF SHE HAD CHOSEN
THOSE TWO IDIOTS OVER US?

468
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,625
- COME ON,
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

469
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,500
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE MEANT TO PROTECT NINA.

470
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,833
AND I WILL NEVER
BREAK MY PROMISE TO YOU.

471
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,958
- ICHII!
- OH BOTHER.

472
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,625
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO USE FORCE AFTER ALL.

473
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,833
- NOT YET. WE NEED TO GO AND
DEVELOP A NEW GAME PLAN FIRST.

474
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,833
BUT MARK MY WORDS,
ZERO AND ICHII!

475
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,583
WE WILL RETURN,
AND WHEN WE DO,

476
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,375
YOU BETTER BE READY,
BECAUSE WE'RE COMING AFTER NINA!

477
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:36,500
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MY BEAUTIFUL NINA.

478
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,583
- All: HUH?

479
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,541
- ( laughs ) GUESS WE'LL
CATCH YOU LATER.

480
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,708
BYE, NINA!

481
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,625
- Nanase: I WON'T GIVE UP ON
THE CRYSTAL PEARL. YOU HEAR ME?

482
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,625
- Yakumo:
WAIT FOR ME, MY DARLING!

483
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,833
AND I'LL BE BACK TO DEAL WITH
YOU LATER, ZERO AND ICHII.

484
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,291
- Zero: HA!
COME BACK ALL YOU WANT.

485
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,750
- Both: BUT YOU'LL NEVER
GET NINA, JERKS.

486
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,750
- I MAY NOT KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT ZERO AND ICHII'S PAST,

487
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,458
BUT I KNOW I CAN TRUST THEM

488
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,958
AND THAT
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR ME.

489
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,375
THEY'LL PROTECT ME
FROM DANGER.

490
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:08,333
BECAUSE, AFTER ALL,
THEY'RE MY TWO PRINCES.

491
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,291
- ARE YOU READY TO GO, NINA?

492
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,000
- ( laughing )

493
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,875
( thinking ) BESIDES,
I STILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME

494
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,291
TO GET TO KNOW THEM BETTER
AND LEARN ALL ABOUT THEM.

495
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,875
AND NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES,
I KNOW IT'S WORTH IT.

496
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:29,041
BECAUSE MY TRUST IN THEM

497
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,500
WILL NEVER GO AWAY.

498
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,333
- 'SCUSE ME.

499
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,916
- YES, NOW WHAT?

500
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,416
- WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE?

501
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,041
- PINE.

502
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,625
- I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT,
I KNEW IT!

503
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,583
THE LOVELY PINE BONSAI.
OH, MY SWEET GOU.

504
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,083
- Zero: OH NO.
WHAT HAPPENED?

505
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,041
- Ichii: WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE RACKET, ZERO?

506
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,250
- Nina: YEAH,
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE NOISE?

507
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,250
- Nina and Zero:
WHY DO I SEE ANOTHER ME?

508
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,041
- Ichii: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

509
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,833
- Zero: HEY, WHY ARE
YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

510
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,916
AND WHY AM I DRESSED LIKE THIS?

511
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,333
- CALM DOWN, YOU TWO.

512
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,500
NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME LOLLIPOP"...

513
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,708
- Nina and Zero: WHAT
JUST HAPPENED?

514
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,125
- Nina: UH-OH!
