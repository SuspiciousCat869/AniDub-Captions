1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,208
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,041
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,500
I ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED
SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,625
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,041
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,708
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,833
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,583
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,750
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,250
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,375
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,500
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,833
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,041
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,458
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,666
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,875
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,333
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,375
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,208
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,833
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,916
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,916
- San:

- Woman: THAT LITTLE GIRL
FRIGHTENS ME.

40
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,208
- Woman #2:
THEY SAY SHE'S CURSED.

41
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,625
- Woman #3:
STOP, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,541
- Man:
SHE IS MOST DEFINITELY HEXED.

43
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,583
- WE SHOULD RUN HER OUT OF TOWN.
- GET OUT OF HERE.

44
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,958
- STAY AWAY.
- LEAVE US.

45
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,125
- SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
- All: LEAVE US, CURSED ONE.

46
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,750
LEAVE US, CURSED ONE!

47
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,208

52
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,958
- THE CAKES HERE ARE ALMOST
AS GOOD AS THE ONES BACK HOME.

53
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,458
- Zura: MM-HMM.

54
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,291
- ( thinking )
LIFE IS SO STRANGE SOMETIMES.

55
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,375
NOW I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
BEING WITHOUT THE THREE OF THEM.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,708
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,125
- HUH?  IT'S NOTHING.
I WAS JUST DAYDREAMING.

58
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,000
- OH, NO!

59
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,416
LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!

60
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,916
- ( San laughing )

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,916
- DON'T WORRY, NINA.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,166
- WE WON'T LET THEM
ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,416
- IS IT OKAY IF WE EAT MORE CAKE
WHILE YOU PROTECT US?

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,625
- I'M STARVING, FO.

65
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,250
I HAVE TO
GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

66
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:01,083
I'M SO THIRSTY TOO.
BUY ME SOMETHING TO DRINK.

67
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,458
I WANT ICE CREAM.

68
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,958
AND A FRUIT CUP!

69
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,250
I WANT--

70
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,041
NOW I'M EXHAUSTED.
I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP.

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,583
- WHAT WOULD YOU
EVER DO WITHOUT ME, SAN?

72
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,083
- ( laughs ) THANK YOU!

73
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,208
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT?
- NO IDEA.

74
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,583
- ( Forte shouting )
- All: HUH?

75
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,416
- GET AWAY, GET AWAY,
GET AWAY!

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
- BUT I'M NOT FINISHED
PLAYING YET.

77
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,708
GET BACK HERE, FO.
- I TOLD YOU,

78
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,958
I DON'T WANNA TO WRESTLE
WITH YOU, SAN!

79
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,458
I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY HOUSE EITHER, OKAY?

80
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,708
- BUT TODAY IS DIFFERENT.
COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

81
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,125
( laughing )

82
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,125
- AHHH!

83
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,250
- TODAY IS THE DAY
WE PLAY DRESS-UP, FO.

84
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,375
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!

85
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,958
- I KNEW THAT COLOR
WOULD LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

86
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,750
- AHH!

87
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,208
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!

88
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,583
- IT'S HARD TO SAY.
- IT DOES LOOK AMAZING ON YOU.

89
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,125
- SAN SHOULD PICK OUT
YOUR CLOTHES ALL THE TIME.

90
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:20,250
- YOU'RE ALL DOLLED UP.
- ( all laughing )

91
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,750
- AHH!

92
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,375
- HEY, FO!
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

93
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,458
- SAN, YOU IDIOT!

94
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,541
- I WANT SOME TANGO TARTS

95
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,666
AND SOME
OF BUJIYA'S CREAM PUFFS,

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,583
A HEALTHY HELPING
OF PASTELA'S PUDDING,

97
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,041
AND COZY CUL-DE-SAC'S SHORTCAKE.

98
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,583
- FORTE'S BEING
REALLY PATIENT WITH HER, ZURA.

99
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,500
- YEAH, SAN MUST'VE DUG UP
SOME DIRT ON HIM OR SOMETHING.

100
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,375
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

101
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,208
THEY'VE KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN
LIKE THIS, HAVEN'T THEY?

102
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,125
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

103
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,708
WHY DOES FORTE ACT SO SWEET
TO THAT ANNOYING LITTLE GIRL?

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,666
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

105
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,583
- HEY, FO?

106
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,833
- JUST DON'T ASK.
I CAN'T BUY YOU ANYTHING ELSE.

107
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:09,083
- BUT THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I NEED TO MAKE TODAY COMPLETE.

108
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,250
AND IT'S MY VERY FAVORITE.
- WHAT IS IT?

109
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,500
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY LIKE
MORE THAN TANGO'S TARTS

110
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,958
OR BUJIYA'S CREAM PUFFS?

111
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,791
- THEY AREN'T NEARLY AS GOOD
AS YOUR HOMEMADE COOKIES.

112
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,083
WILL YOU PLEASE
MAKE ME SOME COOKIES, FO?

113
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,375
- BUT--
- BUT PRETTY PRETTY PLEASE?

114
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,375
I'LL BE
YOUR BESTEST FRIEND FOREVER.

115
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,250
PLEASE?

116
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,791
- ( oven dings )

117
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,875
- ( thinking ) JEEZ, THE THINGS
I DO TO KEEP THIS GIRL HAPPY.

118
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,750
PERFECT.

119
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,250
SAN?

120
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,875
YOU HERE?

121
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,250
"FORTE, I'LL BE BACK
IN TIME FOR TEA.

122
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,375
LOVE, SAN."
THAT LITTLE BRAT.

123
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,125
SHE LEFT
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING MY COOKIES.

124
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,125
( thinking )
THAT'S RIGHT.

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,791
OF COURSE.
HOW COULD I FORGET?

126
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,333
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

127
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,791
IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS
SINCE THAT DAY.

128
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,875
- ( bell tolling )

129
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,291
- Woman: WELL WELL WELL.

130
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,708
DON'T YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME?

131
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,500
YOU ARE MY PERFECT LITTLE
GENTLEMAN, AREN'T YOU, FORTE?

132
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,583
AND NOW YOU'RE READY
TO ATTEND THE TEA PARTY

133
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,500
AT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S MANSION
TODAY.

134
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,375
EVERYONE WILL THINK
THAT YOU'RE JUST PRECIOUS.

135
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,958
- GRANDFATHER'S MANSION?

136
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,291
- I'M SURE IT'LL BE A LOT OF FUN
FOR YOU, FO.

137
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,625
AND THIS WAY,

138
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,291
YOU'LL GET A CHANCE TO
KNOW HIM A LITTLE BETTER.

139
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:51,500
- OH.
IF YOU SAY SO, MOM.

140
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,458
- ( all laughing )

141
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,166
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

142
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,625
- I'M SEVEN YEARS OLD.

143
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,208
- AND WHAT KIND OF MAGIC
DO YOU USE?

144
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,625
- HYPNOSIS MAGIC.
MY MOM IS TEACHING ME.

145
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,750
- OH, HOW IMPRESSIVE.

146
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
- ( girl screaming )
- ( objects clattering )

147
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,666
- ( squawking )

148
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,333
- ( all screaming )

149
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,250
- ( San laughing )

150
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,041
- THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME...

151
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,458
THAT SAN AND I
MET EACH OTHER.

152
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,500
UH, HEY, YOU,
DON'T GO.

153
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,375
WAIT A MINUTE.
- Mother: FORTE.

154
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,541
FORTE, ARE YOU HURT?

155
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,750
- I'M FINE, MOM.
DON'T WORRY.

156
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,166
BUT WHO WAS THAT GIRL?

157
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,833
- HER NAME IS SAN.
SHE'S LADY SALIA'S DAUGHTER.

158
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,250
- THEN THAT WOULD MEAN
SAN IS YOUR COUSIN.

159
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,875
- SHE IS?

160
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,083
- BUT I WONDER WHY
SHE ATTACKED YOU LIKE THAT.

161
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,083
- SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY.
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.

162
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,958
- THAT GIRL HAS DISPLAYED
EXTRAORDINARY MAGICAL POWERS

163
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,041
EVER SINCE
SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE BABY.

164
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,416
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF.

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,666
- AND YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO NEXT.

166
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,083
- I BET SHE'S THE REASON
LADY SALIA'S FALLEN ILL.

167
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:01,166
- LISTEN, FO, I WANT YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER.

168
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,541
- Woman: I MEAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN HER LATELY?

169
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,791
- Man:
SHE IS A FEROCIOUS CHILD.

170
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,791
FOR ONCE THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

171
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,458
- SHE'S SO UNUSUAL.
SHE MUST BE CURSED.

172
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,583
- ( thinking )
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

173
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,750
IT CAN'T BE.

174
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,333
BAD THINGS HAPPEN
BECAUSE OF HER?

175
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,083
IS THAT WHY EVERYONE
HATES THAT GIRL?

176
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,583
BECAUSE SHE'S CURSED?

177
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,416
THAT MUST BE WHY SHE HAD
SUCH A SAD LOOK IN HER EYES.

178
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
- ( San laughing )

179
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,791
- POOR GIRL.  HOW SAD.

180
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,666
SHE MUST BE LONELY.

181
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,791
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

182
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,791
- SHE TRIED TO PUT A CURSE

183
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,708
ON THAT LITTLE BOY FORTE
THIS AFTERNOON.

184
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,333
- I KNOW. HER MAGICAL
POWERS ARE BECOMING--

185
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,416
- ( both gasp )

186
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,416
- THAT GIRL
REALLY FRIGHTENS ME.

187
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,541
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
SHE'S SO STRANGE.

188
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,750
- YEAH.
WE'D BETTER STAY AWAY FROM HER.

189
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,958
- NOW FORTE, TRY AGAIN.

190
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,541
- YES, MOM.

191
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,750
- ( playing )

192
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,291
- ( squawking gently )

193
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,958
- THAT'S MY BOY.

194
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
WONDERFUL.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

195
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,291
- IT'S SO FRIGHTENING.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

196
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,333
ALL THESE OMINOUS THINGS
KEEP HAPPENING TODAY.

197
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,041
- Mother: FO, I DON'T WANT YOU
ASSOCIATING WITH HER.

198
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,000
DO YOU HEAR ME?
STAY AWAY FROM THAT GIRL.

199
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,500
FO?  FO.

200
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,458
- ( squawking )

201
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,416
- ( playing )

202
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,708
- ( Mother sighs )

203
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,833
IS THERE SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU?

204
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,625
- I'M SORRY, MOM.
FORGIVE ME,

205
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,041
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

206
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,750
- FO, WAIT, NO!
- ( thinking ) FOR SOME REASON,

207
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,208
I JUST CAN'T GET THAT GIRL
OUT OF MY HEAD.

208
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,750
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HER--

209
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,125
HER EYES, HER SMILE.

210
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,458
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING TO HELP HER,

211
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,625
BUT I NEED TO FIND HER.

212
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,250
I HAVE TO SEE HER AGAIN.
I HAVE TO.

213
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,000

00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,708
- IT'S JUST ME.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

226
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
I CAME TO FIND YOU.

227
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,250
THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE, BUT--

228
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,833
BUT I WAS JUST HOPING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

229
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,875
- MY FRIEND?
- MM-HMM.

230
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,833
DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?

231
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,875
- WHAT?
YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT AFRAID?

232
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,166
- NO.

233
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,833
- OH.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

234
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,833
- WELL, MY FULL NAME IS FORTE.
WHAT'S YOURS?

235
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,791
- WHO, ME?
IT'S SAN.

236
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,000
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

237
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:54,000
( Forte thinking )
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

238
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,708
I MADE MY DECISION
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

239
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,500
I DECIDED TO TAKE SAN
AS MY PARTNER.

240
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:06,166
AND I KNEW THAT MY LIFE
WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME.

241
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,541
NO.
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS!

242
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,541
- COME ON,
DON'T BE SUCH A SISSY.

243
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,916
I'M HUNGRY!
I NEED SOMETHING TO EAT.

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,875
I'M THIRSTY!
LET'S GO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK.

245
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,083
OOH, AND I WANT SOME ICE
CREAM TOO, AND SOME FRUIT.

246
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,416
- AH!

247
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,833
- AW, NOW I CAN'T
TAKE ANOTHER STEP.

248
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,541
I'M SO TIRED.
- ALL RIGHT.

249
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:32,083
GUESS THAT'S MY CUE.
JUST GO AHEAD AND CLIMB ABOARD.

250
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,416
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, FO.

251
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,125
YOU'RE SO NICE TO ME.

252
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,791
- GET AWAY, GET AWAY, GET AWAY,
GET AWAY, GET AWAY!

253
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,625
- BUT FO, WAIT!
I JUST WANNA WRESTLE.

254
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,500
OR MAYBE WE CAN PLAY HOUSE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

255
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,791
- THEN WE'LL DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, OKAY?

256
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,333
COME ON.

257
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,583
I KNOW!

258
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,875
WE'LL PLAY DRESS-UP!

259
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,333
- WHOA!
WHAT IS THIS THING?

260
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,416
- YOU'RE SO ADORABLE.
THAT DRESS LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

261
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,833
- OH!

262
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,583
- HEY, FO!  WAIT UP.
- ( Forte crying )

263
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,250
THAT IDIOT SAN!
- FO?

264
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,500
- Woman:
WHO'S THERE?

265
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,791
- ( thinking )
WOW, SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

266
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,875
- CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

267
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,916
- UM, I JUST GOT LOST

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,458
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
- San: ARE YOU IN THERE?

269
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,083
- MY FRIEND'S CALLING ME.
IN HERE, SAN.

270
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,708
I CAME IN THE WRONG ROOM.
I GOT LOST.

271
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,875
- I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU, FO.

272
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,083
- IT'S YOU.
- HI, MAMA.

273
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,500
YAY!
- MAMA?

274
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,541
THIS WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE
SHE COULD BE SAN'S OLDER SISTER

275
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,750
IS REALLY HER MOTHER?
- MAMA!

276
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,791
- MY DEAR SAN.

277
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:11,375
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
SAN SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

278
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,291
SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY.

279
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,458
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING IN HERE,
SAN?

280
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,333
- FATHER.

281
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,291
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOUR MOTHER.

282
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,708
YOU MUST LEAVE.
- LET HER STAY, FATHER.

283
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,916
PLEASE JUST LET SAN STAY WITH ME
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,416
- NO.

285
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,833
- PLEASE!
LET ME TALK TO MY DAUGHTER.

286
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,791
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO KEEP HER FROM ME.

287
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,583
- I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

288
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,083
HOW DARE YOU SNEAK INTO YOUR
MOTHER'S ROOM BEHIND MY BACK?

289
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,416
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS,
NOT FOR ONE MOMENT.

290
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
SALIA IS SICK
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

291
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,791
WHENEVER YOU'RE NEAR HER,
HER CONDITION SEEMS TO WORSEN.

292
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,000
SO STAY AWAY, CURSED CHILD.

293
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
- NOW WATCH IT, OLD MAN.

294
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,583
I WON'T LET YOU TALK TO SAN
LIKE THAT.

295
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,166
- IT'S OKAY, FO.

296
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,291
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DISOBEYED

297
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,708
MY GRANDFATHER'S WISHES.

298
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,625
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

299
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,666
THAT MEAN OLD MAN'S
OUR GRANDPA?

300
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,041
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY.

301
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,958
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM ANYWAY?

302
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,875
- GRANDFATHER DOESN'T
LIKE ME VERY MUCH.

303
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,041
- BUT WHY?

304
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:29,000
- I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY MOM'S ILLNESS.

305
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,458
THEY SAY I'M A CURSED CHILD.

306
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:36,291
AND THAT MY MOM WILL DIE IF I'M
CLOSE TO HER FOR TOO LONG.

307
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,041
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

308
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,083
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

309
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,166
I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO HELP MY MOM, FO.

310
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,166
- YOU DO?

311
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,500
- MM-HMM.
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME

312
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,458
THAT GOOD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN
TO ME AS LONG AS I KEPT SMILING.

313
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,291
SO MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT--

314
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,375
MAYBE I CAN CURE HER ILLNESS
IF I KEEP A SMILE ON MY FACE.

315
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,708
BUT I DON'T ENJOY IT
VERY MUCH.

316
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,708
AND SO FAR,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I SMILE,

317
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,708
MY MOM'S CONDITION
HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER.

318
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,000
I'M TRYING MY BEST,
BUT IT JUST ISN'T WORKING.

319
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:18,000
I WONDER WHY MY SMILES
HAVEN'T MADE MY MOM FEEL BETTER.

320
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,958
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

321
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,083
- ( thinking )
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, SAN.

322
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,083
YOUR MOTHER TOLD YOU TO SMILE
SO YOU WOULDN'T BE AFRAID.

323
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,916
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
YOU CAN DO FOR HER NOW.

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,208
I WISH
I COULD'VE TOLD HER THAT.

325
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,125
BUT I COULDN'T FIND THE WORDS
TO EXPRESS IT,

326
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,625
SO I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

327
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,500
ALL I COULD DO
WAS HOLD HER HAND.

328
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,333
I COULD DO NOTHING
BUT COMFORT HER

329
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,875
AND STAY BY HER SIDE.

330
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,416
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID.

331
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,916
I SAT BY HER SIDE.

332
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,625
I TRIED
TO MAKE HER FEEL BETTER,

333
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,125
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

334
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,791
- Woman:
IT CERTAINLY WAS SUDDEN.

335
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,500
- I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

336
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

337
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,291
WHY DID SALIA HAVE TO DIE
WHILE SHE WAS STILL SO YOUNG?

338
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,166
- I WONDER IF WHAT THEY SAY
IS TRUE AFTER ALL.

339
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,541
DID THIS HAPPEN
BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER IS CURSED?

340
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,041
- HEY, SAN.
- FO.

341
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,666
- YOU UPSET?
- 'BOUT WHAT?

342
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,875
- YOUR MOTHER.
- Woman: UNBELIEVABLE!

343
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,166
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT SHE SAID?
- THE GIRL'S MOTHER JUST DIED

344
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,166
AND SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO CARE AT ALL.

345
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,791
- DOES SHE EVEN HAVE A HEART?
- JUST SHUT UP!

346
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,166
STOP SAYING SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS
ABOUT SAN.

347
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,875
SHE'S ONLY A LITTLE GIRL.
AND SHE ISN'T CURSED!

348
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,541
LET'S GO, SAN.
- BUT FO.

349
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,291
FO!

350
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,083
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE HURTING MY HAND.

351
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,458
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

352
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,875
FO?

353
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,208
- SAN, IT'S OKAY.

354
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,500
IT'S OKAY TO CRY
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BAD.

355
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,083
IT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
- WHAT'S THAT?

356
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,791
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD IT IN,
ALL RIGHT?

357
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,500
SAN,
IT'S OKAY TO CRY SOMETIMES.

358
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,583
I KNOW IT MAY NOT BE MUCH,

359
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,416
BUT I PROMISE THAT I'LL
ALWAYS STAY BY YOUR SIDE.

360
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,541
YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU HAVE A FRIEND IN ME.

361
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,125
AND I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.

362
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,541
SO I WANT YOU TO FEEL SAFE
WHEN YOU'RE WITH ME.

363
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,916
I PROMISE THAT I'LL ALWAYS
BE HERE TO WATCH OVER YOU.

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,958
AND I WON'T EVER
LET ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN.

365
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,250
PROMISE.

366
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,708
- ( crying )

367
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:01,291
MAMA!  MAMA!

368
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,333
DON'T LEAVE ME ALL ALONE,
MAMA.

369
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,583
- ( thinking ) YOUR MOTHER MAY
BE GONE, BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

370
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,583
I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

371
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:11,583
AND I'LL ALWAYS KEEP YOU
IN MY HEART.

372
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,916
ALWAYS.  ALWAYS.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,208
- MAMA, NO!
MAMA, PLEASE DON'T GO.

374
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,250
MAMA!

375
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,958
- Forte: AFTER THAT DAY,
I NEVER SAW SAN CRY AGAIN.

376
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,166
IT WAS THE FIRST
AND THE LAST TIME.

377
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,708
TODAY IS JULY 17th,

378
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,083
THE ANNIVERSARY
OF YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH.

379
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,333
I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE, SAN.

380
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,916
I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING YOU
SOME FLOWERS.

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,750
I REMEMBER HOW SHE ENJOYED THEM.
I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

382
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,250
- THEY'RE PRETTY.
- THANKS.

383
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,375
I THOUGHT
THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE THEM.

384
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,416
AND I THINK THAT MAYBE YOUR
MOTHER WOULD'VE LIKED THEM TOO.

385
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,833
- THANK YOU.
- I HOPE YOU KNOW,

386
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:06,750
I'LL ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISE
TO YOU, SAN.

387
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:10,000
WELL THEN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO HOME

388
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,291
AND EAT
SOME OF MY HOMEMADE COOKIES?

389
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,000
SOUND GOOD?

390
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,583
( thinking ) SAN...

391
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:19,125
THE FEELINGS THAT I HAVE FOR YOU
WILL NEVER CHANGE.

392
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,333
AND I'LL ALWAYS
BE BY YOUR SIDE.

393
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:25,458
I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU,
FOREVER.

394
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,416
- HEY, FO!
I'M READY.

395
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,416
CAN WE HAVE SOME CAKE
AND CUSTARD

396
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,416
TO GO WITH THOSE COOKIES?
- I GUESS SO.

397
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,041
- PROMISE?

398
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,750
- YEAH, WE'LL PICK THEM UP
ON THE WAY HOME.

399
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,541
- NO,
I WANT YOU TO MAKE THEM.

400
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,666
- ( thinking ) SAN,
I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU.

401
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,208
AND I WILL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU IN MY HEART.

402
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,125
- PRETTY PRETTY PLEASE!

403
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,500
- MY NAME IS WILL,
AND I'M AN INSPECTOR

404
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,291
SENT BY
THE SORCERY TEST HEADQUARTERS.

405
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,166
- Ichii and Zero:
INSPECTOR?

406
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,041
- I HAVE COME
TO CONDUCT A MID-TERM EXAM.

407
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,250
- MID-TERM?

408
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,916
- IF YOU FAIL THIS TEST,
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE

409
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
TO CONTINUE ON
WITH THE FINAL EXAM.

410
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,500
- Nina: AH!

411
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,916
- YOU MUST TAKE HER BACK
FROM ME BY SUNSET.

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,958
THAT IS THE SOLE OBJECTIVE
OF THE MID-TERM.

413
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,166
- WAIT!

414
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,958
- Will: NEXT TIME, ON "SAVE
ME LOLLIPOP"...

415
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,541
DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO RESCUE HER?

416
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,833
- WILL, DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY?

417
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:46,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
