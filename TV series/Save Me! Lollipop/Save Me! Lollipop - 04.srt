1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,208
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,000
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,166
I ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED
SOMETHING CALLED

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,541
THE CRYSTAL PEARL WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,958
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,625
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,750
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,500
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,666
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,958
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,500
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

12
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,500
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,625
- HUH?

14
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,958
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,958
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

16
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,083
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

17
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,166
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,375
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

19
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,583
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

20
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,166
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,791
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,250
REALLY?

23
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,291
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

24
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,375
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

25
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,125
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,750
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

27
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,833
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

28
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,416
( Nina whining )
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY MOM.

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,083
SHE RAN OFF
FOR A WEEKEND RETREAT

30
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,916
AND THEN LEFT ME
TO DO ALL THE SHOPPING.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,375
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

32
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,208
EGGS, RICE, SOME MISO SOUP,
SOME SUGAR,

33
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,666
WASABI, SOME... SUGAR.

34
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,041
( grunting )

35
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,458
I CAN ALMOST REACH IT.

36
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,500
JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

37
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,708
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO
MAKE THESE SHELVES SO TALL?

38
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,625
I WISH I WERE TALLER.

39
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,333
- NEED THIS?

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,000
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

41
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,291
- WHAT ELSE?
- UM, WELL...

42
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,833
ZERO!  THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
BUY ALL THAT JUNK FOOD.

43
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,000
- DON'T BE SO STINGY.
- WHAT?

44
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,875
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
EAT IT ALL ANYWAY,

45
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,958
SO JUST STOP, UNLESS YOU'RE
GONNA BUY IT YOURSELF.

46
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,875
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

47
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,916
- Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,208
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

49
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,083
THAT OUR ONE-TIME-ONLY SALE
BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

50
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,833
HERE'S THE DEAL--

51
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,875

00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,916
AND IT'LL ONLY COST YOU $3.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,708
- AMAZING.

54
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,083
THIS STORE WAS ALL BUT EMPTY
UNTIL HE MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

55
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,125
- MUST BE MAGIC.
- SO YOU GUYS READY TO GO?

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,125
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BOUGHT ALL THAT, ZERO.

57
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,250
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN EAT THAT MUCH?

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,041
- OF COURSE.

59
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,333
- WELL, THANKS TO YOU,

60
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,208

63

PICK UP THE SPA PACKAGE.

64
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,083
- YOU DON'T PICK IT UP.

65
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,458

68
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,708
WE'LL BE LUCKY

69
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,208

00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,833

WHY'D I HAVE TO WIN
THIS SPA GETAWAY

75
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,916
ON THE WEEKEND WHEN BOTH
MY PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,583
MAYBE I COULD
JUST GO TO THE SPA ALONE.

77
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
- Zero: NINA.
- HUH?

78
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,500
- TA-DA!

79
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,625
- UM, YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

80
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,500

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
- WE'RE PACKED AND READY
TO GO TO THE HOT SPRINGS!

82
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,541
DOI!

00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,833
- IT'LL BE FUN, NINA.
PROMISE.

84
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,583
- WHAT?!

85
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,625
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THE
HOT SPRINGS WITH YOU GUYS?

86
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,833
- I WANNA GO TOO! I WANNA
GO TOO. I WANNA GO TOO.

87
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,083
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO?

88
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,625
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.

89
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,291
I DON'T WANNA BE LEFT HOME ALONE
ALL WEEKEND

90
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,791
WHILE YOU'RE OFF
HAVING FUN, ZURA.

91
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,291
I CAN SNEAK
INTO THE HOT SPRINGS WITH YOU.

92
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,833
NO ONE WILL EVEN KNOW I'M THERE,
I PROMISE.

93
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,333
- SO WE'RE ALL GOING
TO THE HOT SPRINGS?

94
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,375
WOW!
IT'S AWESOME.

95
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,583
- AMAZING.

96
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,458
JUST LOOK AT THIS PLACE,
YOU GUYS.

97
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,458
- I WONDER
WHAT KIND OF FOOD THEY'VE GOT.

98
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,958
- I JUST WANNA TAKE
A NICE, RELAXING BUBBLE BATH.

99
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,458
- ( thinking ) THIS HAS DISASTER
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

100
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,833
( sighs )

101
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,125
- OH, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

102
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,250
THAT GIRL IS DOING EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO STEAL MY ICHII AWAY.

103
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,958
I BET SHE HAS ALL SORTS OF STUFF
PLANNED FOR HIM TOO.

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,208
WELL, I WON'T STAND
IDLY BY AND WATCH

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,541
THAT TREACHEROUS LITTLE
VIXEN TAKE MY MAN FROM ME!

106
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,041
I HOPE SHE KNOWS
SHE BROUGHT THIS ON HERSELF.

107
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,208
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO
USE

108
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,083
MY SUPER SEXY
BOMB-DIDDLY-ICIOUS BODY

109
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,416
TO BRING MY SWEET LOVE BACK.
- PLEASE REFRAIN, ROKKA,

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
FROM ANY LEWD BEHAVIOR
WHILE WE'RE IN PUBLIC.

111
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,250
- IT'S TIME TO CHECK IN.

112
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,166
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.
- ( rustling )

113
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,041
- GUESS I'M HEARING THINGS.

114
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,333
- I DON'T GET IT!
WE MADE A POINT TO CHECK IN

115
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,541
WITH ICHII POSING AS MY OLDER
BROTHER AND ZERO AS MY COUSIN.

116
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,208
SO WHY DID THEY PUT US ALL
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER?

117
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,625
- WELL, ANYBODY WANT
TO CHECK OUT THE BATHS WITH ME?

118
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,666
- I DO!
- ( both humming )

119
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,291
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

120
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,291
WHY DON'T YOU GO
INTO THE BATHROOM TO CHANGE?

121
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,625
- MAYBE YOU
SHOULD STOP LOOKING

122
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,250
AND GET CHANGED YOURSELF,
NINA.

123
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,666
- YOU TWO GO ON AHEAD.

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,875
I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU LATER.
ENJOY.

125
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,416
- Both: HUH?

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
- I CANNOT BELIEVE

127
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,625
WHAT I JUST SAW.

128
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,125
- ( both laughing )

129
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,833
- WAIT.

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:13,208
I JUST NEED TO CALM DOWN
AND STOP GETTING SO EXCITED.

131
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,166
- Gou: I HAVE SOMETHING EVEN
MORE EXCITING IN STORE FOR YOU.

132
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,416
- AREN'T YOU--
- THAT'S RIGHT.

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,083
- UM...
- I'M ROKKA'S BUTLER, GOU.

134
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,875
AND I'M AFRAID
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE

135
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,166
COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT WITHOUT
ZERO AND ICHII BY YOUR SIDE.

136
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,583
SO I'LL SEIZE THIS GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY AND TAKE YOU AWAY.

137
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,041
AND THOSE TWO WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO FIND YOU AGAIN.

138
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,791
SUMMONING PHANTOM MAGIC.

139
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,833
AND NOW, GAME SQUARE.

140
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,166
- AH!

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,041
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?!

142
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,083
AHH! ARE THOSE
WHAT I THINK THEY ARE?

143
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,666
- THAT'S RIGHT, NINA.

144
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,791
I'VE TRANSPORTED YOU
INTO A PINBALL MACHINE

145
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,708
IN THE HOT SPRINGS ARCADE.

146
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,333
- HEY, GET ME OUT OF THIS THING
RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HEAR ME?!

147
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,250
- STOP COMPLAINING OR I'LL MAKE
THIS MUCH WORSE FOR YOU.

148
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,125
- OH, YEAH?
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY IT.

149
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,250
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET
ON WITH THE GAME THEN.

150
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,166
IT'S SURE TO BE A BLAST.

151
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,666
GOOD LUCK NOW, NINA.

152
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,083
- ( thinking ) WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

153
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,458
- DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
JUST YET.

154
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,291
- OH, NO!

155
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,666
AHH!

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,333
- LADY ROKKA IS PRETTY
UPSET WITH YOU.

157
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,333
PERHAPS
THIS WILL CALM HER NERVES.

158
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,416
- HELP ME!

159
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,458
- THAT'S IT!
I WON'T LET YOU DO THAT.

160
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,583
MAGICAL BREAK!

161
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,458
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I ALMOST HAD THE PEARL.

162
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,958
- NO WAY!  YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA GET THE PEARL.

163
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,083
NOT AS LONG
AS I'M PROTECTING NINA.

164
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,375
- NINA!  ZERO!

165
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,625
IT'S YOU.
- ESCAPE HOLE.

166
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,750
- HEY, STOP!
WAIT.

167
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,333
HE GOT AWAY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

168
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,666
- YEAH.
AND THANKS FOR ASKING, ICHII.

169
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,916
- IF GOU CAME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO ATTACK NINA,

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,250
THERE MAY BE OTHERS.
WE CAN'T LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

171
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,291
- I KNOW.
- ( women shouting )

172
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,291
- OH MY!
LOOK AT THE MESS YOU MADE.

173
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,416
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

174
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,583
I THOUGHT THE PINBALL MACHINE
COULD SUPPORT MY WEIGHT,

175
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,208
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG

176
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,666
'CAUSE IT BROKE
WHEN I STOOD ON IT.  MY BAD.

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,833
- SOMEONE STOP THEM.

178
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,458
- All: WE'LL BE GOING NOW.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,958
- ( owl hooting )

180
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,750
- HA-HA!
ZURA, ZURA, ZURA.

181
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,875
- ARGH! ZERO.

182
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,041
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO
AND BREAK THE MACHINE?

183
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,208
- I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
IN ORDER TO SAVE YOU,

184
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,375
SO STOP COMPLAINING.

185
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,125
- BUT STILL!
- THERE'S NO NEED

186
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,875
TO KEEP ARGUING ABOUT IT,
YOU TWO.

187
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,666
- LOOK, ZERO--

188
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,000
- I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT THE BREAK THE MACHINE, NINA.

189
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
SO JUST DROP IT.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,750
- Forte:
ARE YOU AN EXAMINEE TOO?

191
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,250
- WHO ARE YOU?

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,500
- FORTE.
EXAMINEE NUMBER 004.

193
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,500
- AND MY EXAMINEE NUMBER
IS 005.

194
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,583
I'M GOU.

195
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,041
- SORRY TO DAMPEN
YOUR SPIRITS, GOU,

196
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,000
BUT THAT CRYSTAL PEARL
BELONGS TO US.

197
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,250
AND HERE'S A WARNING FOR YOU.

198
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO
TAKE NINA'S PROTECTORS LIGHTLY.

199
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,375
ZERO AND ICHII
ARE BOTH FORMIDABLE OPPONENTS

200
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,791
WITH POWERFUL
MAGIC ATTACKS,

201
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,125
AND THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

202
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,541
AND IF YOU ATTACK THEM
WITH A HALF-PLANNED OFFENSIVE,

203
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,041
THEN YOU'LL SURELY BE DEFEATED.
- THEN IN THAT CASE,

204
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,041
I HAVE A WARNING FOR YOU
AS WELL.

205
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,666
THE SUMMER KIMONO
THAT YOU'RE WEARING?

206
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,416
- YEAH?
WHAT ABOUT MY SUMMER KIMONO?

207
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
- YOU KNOW IT'S FOR WOMEN.

208
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,625
- AH!

209
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,833
SAN, THAT LITTLE BRAT!
SHE TRICKED ME!

210
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,041
I KNEW THIS WAS FOR WOMEN!

211
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,916
- SOMEHOW, THAT KID
MANAGES TO PULL IT OFF.

212
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,750
- ZURA, ZURA, ZURA.

213
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,875
- OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU LATER,
NINA.

214
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,416
- OKAY, BUT...

215
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,958
WHAT IF SOMEONE
TRIES TO ATTACK ME

216
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,833
WHILE I'M ALONE IN THE BATH?

217
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,041
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

218
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,083
AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT
THAT LOLLIPOP,

219
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,166
NO ONE CAN LAY A HAND ON YOU.

220
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,208
- I GUESS I CAN RELAX NOW
KNOWING THAT THIS LOLLIPOP

221
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,458
WILL PROTECT ME
FROM ANY ATTACKERS.

222
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,750
- F.Y.I., THE HOTEL HAS APPROVED

223
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,416
THE USE OF TOWELS WHILE
IN THE BATHS.

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,458
- AHH!
THIS FEELS SO GREAT.

225
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,500
I DON'T EVER WANNA LEAVE.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,791
"THE LEGEND OF HARUYAMA LAKE?"

227
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,666
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,125
IF YOU LOOK INTO YOUR REFLECTION
IN THE WATER,

229
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:08,625
THE FACE OF YOUR DESTINED SOUL
MATE IS SUPPOSED TO APPEAR.

230
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,166
OH, WOW, SO ROMANTIC.

231
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,375
BUT I WONDER WHO MY SOUL MATE
IS DESTINED TO BE.

232
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,875
OH, NO!

233
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,666
WHAT IF ZERO AND ICHII
ARE BOTH MY SOUL MATES?

234
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,666
I'M TOO SCARED
TO CHECK MY REFLECTION.

235
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,125
WHAT HAPPENS IF BOTH OF THEM
ARE LOOKING AT ME IN THE WATER?

236
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,791
AHH!

237
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,583
- Both: HUH?
- ICHII, MY LOVE!

238
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,541
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

239
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,708
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE TOO.

240
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,625
- THE HOTEL ALSO APPROVES
THE USE OF SWIMSUITS

241
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,625
IN THE BATH, ZURA.

242
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,000
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ROKKA?

243
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,750
THIS IS THE MEN'S SECTION.

244
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,833
- HOW DARE YOU?

245
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,375
HOW DARE YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE
TO LADY ROKKA?

246
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,583
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

247
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,333
- BUT I JUST HEARD YOU YELLING
AT HER, YOU LITTLE HOOLIGAN.

248
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,958
LET'S GO, LADY ROKKA.
I DON'T WANT YOU HANGING AROUND

249
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,208
THESE VIOLENT PERVERTS
ANOTHER MOMENT LONGER.

250
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,583
LADY ROKKA.
LADY ROKKA?

251
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,125
- ( Rokka laughing )

252
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,750
HERE I COME!  AHH!

253
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,500
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

254
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,833
HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS
TO ROKKA'S FATHER?

255
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,791
LADY ROKKA,
WHERE ARE YOU?

256
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,625
LADY ROKKA?

257
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,166
- WHY AM I STILL THINKING
ABOUT THIS LEGEND NONSENSE?

258
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,083
I JUST HAVE TO PUSH IT
OUT OF MY MIND

259
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,000
AND TRY TO ENJOY THE WEEKEND.
BUT STILL,

260
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,416
WHAT-- WHAT IF THEY
ARE MY SOUL MATES?

261
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,250
THEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

262
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,791
- San: WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?

263
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,333
( laughing )

264
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,333
DON'T YOU WANT
TO PLAY WITH ME?

265
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,625
( speaking gibberish )

266
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,791
( San speaking gibberish )

267
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I CAME HERE FOR YOU

268
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,041
SO I CAN GET THE PEARL
AND FINISH THE FINAL EXAM.

269
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,916
- I KNEW IT.
- READY?

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,750
SUMMONING MAGIC!
DUCKY HUNT!

271
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,583
- ( quacking )

272
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,791
- LOOK, HE'S ADORABLE!

273
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,458
- BUT HE WON'T BE SO CUTE
WHEN HE GETS BIGGER.

274
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,000
- QUACK!

275
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,375
- AHH!

276
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,958
- NINA!

277
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,416
- HELP ME!  HELP ME.

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,208
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

279
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,750
I WON'T LET YOU HURT NINA.

280
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,416
GIVE IT UP, SAN!
YOU CAN NEVER BEAT ME.

281
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,166
HERE COMES MAGIC SPLASH!

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,041
- BUT WHERE DID MY DUCKY GO?

283
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,333
BYE, NINA.
WE'LL PLAY AGAIN LATER.

284
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,708
BYE!

285
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,416
- I'M GOING TO DROWN!
HELP ME.

286
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,916
- THE WATER'S NOT THAT DEEP.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,708
- BUT I HAVE A CRAMP
IN MY FOOT.

288
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,625
- HEY, NINA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

289
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,291
- I'M FINE, ZERO,
THANKS TO YOU RESCUING ME.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,750
YOU'RE REALLY BRAVE.

291
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,458
- ( both groaning )

292
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,958
- NO!

293
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,416
- I NEVER THOUGHT
THE DEFENSE MAGIC

294
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT HER
FROM ZERO.

295
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,041
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?
- NOTHING.

296
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,875
- DON'T LIE TO ME, ZERO.
- BUT I'M NOT.

297
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,083
- YOU MUST'VE SEEN SOMETHING.
- I DIDN'T, I SWEAR.

298
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,708
MAN, THAT HURT.

299
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,833
- YOU'RE SUCH A MORONIC
AND LECHEROUS PERVERT.

300
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,208
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH?
- I'M NOT LYING.

301
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,416
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

302
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,958
'CAUSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
FOR ME TO SEE.

303
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,958
- IDIOT!  IDIOT!

304
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,166
YOU ARE SUCH A JERK.
YOU HAVE NO SENSE OF DECENCY.

305
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,541
- HA!  IT'S SO CHILDISH OF NINA
TO MAKE SUCH A SCENE

306
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,541
JUST BECAUSE
SOMEONE SAW HER TOPLESS.

307
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,083
I GUESS THAT SHE'S EMBARRASSED
'CAUSE SHE HAS NO BOOBS.

308
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,083
- LADY ROKKA, JUST BE NICE
AND TRY TO BEHAVE YOURSELF.

309
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,333
- ( Ichii sighs )
SHE'S REALLY UPSET, HUH?

310
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.
WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

311
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,916
- I'M NOT LYING.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,291
'CAUSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
TO SEE.

313
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,333
- HE'S SUCH AN INSENSITIVE JERK.

314
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,458
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE HIM
FOR THIS.

315
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,250
- GUESS WE BLEW IT, DIDN'T WE?

316
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,708
- LET'S JUST
LEAVE THAT WENCH ALONE.

317
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,208
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- YOU'RE A WENCH!

318
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,375
WENCH, WENCH, WENCH.

319
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,625
- JUST WHO ARE YOU
CALLING A WENCH?

320
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,375
- Zero: ICHII, LET'S
LEAVE HER ALONE

321
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,583
AND GO PLAY SOME PING PONG.

322
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,958
COME ON.
- HUH?

323
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,125
GO AHEAD.
LEAVE ALREADY.

324
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,208
I DON'T CARE.

325
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,833
BUT--

326
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,166
ZERO?  ICHII?

327
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,375
- YEAH?
- ICHII?

328
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,541
BUT I--

329
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,083
I THOUGHT THAT THEY BOTH LEFT
TO PLAY PING PONG TOGETHER.

330
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:09,458
- ( laughing ) YOU KNOW WE CAN'T
LEAVE YOU ALL BY YOURSELF.

331
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,500
- BUT--

332
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,333
- LISTEN,

333
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,583
ZERO IS HOT-HEADED
AND CAN COME ACROSS AS A JERK

334
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,125
BECAUSE HE SAYS
WHAT'S ON HIS MIND

335
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,666
WITHOUT THINKING SOMETIMES.

336
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,583
BUT I KNOW THAT ALL HE REALLY
WANTS TO DO IS PROTECT YOU.

337
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,166
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

338
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,375
I THINK
HE'S JUST PROTECTING ME

339
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,625
BECAUSE
I SWALLOWED THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

340
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,833
- NO,
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON.

341
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,625
ZERO AND I
CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY.

342
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,250
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT ZERO'S THINKING.

343
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,416
YOU COULD BE WRONG.

344
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,875
- I KNOW I'M RIGHT,
'CAUSE I KNOW ZERO.

345
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,750
AND I KNOW THAT HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT PROTECTING YOU.

346
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,500
- BUT I-- 
I DON'T KNOW.

347
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,583
- JUST GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND FOLLOW THE SIGNS.

348
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,833
IT'S HARD TO MISS
THE PING-PONG ROOM.

349
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,416
- ARE YOU SURE?

350
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,041
- YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
ZERO IS WAITING FOR YOU.

351
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,625
- 'KAY.
- GO ON.

352
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,791
- THANK YOU, ICHII.

353
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,791
( thinking ) ZERO SAVED
ME TWICE TODAY

354
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,541
AND ALL I DID WAS COMPLAIN.

355
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,916
THAT TIME
AND EVEN THEN.

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,875
YOU'RE SUCH A MORONIC
AND LECHEROUS, PERVERT!

357
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,625
WHY CAN'T YOU
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

358
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,250
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

359
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,250
I'VE GOT TO LET ZERO KNOW
HOW I FEEL

360
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,666
AND THAT I WAS WRONG.

361
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,250
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
HE KNOWS THAT I'M TRULY SORRY.

362
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,416
I JUST HOPE HE CAN FORGIVE ME.

363
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,541
- WOW,
YOU REALLY SUCK AT PING PONG.

364
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,583
- SHUT UP.

365
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,666
I'M JUST NOT IN THE BEST
OF MOODS TODAY, THAT'S ALL.

366
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
SO LEAVE ME ALONE.

367
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,416
- OH, IT'S SO BORING
WITHOUT MY ICHII HERE.

368
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,333
OOOH!  ICHII!

369
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,791
- ZERO, HAVE YOU SEEN NINA?

370
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,458
HAVE THE TWO OF YOU
HAD A CHANCE

371
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,625
TO SETTLE YOUR DIFFERENCES YET?
- WHAT?  NINA?

372
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,375
WAS SHE COMING TO SEE ME?
- WHERE COULD SHE BE?

373
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,166
- NINA!
- SHE'S GONE.

374
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,458
- IT'S LAKE HARUYAMA.

375
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,166
BY LOOKING INTO THE WATER,

376
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,500
YOU'LL SEE THE REFLECTION
OF YOUR SOUL MATE.

377
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,083
HOLD ON.  ZERO?

378
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,291
ZERO, WHERE ARE YOU?

379
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,083
ZERO?

380
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,000
- LOOKS LIKE THOSE FAKE SIGNS
DID THE TRICK

381
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,333
AND LURED HER OUT HERE
JUST AS WE HOPED, SAN.

382
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,708
- AWESOME.

383
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,166
- NOW THEN, LET'S BEGIN.
( playing )

384
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,458
- NO!

385
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,916
- ZERO?

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,791
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
SNAP OUT OF IT NOW.

387
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,500
- Forte: UGH!
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

388
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,750
- IT'S FORTE.
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

389
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
- I THINK IT'S TIME I FINISH
BOTH OF YOU OFF

390
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,041
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

391
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,791
( playing )

392
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,833
- ( San laughing )
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN.

393
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,333
SUMMONING MAGIC!
WILD CATFISH.

394
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,666
- ZERO!

395
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,416
- IT SEEMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE
FINALLY MET YOUR MATCH, ZERO.

396
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,083
- LOOK OUT.

397
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,416
- HE'S PUTTING HIMSELF IN DANGER
TO PROTECT ME.

398
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,958
I CAN'T LET HIM RISK HIS LIFE
FOR ME AGAIN.

399
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,916
ZERO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROTECT ME.

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,458
- NO, NINA.

401
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,583
I TOLD YOU I'D PROTECT YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

402
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,541
I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU.
- BUT ZERO--

403
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,666
- NOW THE FINAL BLOW.
- BYE-BYE, NINA.

404
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,208
- BRACE YOURSELF.
- Ichii: ZERO!

405
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
CHARM CAPSULE!

406
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,916
- Both: ICHII.
- NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,666
AND DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK.

408
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,250
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME THAT.

409
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,500
I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF
YOU TWO IDIOTS ATTACKING NINA.

410
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,166
THIS ENDS RIGHT NOW.
- ( both gasp )

411
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,416
- NOW!

412
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,875
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!

413
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,250
AHHH!

414
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,541
MAGIC CANNON!

415
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,875
- ( both shouting )

416
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,500
- Forte:
I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

417
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,166
- SEE YOU LATER, NINA.
BYE-BYE!

418
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,875
- ARE YOU OKAY?

419
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,791
- IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

420
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,750
- ( thinking ) A SCRATCH?

421
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,291
BUT HE HURT HIMSELF BECAUSE
HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

422
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,708
IF I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE,
I'VE GOT TO DO IT NOW.

423
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,458
- Both: LISTEN.

424
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,375
I'VE BEEN, THINK--

425
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,208
AH, SORRY!

426
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,166
- EXCUSE ME?
- I'M SORRY.

427
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I THOUGHT I SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR MAKING YOU ANGRY.

428
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,250
- ( thinking ) HE WANTED
TO MAKE UP WITH ME TOO.

429
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,000
THANK YOU, ZERO.
- HUH?

430
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,958
- I SAID THANKS.

431
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,333
- OKAY THEN, THAT'S ENOUGH.
NO MORE FIGHTING FOR US.

432
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,708
WE SHOULD GET BACK.
LET'S GO, NINA.

433
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,125
COME ON!

434
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,916
- ( thinking )
HARUYAMA LAKE.

435
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,166
IF YOU LOOK INTO THE SURFACE
OF THE WATER,

436
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,166
YOU'LL SEE THE FACE
OF YOUR SOUL MATE

437
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,750
REFLECTED BACK TO YOU.

438
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,708
BUT WHO IS
MY DESTINED SOUL MATE?

439
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,375
ZERO?  ICHII?

440
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:04,166
IS IT POSSIBLE?
COULD IT REALLY BE BOTH OF THEM?

441
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,041
- COME ON,
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

442
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,208
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO CATCH A COLD NOW, DO YOU?

443
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,916
- ( thinking ) OH, WELL.

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,125
FOR NOW,
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

445
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,083
HEY, WAIT UP!

446
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,541
GUYS, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

447
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,166
- ( all laughing )

448
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,833
- ( thinking ) I'M JUST GLAD
THEY'RE BOTH HERE.

449
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,833
- Zura: OH, NO.

450
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:34,291
SOMEBODY HELP ME, ZURA.

451
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,916
I THINK I'VE BEEN SOAKING
TOO LONG, ZURA.

452
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,916
ZURA.
OH, ZURA.

453
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,916
( moaning )

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,416
ZERO?  ICHII?  NINA?

455
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,291
- Nina: SAN AND FORTE ARE
ALWAYS TOGETHER, AREN'T THEY?

456
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,791
- Zero: THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE
PARTNERS FOR THE SORCERY TEST.

457
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,583
- Ichii: ACTUALLY, THEY'VE BEEN
TOGETHER MUCH LONGER THAN THAT.

458
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:29,958
- Nina: HMM.  REALLY?
I WONDER WHAT THEIR STORY IS.

459
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:34,916
- Forte: I SWORE TO MYSELF ON
THAT DAY, IN THAT MOMENT...

460
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,416
NEXT TIME,
ON "SAVE ME LOLLIPOP"...

461
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,166
- San: HEY FO, LET'S PLAY!

462
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,041
- COME ON. I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.
