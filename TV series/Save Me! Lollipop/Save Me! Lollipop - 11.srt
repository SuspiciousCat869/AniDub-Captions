1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,208
- Nina: EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
THAT WONDERFUL DAY

2
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,375
WHEN I FIRST MET
ZERO AND ICHII...

3
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,583
- READY?
- YEAH.

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,166
LET'S GET THIS THING STARTED.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,291
- ...THEY TOLD ME
THAT THEY WOULD PROTECT ME,

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,791
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD
ALWAYS BE HERE FOR ME.

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,333
I THOUGHT
WE WOULD BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,541
- WHAT'RE YOU GUYS DOING?

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,750
- I NEVER REALIZED THAT THE TIME
WOULD ACTUALLY COME

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,291
WHEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE.

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,458
BUT NOW
THAT TIME IS GETTING CLOSER.

12
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,541
I WONDER WHAT ZERO AND ICHII
ARE PLANNING TO DO?

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,541
ONCE THE CRYSTAL PEARL IS
REMOVED FROM MY BODY

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,541
AND THE TEST ENDS,

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,166
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO THEN?

16
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,958
THE TEST IS ENDING SOON.

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,916
IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS.

18
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,583
WOW!
THIS ONE'S SO CUTE.

19
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,333
- LOOKS TASTY.

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,500
- IT HAS A LITTLE SANTA CLAUS
ON IT,

21
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,083
AND REINDEERS TOO!

22
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,541
- YEAH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO EAT SANTA CLAUS.

23
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,541
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU CAN'T EAT SANTA.

24
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,125
- WHAT?
BUT WHY CAN'T I, NINA?

25
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,583
- 'CAUSE HE'S A CANDLE, SILLY.
HE WOULDN'T TASTE VERY GOOD.

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,208
- IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS.
- THAT MEANS--

27
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,958
- IT'S COMING UP SOON, ZERO.
- YEAH.

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,250
TIME REALLY DOES FLY.

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS.

30
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,333
- YEAH IT IS.
SPEAKING OF,

31
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,500
DO YOU TWO KNOW WHAT--
- HMM?

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,625
OH!  NEVER MIND.
( laughs ) 

33
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,125
- DON'T RUN OFF.
TELL US, NINA.

34
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
- NO.

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
IF I TOLD YOU,
IT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE.

36
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,708
- WHATEVER!

37
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,291
- ( thinking ) IT WOULDN'T BE
FUN IF I JUST ASKED THEM

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,250
WHAT THEY WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS.
I HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF.

39
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,416
I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING REALLY
SPECIAL FOR ZERO AND ICHII.

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
- EH?

41
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,708
AH!

42
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,916
- AHHH!

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,625
OF COURSE I'LL HAVE TO GET
SOMETHING NICE FOR ZURA AS WELL.

44
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,416
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,208
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE MY FRIENDS.

46
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,250
I WISH--

47
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,875
I WISH THAT THIS HAPPINESS
COULD LAST FOREVER, 

48
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,625
BUT THE SORCERY TEST
IS ALMOST OVER.

49
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,583
IT'S CHRISTMASTIME.

50
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,708
JEEZ!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

51
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,833
WHAT SHOULD I GET THE GUYS?

52
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,208
CLOTHES?
JEWELRY?

53
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,166
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT KIND OF GIFTS THEY LIKE.

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,166
I GUESS HATS AREN'T REALLY
THAT TRENDY ANYMORE.

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,833
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO KNIT A SCARF FOR THEM.

56
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,458
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET ICHII
A FANCY WALLET OR SOMETHING.

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,916
AND ZERO, UM,
AN ORANGE VEST?

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,958
( moans )

59
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,916
WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,625
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

62
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,958
- NINA!
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,833
- 'CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS
QUICKLY APPROACHING, YOU KNOW?

64
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,208
- SO WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "SO WHAT"?

65
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,541
YOU KNOW WHAT CHRISTMAS EVE
IS ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

66
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
- NO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

67
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,625
- YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO, NINA.

68
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,625
- WELL,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET.

69
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,583
- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS
EVE, DECEMBER 24th, THE BIG DAY.

70
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,291
- BECAUSE THAT'S THE DAY

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,875
YOU SPEND WITH THE PERSON
THAT YOU LOVE THE MOST.

72
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,125
- AND IT ONLY COMES AROUND
ONCE A YEAR.

73
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,208
- SO WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO SPEND THE DAY WITH, NINA?

74
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,833
WITH ZERO
OR WITH ICHII?

75
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,458
WHICH ONE?
COME ON, TELL US!

76
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,125
WHICH ONE?
- AHHH!

77
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,041
- WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS EVE WITH? HUH?

78
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,625
- ( thinking ) "WHICH ONE"?

79
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,541
- NINA.
SO YOU'VE CHOSEN ME.

80
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,958
NINA.
NINA, MY LOVE!

81
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,458
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

82
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,000
I WON'T LET YOU HAVE NINA!

83
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,208
- OH YEAH?

84
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,583
I LOVE NINA MORE THAN ANYONE
IN THE WORLD.

85
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,250
AND I WON'T LET HER GO.
- HUH?

86
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
- FIGHT ME FOR HER.
- AS YOU WISH.

87
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,750
- ( both grunting )

88
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,166
- STOP IT!  STOP IT!

89
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,125
THIS IS MY FAULT.
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING.

90
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,791
I CAN'T CHOOSE.
I CAN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU.

91
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,916
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.  AHH!

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,291
PLEASE STOP IT ALREADY.
STOP!

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,750
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS.

94
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,666
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING.
- HUH?

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

96
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,833
- HUH? UH, UH...
( laughing )

97
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,458
OH NOTHING,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

98
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,333
 ( thinking ) THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN PICK JUST ONE.

99
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,375
I WANT TO SPEND CHRISTMAS EVE
WITH ALL OF 'EM .

100
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:46,708
- ( grunting )
- EVEN ZURA.

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,916
- THIS ISN'T THE WAY
TO THE CAKE SHOP.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,291
I WANT CAKE.
- UH, NINA?

103
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,708
- JUST WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

104
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,000
- JUST GIVE ME
SOME TIME TO THINK, OKAY?

105
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,666
- WHAT'S WITH HER?
SHE'S ACTING STRANGELY.

106
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,583
- NEVER TRY
TO UNDERSTAND A WOMAN, ZURA.

107
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,333
- COME ON.

108
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,625
- ( thinking ) THIS IS
OKAY, ISN'T IT?

109
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,500
I DON'T HAVE TO
PICK BETWEEN THEM.

110
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,875
I JUST WANT TO BE WITH EVERYONE
NOW-- ZERO, ICHII, AND ZURA.

111
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,291
- HEY, NINA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

112
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,708
- YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

113
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,541
- ( thinking ) I WANT TO
SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH EVERYBODY.

114
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,333
OH!  I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

115
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,291
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO GET THOSE TWO GUYS.

116
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE
SO DIFFICULT?

117
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,625
I MEAN, WHAT IN THE WORLD
DO YOU GET A SORCERER

118
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,375
FOR CHRISTMAS ANYWAY?

119
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,458
AH!  THAT'S PERFECT.
I'VE GOT IT.

120
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,708
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
( laughing ) 

121
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,916
AND YOUR SPECIAL PRESENT
IS ME, NINA!

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,333
NAH. I'D BETTER COME UP WITH
SOMETHING A LITTLE BETTER

123
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,791
TO GET THOSE GUYS.

124
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,833
WELL, I GUESS I COULD
JUST CASUALLY ASK THEM

125
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,250
WHAT THEY MIGHT LIKE.

126
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,333
THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT.
I WONDER IF THEY'RE STILL AWAKE.

127
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,458
I SURE HOPE SO.

128
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,916
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,375
- DO YOU MEAN
ABOUT CHRISTMAS?

130
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,708
- YEAH. I THINK WE SHOULD
GET HER A PARTING GIFT

131
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,208
BECAUSE WE'RE LEAVING.

132
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,125
- I SUPPOSE.

133
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,875
AFTER THE TEST IS OVER
ON CHRISTMAS, WE'LL LEAVE.

134
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,291
- RIGHT.
WE WON'T HAVE TO STAY

135
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,875
AND PROTECT NINA
AND THE PEARL ANY LONGER.

136
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,208
- AND THEN WE GET
TO GO BACK HOME.

137
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,916
AND NINA WILL BE
LEFT ALL ALONE.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,500
- YEAH.
OUR TIME HERE'S JUST ABOUT UP.

139
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,125
BUT BEFORE WE LEAVE,
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY

140
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,583
GET A REALLY SPECIAL PRESENT
FOR NINA.

141
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,208
SOMETHING...

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,708
- ( thinking ) WHAT?
A PARTING GIFT?

143
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:49,000
I GUESS
THEY'RE REALLY LEAVING.

144
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,833
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
WHEN I FIRST MET ZERO AND ICHII

145
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,458
AND THEY TOLD ME
THAT THEY WOULD PROTECT ME,

146
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,875
I NEVER REALIZED
THAT THE TIME WOULD COME

147
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,833
WHEN WE WOULD HAVE TO
SAY GOODBYE.

148
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,583
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

149
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,791
- I GUESS
THEY'LL HAVE TO GO BACK HOME

150
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,250
ONCE THE EXAM IS OVER.

151
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,000
AND WHETHER THEY PASS IT OR NOT,
I'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

152
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,625
AND THEY'LL GO BACK
TO THE MAGIC WORLD,

153
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,416
LEAVING NOTHING BUT THAT
LOLLIPOP TO REMEMBER THEM BY.

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,041
( sobbing )

155
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,125
I WISH
THERE WERE NO SORCERY TEST.

156
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,250
I WISH THERE WERE NO CHRISTMAS.

157
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,583
OUR TIME TOGETHER
IS ABOUT TO END.

158
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,541
THE TEST IS ALMOST OVER.

159
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,291
AND IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS.

160
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,916
- Female voice: NINA.

161
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,500
- ( bell tolling )

162
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,208
- JEEZ, THAT STUDENT COUNCIL
MEETING TOOK FOREVER.

163
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,333
I'M RUNNING SO LATE NOW.

164
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,708
UH, NOBODY'S HERE.

165
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,291
I GUESS ZERO AND ICHII
HAVE GONE HOME ALREADY.

166
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,500
THAT'S PRETTY RUDE OF THEM
TO LEAVE WITHOUT ME.

167
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,791
NO BIG DEAL. I CAN ALWAYS
WALK HOME BY MYSELF.

168
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,958
I'LL BE JUST FINE WITHOUT THOSE
TWO PROTECTING ME. HA!

169
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,416
 ( thinking )
BUT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

170
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,291
I HAVEN'T BEEN ALONE
IN A WHILE.

171
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,291
ZERO AND ICHII
HAVE BEEN WITH ME ALL THE TIME.

172
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,625
SO I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE
TO BE ALONE.

173
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,500
BUT I GUESS I'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO BE BY MYSELF

174
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,125
AFTER CHRISTMAS.

175
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,375
I MIGHT AS WELL
GET USED TO IT NOW.

176
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,958
I NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE
BEING BY MYSELF AGAIN.

177
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,958
- Ichii: NINA.

178
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,583
THERE YOU ARE.
HOW DID YOUR MEETING GO?

179
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,458
- WELL, IT SURE TOOK FOREVER.
I THOUGHT IT'D NEVER END.

180
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,750
- NOW CAN WE GO BACK
TO THE CAKE SHOP, NINA?

181
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,125
'CAUSE I'M GETTING
REALLY HUNGRY, YOU KNOW.

182
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,875
- ZERO, ICHII?
- ( all laugh )

183
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,916
YOU TWO WAITED FOR ME?

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,458
BUT-- BUT--

185
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,541
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT,

186
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,500
THAT THEY'RE NOT
ABOUT TO LEAVE ME?

187
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,291
( crying )
- HEY, NINA!

188
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,416
WAIT!

189
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,875
- I'M SORRY.

190
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,791
I CAN'T GO
TO THE CAKE SHOP TODAY.

191
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,958
BECAUSE I'M LATE
FOR AN APPOINTMENT

192
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,458
WITH HATSUKA AND YOUKA.

193
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,083
- Ichii: NINA, WAIT.
- NINA!

194
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,291
- LET'S GO.
WE STILL HAVE TO PROTECT HER.

195
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,875
- RIGHT.
- COME ON.

196
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,541
- Hatsuka:
HEY, NINA, OVER HERE.

197
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,666
- HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

198
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,666
- BUT WHERE'S ZERO AND ICHII?

199
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

200
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,958
- WHAT?
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU WITH THEM?

201
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,583
- I DON'T HAVE TO
BE WITH THEM ALL THE TIME.

202
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,458
- WHAT?
YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH THEM.

203
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,291
- I JUST WANT
TO HAVE A LITTLE CAKE.

204
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,250
- DID YOU GUYS HAVE A FIGHT?
- NOT REALLY.

205
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,625
- Both: UM, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON?

206
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,041
- LET'S SEE...
- Zero: I THOUGHT SHE SAID

207
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,083
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME
TO THE CAKE SHOP TODAY.

208
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,791
- IT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S EATING WITHOUT ME.

209
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,833
- YEAH, WE SHOULD GO JOIN HER.

210
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:13,541
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ICHII?
WHY CAN'T I GO AND JOIN NINA?

211
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
- JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.
- BUT WHY?

212
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,791
- 'CAUSE SHE MAY NOT
WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE, ZERO.

213
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,500
- WHAT?
NO WAY.  SHE'S FINE.

214
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,291
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
SHE'S PROBABLY SICK OF US.

215
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,791
- BUT, ICHII,
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

216
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,750
- LET GO. WE HAVE TO
PROTECT THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

217
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,000
WE HAVE TO.
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE HERE.

218
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
- BUT IT JUST SEEMS
LIKE A SELFISH REASON

219
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,083
FOR US TO DO THIS TO HER.

220
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,708
- ( all laughing )

221
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,750
- NINA IS JUST
AN ORDINARY HUMAN GIRL.

222
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,166
NEITHER THE CRYSTAL PEARL
NOR THE SORCERY TEST

223
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,291
ARE OF ANY CONCERN TO HER.

224
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,166
AND NOW NINA'S STUCK IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS MESS

225
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,583
BECAUSE OF US, ZERO.

226
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,750
SHE DIDN'T ASK
TO BE ANY PART OF THIS.

227
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,708
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

228
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,291
SO MAYBE WE HAVE TO GIVE HER
SOME ROOM OF HER OWN.

229
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,583
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

230
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,250
IS MAKE SURE SHE'S ALWAYS SAFE,
BUT THAT'S IT.

231
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,750
I GUESS ONCE THIS WHOLE THING
IS OVER,

232
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,750
NINA WILL FINALLY
GET HER NORMAL LIFE BACK.

233
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,500
- BYE, YOU GUYS!
LATER.

234
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,958
- BYE.

235
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,458
- GOOD LUCK WITH
ALL OF YOUR HOMEWORK, NINA.

236
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,125
- WHAT?
WE HAVE HOMEWORK TO DO?!

237
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,458
- Both: JUST KIDDING.
NO HOMEWORK FOR US.

238
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,625
SEE YOU, NINA.
BYE.

239
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,541
- YEAH, THAT WASN'T FUNNY
AT ALL, YOU GUYS.

240
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,750
THANKS, JERKS.

241
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,791
ZERO, ICHII.

242
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,166
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN
WAITING FOR ME THIS WHOLE TIME?

243
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,833
- OF COURSE.

244
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,416
- WE CAN'T LET YOU
GET ATTACKED AGAIN, NOW CAN WE?

245
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,791
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

246
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,333
- Ichii: NINA,

247
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,791
WE'RE SORRY FOR MAKING YOU RUN
AROUND WITH US ALL THE TIME.

248
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,625
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WEEK LEFT,

249
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,875
SO PLEASE JUST TRY TO BE PATIENT
WITH US TILL THEN, OKAY?

250
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,500
- WHEN THE TEST IS OVER,

251
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,583
WE'LL GO BACK HOME
TO THE MAGIC WORLD.

252
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,291
AND THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO
HANG OUT WITH US ANY LONGER.

253
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,958
- BUT BEFORE WE GO HOME,

254
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,000
ZERO AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE
YOU A TOKEN OF OUR APPRECIATION.

255
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,916
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,750
IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
THAT YOU'VE HAD YOUR EYE ON?

257
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,041
JUST SAY IT AND IT'S YOURS.
- I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

258
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,791
I JUST WANT
YOU BOTH TO LEAVE.

259
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,541
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK HOME
SOON ANYWAY, SO LEAVE.

260
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,666
AND I DON'T NEED PRESENTS
TO HELP ME REMEMBER YOU TWO.

261
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,916
JUST GO, ZERO.

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,291
AND ICHII, GO.

263
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,583
( sobbing )
- WAIT, NINA.

264
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,458
- POOR NINA.
I THINK WE REALLY UPSET HER.

265
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,291
THAT'S AWFUL.

266
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,458
- ( Nina sobbing )

267
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

268
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,291
ALL THEY EVER DID
WAS LIE TO ME.

269
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,583
ZERO AND ICHII
ARE SO HEARTLESS.

270
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,833
- I GOT THIS FOR YOU.
- FOR ME?

271
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,875
- YEP.
I GOT YOU THIS LOLLIPOP

272
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,416
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT FIT YOUR
IMAGE. IT'S CUTE, LIKE YOU ARE.

273
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,875
- OH, THANK YOU.

274
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,250
AFTER ALL
THAT THEY PROMISED ME...

275
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,416
I WISH THEY'D NEVER COME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

276
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,791
IF I HAD KNOWN
THEY WERE GONNA LEAVE.

277
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:12,291
I JUST HAVE TOO MANY MEMORIES
OF THEM BOTH.

278
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,708
ZERO, ICHII,
DON'T GO.

279
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,625
JUST STAY HERE.

280
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,916
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,791
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU.

282
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,625
ZERO, ICHII!

283
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,125
- Zura: NINA? IS IT REALLY
THAT PAINFUL FOR YOU?

284
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,041
IF IT REALLY HURTS

285
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,875
FOR YOU TO LOSE ZERO
AND ICHII LIKE THIS.

286
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,791
THEN MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU OUT.

287
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

288
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,958
- I HAVE THE MAGIC
TO ERASE YOUR MEMORIES.

289
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,291
- IF IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
FOR YOU TO COPE

290
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,916
AFTER ZERO AND ICHII
GO BACK HOME TO THE MAGIC WORLD,

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,791
AND IF YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO BE REALLY SAD

292
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,250
AND LONELY HERE WITHOUT THEM,

293
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,416
THEN I WOULDN'T MIND
HELPING YOU OUT

294
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,250
AND USING THE MAGIC
TO ERASE YOUR MEMORIES, ZURA.

295
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,375
- IF YOU DID THAT, WOULD I
REALLY FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING?

296
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,875
EVEN YOU, ZERO AND ICHII?

297
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,500
- THAT'S CORRECT.

298
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,166
YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT THE DAY
YOU FIRST MET US,

299
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,416
AND ALL THE TIMES
WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER SINCE THEN,

300
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
ALL THE CAKES WE'VE EATEN,

301
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,041
AND THE TIME WE WENT TO
THE HOT SPRINGS,

302
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,083
AND THE BEACH.
YOU'LL FORGET IT ALL--

303
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,541
EVERYTHING.

304
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,458
ALL THE GOOD TIMES
WE HAD TOGETHER

305
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,875
AS WELL AS THE BAD
WILL BE ERASED FOREVER.

306
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,125
ALL GONE.
- ERASED?

307
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,416
EVERYTHING?
- THAT'S RIGHT, ZURA.

308
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,041
AND IF IT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,

309
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,333
THEN I WOULDN'T MIND
DOING IT FOR YOU.

310
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,875
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.
- I SEE.

311
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,291
- YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
FOR YOURSELF.

312
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,666
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

313
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,125
YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

314
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,250
NINA?

315
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,458
- I WANT--

316
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,250
- San: HEY, CHECK IT OUT!
NINA!

317
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
ISN'T IT GREAT?

318
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,291
JUST LOOK AT THIS DRESS!

319
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,458
IT'S MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT
FOR FO.

320
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,958
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO HIM
ONCE THE TEST IS OVER.

321
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,750
I BET HE'S GONNA LOVE IT!
( laughing ) 

322
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,000
- UH, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT.

323
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,416
- IT'S A SECRET,

324
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,958
SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO FO THAT
WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE.

325
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,958
SEE YA!

326
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,958
- Zero: I REALLY DON'T THINK
FORTE'S GONNA LIKE HIS PRESENT.

327
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,125
- Forte: WHOA!  MOVE MOVE MOVE!
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

328
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,875
AHHHH!

329
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,458
I'M SERIOUSLY HAVING A HARD TIME
KEEPING IT TOGETHER, YOU GUYS.

330
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,875
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME?
ANY-- OH!

331
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,291
( screaming )

332
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,500
THANKS.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, FORTE?

333
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,500
- I'M GONNA BAKE A SPECIAL
CHRISTMAS CAKE FOR SAN.

334
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,583
- All: A CAKE?
- YEAH.

335
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,958
SAN SAID THAT SHE WASN'T
GONNA EAT ANY MORE CAKE

336
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,541
UNLESS I BAKED IT FOR HER.
WELL THEN, I'D BETTER GO.

337
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,916
I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
READY WHEN SAN COMES BACK.

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,166
- GOOD LUCK, FORTE.

339
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,291
- Zero:
IS THAT ROKKA OVER THERE?

340
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,958
- All: HUH?
- I THINK SO.

341
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,916
BUT WHY IS SHE ALL ALONE?
- EXCUSE ME.

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,291
- ( all grunting )

343
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,083
- HEY, AREN'T YOU--
- I'M GOU.

344
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,416
( echoing )
I'M GOU, I'M GOU.

345
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,083
- WE GET IT, YOU'RE GOU.
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.

346
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,375
- FORGIVE ME FOR MY RUDENESS,
BUT YOU SEE, LADY ROKKA IS--

347
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,708
- SHE'S WHAT?
THIS IS SO CONFUSING.

348
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,166
- SHE'S DRAWING A PICTURE AS
A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR ICHII.

349
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
SHE TOLD ME THAT I
ABSOLUTELY HAD TO

350
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,208
KEEP IT A SECRET FROM
ICHII UNTIL THEN,

351
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,458
SO I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU COULD PRETEND

352
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,541
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

353
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,166
- OH!
THIS DRAWING IS MY MASTERPIECE.

354
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,416
- Nina: SHE'S REALLY EXCITED.

355
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,791
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SORCERY
TEST TO BE OVER

356
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,458
AND FOR CHRISTMASTIME
TO BE HERE ALREADY.

357
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,083
- EVEN ROKKA'S GETTING READY
TO GIVE A GIFT

358
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,208
TO THE PERSON SHE CARES ABOUT,

359
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,291
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO TELL
THAT PERSON HOW SHE FEELS,

360
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,041
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO EXPRESS
HER APPRECIATION TO THAT PERSON.

361
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,666
ZERO AND ICHII HAVE BROUGHT
SO MUCH INTO MY LIFE,

362
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,625
MORE THAN THEY'LL EVER KNOW.

363
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,791
THEY'VE BROUGHT
THEIR KINDNESS TO ME

364
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,416
AND ALL OF OUR SWEET MEMORIES.

365
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
- ARE YOU OKAY, NINA?
- THIS ENDS RIGHT NOW!

366
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,083
- I GOT YOU.

367
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
- Nina: WE SHARE A MUCH STRONGER
CONNECTION,

368
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,083
BECAUSE OUR HEARTS
ARE BOUND IN FRIENDSHIP.

369
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,083
- I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE DECIDED
TO STAY WITH THEM.

370
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,750
I'VE THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER.

371
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,958
AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR PAST,

372
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,000
I KNOW I CAN TRUST THEM BOTH

373
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,708
AND THAT THEY'LL PROTECT ME,
BECAUSE THEY GAVE THEIR WORD

374
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,708
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

375
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,708
SO I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

376
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,708
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY
WITH ZERO AND ICHII.

377
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,250
- NINA, YOU CAN TALK NOW.
- Nina: IT'S REALLY BACK.

378
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,125
- I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE SAFE,
NINA.

379
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,416
- THANK YOU.
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

380
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,583
I ALWAYS BELIEVED
AND NEVER DOUBTED

381
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,416
THAT YOU'D RESCUE ME
FOR ONE MINUTE-- NEVER.

382
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,708
ZERO!
- DON'T WORRY.

383
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,333
- 'CAUSE WE ALREADY KNEW
THAT YOU HAD FAITH IN US, NINA.

384
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,625
- ZERO, ICHII,
YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.

385
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,250
( thinking ) THEY'VE BEEN
GREAT TO ME, BUT STILL...

386
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,000
- Zura: NINA.

387
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:07,000
IF IT REALLY HURTS FOR YOU TO
LOSE ZERO AND ICHII LIKE THIS,

388
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,500
THEN MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU OUT.

389
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

390
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,250
- I HAVE THE MAGIC
TO ERASE YOUR MEMORIES.

391
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,416
IF IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
FOR YOU TO COPE

392
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,250
AFTER ZERO AND ICHII
GO BACK HOME TO THE MAGIC WORLD,

393
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,916
AND IF YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO BE REALLY SAD

394
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,625
AND LONELY HERE WITHOUT THEM,

395
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,625
THEN I WOULDN'T MIND
HELPING YOU OUT--

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,416
- IF YOU DID THAT, WOULD I
REALLY FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING?

397
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,291
EVEN YOU, ZERO AND ICHII?

398
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,166
- ALL THE GOOD TIMES WE HAD
TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE BAD

399
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,083
WILL BE ERASED FOREVER--
ALL GONE.

400
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,166
AND IF IT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,

401
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,208
THEN I WOULDN'T MIND
DOING IT FOR YOU,

402
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,208
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.
- I SEE.

403
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,708
- YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
FOR YOURSELF.

404
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,041
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

405
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,916
YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND.
NINA?

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,250
- I WANT YOU

407
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,041
TO ERASE ALL OF MY MEMORIES,

408
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,083
BECAUSE IT'S-- IT'S TOO PAINFUL
TO BE WITHOUT ZERO AND ICHII.

409
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,208
REMEMBERING THEM
WOULD JUST MAKE ME TOO SAD.

410
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,583
SO PLEASE, ZURA,
ERASE MY MEMORIES.

411
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,041
TAKE AWAY EVERY THOUGHT OF THE
FUN THINGS WE DID TOGETHER--

412
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,291
THE BEACH, THE HOT SPRING,
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE WE WENT.

413
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,041
I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
ANYTHING LEFT. ZURA!

414
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,666
- I UNDERSTAND.

415
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,666
NOW I GUESS I NEED YOU
TO GIVE ME THE LOLLIPOP.

416
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,208
- HUH?
- IN ORDER TO DO THIS,

417
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,125
I NEED AN ITEM OF YOURS
THAT IS FILLED WITH MEMORIES.

418
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,958
- YOU NEED IT NOW?
- I SUPPOSE NOT.

419
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,000
YOU CAN WAIT AND GIVE IT TO ME
WHEN WE GO BACK HOME.

420
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,500
I'LL CAST THE ERASING MAGIC
ON THE LOLLIPOP

421
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,583
WHEN WE GET
TO THE MAGIC WORLD.

422
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,125
ONCE WE'RE GONE,
YOU'LL FORGET EVERYTHING

423
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,666
ABOUT ZERO AND ICHII
AND ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER.

424
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,791
SO IF-- IF THIS
IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT, NINA,

425
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,125
BE SURE TO GIVE ME THE LOLLIPOP
BEFORE WE LEAVE.

426
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,125
- MY LOLLIPOP.

427
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,583
- Ichii:
YEAH?  WHAT ABOUT IT?

428
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,291
- I DECIDED I WANT TO KEEP IT!

429
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,166
I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE MY LOLLIPOP AWAY.

430
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,708
NO MATTER HOW LONELY OR PAINFUL
IT MAY BE,

431
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,291
I WANT TO REMEMBER
THE BOTH OF YOU FOREVER.

432
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,166
I NEVER WANT TO FORGET YOU TWO.

433
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,833
AND WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD
OR BAD MEMORIES,

434
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,041
THEY'RE STILL MEMORIES OF YOU,

435
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,958
AND I WANT TO TREASURE THEM
AS LONG AS I CAN.

436
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,250
I HOPE
THAT I NEVER FORGET YOU.

437
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,333
I WANT TO KEEP YOUR
MEMORY ALIVE.

438
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,291
- NINA.

439
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,416
- ZERO, ICHII!

440
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,083
I COULDN'T IMAGINE
BEING APART FROM YOU TWO.

441
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,541
BUT FORGETTING ABOUT YOU
IS EVEN WORSE.

442
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,166
PROMISE THAT
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET ME,

443
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,291
EVEN AFTER THE TEST IS OVER,
OKAY?

444
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,500
EVEN AFTER YOU GO BACK
TO THE MAGIC WORLD,

445
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,916
DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME.
- NINA.

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,625
- AND YOU-- YOU TWO
WILL BE MY PRINCES FOREVER.

447
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,916
- NINA.

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,083
- ( thinking ) ZERO, ICHII--

449
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,541
I NEVER WANT
TO BE APART FROM THEM.

450
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,208
BUT THE TEST IS ABOUT TO END

451
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,458
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

452
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:03,166
CHRISTMASTIME
IS GETTING CLOSER.

453
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,791
AND THAT MEANS THAT SOON
WE WON'T BE TOGETHER ANYMORE.

454
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,166
BUT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT WE
DON'T HAVE TO BE APART FOREVER.

455
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,166
AND THAT ONE DAY,
WHEN I LEAST EXPECT IT,

456
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,250
I'LL SEE THEM AGAIN.

457
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:21,500
ZERO, ICHII,
THANK YOU.

458
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,833
THANK YOU
FOR SO MANY MEMORIES.

459
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,958
- HUH?
- ( grunts )

460
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:35,291
- Zero: WHO ARE YOU?
- MY NAME IS RIRU.

461
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,833
I'M HERE TO HELP NINA.

462
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,583
Riru:
NOW TAKE THIS MEDICINE.

463
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,833
IF YOU DO, THE CRYSTAL PEARL
WILL LEAVE YOUR BODY.

464
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,958
- Zero: YOU DON'T HAVE TO, NINA.
WE'LL PROTECT YOU.

465
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,333
- Bird: STOP THAT NONSENSE.
IT'S DANGEROUS!

466
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,500
IT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING!

467
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,375
- BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

468
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,958
I DON'T WANT TO BE APART
FROM ZERO AND ICHII.

469
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,375
NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME! LOLLIPOP"...

470
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,375
- YOU'LL TAKE IT BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ANSWER YOU'VE CHOSEN.
