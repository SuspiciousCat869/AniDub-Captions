1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,375
- MY NAME'S NINA AND I'M A
PRETTY AVERAGE, ORDINARY GIRL.

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,708
AT LEAST I WAS,
UNTIL ONE DAY.

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,833
I ACCIDENTALLY
SWALLOWED SOMETHING

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:16,958
CALLED THE CRYSTAL PEARL

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,625
WHILE EATING
AT MY FAVORITE CAKE SHOP,

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,041
AND MY LIFE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE.

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,708
THIS PEARL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF AN OTHERWORLDLY SORCERY TEST.

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,833
IT'S DROPPED RANDOMLY
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,583
AND THE TEAM OF TWO EXAMINEES
WHO ARE ABLE

10
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,750
TO TRACK IT DOWN FIRST
WILL PASS THE EXAMINATION

11
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
AND BECOME
PROFESSIONAL SORCERERS.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,250
THEN GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!
- STOP CRYING.

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,500
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF, ZERO.

14
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,625
- HUH?

15
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,958
- NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DO THIS.

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,041
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
PROTECT HER ANY WAY WE CAN

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
UNTIL THE DAY THE TEST IS OVER.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,250
WE'LL KEEP DILIGENT WATCH OVER
HER UNTIL THE MEDICINE IS READY

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,458
AND WE CAN EXTRACT
THE CRYSTAL PEARL FROM HER BODY.

20
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,666
WE'LL HAVE TO PROTECT THIS GIRL
WITH OUR VERY LIVES.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,875
- SO YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA STAY HERE AND HELP ME?

23
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,333
REALLY?

24
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,375
JUST LIKE THE PRINCES
IN THE FAIRY TALE

25
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
WHO BRAVELY FACE THEIR ENEMIES

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,208
NO MATTER HOW FEROCIOUS
THEY MAY BE,

27
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,833
AND FIGHT TO THE BITTER END
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE,

28
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,916
THESE TWO
ARE HERE TO PROTECT ME.

29
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,166
- ( alarm sounding )

30
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,833
- ( yawning )

31
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,416
I REALLY SLEPT LIKE A ROCK.
THAT'S WEIRD.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,250
FOR SOME REASON, I FEEL LIKE I'M
FORGETTING SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

33
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,541
OH, WELL.

34
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,791
I BETTER HURRY UP
AND GET DRESSED.

35
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,708
( shouting )

36
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,833
NOOOOO!

37
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,041
- Zero: JEEZ,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

38
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
WHY CAN'T YOU GET USED
TO THE FACT

39
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,041
THAT WE'RE YOUR ROOMMATES NOW?
- IT IS A BIG DEAL!

40
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,041
I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO WAKING UP
IN THE MORNING

41
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,083
AND FINDING
TWO HALF-NAKED MEN IN MY CLOSET.

42
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,041
AND IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES,
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT, EITHER.

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,625
- I'M SORRY, NINA.

44
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,791
WE'LL TRY TO USE
MORE DISCRETION IN THE FUTURE.

45
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,083
- BUT SHE BARGED IN ON US
WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING.

46
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,583
- BUT IT'S MY ROOM, ZERO.

47
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,625
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

48
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,208
WHEN I WANT
TO OPEN MY OWN CLOSET.

49
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,833
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD JUST SLEEP
IN THE CAR. THAT WOULD SAVE US

50
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,166
FROM ANY MORE EMBARRASSING
SITUATIONS NOW, WOULDN'T IT?

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WE NEED TO
STAY AS CLOSE TO YOU AS POSSIBLE

52
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,333
SO WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

53
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
- Zura: NINA.
- THIS IS SO ANNOYING.

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,458
- REMEMBER,
DON'T WANDER OFF AGAIN

55
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,166
AND STICK CLOSE TO US
AT ALL TIMES.

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,125
I WON'T LET YOU
OUT OF MY SIGHT

57
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,250
'CAUSE I'M SICK
OF YOU CAUSING PROBLEMS.

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,416
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,416
BOYS CAN'T GO
TO MY P.E. CLASS.

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,083
- EITHER WE GO TO P.E. WITH YOU
OR YOU GET ATTACKED.

61
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,833
GOT IT?
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF--

62
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,916
- ( grunts )
- ZERO,

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,708
DON'T WALK AWAY WHILE WE'RE
TALKING. DO YOU HEAR ME?

64
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,125
- ( girl crying )

65
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,916
- ARE YOU OKAY?
CAN YOU WALK?

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,375
IF YOU CAN GET THE NURSE,

67
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,083
SHE'LL CLEAN UP
THE SCRAPE FOR YOU.

68
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,583
- BUT IT REALLY HURTS.
AHH!

69
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,333
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SHE FELL.

70
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,875
- AW, DID YOU SCRAPE UP
YOUR KNEE?

71
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,208
DOES IT STING?
- A LITTLE BIT.

72
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,416
- LET'S GO.

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
YOU FEEL BETTER?
- YES.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,041
- THIS SHOULD HELP
KEEP THE AREA CLEAN.

75
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,458
OKAY, ALL DONE.
- ( giggles )

76
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,750
- OH, YEAH.  HERE.

77
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,708
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

78
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,916
NOW MY KNEE
DOESN'T EVEN HURT ANYMORE.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,291
- ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?
- YEAH, I PROMISE.

80
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,750
- JUST BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR
SCRAPE DISINFECTED

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,583
WHEN YOU GET TO SCHOOL.

82
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,708
- THANK YOU!

83
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,875
- MY PLEASURE, LITTLE GIRL.
JUST TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

84
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,916
YOU DON'T WANNA FALL DOWN
AND SCRAPE UP YOUR KNEE AGAIN.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,125
- 'KAY!
- THAT WAS THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

86
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,208
YOU HAVE
A VERY SWEET DISPOSITION, NINA.

87
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,458
- OH, ICHII.

88
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,375
- I THINK YOU'RE A--

89
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,041
A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, NINA.

90
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,291
- THANK YOU.

91
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,333
- Zero: HEY, SNAP OUT OF IT,
YOU TWO! WHAT'S THE MATTER?

92
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,416
IF WE DON'T GET A MOVE ON,

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,916
THEN WE'RE ALL GONNA BE
LATE FOR SCHOOL!

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,625
STOP STARING AT EACH OTHER
AND GET OVER HERE IMMEDIATELY.

95
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,250
LET'S GO!
- I'M COMING, ZERO.  SORRY.

96
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,166
- ( chuckles )

97
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,208
- JEEZ.

98
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,250
- ( all squealing )

99
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,166
- ZERO!
- ICHII!

100
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,916
- THE RUMORS WERE TRUE.
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY HOT.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,041
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
ARE YOU BROTHERS?

102
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,708
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

103
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,291
- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
LET ME BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

104
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,000
- Nina: HEY, NOW.
- GET OUT OF HERE, NINA!

105
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,208
- WAIT A MINUTE!

106
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,250
- THOSE GUYS ARE
ALWAYS SURROUNDED

107
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,625
BY A GIANT GROUP OF GIRLS, HUH?

108
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,125
- HATSUKA, YOUKA.
- BUT I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

109
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,375
YOU THREE HAVE BEEN THE TALK
OF THE SCHOOL LATELY.

110
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,125
- Both: WE WANT TO KNOW,
ARE YOU THREE GOING OUT?

111
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,458
TELL US.  HUH?

112
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,875
- WELL, THAT'S--
- ( all screaming )

113
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:21,500
- Girl: WAIT, DON'T GO.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN!

114
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,375
- ( device beeping )
- HMM, IT'S CLOSE.

115
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,083
- Machine: IT'S IN THE VICINITY.
- THE CRYSTAL PEARL.

116
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,166
IT MUST BE HERE, LADY ROKKA.

117
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,541
- I DON'T CARE, GOU.
I JUST WANNA FIND ICHII.

118
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,375
I MISS HIM.

119
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,750
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

120
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,583
- WHY NOT?

121
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,000
- YOUR FATHER'S ALLOWED YOU

122
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,291
TO TRAVEL TO THE HUMAN WORLD
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE

123
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,375
OF COMPLETING
THE FINAL SORCERY EXAM.

124
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,791
AND NO MATTER WHAT PERSONAL
MATTERS YOU MAY BE DEALING WITH,

125
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,458
WE MUST FIND THAT PEARL FIRST.

126
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,333
- BUT YOU ARE MY PARTNER, RIGHT?
- NO.

127
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,708
I'M MERELY YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT,
LADY ROKKA.

128
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,625
- OOH!

129
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,166
- I'M GETTING A STRONG READING
FROM THE FINDER.

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,208
THE CRYSTAL PEARL
IS RIGHT OVER THERE.

131
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,625
IT'S MOST LIKELY
INSIDE THAT BUILDING.

132
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,625
- FINE, THEN LET'S GO.
I'VE ALREADY WASTED ENOUGH TIME

133
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,291
AND THIS
IS GETTING REALLY ANNOYING.

134
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,750
( squealing )

135
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,083
ICHII, MY LOVE.
ICHII, ICHII!

136
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:19,916
ICHII!  ICHII!
ICHII!  ICHII!

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,416
- IMAI.
- HERE.

138
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
- MY DARLING!

139
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,208
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE

140
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,333
AND NOW I'VE FOUND YOU!

141
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,666
HOW I MISSED YOU.
MY ICHII!

142
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,166
HOW 'BOUT A KISS?

143
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,375
- All:
ICHII, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

144
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,041
ICHII!  ICHII!

145
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,166
- PLEASE TELL ME
THAT THIS IS ALL A BAD DREAM.

146
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,333
- All: OH, HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY DO THIS TO US?

147
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,291
PLEASE, STOP IT.

148
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,125
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW, NINA.

149
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
- YEAH, RIGHT.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

150
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,541
- Ichii: ROKKA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

151
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, ARE YOU?

152
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,416
- NO,
GOU IS TRAVELING WITH ME.

153
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,625
TO FOLLOW YOU
INTO THE HUMAN WORLD,

154
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,666
WE BOTH BECAME EXAMINEES
FOR THE FINAL SORCERY EXAM.

155
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,500
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- LADY ROKKA.

156
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,083
- GOU?
- LONG TIME NO SEE, ICHII.

157
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,166
I APOLOGIZE,

158
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,958
BUT LADY ROKKA WAS EXTREMELY
EXCITED TO SEE YOU.

159
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
WE SHOULD BE GOING NOW, ROKKA.

160
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
ICHII SEEMS TO BE BUSY, AND IT'S
NOT NICE OF YOU TO BOTHER HIM.

161
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,875
- NO!
ICHII DOESN'T MIND.

162
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,791
I CAN STAY,
CAN'T I, MY LOVE?

163
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,583
- HEY, NINA.
WHO IS THAT GIRL ANYWAY?

164
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,375
- SHE'S NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND,
IS SHE?

165
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
- NO, NOT QUITE.
HE'S MY FIANCE.

166
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,833
- All:
DID YOU SAY HIS FIANCEE?

167
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,875
- THAT ISN'T TRUE.
- I HOPE NOT.

168
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,583
- WOW,
YOU SURE ARE A LADIES' MAN.

169
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,500
- BOTH OF YOU SHUT UP.

170
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,708
- HEY, ICHII MY LOVE, STOP
WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THEM.

171
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET BACK TO THE MAGIC WORLD

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,041
SO WE CAN GET MARRIED
AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

173
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,791
- ROKKA!  I'M SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS COMMOTION, NINA.

174
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,583
I'LL GET THEM OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

175
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,375
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
ICHII.

176
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,583
- AND JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU MAKING MOVES ON MY MAN?

177
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,791
IF SO, THEN YOU'RE
IN BIG TROUBLE, MISSY.

178
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,791
- HUH?

179
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,666
IT'S-- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
UH...

180
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,541
- LEAVE HER ALONE, ROKKA.
- HUH?

181
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,583
- SHE'S AN IMPORTANT PERSON
TO ME.

182
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,916
- WAIT A MINUTE.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,375
SHE'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ME?!

184
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,000
OH!  THAT'S IT!

185
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,291
YOU'D BETTER STAY
AWAY FROM HIM.

186
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,583
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE SEES
IN YOUR FLAT CHEST.

187
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,375
NO BOOBS!
NO BOOBS!

188
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,625
- YOU BETTER SHUT YOUR--
- STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

189
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,375
I DON'T WANT YOU SAYING ANY MORE
RUDE THINGS TO MY FRIEND.

190
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,875
- BUT ICHII, SHE WAS TRYING
TO STEAL YOU FROM ME.

191
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,875
YOU BELONG TO ME, ICHII,
ME ALONE,

192
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,416
AND I WON'T LET ANYONE
TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME, MY LOVE.

193
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,250
I JUST CAN'T STAND
TO BE WITHOUT YOU

194
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,916
FOR EVEN ONE MINUTE LONGER!

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,625
- WAIT, LADY ROKKA!

196
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,583
TAKE THIS.

197
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,541
AND IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
SEND ME THE BILL.

198
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:45,666
I'M SORRY FOR THE DISTURBANCE,
EVERYONE.

199
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,375
ROKKA, DON'T RUN OFF!
WAIT FOR ME.

200
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,375
- WHERE IN THE WORLD
DID THEY COME FROM?

201
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,291
- Ichii: THEY'RE NUMBERS 005
AND 006.

202
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,125
ROKKA IS A PERSISTENT ONE,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

203
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,458
AND GOU IS HER BUTLER.
HE CARRIES OUT HER EVERY WISH.

204
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,250
AND, WELL,

205
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,125
NOW I THINK THEY'VE GOT THEIR
SIGHTS SET ON YOU, NINA.

206
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
- OH, NO!
- BUT DON'T WORRY.

207
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,083
YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WE WON'T
LET ANY HARM COME TO YOU.

208
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,791
- NO MATTER
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST,

209
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,041
WE PROMISE WE'LL PROTECT YOU.
YOU'RE SAFE.

210
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,375
- OH, YEAH.  HEH.
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

211
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,333
- FOR ME?
- YEP.

212
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,166
I GOT YOU THIS LOLLIPOP BECAUSE
I THOUGHT IT FIT YOUR IMAGE.

213
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,375
IT'S CUTE, LIKE YOU ARE.
- YOU THINK I'M CUTE?

214
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,500
- OH, YES, NINA.

215
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,708
I THINK
YOU'RE VERY VERY CUTE.

216
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,958
- OH, THANK YOU.

217
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,708
BUT...

218
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,375
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

219
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,000
WHY DID YOU LET THAT MEAN GIRL
ROKKA KISS YOU?

220
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,791
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUSH HER AWAY,
ICHII?

221
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
I REALLY THOUGHT ROKKA
WAS LYING

222
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,375
WHEN SHE SAID
THEY WERE ENGAGED,

223
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,625
BUT NOW
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT IT.

224
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,750
OH, WHY?!
WHY DOES IT BOTHER ME ANYWAY?

225
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,291
I WISH I HAD NEVER
SEEN ICHII KISS THAT GIRL.

226
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

227
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,000
- GUESS WHAT?
I'M IN LOVE TOO,

228
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,791
SO DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
A CORNER ON THE MARKET.

229
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,791
- LADY ROKKA,
HAVEN'T YOU HAD ENOUGH YET?

230
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,625
AND BESIDES,
YOU DIDN'T TAKE A NAP TODAY.

231
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,166
I SUGGEST YOU GO TO BED SOON
SO YOU'LL BE WELL RESTED.

232
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,375
- SHUT UP, GOU.
I'M TOO ANGRY TO SLEEP.

233
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,041
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GIRL!

234
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,833
I WISH I COULD GET HER
OUT OF THE PICTURE FOR GOOD

235
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,708
SO ICHII WILL COME BACK
TO MY LOVING ARMS.

236
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,208
- I SHOULD MENTION
THE FINDER HAS BEEN GIVING ME

237
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,250
A STRONG SIGNAL
IN ICHII'S VICINITY.

238
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,875
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS THEY'VE
ALREADY ACQUIRED THE PEARL?

239
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,458
- I KNOW.

240
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,125
I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA, GOU.
SHE'LL SEE.

241
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
SHE'LL LEARN NOT TO MESS
WITH MY MAN.

242
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,250
NO MORE
LITTLE MISS NO BOOBS!

243
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,583
( laughing )

244
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,166
- NO! YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO
THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM WITH ME.

245
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,083
- BUT WE CAN'T
LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

246
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,083
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,

247
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,833
BUT YOU CAN'T BE
IN THE SAME ROOM.

248
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,750
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN I'M CHANGING CLOTHES?

249
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,625
- WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
LET'S GO, ZERO.

250
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,541
- WHAT?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YES.

251
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,833
SEE YA LATER, NINA.
BE CAREFUL.

252
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,625
- HEY, WAIT, ICHII, I DON'T
THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

253
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:19,166
- WOW,
ICHII IS SO MATURE AND SWEET.

254
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
- NINA,
YOU BETTER GET CHANGED FAST.

255
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,416
- YEAH, HURRY.

256
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,833
- OH, OKAY.
- WE'LL SEE YOU IN A SEC.

257
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,208
- THANKS!  COMING.  AH!

258
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,291
IT'S STILL BOTHERING ME.

259
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,208
- YOU SHOULDN'T
LET IT BOTHER YOU SO MUCH

260
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,375
THAT YOU HAVE SMALL BOOBS.

261
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,791
- AHHH!
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

262
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:46,208
- WE CAN'T ALL HAVE AMAZING,
VOLUPTUOUS BODIES LIKE MINE.

263
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,541
WHAT DO YOU THINK, NINA?
I'M PRETTY HOT, RIGHT?

264
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,750
- YEAH, DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE, ROKKA?!

265
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,791
- I'M HERE
TO CAST A SPELL ON YOU.

266
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,500
- A WHAT?
- THAT'S RIGHT!

267
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,666
IT'S A TRANSFORMING SPELL!
WHOAAA!

268
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,041
- HEY!

269
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,958
AHHH!

270
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,750
AHHHH!

271
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,375
( cooing )

272
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,583
- ( baby squeals )
- WHAT?  WHY AM I A LITTLE BABY?

273
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,958
- ( chuckles )
NOT BAD, HUH?

274
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,958
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE CHANGE.

275
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,625
SO GOOD LUCK TRYING
TO STEAL ICHII AWAY NOW.

276
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,125
I TOLD YOU YOU DIDN'T WANNA
MESS WITH ME, DIDN'T I?

277
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,541
AND NOW LOOK
AT WHAT YOU MADE ME DO.

278
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,000
THAT'S RIGHT, I WON'T LET YOU
TEAR OUR LOVE APART.

279
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,208
ICHII IS MINE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

280
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,541
SO JUST BACK OFF
AND LEAVE MY MAN ALONE.

281
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,250
OH, I'M COMING, MY LOVE.
NOW WE CAN BE TOGETHER

282
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,583
AND NOBODY
WILL STAND IN OUR WAY.

283
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,000
- NO, THIS IS BAD.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

284
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
- All: YAY!

285
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,083
YOU CAN DO IT, ICHII!
- HERE!

286
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,291
- OKAY.
- ( girls squeal )

287
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,166
- WAY TO GO, ZERO!
YOU'RE AMAZING.

288
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,125
- EXCUSE ME.
WE CAN'T FIND NINA.

289
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,541
- WE BOTH WENT BACK TO THE
LOCKER ROOM TO LOOK FOR HER.

290
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,458
AND WE FOUND THIS.
- ICHII!

291
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,875
- LET'S GO, ZERO!

292
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,291
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU TWO.

293
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,000
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

294
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,625
YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION
TO LEAVE MY CLASS.

295
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,541
- WE THINK
THAT OUR FRIEND'S IN TROUBLE.

296
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,333
- WE HAVE TO FIND HER
BEFORE SHE GETS HURT.

297
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,166
YOU DON'T WANT THAT
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE.

298
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,791
- THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON
TO LEAVE, ISN'T IT?

299
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,416
CAN WE GO?

300
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,416
- ( girls squeal )

301
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,625
- THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE.
- COME ON!

302
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,500
- BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- ( groans )

303
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,541
- ( crying )

304
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,666
- SO HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

305
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,000
- SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ME!

306
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,791
- EXCUSE ME,
HAVE YOU SEEN NINA ANYWHERE?

307
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,958
- UH, NO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

308
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,375
- COME ON. HATSUKA, YOUKA,
PLEASE RECOGNIZE ME.

309
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,041
HURRY.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME FIND ICHII.

310
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,250
- WOW, SHE'S SO CUTE.

311
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,083
- YEAH,
IS THIS YOUR LITTLE BABY?

312
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,166
- SHE'S NOT MINE!

313
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,875
I JUST FOUND HER
OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

314
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,875
- SO HAVE YOU FOUND HER YET?
- Both: NO, SIR.

315
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,666
- AND I'M GETTING
REALLY WORRIED.

316
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,750
- ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD SPLIT UP
AND SEARCH AGAIN.

317
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,500
LET'S GO.
- I HOPE WE CAN FIND HER.

318
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
- I'LL GO WITH YOU, COACH.

319
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,250
- IF I HAVE THAT LOLLIPOP,
ICHII'LL NOTICE ME.

320
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,791
IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE.

321
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,875
- Zero: NINA!
- Zura: WHERE ARE YOU?

322
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,625
- HEY, ICHII, MY LOVE!

323
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,291
- OH, NO, IT'S ROKKA.

324
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,541
- I FOUND YOU, ICHII,
AND I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO.

325
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,125
SO DO YOU LIKE MY DRESS?

326
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,708
SEXY, ISN'T IT?
WHAT DO YA THINK?

327
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,708
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.

328
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,708
- AH!

329
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,916
LOOK, ICHII,
I PACKED A LUNCH FOR YOU.

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,708
I WOKE UP EARLY THIS MORNING
JUST TO MAKE IT.

331
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,916
BON APPETIT, MY LOVE.

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
- DON'T GO NEAR IT.
- THAT LOOKS SICK.

333
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,458
- NOW DIG IN, ICHII,

334
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,416
AND LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING AT ALL.

335
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,166
( screaming )
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

336
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,000
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

337
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,541
I JUST FORGOT TO BRING
A SUPER DELICIOUS DESSERT

338
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,500
THAT I MADE FOR YOU.

339
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,000
SO SIT DOWN,
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

340
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,875
I'LL RUN BACK TO THE KITCHEN.
BE RIGHT BACK!

341
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,833
JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE THESE
CHINESE-STYLE ALMOND JELLIES.

342
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,666
TA-DA!
- EW!

343
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,125
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
SO DISGUSTING

344
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,916
AND I'M A SEAHORSE.
- OH, ICHII MY SWEET LOVE,

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,958
WHEN WE GO BACK TO THE MAGIC
WORLD AND GET MARRIED,

346
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,500
YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD
TO ME MAKING YOU

347
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,375
THESE DELICIOUS LUNCHES
EVERY DAY.

348
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,000
AND NOT TO MENTION
THE EXCELLENT DINNERS I'LL-- 

349
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,000
AHHH!

350
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,916
OUR WEDDING WILL BE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WEDDING OF ALL TIME.

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,083
AHHH!

352
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,958
AND OUR HONEYMOON
WILL BE SO EXQUISITE.

353
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,250
WE'LL TRAVEL-- AHH!

354
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,625
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE QUIET,
YOU LITTLE BRAT?

355
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,250
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING IN THERE,
ROKKA?

356
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,375
- AHH!  THAT VOICE IS...

357
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,000
THE VOICE OF MY DARLING.

358
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,916
- UH, ROKKA,
IS THAT A BABY BEHIND YOU?

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,875
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- AW, COME ON, ICHII!

360
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,208
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE IT'S ME?
LOLLIPOP!  HELLO!

361
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,875
- I FOUND THIS ADORABLE
LITTLE GIRL WANDERING AROUND.

362
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,041
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HER
TO THE TEACHERS

363
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,125
AND HELP FIND HER PARENTS

364
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
BEFORE YOU WALKED IN AND
INTERRUPTED ME.

365
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,750
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
LADY ROKKA.

366
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,000
THE FINDER SAYS THE CRYSTAL
PEARL IS INSIDE THAT BABY.

367
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,375
- CRYSTAL PEARL FOUND!
CRYSTAL PEARL FOUND!

368
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,625
- WHAT?  THEN THAT MEANS--
- THAT BABY'S NINA.

369
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,041
- THAT IS CORRECT.

370
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,291
- NOW IT ALL
MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

371
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,041
YOU MUST'VE SWALLOWED THE
CRYSTAL PEARL ON ACCIDENT

372
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:24,958
OR SOMETHING.

373
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,583
AND THAT MUST BE
WHY ICHII SAID

374
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,791
YOU WERE AN IMPORTANT PERSON
TO HIM EARLIER.

375
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,250
THE ONLY REASON
HE'S PROTECTING YOU

376
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,000
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PEARL.
WITHOUT THAT, YOU'RE USELESS.

377
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,750
- AHH!
- SO ICHII, MY LOVE,

378
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,750
IF I TAKE HER
TO THE MAGIC WORLD,

379
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,333
WILL YOU COME BACK
AND LIVE WITH ME FOREVER?

380
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,375
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
NOW!

381
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,958
- AS YOU WISH, LADY ROKKA.

382
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,625
PHANTOM MAGIC.

383
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,458
A CHILD'S ROOM.

384
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,958
- WHAT IS THIS?

385
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,708
THIS ISN'T GOOD.
- Gou: IT'S UP TO YOU, ICHII.

386
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,041
IF YOU CAN PICK THE REAL NINA

387
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,833
OUT OF THIS MULTITUDE
OF IMPOSTORS,

388
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,125
THEN YOU WIN AND WE'LL WITHDRAW
QUIETLY FOR TODAY.

389
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,458
BUT IF YOU CAN'T FIND HER,

390
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,916
THEN WE'LL TAKE THE
CRYSTAL PEARL AWAY

391
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

392
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,125
SO IF YOU REALLY
DO CARE FOR NINA,

393
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,291
AND NOT JUST FOR THE PEARL, THEN
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM

394
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,375
PICKING HER OUT OF A CROWD,
RIGHT?

395
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,708
HAPPY HUNTING, ICHII AND ZERO.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU BOTH.

396
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,625
- WHICH ONE OF THEM
IS THE REAL NINA?

397
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,625
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
WE'LL NEVER FIND HER.

398
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:41,041
- OH, NO.  I CAN'T TELL
WHICH ONE IS NINA.

399
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,583
ZURA!

400
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,750
ZURA!  ZURA!

401
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,333
NO!

402
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,375
( grunting )
- ZURA!

403
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,916
- ( bear laughing )
- GET AWAY!  ZURA!

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,916
GET AWAY FROM ME.
PLEASE DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,791
NO!

406
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,875
- ( baby squeals )
- NINA!

407
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,833
- ZERO, ATTACK THE TEDDY BEAR.
AND I'LL PROTECT THOSE TWO.

408
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,666
- OH, WELL,
RIGHT, ICHII.

409
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,958
IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE

410
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,125
TO TAKE CARE
OF THAT OVERGROWN BEAR.

411
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,208
DESTRUCTION MAGIC!
- DEFENSE MAGIC!

412
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,000
- AHHH!

413
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,125
MAGIC CANNON!

414
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,833
- ( bear shouting )

415
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,958
- Nina: ICHII.

416
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,583
- NINA, WE'VE GOT YOU NOW.

417
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,958
YOU'RE SAFE.

418
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,625
- OH, ICHII!

419
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,666
- ( baby squealing )

420
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,375
- I GOTCHA.
- HOW'D YOU KNOW?

421
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,958
- ( crying )
- DON'T WORRY.

422
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,208
I'LL ALWAYS
BE HERE TO PROTECT YOU.

423
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,083
- ICHII, YOU SAVED ME!

424
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,750
- KEEP YOUR PROMISE.
WE FOUND THE REAL NINA.

425
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,500
LET US GO.
- THAT WAS THE DEAL.

426
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,208
YOU WON THE GAME, SO WE WON'T
TAKE THE GIRL AWAY FROM YOU.

427
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,375
I JUST HOPE YOU SAVE SOME
LUCK FOR THE NEXT TIME.

428
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,708
- NO WAY! I'LL NEVER LET AN
ANNOYING LITTLE GIRL LIKE THAT

429
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,500
STEAL MY ICHII AWAY FROM ME.

430
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,166
- WE LOST TO THEM
FAIR AND SQUARE.

431
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,083
LET'S GO, LADY ROKKA.
- I CAN'T.

432
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,125
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE ICHII
BY HIMSELF WITH THAT GIRL.

433
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,208
I CAN'T LOSE HIM,
AND I JUST WON'T STAND FOR IT.

434
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,333
TRANSFORM MAGIC!
MAGICAL FORGE!

435
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,750
- ( screaming )

436
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,333
- ICHII?

437
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,791
- I CAST A DEFENSE MAGIC SPELL
ON NINA'S LOLLIPOP.

438
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,625
IT'S SET UP SO IT'LL ACTIVATE
WHENEVER SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

439
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,750
SORRY. GUESS I SHOULDA TOLD YOU
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING.

440
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,458
- YOU DID THAT FOR ME?

441
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,125
- WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT
A LITTLE GIRL LIKE HER, ICHII?

442
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,541
I'M A MUCH MUCH
MUCH BETTER WOMAN THAN SHE IS

443
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,958
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN SHE EVER WILL.

444
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,416
WHY WON'T YOU COME BACK HOME
AND MARRY ME?

445
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,833
- BECAUSE
I CAN'T LEAVE NINA NOW.

446
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,375
I'VE SWORN TO PROTECT HER.

447
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,791
- I SEE.
SO THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE.

448
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,000
I HOPE YOU KNOW

449
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,291
THAT YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART!

450
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,291
( crying )
- SHE'S REALLY A LITTLE GIRL?!

451
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,833
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

452
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,791
LADY ROKKA HERE
IS REALLY ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD.

453
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,666
- OF COURSE.

454
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,833
THAT'S WHY ICHII WASN'T FAZED
WHEN SHE KISSED HIM.

455
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,458
AND WHY HE DIDN'T GET ANGRY
WHEN HE TURNED ROKKA AWAY.

456
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,166
- I THOUGHT
I COULD GET ICHII BACK

457
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,833
IF I TURNED YOU
INTO A LITTLE GIRL.

458
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,625
I THOUGHT WITH YOU
OUT OF THE PICTURE,

459
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,125
HE WOULD COME HOME WITH ME.
( crying )

460
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,375
- SORRY, ROKKA.

461
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,875
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE MAGIC WORLD RIGHT NOW.

462
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,708
I HAVE TO STAY HERE
AND PROTECT NINA

463
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,958
AND MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE.
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

464
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,041
- NO NO NO.
I WANNA BE WITH YOU, ICHII.

465
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,500
I WANNA BE WITH YOU FOREVER
AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER!

466
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,250
- NOW NOW,
WE REALLY SHOULD GET BACK.

467
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,208
IF YOU LIKE, I'LL MAKE YOU A BIG
BOWL OF YOUR FAVORITE STEW.

468
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,833
- ROKKA.

469
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,416
- NO, I DON'T WANNA
GO WITHOUT YOU.

470
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,375
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU,
ICHII.

471
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,458
I KNOW THAT WE'RE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND EVER

472
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,625
AND I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU!
- GOODBYE, EVERYONE.

473
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,875
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO!

474
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,833
GOODBYE, ICHII!
- TILL WE MEET AGAIN.

475
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,291
- FINALLY.
- SWEET GIRLFRIEND, ICHII.

476
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:52,333
- HEY.
- ( all laughing )

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,791
- HEY, ICHII,
MIND IF I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

478
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,541
- NO.  WHAT IS IT?

479
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,291
- HOW EXACTLY DID YOU KNOW
WHICH BABY WAS THE REAL ME?

480
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,333
HATSUKA AND YOUKA
COULDN'T TELL,

481
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,208
AND THEY'VE KNOWN ME LONGER
THAN YOU HAVE.

482
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,625
- IT WAS EASY.

483
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,708
THERE WERE A LOT OF BABIES
THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU.

484
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,458
BUT YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO TRIED TO SAVE ZURA.

485
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:22,125
YOU'RE REALLY SWEET, NINA.

486
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,791
- HUH?
- YOU'RE A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.

487
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?
LET'S GET GOING.

488
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,291
I'M HUNGRY
AND TIRED OF WAITING ON YOU.

489
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,208
- OH, ZERO.

490
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,041
- NO, HE'S RIGHT. READY TO GO?

491
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,041
- ( both laughing )

492
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,000
- Zero: HURRY UP.
I'M STARVING.

493
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,958
- YOU'RE ALWAYS SO SWEET, NINA,
TO EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING.

494
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,750
- San: DID YOU KNOW THAT NINA
AND THE OTHERS

495
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,458
ARE PLANNING A TRIP
TO THE HOT SPRINGS?

496
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,375
- Forte: REALLY?
THAT'S OUR CHANCE.

497
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,250
- Rokka: DID YOU HEAR THAT?
LET'S GO TOO.

498
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,416
- Gou: SO WE CAN ATTEMPT
TO OBTAIN THE CRYSTAL PEARL

499
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,708
WHILE THEY AREN'T LOOKING?
- NO, I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU,

500
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,625
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PEARL.

501
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,708
I'VE GOTTA STOP THAT LITTLE
MONSTER FROM GETTING MY MAN.

502
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,500
- LADY ROKKA,
PLEASE CALM DOWN.

503
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,541
- ICHII, MY LOVE,
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

504
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,291
- Nina: NEXT TIME
ON "SAVE ME LOLLIPOP"...

505
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,583
HUH?  WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
